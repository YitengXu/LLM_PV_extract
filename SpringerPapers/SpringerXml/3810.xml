Domestic and global trends in the development of the mineral-resource base of high-tech industry and energy are shown. Having applied spatial statistics of geoinformational analysis, the maps of the locations of the main deposits and promising ore occurrences of high-tech metals (HTMs) in Russia were compiled. The degree of criticality of strategic and high-tech mineral raw materials for Russia was assessed. It is noted that the share of Russian HTM production in the world structure of their output is extremely small, despite the available reserves. Many domestic complex HTM-bearing deposits are not developed. Most HTMs necessary for the Russian industry are imported. The analysis has shown that Russia can increase the production of two HTM groups critical for green technologies—“battery” metals (Ni, Co, Li, Pt, Pd, Ro, and REE) and components for “photovoltaics” (Cd, Se, Te, Ge, Ga, and In). In recent years, the mineral-resource base of HTMs in Russia has been showing positive growth, and the development of a number of deposits is planned.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords: </title><kwd>Russia</kwd><kwd>high-tech industry</kwd><kwd>metals: critical and battery</kwd><kwd>photovoltaics</kwd><kwd>mineral-resource base</kwd><kwd>analysis</kwd><kwd>deposits</kwd><kwd>prospects</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Pleiades Publishing</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>10</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/11477_2023_Article_9184.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>16</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Earth Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Mineral Resources</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Earth and Environmental Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="CrossLinking"><sec><p>An erratum to this article is available online at <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1134/S1075701523340019" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1134/S1075701523340019</ext-link>.</p></sec></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Russia has a world-class mineral-resource complex (MRC), which is the basis of the country’s economy, and is one of the top exporters of mineral raw materials and their primary products. Economic development, national security, and living standards in the Russian Federation depend to a large extent on a vigorous mining industry and a reliable mineral-resource base (MRB). However, the problem of supplying high-tech industry in Russia with critical mineral raw materials is becoming more acute every year due to the continuing reduction of rich and relatively technically and economically accessible deposits and the instability of its import from producer countries due to political turbulence in the world.</p><p>According to the forecasts of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the World Bank, the transition to green technologies will require a considerable increase in the production of nonrenewable mineral resources (including oil, gas, and solid minerals), especially high-tech metals and minerals. Russia has significant resources of strategic and high-tech metals (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), including those necessary for green technologies. This allows one to create new enterprises or significantly increase production volumes at operating enterprises (Bortnikov et al., 2016). The realization of this associated critical metals in ores and concentrates of known deposits is hampered by problems in the technology of extraction and weak production profitability.</p><fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1. </label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Location scheme of large strategic- and high-tech metal deposits in Russia.

Experts from the Japanese Institute of Metals and Materials believe that the demand for HTMs will increase by a factor of 5 by 2050 and will exceed our current reserves for many of them. This coming crisis increases the likelihood that mineral-rich countries, including Russia, will use their own MRBs to gain strategic and economic advantages. This crisis is stimulating a search for new sources of HTMs, more efficient use of them, and the development of our knowledge in geology, metallurgy, and materials science, as well as the creation of effective recycling systems.</p><p>Since 2014, Russia has been implementing the State Program “Development of Industry and Its Competitiveness until 2030,” Subprogram 15: “Development of the Rare and Rare-Earth Metal (RMs and REM) Industries; Russian Market Conditions of REM Products and Prospects for Their Export” (<italic>Gosudarstvennaya</italic> …, 2014). Subprogram 15 focuses on the development of the REM industry. Most recent publications are also devoted to the MRB of REMs in Russia (Arkhipova et al., 2014; Kremenetskii and Kalish, 2014). At the same time, the MRB of the associated HTMs has not been properly studied and evaluated (Bortnikov et al., 2016).</p><p>This article was prepared by a research team at the Institute of Geology of Ore Deposits, Petrography, Mineralogy, and Geochemistry of the Russian Academy of Sciences within the framework of Project of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation no. 13.1902.21.0018 “Fundamental Problems of Development of the Mineral-Resource Base of High-Tech Industry and Energy in Russia.” The purpose of this project is to conduct fundamental and applied research on the problem of providing the high-tech industry of the Russian Federation with strategic metals; to understand the features of formation of large-scale deposits of strategic and high-tech metals in the Earth’s crust at different scales, from global to local; and to assess the mineral resource potential of high-tech metals of major ore-forming systems; to study the reference deposits of strategic and high-tech metals on the basis of modern methods and scientific concepts, which explain the geological and genetic regularities of their formation and emplacement; to study the origin of mineable concentrations of high-tech metals of fundamental importance, especially for geological practice in various aspects of its implementation (prediction, prospecting, evaluation, and development of deposits). The development of the RM and REM mining and processing industry in Russia is a very important task, which cannot be solved without innovative modernization of the economy.</p><p>When preparing this paper, we used data from the scientific literature and the Internet, as well as materials of federal executive authorities, specialized research institutes, and industry experts and organizations, as well as data and reports of experts of information-analysis agencies and data on the implementation of government-sponsored programs and strategies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>MAIN TRENDS OF DEVELOPMENT
OF THE MINERAL-RESOURCE SECTOR
AND MRB IN RUSSIA AND WORLD</title><p>The mineral-resource sector (MRS) helps to determine the basis for the survival of the human species, living standards, and future human development. The world’s population growth and advances in technology have led to a runaway growth in the consumption of mineral resources. Since the beginning of the 20th century, annual production has been growing exponentially. As a result, over the last 60 years, more minerals have been produced and used worldwide than in the entire history of mankind. Every 20–25 years, such production increases by a factor of 2.</p><p>According to UN data, the total percentage of developed countries with a population of about 16% of the global population (the “golden billion”) in global mineral consumption ranges from 50 to 80–90%. At the same time, we should note the rapid increase, in contrast to the previous period of the 20th century, in the consumption of mineral resources (MRs) and primary products made of them in some developing countries of the Asia–Pacific Region (APR), led by China and India. As for developing countries, the accelerated increase in consumption of their own mineral resources is especially clearly evident in China, which resulted in the very intense industrialization of Chinese economy.</p><p>The UN predicts an increase in population to 9.1 billion people by 2050. This will inevitably result in further growth in the consumption of mineral resources alongside the continuing energy and metal consumption of industrial production. A higher or lower rate of population growth will lead to an increase or decrease in global demand for metals, mostly in developing countries.</p><p>Foreign experts have increasingly begun to focus on the problem of the imminent depletion of mineral resources. The concept of “peak metal production” has been introduced. It is believed that the production of a number of metals in the near future (for 40–50 years) will reach a maximum. Then, it will start to decline. The forecasting and assessment of production from copper-ore deposits can be given as an example, according to which the peak of production is expected in the 2050s. Thereafter, it will start to decline sharply.</p><p>Thus, the main trend in the world so far is a continuing increase in the production, consumption, and amount of proven reserves of almost all the most important minerals in the developing countries, which characterizes, above all, the high level of industrialization of the economy, scientific and technological progress, and development of high-quality production.</p><p>In recent years, the World Bank and the OECD (an association of 36 countries) have been concerned about some problems: the greenhouse effect, warming of the climate, and depletion of oil reserves and its consequences (Coulomb et al., 2015; <italic>The Growing</italic> …, 2017). According to their forecasts, the only nonalternative variant is a transition to “green technology”. According to the same forecasts, however, this transition will require a significant increase in the extraction of nonrenewable mineral resources (including oil, gas, and solid minerals) and especially critical metals and minerals. Therefore, the world’s existing reserves of as yet unclaimed mineral resources will be involved in development in the near future. In addition, one can assume that a boom of geological prospecting work in poorly explored areas is coming that will be aimed at discovering new deposits.</p><p>At present, green technology is expected to bring innovation to everyday life on the same scale as computer technologies over the past two decades. It is impossible to predict at an early stage the consequences of the development of green technology. Perhaps the most acute problem lies in the development of alternative fuels and new ways of generating energy. By 2060, the “green transition” is expected to lead to the increase in global metals demand faster than any other raw material: from 8 to 20 gigatons/year. Growth in demand for HTMs is expected to be especially fast (Coulomb et al., 2015; <italic>The Growing</italic> …, 2017).</p><p>Another trend in the use of mineral resources has been the monopolization of production of metals and their market: platinum-group metals are produced in South Africa (60%), Russia (30%), and Zimbabwe (15%); over 70% of beryllium, cobalt, and niobium is produced in the United States, Congo, and Brazil respectively. Based on the statistical data provided by the U.S. Geological Survey, China accounts for more than 20% of the world production of ores containing more than 40 types of minerals. This country produces 85% of rare-earth metals, 82% of tungsten, 76% of antimony, 73% of germanium, 68% of mercury, 66% of graphite, 59% of fluorite, and 56% of bismuth.</p><p>One distinctive trend in modern times is the widespread use of rare and trace metals, so-called “associated metals”, which are used in medicine and electronics and as catalysts (<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Each industry has its own list of key elements (<italic>Managing</italic> …, 208): Ro, Pd, Pt, V, Nd, and La for the automotive industry; Ge, Ga, In, and Eu for fiber optics and electronics; and Nb, Mo, W, Ta, Ti, Sc, and Re for special steels and superhard alloys. Manufacturing of high-precision optics is hardly possible without La and Ce. In the solar power industry, In, Ga, and Se are indispensable. No jet plane would take to the skies without Ti, Sc and Re. This list is getting longer every year.</p><table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1.  </label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Scope of application of HTM</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left"><p>Fields</p></th><th valign="top" align="left"><p>Technology/product</p></th><th valign="top" align="left"><p>High-tech metals</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="4"><p>Transport</p></td><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Powerful magnets</p></td><td valign="top" align="left"><p>REE (Nd, Dy, Pr)</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Batteries</p></td><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Li, Cd, Co, REE (La, Ce, Nd, Pr),</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Superalloys</p></td><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Re, Be, Co, Hf, Nb, Zr, Ta</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Catalysts</p></td><td valign="top" align="left"><p>PGE (Pt, Pd, Ro), Au</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="4"><p>Energy production</p></td><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Wind turbines</p></td><td valign="top" align="left"><p>REE (Nd, Dy, Pr)</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Solar energy</p></td><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Ge, Cd, In, Ga, Te, Se</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Nuclear reactors</p></td><td valign="top" align="left"><p>U, Th, Zr</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Fuel cells</p></td><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Y, Zr, Sc</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="4"><p>Means of communication</p></td><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Smartphones</p></td><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Ga, In, Be, Ta</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Computers</p></td><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Ga, In, REE (Eu, Dy, Hd, Lu)</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Optoelectronics</p></td><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Ga, Ge, In, Ree, Se, Te</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Electronics</p></td><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Co, Ga, Ge, Au, In, MPG, REE, Ag, Ta, Te</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="3"><p>Defense/Security</p></td><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Aerospace industry</p></td><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Be, Re, Nb, Sc, REE</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Water desalination</p></td><td valign="top" align="left"><p>PGE (Pt, Pd, Ro)</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left"><p>LEDs</p></td><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Ga, In, Ge</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="5"><p>Industry</p></td><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Metallurgy</p></td><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Bi, Li, Se, Ro, Rt, Ag, Te</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Glass, ceramics, pigments</p></td><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Bi, Co, In, Pd, Pt,</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Solders</p></td><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Bi, In, Rt</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Lubricants</p></td><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Ga, Li</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Medicine</p></td><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Bi, Co, In, Ga, Ag, Li, Se, Au, Ge, MPG, Te</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Many chemical elements (<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which are produced as by-products from complex ores and are extracted at the later stages of the metallurgical process, are associated HTMs. In many cases, the distribution pattern and the forms of occurrence of these metals in complex ores, as well as their extraction, are poorly studied or not studied at all. As a result, they are characterized by very uncertain estimates of the resource base both in Russia and abroad. Their main sources are Cu, Pb–Zn, and Mo sulfide ores, as well as some types of tungsten, tin, and uranium deposits, bauxites, weathering crusts and alluvial deposits. Associated HTMs in complex ores are often called “companion elements” (companion metals).</p><p>At present, HTMs play rather insignificant role in total value of globally produced mineral raw materials. However, according to the growth rates of production and consumption, these metals, in the role of components of the most advanced technologies, leave behind many common types of raw materials in countries with a developed market economy.</p><p>There are three directions of innovative development, which is one of the main global trends in the development of MRBs: first, it allows one to discover and develop new deposits with confidence; second, it efficiently develops outbalance, previously noncommercial deposits; and, third, it increases the potential of the deposits under development by redetermining their reserves. The key element of the “innovative” model lies in the creation and application of modern progressive technologies of mining and processing of ores that ensure the efficient exploitation of currently noncommercial deposits, extraction of the main and major associated mineral components, a closed technological cycle, minimization of environmental damage and waste recycling. The introduction of “breakthrough” technologies will increase the processing depth of domestic minerals.</p><p>Another global trend in the development of MRS and MRB is an increase in the HTM extraction from technogenic mineral raw materials. Some such wastes are located in different dumps, which have recently been considered full-scale technogenic deposits, and, of course, the volumes of such waste are accumulated at a significant rate from year to year. In the Russian Federation, great volumes of mining and processing wastes were accumulated in the form of mineral raw materials. According to expert estimates, there are more than 100 billion t (Zakharov, 2015). Processing of technogenic deposits allows obtaining additional mineral raw materials, including HTMs, and reducing the negative impact on the environment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS
FOR THE DEVELOPMENT
OF THR MRB OF HTMs IN RUSSIA</title><p>In recent years, the policy priorities of Russia have been import substitution and, regarding HTMs, the creation of fully integrated manufacturing enterprises based on the domestic MRB. A state program for the development of the HTM industry has been approved and financed (<italic>Programma</italic> …, 2014). However, this program will not be able to fundamentally change the situation with HTMs. It focuses on exploration research projects, although the main problem of the country is the extremely low consumption of HTMs (<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The program does not consider the expansion of existing consumption areas and the creation of new ones.

At the same time, the domestic HTM industry is characterized by heterogeneous development, especially in relation to individual metals (<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The country has unresolved problems that hinder the development of the extraction and production of HTMs, as well as the growth of their consumption.</p><p>The existing dependence of the Russian economy and industry on import of HTMs (<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) is a serious threat to national security.</p><p>The most important critical minerals for the Russian economy can be ranked as follows: Re, Be, Nb, Ta, HREE<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref>, Y, Sc, LREE<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref>, Ge, Ga, In, Bi, Cd, Hf, Sr, Co, Tl, Te, and Se (Bortnikov et al., 2016). It should be noted that, among REEs, there are significant differences in criticality, with HREE being at the highest level, while LREE, Sc, and Y are less critical. Experts believe that most of the critical metals listed above may experience very large growth in demand by 2050. An assessment of the degree of criticality of strategic and high-tech types of mineral raw materials for Russia (Bortnikov et al., 2016) suggests that a growing demand for minerals, which provide the basis of high-tech manufacture, may strengthen international competition for mineral resources in the 21st century. This especially concerns HTMs, to which there are no alternatives and which are characterized by highly concentrated mining. At the same time, new technologies for recycling, mineral processing, materials science, and efficient substitution and domestic production can mitigate dependence on imports and competition for resources in the long term. Economical and geopolitical regulation of the development of the MRB of high-tech metals can potentially increase global supplies, although such projects will face long-time development.</p><p>Thus, it is a priority of state policy to ensure domestic demand for HTM products. This is related to the need to integrate the country into the global market: acquisition of new positions in the global economy through an innovative model of development of the export of high-tech products with high added value.</p><p>The sustainable provision of the demands of the economy of the Russian Federation with mineral raw materials, including HTMs, is determined by the “Strategy for the Development of the Mineral-Resources Base of the Russian Federation until 2035” (government decree no. 2914-r of the 22nd of December, 2018) (<italic>Strategiya</italic> …, 2018). According to the Strategy, scandium, niobium, tantalum, and germanium are included in the group of <italic>nondeficient</italic> minerals, the reserves of which will meet necessary needs until 2035 and beyond under any scenarios of economic development. Zirconium, beryllium, lithium, rhenium, and rare earths of the yttrium group are included in the group of <italic>deficit</italic> minerals, domestic consumption of which is largely provided by forced import and/or reserve stocks. Deposits of these metals are mainly low-grade. However, some deposits of this group are similar in quality to the developed deposits in foreign countries, which make the development and application of incentive mechanisms to stimulate their development especially relevant. To continue mining of lithium at the Zavitkinskoe deposit and beryllium at the Ermakovskoe deposit, it is necessary to introduce high-performance technology of processing and treatment of mineral resources (Bortnikov et al., 2016).</p><p>The Strategy emphasizes that the Russian MRB of practically every HTM is quite significant, which allows the country to occupy leading positions in the world: the first, Tn; the second, Nb, REM, and Ge; and the third, Li, Zr, and Be. For a number of HTMs, the state of the MRB of the Russian Federation, as well as worldwide, has not been determined (<italic>Strategiya</italic> …, 2018).</p><p>Currently, Russia mines niobium, tantalum, zirconium (in the form of baddeleyite concentrate), germanium, cadmium, indium, scandium, tellurium, selenium, cobalt, and REMs (in small amounts); there is absolutely no extraction of lithium and beryllium. There are no reliable statistics for other elements. However, the share of the domestic HTM production in the global structure of their output is insignificant (<italic>Mineral</italic> …, 2022). Only germanium and scandium are above 10% of world production. Apart from these elements, the production of Ta, Se, Te, Cd, and Ga is noticeable against the global background. It should also be noted that the majority of products made is exported (<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) due to low domestic consumption.</p><p>Independent marketable products are produced only from two HTM deposits: Lovozero (Nb, Tn, and REM) in Murmansk oblast and Pavlovskoe (Ge) in Primorsky krai. As associated components, HTMs are included in and extracted partially from 24 complex deposits. In general, the efficiency of use of extracted mineral resources of HTMs registered in the State Reserve Register is extremely low.</p><p>It is possible to minimize the dependence on imports of HTMs (<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) by the development of low-quality ore deposits or those located in remote areas with an undeveloped infrastructure, as well as by the use of significantly updated forecasting and prospecting models providing identification of unconventional HTM deposits of high-quality and rich ores. The participation of domestic companies in the implementation of projects of the development of deposits abroad is believed to be important to make up for the shortage of HTMs.</p><p>In accordance with global trends, the priority of the state is to create a powerful MRB including HTMs on the basis of large-tonnage deposits (<italic>Strategiya</italic> …, 2018), which will resolve the issues of supplying the domestic industry with mineral raw materials in the long term.

For this reason, most of the HTMs required for the Russian industry (Be, Nb, Ta, Li, Zr, Re, and REM) are imported. The situation with niobium, tantalum, and REMs is paradoxical. The Solikamsk Magnesium Plant produces them as by-products (niobium oxide, tantalum oxide, REM carbonates), which are mostly exported. At the same time, other products made of these metals—ferroniobium, metallic tantalum, and REM-separated products—are imported.</p><p>The world consumption of the overwhelming number of HTMs is projected to increase by from two to six times by 2035. The demand in Russia for HTMs should also increase sharply by 2035, by from 1.5 to 20 times, depending on the type (<italic>Programma</italic> …, 2014). Large-scale areas of application of HTMs are shown in <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>A growing demand for the most important minerals grows opens up significant economic opportunities for Russia. The Russian Federation has explored large HTM reserves, which are considered critically important abroad. Consequently, Russia can benefit from the growing global demand.</p><p>There are two main groups of HTMs that are in demand in the world for green technologies (<italic>Inclusive</italic> …, 2012), so-called “battery” metals (Ni, Co, Li, Pt, Pd, Ro, and REE) and components for “photovoltaics” (Cd, Se, Te, Ge, Ga, and In). Electric cars will not run without battery metals, and solar power plant panels will not work without photovoltaics (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). These groups are both associated chemical elements that are produced as by-products at the later stages of the metallurgical process. In many cases, the distribution pattern and occurrence of these metals in complex ores and their extraction are poorly studied or not studied at all. As a result, the assessment of the resource base of these metals both in Russia and abroad is very uncertain.</p><fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3. </label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Scope of application of components for (a) photovoltaics and (b) “battery” metals.

They include Li, Ni, Co, graphite, and REMs. In 2021, there were 2 million electric vehicles in operation worldwide. By 2040, their number is expected to reach at least 40 million. By 2025, electric cars will be as expensive as cars equipped with internal combustion engines. For this reason, Co, one of the main battery metals, has risen in price by more than 190% in the last year and a half. It is most difficult to provide supply of Co, because 65% of its production is in the Democratic Republic of Congo, one of the poorest and most politically unstable countries in the world.</p><p>In Russia, the mining and production of battery metals is concentrated in the Arctic zone (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1, 2</xref>): the Norilsk ore district (north of Krasnoyarsk krai) and Murmansk oblast (Bortnikov et al., 2015; Volkov and Sidorov, 2020). So, 6% of the Со and 12–14% of the Ni in the world are controlled by Nornickel. The same area also contains one-seventh of the world’s nickel-ore reserves.</p><p>The most acute situation in the automobile industry is with platinoids, Pd, Ro, and Pt. Every modern car is equipped with a catalytic converter containing these platinoids, which occur together in nature. The global production of Ro, the cost of which, $9000/ troy ounce, is enormous, is about 50 t per year and has practically reached a peak in Norilsk and the Polar Region, as well as in the Merensky Reef of the Bushveld Complex (South Africa). Substitutes for Pd, Ro, and Pt cannot be found (<italic>Global</italic> …, 2019). However, it is assumed that the growth of electric vehicles will lead to a decrease in the number of cars equipped with catalytic converters.</p><p>In addition, the green automotive industry needs the same REMs as common cars. Recently, REM products have been provided mainly by a single giant source, the Bayan-Obo deposit in China (Petrov, 2014). There are alternatives to Chinese supplies of REMs: the very rich Mountain Pass deposit in the Mojave Desert mountains (United States), the Dubbo and Arafura deposits in Australia, and, of course, deposits in the Arctic zone of Russia (the Khibiny group, Kovdor, Lovozero, Tomtor, and others). However, it will take at least a decade to increase REM production from these deposits. Russia’s REM reserves are 20% of the world’s (<italic>Gosudarstvennyi</italic> …, 2020).</p><p>All Russia’s REEs are extracted from loparite ores of the Lovozero deposit. Of the obtained loparite concentrate with REEs, 28–30% is transported to the Solikamsk metallurgical enterprise (SME) for processing, where it is used to produce carbonates and oxides of mixed REEs. Over 70% of REEs are used by JSC Ruselectronics and Shvabe Holding (companies within the Russian state-owned Rostec group), 20–25% by the ROSATOM Production System, 5% by the metallurgical sector (as additives to alloyed steel products), and the rest by the petrochemical and other industries (<italic>Gosudarstvennyi</italic> …, 2020).</p><p>Almost all balance reserves of REMs in Russia are associated with deposits in the Arctic zone (Bortnikov et al., 2015; Volkov et al., 2019; <italic>Gosudarstvennyi</italic> …, 2020). The main percentage, more than 40%, is contained in the developed Khibiny apatite–nepheline deposits. The rest of the reserves come from the complex loparite ores of the Lovozero deposit (more than 25%) and the weathering crust of rare-metal carbonatites of the Tomtor deposit, bearing associated Nb (about 10%). It should be noted that the Tomtor deposit in the Arctic segment of Russia ranks third among the new developed deposits in the world by the price of 1 t of ore in U.S. dollars (Petrov, 2014). With annual processing of more than 7 million t of apatite and extracting REM as by-products, Russia could meet almost 50% of global demand.</p><p>According to experts, Li would be a catalyst for the coming “green revolution” (<italic>Global</italic> …, 2019). In 2019, demand for Li carbonate went up to 300% and this year became landmark for global investors. To produce 500 000 electric cars per year it would be necessary to buy all world’s Li reserves. Demand for Li can quadruple by 2030 (<italic>Global</italic> …, 2019). The lithium-ion battery market already accounted for 71% of global lithium consumption in 2020. According to the US Geological Survey (<italic>Mineral</italic> …, 2022), global lithium production rose to more than 100 000 t in 2021, up 21% in the span of a year. Due to the burst in demand, there could be a critical deficiency of Li in the coming years. Norilsk Nickel has started upgrading production facilities to increase the supply of Ni and Co for Li-ion and other advanced batteries. In Russia, Li and its compounds have so far been used mainly in the defense industry. In developing a high-tech green industry, Russia will use increasing amounts of Li.</p><p>Over the last 50–60 years, due to the discovery, exploration, and calculation of Li reserves in dozens of the largest deposits of the world with reserves from 1 to 11 million t of Li<sub>2</sub>O, the structure of its reserves has been changed. In addition to ores of rare-metal granite pegmatites with an average content of 1.1–3.0% Li<sub>2</sub>O, up to 60–70% Li is extracted recently from brines of drainless salt lakes with a Li<sub>2</sub>O content of 0.06–0.5% (Melentiev, 2016).</p><p>Russia is one of the world’s leaders in lithium reserves (about 1 million t) (<italic>Mineral</italic> …, 2022). There are 17 lithium deposits registered in the State Reserve Register. The allocated subsoil fund contains four deposits. However, lithium deposits are not currently developed and lithium raw materials are not produced in the Russian Federation. While more than 70% of global lithium production comes from salar deposits in Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, China, and the United States, Russia’s main lithium reserves are concentrated in pegmatite (Kolmozerskoe, Voron’i Tundry, Tastyg, Ulug-Tanzek, Goltsovoe) and greisen (Voznesenskoe, Pogranichnoe) deposits.</p><p>The first lithium mine in the Soviet Union was put into operation in 1941 at the Zavitinskoe spodumene deposit (5.9–7.9% Li<sub>2</sub>O), Eastern Transbaikalia. This mine operated for 56 years and was put on care and maintenance in 1997 due to the economic situation in the country, depletion of reserves for open-pit mining, and a decrease in the Li<sub>2</sub>O content in the ores. At that time, Russia began importing lithium products (carbonate and oxides), which was motivated by its cheapness on the world market relative to the traditional spodumene raw materials. In recent years, almost all raw materials for lithium production have been imported into Russia from abroad, mainly from Chile (50%), Argentina (35%), and China (12%).</p><p>In 2021, Russia imported about 8000 t of lithium carbonate; in 2020, against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic, 7500 t were imported. In January 2022, lithium carbonate costs more than $48 000/t. Compared to January 2021, it was 430% more expensive.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3">3</xref> It should be noted that lithium carbonate contains 19% of lithium. Accordingly, the estimates for lithium carbonate are about five times higher than those for pure metal.</p><p>Domestic lithium industry includes plants for processing of lithium carbonate (Krasnoyarsk Chemical-Metallurgical Plant (CMP), Novosibirsk Chemical Concentrates Plant (NCCP) (Rosatom), and LLC TD Halmek (Tula oblast). Of the total Li production from imported raw materials (~2000 t), 400–700 t of lithium is consumed in Russia, while the other 1300–1600 t are exported.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn4">4</xref></p><p>According to experts, the demand for Li in Russia is currently minimal, with it being used by the nuclear industry and defense industry. Even Russian producers of lithium batteries use foreign products.

In addition, these deposits contain 14% of Russian reserves of Be and about 3% of Ta (Volkov et al., 2019). JSC Atomredmetzoloto, (ARMZ Uranium Holding Co.), the Mining Division of Rosatom State Atomic Energy Corp., is considering variants for investing in lithium mining projects in Murmansk oblast.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>MRB OF PHOTOVOLTAICS</title><p>Photovoltaic solar power plants consume a large amount of minerals for the base of structures and power transmission, including aluminum, concrete, copper, glass, nickel, steel, and zinc (Bleiwas, 2010). Crystalline silicon, the dominant semiconducting material used in photovoltaic technology for the production of solar cells, is common and readily available. However, more advanced thin-film photovoltaic cells include six less common components (cadmium, gallium, germanium, indium, selenium, and tellurium), which are highly valued for their peculiar properties when combined with other mineral materials. These six elements provide photovoltaic cells with durability, as well as a higher level of light absorption and conversion to electricity (Mah, 1998). Although relatively small quantities of these components are used in comparison to other materials used in the manufacture of photovoltaic cells, they play a crucial role in the production of specifically thin-film photovoltaic cells.</p><p>Thus, cadmium, gallium, germanium, indium, selenium, and tellurium, which are extracted as byproducts in the production of other metals, are critical for the implementation of large-scale global photovoltaic systems based on modern technology. These six components are as important to the implementation of green technology as the production of battery metals. The supply of these components to the market is heavily dependent on the mining of ores and the production of primary products: aluminum, coal, copper, lead, and zinc. Therefore, the production of primary products must increase significantly to get more of these six components. However, it is unlikely that more coal will be mined and combusted to extract more germanium from ash. In addition, it is also unlikely that more copper and zinc ore will be mined to extract cadmium, indium, selenium, and tellurium, while bauxite mining will increase to extract more gallium as a by-product during alumina production.</p><p>The complex deposits containing significant amounts of Ge and In as well as Ga, Te, and Se belong to the following types: volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposits, sedimentary-exhalation deposits (SEDEX), Mississippi Valley-type (MVT) lead–zinc deposits, and carbonate-hosted Kipushi-type zinc, lead, and copper deposits (<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).

There are 11 deposits, including three brown coals: Tarbagarai in Transbaikalia, Shkotovskoe in Primorsky krai, and Novikovskoe in Sakhalin oblast (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). In the case of a need for Ge, these deposits will be of high priority (<italic>Programma</italic> …, 2014).

Only one company, LLC Germanium and Applications, extracts Ge from raw materials of the Pavlovskoe brown-coal deposit (Primorsky krai). The Pavlovskoe deposit does not meet the domestic demand for raw materials, with the deficit being as much as 6 t (Naumov, 2007).</p><p>Another seven deposits are being developed to obtain other components (copper, iron, hard coal); GE is not extracted. The Novo-Uchalinskoe copper–sulfide deposit in the Republic of Bashkortostan is being prepared for development. The deficit of Ge could be reduced by developing lignite deposits, primarily in the Kasskaya ore zone, as well as by increasing the processing of secondary raw materials.</p><p>The domestic consumption pattern of Ge is represented by four groups (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>): infrared optics, 20%; electronics and solar batteries, 15%; fiber optics, 5%; and others, 60%. At the same time, domestic consumption of Ge remains insignificant due to the lack of development of the high-tech industry (Naumov, 2007). Domestic Ge products (more than 70% annually) are exported to Europe, the United States, Japan, and South Korea. The demand for Ge in the domestic industry is anticipated to increase until 2035 (<italic>Programma</italic> …, 2014).</p><fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5. </label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Main stages of production and application of Ge modified after (Naumov, 2007).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11477_2023_9184_Fig5_HTML.png"/></fig><p>The future of germanium looks optimistic given its obvious leading efficiency in solar technology and the fact that metal compounds containing CIGS (Cd–In–Ga–Se) may be replaced by germanium<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn5">5</xref>, because it is a more reliable metal in high-frequency devices and more economical for some LEDs.</p><p><italic>Gallium</italic>. In 2021, the world production of primary Ga was 430 t; the production from recycled material was 270 t (<italic>Mineral</italic> …, 2022). China is the leading producer of primary gallium (420 t), followed by Russia (5 t), Japan (3 t), and South Korea (2 t). The world’s Ga reserves of bauxite are estimated at more than 1 million t. The average Ga content in bauxite is 50 g/t. In addition, a significant amount of Ga occurs in zinc reserves worldwide. However, less than 10% of Ga can be extracted from these ores. In 2021, GaAs and GaN were mainly used in integrated circuits (ICs) and optoelectronics, while metallic gallium was used to produce microcircuits and LEDs.</p><p>In Russia, the Ga sources are by-products of alumina production: bauxite (60–65%) and nepheline (35%), with lead–zinc production wastes also being used to a limited extent. The cost of Ga extraction from polymetallic ores is from six to eight times higher than the cost of its extraction from bauxite and nepheline. The possibilities of obtaining gallium from bauxite raw materials are constrained by capacities of the primary alumina production.</p><p>Russia leads the world in Ga reserves (Larichkin et al., 2017). However, most of them (64%) are associated with nepheline ores of the group of Khibiny apatite deposits. The annual production of Khibiny ores is 25–28 million t; 350–400 t Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is extracted from this volume. The annual output of nepheline concentrate (1.5 million t) contains 50–55 t of Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.</p><p>United Company RUSAL is capable of producing up to 21.5 t of Ga owing to the capacities of Nikolaevskoe (15 t), Achinskoe (1.5 t), and Boksitogorskoe (5 t) alumina refineries. Siberian–Urals Aluminium Co. (SUAL) could produce about 11 t/year of gallium, employing the capacities of the Pikalyovo Alumina Refinery (9 t) and Urals Aluminum Smelter (2 t) (Larichkin et al., 2017).</p><p>In 2021, low-refined Ga was sold for $345/kg, 2.4 times higher than in early 2020 (<italic>Mineral</italic> …, 2022). The export of Ga from Russia is 5–8 t/year, and domestic needs are up to 1 t/year, mostly for electronics industry (Gasanov and Naumov, 2018). Because of the growing demand for gallium, we can probably expect an increasing global dependence on gallium from Chinese manufacturers in the next 5 years as well.</p><p><italic>Indium</italic>. In 2021, world resources of Zn were estimated at about 1.9 billion t (<italic>Mineral</italic> …, 2022). The average In content in zinc ore is thought to be 50 g/t. Thus, the estimated In resources in the Zn deposits are approximately 95 000 t. Indium is widely used to produce transparent film electrodes made of indium–tin oxide for liquid-crystal screens (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>).</p><fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6. </label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(a) Global Indium Production and (b) applications in 2021, based on (<italic>Mineral</italic> …, 2022).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11477_2023_9184_Fig6_HTML.png"/></fig><p>The global production of primary In is estimated at 920 t in 2021, which is 40 t less than in 2020. More than 1000 t/year of secondary indium is produced (<italic>Mineral</italic> …, 2022). The largest producer of secondary indium is Japan (~300 t/year) (Naumov, 2015). The current share of China is up to 60% of global production (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). It takes 3600 kWh to produce 1 kg of indium, which is 50 times more than for production of 1 kg of Al. Over recent years, 12.5 million t of zinc concentrates per year containing over 1500 t of indium have been processed (Naumov, 2015).</p><p>Japan ranks first in terms of In consumption, followed by the United States and China (Anderson, 2017). Increasing the share of cheaper recycled indium is an important pricing factor that keeps prices down. It is used in microelectronics as an acceptor dopant to germanium and silicon and has high adhesion to many materials, allowing soldering of different materials (e.g., metal to glass). Sometimes, In is used (pure In or Ag–In alloy) to coat mirrors, particularly car headlights and astronomical mirrors. In addition, it is used as a material for photocells in mechanical engineering, electronics, measurement equipment, etc.</p><p>At present, the world’s main sources of indium are polymetallic (70–75%) and tin–sulfide (10–15%) deposits. The highest In content is characteristic of ores of cassiterite-bearing skarns and sulfide–cassiterite deposits of various types (<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Indium is extracted worldwide from polymetallic ores with the In content of more than 100 g/t. In Russia, the highest In content was established in ores of tin and polymetallic deposits of various types (Gaskov et al., 2014). Although indium occurs in trace amounts in other sulfides of base metals, in particular, in chalcopyrite and stannite, most of the deposits of these minerals are subeconomic for indium extraction.</p><fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7. </label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Indium content (ppm) vs. In reserves (t) in the main types of In-bearing deposits, after (Paradis, 2015). <italic>Deposits:</italic> (1) Kidd Creek, (2) Brunswick, (3) Heath Steel, (4) Neves-Corvo, (5) Letnee, (6) Komsomolskoe, (7) Podolskoe, (8) Sibai, (9) Gai, (10) Bakr-Tau (11) Maranda-Jay, (12) Lau Base, (13) TAG, (14) Rammelsberg, (15) Longban, (16) Tosham, (17) Omodani, (18) W.

In-bearing concentrates are transported to JSC Chelyabinsk Zinc Plant (CZP) and JSC Electrozinc (companies of UMMC Holding) to produce pure indium. The main suppliers of raw materials are Uchalinsky and Gaisky Mining and Processing Plants. In production is about 6–10 t/year. After the reconstruction, CZP can produce up to 15 t of In per year (Gasanov and Naumov, 2018). The export of In from Russia is 5–8 t/year, and the domestic market consumes up to 1 t/year in alloys for electronics production.</p><p>The growth in the demand for In over the past two decades is due to the increased production of LCD screens and TVs, which consumes approximately 56% of the total metal produced. Currently, there is no alternative to indium in this area of production and all substitutes have much worse properties. In this scenario, global In consumption will grow by 7–10% annually in the near term (Schwarz-Schampera, 2014; Shanks et al., 2017).</p><p>At present, due to the increasing demand for In, there is a need to reassess the possible In sources in the discovered and explored deposits of Siberia and the Russian Far East, including the tailings of mining and processing plants and industrial enterprises (Gaskov et al., 2017).</p><p><italic>Cadmium</italic>. Cd reserves are estimated based on zinc reserves. The Cd content in typical zinc ores averages about 0.03%. It is relatively easy to obtain as a by-product during zinc ore processing: ~3 kg of Cd is produced from each ton of Zn. The world production of cadmium in 2021 was 24 thousand t; in Russia, 1000 t (<italic>Mineral</italic> …, 2022). Secondary production of Cd in the world is about 20% of its total production. Most of the secondary metal is produced by recycling Ni–Cd batteries in Asia, Europe, and the United States. The price of 1 t of Cd in 2021 varies from $2120 to $2850 (<italic>Mineral</italic> …, 2022).</p><p>Metallic cadmium and its compounds are mainly used to produce Ni–Cd batteries, as well as alloys, anticorrosion coatings, pigments, polyvinyl chloride stabilizers, and semiconductors for solar cells and radiation-detection systems.</p><p>There are two producers of cadmium in Russia: Chelyabinsk Electrolytic Zinc Plant, with a current output of 650–850 t/year, and Elektrozinc in Vladikavkaz, with one of 190–200 t/year (Kulchitsky and Naumov, 2010). In contrast to ore raw materials, in which the Cd percentage is usually as high as 0.03%, the Cd content in operated-off power sources reaches 30%, which makes them an extremely valuable raw material for industrial applications. This makes it possible to return up to 10 thousand t of all the Cd mined worldwide to the production cycle, while reducing the same amount of toxic waste.</p><p>Cd offers will increase due to the growth of zinc raw material base and continuing rise in Zn and Cd prices. The prospective state of Cd demand depend entirely on economic growth in China, which has the largest reserves of zinc and, potentially, cadmium, and Southeast Asia, where the main production of Ni–Cd batteries is now concentrated. In the coming years, the demand for Cd–Te is projected to rise due to the acceleration of solar energy development. In March 2021, for example, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) initiated Cd–Te production for the photovoltaic industry development program. The aim of the program is to achieve solar PV cell efficiencies above 26% by reducing panel costs to below $0.15/Wt by 2030 and increasing domestic production of PV materials and panels (<italic>Mineral</italic> …, 2022).</p><p><italic>Tellurium</italic>. World production of tellurium in 2021 was estimated at about 580 t, including 70 t in Russia at reserves of 31 thousand t. The average annual price for tellurium in 2021 was $68 per kg, 12% higher than in 2020 and twice as high as in 2017 (<italic>Mineral</italic> …, 2022). More than 90% of tellurium was derived from anode sludge collected during the electrolytic refining of copper, and the rest came from lead smelters and from dust and gases produced during the smelting of bismuth, copper, and lead–zinc ores (<italic>Mineral</italic> …, 2022). Potential Te sources also include bismuth and gold tellurides. Copper slimes contain 3–5% Te in the form of compounds with noble metals (Kulchitsky, Naumov, 2010). There are only two producers of tellurium in Russia: Nornickel (&lt;3 t/year) and Ural Mining and Metallurgical Co. (UMMC) (&gt;30 t/year).</p><p>The global consumption of tellurium is as follows: solar energy, 40%; thermoelectric production, 30%; metallurgy, 15%; manufacture of rubber products, 5%; and others, 10%. Producers of CdTe-based photovoltaic panels will be sorely in need of tellurium after the Te market grows to more than 3–4 GW/year, which will require 300–400 t/year, i.e., more than half of all currently mined tellurium (Kulchitsky and Naumov, 2010).</p><p>The slowdown in the growth rate of the ore reserves to extract tellurium, on the one hand, and the growing demand for Te, on the other, may cause a surge in Te prices and, eventually, have an effect on the cost of its compounds and devices based on them. The growing problem of Te shortage gives an incentive to the development of its extraction from sources that have been out of consideration before. One example of this is the renewed mining of the Kankberg gold–tellurium deposit in Sweden, in which tellurium is the second major ore component (Schulz et al., 2017).</p><p><italic>Selenium</italic>. Global Se reserves in copper deposits are estimated at ~100 thousand t. Total Se production in 2021 was ~3000 t, 120 t less than in 2020 (<italic>Mineral</italic> …, 2022). Global Se consumption is represented (in the descending order) by metallurgy (including manganese production), glass production, agriculture, chemicals and pigments, and electronics, including copper–indium–gallium–di-selenide photovoltaic solar cells (CIGS).</p><p>Approximately 250–300 t of Se is extracted from secondary sources (Kulchitsky and Naumov, 2015). Russia has three Se producers: Nornickel (about 80 t/year), UMMC (up to 110 t/year), and Kyshtym Copper Smelter (up to 15–20 t/year). In recent years, the production of refined copper has been increasing. Consequently, the reserve base of Se is growing as well.</p><p>The average annual price for selenium in 2021 was $8.00 per pound, 21% higher than in 2020 (<italic>Mineral</italic> …, 2022). The selenium-price position is projected to be more or less stable in the medium term or rather, which is more likely, with a mild downward trend. In the long term, the role of selenium and its compounds will increase due to the development of new innovative application sectors. By 2030, the global Se demand may increase to 8000–9000 t/year (Kulchitskii and Naumov, 2015).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>This work presents an assessment of the degree of criticality of strategic and high-tech mineral raw materials for the Russian Federation and location schemes of the major deposits and promising ore occurrences of HTMs in Russia. It is noted that the share of Russia in the HTM production in the global structure is extremely insignificant, despite the available reserves. Many complex HTM-bearing deposits in Russia are not developed. Most HTMs necessary for Russian industry are imported.</p><p>The analysis performed has shown that Russia can increase the production of two HTM groups that are critical for green technologies: “battery” metals (Ni, Co, Li, Pt, Pd, Ro, and REE) and components for “photovoltaics” (Cd, Se, Te, Ge, Ga, and In). At the present stage, one of the crucial tasks facing producers is to ensure a sufficient supply of these metals at a reasonable price, given the upswing of demand for them. The Russian segment of the Arctic has a considerable HTM resource potential (including “battery” metals), which allows one to create new enterprises or significantly increase production volumes at existing ones.</p><p>At present, Russia is showing a positive development of the MRB of high-tech metals. It is planned to develop a number of new deposits of rare and trace metals, including Tomtor (Republic Sakha-Yakutia), REMs, Sc, and Nb; Zashikinskoe (Irkutsk oblast), Nb and Ta; Ermakovskoe (Republic of Buryatia), Be; Tsentralnoe (Tambov oblast), Zr and Hf; Podolskoe (Republic of Bashkortostan), Cd, Ga, Ge, In, and Bi; Pavlovskoe (Arkhangelsk oblast), Cd, Ga, Ge, In, and Bi; Dalmatovskoe (Kurgan oblast), Sc; Korbalakhinskoe (Altai krai), Se, Te, Bi, Tl, Cd, and In; Peschanka (Chukotka autonomous oblast) and Malmyzh (Khabarovsk krai), Re, Te, and Se; and Kolmozerskoe and Polmostundrovskoe (Murmansk oblast), Li, Be, and REMs.</p><p>Supplies of most associated HTMs extracted from complex ores may potentially be increased as a result of special measures stimulating their production, including</p><p>(1) an increase in by-product metal prices to justify increased production at concentrators by the expansion of existing facilities and construction of new ones;</p><p>(2) production of by-product metals at mines, where they are not currently mined, but could be potentially extracted;</p><p>(3) improving the technology of metallurgical recovery of by-product metals;</p><p>(4) reevaluation of reserves of complex deposits, where the metals in question are not currently being produced;</p><p>(5) extraction of associated metals from residual mining and processing waste of complex ores; and</p><p>(6) improvement of by-product metal-processing indicators.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation, project no. 13.1902.21.008.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement"><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</title><p>The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.</p></sec><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>REFERENCES</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Anderson, C.S., Indium, <italic>U.S. Geol.
