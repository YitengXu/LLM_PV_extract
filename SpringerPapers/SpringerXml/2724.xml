Physical insight of viscous dissipation, heat absorption and thermal radiation on the flow-field is scrutinized by dissolving the nanoparticles of molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>) and graphene into ethylene glycol. The governing mathematical model is transformed into the system of similarity equations by utilizing the apt similarity variables.

Additionally, to comprehend the connection between heat transport rate and emerging flow parameters, a quadratic regression approximation analysis on the numerical entities of local Nusselt numbers and skin friction coefficients is accomplished. The findings disclose that the suction and thermal radiation have an adverse influence on the skin friction coefficients and heat transport rate.

A hybrid nanofluid is prepared by the dispersal of two or more nano-sized metal or metal oxides into a conventional (base) fluid. The thermophysical features and significance of nanoparticles of various metals (Cu, Au, Ag, etc.), metal oxides (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, ZnO, TiO<sub>2</sub>, SiO<sub>2</sub>, MoS<sub>2</sub>, etc.), metal nitrides (Boron nitride BN, AIN), metal carbides (SiC), carbon materials (CNTs, graphene, diamonds, etc.) and hybrid nanomaterials are available in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Each nanoparticle has inimitable thermal features and is utilized as per the need of the thermal systems. In this research exploration, the nanoparticles of graphene and molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>) are disseminated into the ethylene glycol to prepare the hybrid nanofluid. The nanoparticles of graphene and molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>) have tremendous thermal performance and are applicable in various thermal systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The graphene (allotrope of carbon) nanoparticles own the unique material, chemical, electrical and physical characteristics because it has a single layer of atoms, biocompatibility certainties, expanded surface area, cell growth capability, fast mobility of electrons, stability, and high thermal conductivity. On the other hand, molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>) consists of a layered structure and has distinctive properties such as chemically inertness, photo corrosion resistance and anisotropy, etc. Experimental findings revealed that hybrid nanofluids have better efficiency as compared to nanomaterials. Novel characteristics of hybrid nanofluids are significant in thermal storage, solar heating, transformer cooling, biomedical industry, heat pumps, refrigeration, welding, aircraft, spacecraft, lubrication, generator and electronic cooling, etc. Suresh et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> quantified the mechanism of thermal transport on the dynamics of water conveying Cu-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> hybrid nanofluid. They analysed the significant improvement in convective heat transfer owing to synthesized hybrid particles’ addition as compared to water. Devi and Devi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> implemented the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg algorithm to analyse the heat transport rate of three-dimensional water-driven Cu-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles hybrid nanofluid flow through a stretchable surface under the inspiration of suction and Lorentz force. The numerical findings disclosed that the heat transport rate of water conveying Cu-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles hybrid nanofluid is better than Cu-water nanofluid. Further, in the extended work, Devi and Devi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> showed that the heat transport rate of water-driven Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-Cu hybrid nanofluid can be improved to 17.3% as compared to base liquid water whereas 11.2% than the Cu-water nanofluid. Recently, Khashi’ie et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> enumerated the significance of the magnetic field and suction strength on the time-dependent squeezing flow of water-based Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-Cu hybrid nanofluid through a parallel channel. They observed that the heat transport rate of the hybrid nanofluid at the lower plate can be reduced due to the inclusion of injection, squeezing and magnetic parameters while it can be improved at the upper plate of the channel nearly by 30.35% owing to the augmentation of suction and magnetic field strength.</p><p id="Par3">Because of the applications in industry, the novel features of thermal radiation cannot be overlooked exclusively in the designing of steadfast equipment, furnaces, electrical power generation, nuclear plants, gas turbines, satellites, missiles, and also in designing of various cutting-edge energy conversion systems. These days, owing to the diminution of traditional energy sources, researchers are giving much attention to renewable energy resources. Solar energy is the fundamental basis of renewable energy and the thermal effect performs as an important fragment to change solar energy to the apt form for different industrial applications. Keeping the significance of radiation effect into account, the influence of nonlinear radiation on the Cu-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles driven flow of micropolar dusty hybrid nanofluid via a stretchable surface was scrutinized by Ghadikolaei et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The nonlinear radiation impact on the thermal conductive flow of hybrid nanofluid (water/Cu-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) through a three-dimensional stretchable surface in a rotating medium using the least square approach was surveyed by Usman et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Further, Sheikoleslami et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> inspected the non-Darcy model of hybrid nanofluid considering Hartmann effects and a radiation term. They analysed that the temperature gradient gets highly affected owing to augmenting values of buoyancy parameter. Shoaib et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> studied the three-dimensional rotating flow of magneto-hybrid nanofluid past an extendable surface with thermal radiation. Some illustrious research articles highlighting the novel features of thermal radiation can be seen in references<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In addition, the inclusion of heat generation/absorption is important in controlling the heat transport rate in several industrial processes such as in glass fibre production, hot rolling, endothermic reactions, paper production, heat conversation due to nuclear fuel wastage, etc. Following this, Hayat and Nadeem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> elucidated the implication of heat absorption/generation on the heat transport features of three-dimensional chemically reactive and radiative hybrid nanofluid flow through a stretchable surface. They concluded from their numerical exploration that the inspirations heat generation, radiation and chemical reaction are significant to achieve the higher heat transport rate of hybrid nanofluid as compare to simple nanofluid. This numerical exploration was further extended by Hayat et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> to capture the effects of heat generation/absorption, considering the hybrid nanofluid in a rotating medium. Recently, Li et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> assessed the mathematical model to illustrate the effect of heat generation/absorption on the entropy optimised convective flow in a rotating cone. They concluded that the upsurge in viscosity parameter and buoyancy ratio variable result in a significant rise in the tangential velocity.</p><p id="Par4">One point to note here is that, in all the research articles reported above, the majority of authors have overlooked viscous dissipation term because of the feeble result on the flow field but its bearing in polymer manufacturing, lubrication, instrumentations, food processing, etc., is substantial because it augments the temperature distribution features and subsequently upsurges the heat transport rate. Few novel research articles describing the implication of viscous dissipation on various flow problems persuaded by a stretchable surface/thin stirring needle are cited in references<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. In addition, Joule dissipation demonstrates the features of volumetric heat source in magneto-fluid flows and combined Joule and viscous dissipations inspirations are noteworthy in various heat-treated materials. Owing to this reason, Seth et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, Daniel et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> and Seth and Singh<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> taken both the terms of Joule and viscous dissipations together in their mathematical models. Flow features of propylene glycol conveying, entropy optimized, magneto and dissipative Darcy-Forchheime nanofluid via a stretchable surface was illustrated by Abbas et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Further, Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> explored the irreversibility features of entropy optimized magneto-nanofluid flow via variable thick surface under inspirations of viscous dissipation and Joule heating. Numerical exploration was done by Ibrahim and Khan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> to analyse the influence of viscous dissipation on SWCNT and MWCNT conveying mixed convection nanofluid flow. Slip conditions are being extensively inspected by numerous researchers owing to their importance in the heat transport process which occurs due to the dissimilar fluid velocity and the velocity of fluid near the boundary. In industry, slip condition is widely used in micro heat exchangers, microelectronics cooling devices, polishing, artificial heart valves, internal cavities and drug delivery system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Lately, Hussain et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> inspected the flow of graphene and ethylene glycol-based Maxwell nanofluid via a stretchable surface under the inspirations of thermal radiation, slip conditions, viscous and Joule dissipations. This problem was further extended by Sharma et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> considering heat absorption into account. The numerical findings divulged that viscous dissipation, radiation and slip parameters are important in controlling the temperature of the flow field. Also, heat transport rate is more sensitive to radiation parameters in contrast with viscous dissipation. Very recently, Wahid et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> investigated the dynamics of hybrid nanofluid flow in the presence of velocity slip and heat generation via an exponentially stretchable surface. They analysed that the shear stress and wall temperature gradient can be augmented by enhancing the volume fraction of copper nanoparticles. Recent additions considering nanofluids with heat and mass transfer in various physical situations are given by Refs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Encouraged from the available literature, in this research exploration, we envisioned examining the dynamics of ethylene glycol-based hydromagnetic hybrid nanofluid containing graphene and MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles over an exponentially stretchable sheet with partial slip and thermal jump conditions. The significance of viscous dissipation, heat absorption and thermal radiation on the flow field is scrutinized under both velocity slip and without slip conditions. The governing mathematical equations of the problem are solved numerically with the help of three stages Lobatto IIIa-bvp4c solver based on a finite difference scheme in MATLAB. Moreover, to comprehend the connection between heat transfer rate and emerging flow parameters, a statistical method is accomplished for the quadratic regression approximation on the numerical entities of local Nusselt numbers and skin friction coefficients. Finally, the computed numerical results are compared with the published results under limited conditions to validate the numerical solution.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Mathematical foundation of the problem</title><p id="Par6">In this numerical exploration, the dynamics of two-dimensional, steady-state, incompressible and electrically conducted flow of ethylene glycol-based hybrid nanofluid over an exponentially stretchable sheet under the stimulus of partial slip and thermal jump conditions are examined.

This phenomenon happens because a resisting force is persuaded due to the gradual improvement in the strength of the magnetic field. This resisting force termed as Lorentz force acts in the opposite direction of flow-field as well as hybrid nanoparticles and subsequently, the velocity of hybrid nanofluid is retarded whereas its temperature gets improved due to enrichment in frictional drag force. The hybrid nanofluid velocity profiles are declined while the temperature dispersal profiles are improved owing to the rise in the angle of aligned magnetic field under both velocity slip and without slip conditions, as revealed in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. This tendency of profiles exhibits that the angle of the aligned magnetic field retards the velocity of hybrid nanofluid and the resistive force’s strength is optimal when the exerted magnetic field is perpendicular to the stretchable sheet. The optimal resistive force diminishes the motion hybrid nanofluid and improves the temperature of the fluid. Figures <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> represent the diminishing effect of suction parameter <inline-formula id="IEq89"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq89_Math"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq89_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The reason behind this behaviour of profiles is that the momentum boundary layer sticks to the surface of the stretchable sheet in the instance of suction, which breaks the flow momentum and as a result, both velocity and temperature of hybrid nanofluid are reduced. On the other hand, injection enhances fluid via lateral mass flux over the stretchable sheet and, in turn, appends the momentum of fluid flow. Consequently, both the velocity and temperature of hybrid nanofluid get improved. Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> illustrates the influence of thermal radiation and heat absorption on the temperature of hybrid nanofluid. This figure shows that the temperature dispersal profiles upsurge due to the rise in the values of the radiation parameter (<italic>Tr</italic>). Generally, thermal radiation depends on the temperature of the surrounding, and it is emitted in an electromagnetic waveform. Therefore, thermal radiation can be assumed as a function of temperature. The thermal effect improves the conduction properties of nanofluid and hence, thicken the boundary layer and as a result, the temperature of fluid gets enhanced. Further, the temperature dispersal profiles of hybrid nanofluid are reduced due to the enhancement in heat absorption parameter (<italic>H</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>). The reason behind this physical behaviour of the fluid is that a rise in the values of <italic>H</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> results from the augmentation in the heat-absorbing capacity of the hybrid nanofluid and consequently, the fluid temperature gets diminished. Figure <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> is depicted to capture the inspirations of viscous dissipation and thermal slip factor on the temperature of hybrid nanofluid. It is observed that the temperature dispersal profiles of hybrid nanofluid are improved owing to the enhancement in Eckert number (<italic>Ec</italic>) while it reduced due to thermal slip factor (<italic>D</italic>).

This infers that the inspiration of viscous dissipation is responsible to raise the temperature of hybrid nanofluid. On the other hand, the thermal slip parameter is accountable to lessen the hybrid nanofluid temperature under both the velocity slip and no-slip situations. Physically, it is justified because from the surface of the stretchable sheet a reduced quantity of heat flows to the hybridized fluid in increasing the thermal slip parameter. Additionally, the graphical illustrations suggest that the thermal boundary layer thickness is improved by the magnetic field, angle of aligned magnetic field, viscous dissipation, injection and thermal radiation while it is declined due to augmentation in suction, heat absorption, and the thermal slip factor.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Effects of <italic>M</italic> on the dispersal profiles of hybrid (<bold>a</bold>) velocity <inline-formula id="IEq94"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq94_Math"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>ξ</mml:mi><mml:mo>′</mml:mo></mml:msup><mml:mfenced close=")" open="("><mml:mi>η</mml:mi></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq94_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Precisely, regression approximation is employed to analyse how the features of an emerging flow parameter change due to the variation of another flow parameter while the remaining flow parameters are kept constant.

These error bounds are mentioned in Tables <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref> and <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>. It is worthy to remark that as the strength of the magnetic field or viscous dissipation effect improves, the coefficients of <italic>S</italic> or <italic>Tr</italic> becomes negative as observed from Tables <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref> and <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>, respectively. This finding reveals that the suction and thermal radiation have an adverse influence on the approximated skin friction coefficients and wall temperature gradients respectively. Moreover, from the tabulated values it is found that the coefficients of the velocity slip parameter are greater than those of the suction parameter in magnitude; which reveals the findings that a small variation in the velocity slip parameter <italic>L</italic> results in a significant change in the shear stress function in comparison to the suction parameter <italic>S</italic>. Likewise, a small augmentation in the thermal slip factor causes a considerable variation in the heat transport rate in comparison to the thermal effect. In addition, it is observed that the optimum relative error of quadratic regression approximation for the reduced wall temperature gradient is approximately zero, and the approaching rate towards this admirable accuracy level is faster than that of the quadratic regression approximation for the reduced skin friction coefficients.<table-wrap id="Tab6"><label>Table 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Quadratic regression approximated coefficients of <inline-formula id="IEq205"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq205_Math"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq205_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Likewise, a small augmentation in the thermal slip factor causes a considerable variation in the heat transport rate in comparison to the thermal effect.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par47">The optimum relative error of quadratic regression approximation for the reduced wall temperature gradient is approximately zero, and the approaching rate towards this admirable accuracy level is faster than that of the quadratic regression approximation for the reduced skin friction coefficients.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The researcher wishes to extend their sincere gratitude to the Deanship of Scientific Research at the Islamic University of Madinah for the support  provided to the Post-Publishing Program 1.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>The author of the paper is sole responsible for the manuscript which includes conceptualization, literature survey, formulation, numerical computation, validation, results and discussion, etc.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement"><sec id="FPar1" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Competing interests</title><p id="Par48">The author declares no competing interests.</p></sec></sec><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Babar</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Ali</surname><given-names>HM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Towards hybrid nanofluids: Preparation, thermophysical properties, applications, and challenges</article-title><source>J.
