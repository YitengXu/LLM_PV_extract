However, the development of facile and high-yield techniques for the fabrication of SACs remains challenging. In this paper, we report a laser-induced solid-phase strategy for the synthesis of Pt SACs on graphene support. Simply by rapid laser scanning/irradiation of a freeze-dried electrochemical graphene oxide (EGO) film loaded with chloroplatinic acid (H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub>), we enabled simultaneous pyrolysis of H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub> into SACs and reduction/graphitization of EGO into graphene. The rapid freezing of EGO hydrogel film infused with H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub> solution in liquid nitrogen and the subsequent ice sublimation by freeze-drying were essential to achieve the atomically dispersed Pt. Nanosecond pulsed infrared (IR; 1064 nm) and picosecond pulsed ultraviolet (UV; 355 nm) lasers were used to investigate the effects of laser wavelength and pulse duration on the SACs formation mechanism. The atomically dispersed Pt on graphene support exhibited a small overpotential of −42.3 mV at −10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> for hydrogen evolution reaction and a mass activity tenfold higher than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. This method is simple, fast and potentially versatile, and scalable for the mass production of SACs.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Synthesis of Pt single atom catalysts is achieved by one-step laser irradiation of “isolated” H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub> precursor on graphene oxide, via filtration and freeze-drying sublimation, by simultaneous pyrolysis of the precursor and reduction of graphene oxide.</p><p id="Par3"><fig id="Figa" position="anchor"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41377_2021_603_Figa_HTML.png" position="anchor"/></fig></p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>168</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>19</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41377_2021_Article_603.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Physics</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Physics, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Applied and Technical Physics</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Atomic, Molecular, Optical and Plasma Physics</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Classical and Continuum Physics</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Optics, Lasers, Photonics, Optical Devices</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Physics and Astronomy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par4">Single-atom catalysts (SACs) are a class of catalysts in which individual and isolated metal atoms are anchored to supports. Due to their maximized atom utilization and unique coordination environments, SACs have emerged as a new frontier in heterogeneous catalysis, showing outstanding catalytic performance in a variety of reactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, including electrochemical reactions, water-gas shift reactions, and hydrogenation reactions. The SACs have shown a wide range of applications in synthetic organic chemistry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, solar hydrogen technologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, and low-platinum fuel cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The production of well-dispersed isolated atoms as heterogeneous catalysts remains challenging due to the high-surface energy of individual atoms. Various strategies have been developed for the fabrication of SACs. High-vacuum physical deposition technologies, such as atomic-layer deposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, provide ideal model catalysts for fundamental studies of the metal–support interaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. However, these high-vacuum methods are difficult for large-scale production due to the complex and costly equipment and low yield. Meanwhile, a variety of wet-chemical routes, including co-precipitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, impregnation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, acid leaching<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, and de-alloying<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, are commonly used for catalyst synthesis. The adaptation of these methods in the production of SACs remains limited, for the complexity, poor versatility, long processing time, and high post-processing cost<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In addition, defect engineering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> and organic synthesis (e.g., metal–organic framework<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>) also suffer from poor versatility and tedious precursor modifications.</p><p id="Par6">On the other hand, facile fabrication of heterogeneous SACs has been achieved by high-temperature pyrolysis of precursors on a wide variety of supports. For instance, a single atom Fe, Co, or Ni on carbon nanotube was obtained by multistep pyrolysis of the mixture of dicyandiamide with iron, cobalt, and nickel acetylacetonate, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Very recently, Yao et al. demonstrated the use of high-temperature shockwaves generated from pulsed electrical Joule heating of the H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub>-loaded activated carbon nanofiber to synthesize and stabilize single Pt atoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In this research, proper controls of the heating period and temperature (~1500 K) are critical to avoid agglomeration and provide sufficient activation energy for the formation of a thermodynamically stable Pt–C bond. This synthetic method extends the previous high-temperature atom trapping and pyrolysis routes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, which improves processing efficiency and can be easily scaled up.</p><p id="Par7">Lasers, as a non-contact manufacturing tool, benefit from various available wavelengths, high-energy-density, rapid scanning speed, high spatial resolution, and good flexibility in designing complex patterns and 3D architecture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. They have been used to fabricate various kinds of nanoparticles (NPs), including metal, alloy and metal oxide NPs, semiconductor quantum dots, and core-shell NPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, offering a powerful and flexible alternative to the purely chemical approaches for the synthesis of NPs. Laser-induced synthesis of NPs mainly based on two different mechanisms. The first mechanism is based on laser ablation in liquid to produce colloidal NPs with particle size typically above 5 nm and broad size distribution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The second mechanism is based on laser-assisted photochemical processes to generate metal (Au, Ag, and Pd) NPs down to sub-5 nm through photochemical reduction of metal salt precursors in aqueous solution, e.g., using ultrashort laser pulses to induce solvated electron from the liquid medium or excite electron–hole pairs in the semiconducting solute that are capable of reducing soluble metal ions to neutral atoms, which then coalesce into NPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. However, the synthesis of atomically dispersed species via liquid-phase laser photo-deposition remains challenging, as the nucleation and crystal growth can hardly be prevented without effective confinement of the reactants.</p><p id="Par8">In this paper, for the first time, we report a laser-induced solid-phase strategy for the synthesis of atomically dispersed Pt on graphene support by simultaneous pyrolysis of metal salt precursor and reduction/graphitization of electrochemical graphene oxide (EGO). The Pt-EGO samples for laser irradiation were prepared by freeze-drying the H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub> infused EGO hydrogel films to form “isolated dispersion” of H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub> precursor on the EGO substrate. In order to establish laser synthesis mechanisms, two types of lasers, namely, a picosecond (ps) pulsed ultraviolet (UV) laser with a wavelength of 355 nm and nanosecond (ns) pulsed infrared (IR) Nd:YAG laser with a wavelength of 1064 nm were used; and the temperature evolution during the laser irradiation was recorded. For the use of the ns IR laser, the localized temperature reached up to ca. 1350.2 K as measured by the thermal camera; finite element modeling suggested a peak temperature as high as 1692.6 K, suggesting thermal decomposition route via photothermal effect. After the laser irradiation, single Pt atoms decorated laser-reduced EGO (Pt-LrEGO) with a Pt loading of 0.41 wt.% were successfully synthesized. As electrocatalysts, the Pt-LrEGO presented a small overpotential of −42.3 mV at −10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a mass activity over ten times higher than that of the commercial Pt/C. This laser synthesis method is one-step, simple, ultrafast, and potentially scalable, which can be readily extended to other metals and supporting materials for mass production of functional SACs for various applications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><p id="Par9">The laser synthesis is illustrated in both Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>. First, the EGO film was prepared by vacuum filtration of the EGO aqueous dispersion through a PTFE membrane filter, then 1 mL of the chloroplatinic acid (H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub>) solution with desired concentration (1, 2, 3, 5, or 10 mM) was filtered through the EGO film to obtain the Pt-EGO hydrogel film. The freshly filtered, wet Pt-EGO hydrogel film supported by the PTFE membrane filter was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, followed by freeze-drying in a vacuum to sublimate the ice. The purpose of this direct sublimation of solid ice to water vapor was to immobilize the [PtCl<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2−</sup> anion complex on negatively charged EGO flakes to avoid localized precipitation of the metal precursor. The as-prepared Pt-EGO films were subject to laser irradiation under Ar atmosphere via rapid scanning. After the laser treatment, the laser-reduced EGO (LrEGO) film loaded with Pt single atoms were separated from the PTFE membrane filter by sonication in water, followed by washing and freeze-drying to obtain the final materials in a powder state.

The weight percentage of Pt species increased from 0.03 to 1.40 wt.% with H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub> concentration from 1 to 10 mM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>).</p><p id="Par13">In addition to the concentration of precursor solution, the type of Pt precursor compounds, namely, H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub> or PtCl<sub>4</sub>, shows a significant impact on the as-formed Pt species on the LrEGO support.

To compare the temperature evolution of the EGO surface at different laser fluences, we monitored the temperature evolution at five probe points (as marked in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>) for each laser fluence. By averaging the time trace temperatures of these five probe points (see details in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S7</xref>), we obtained the representative temperature-time profiles for each laser fluence.

Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref> compares the peak temperatures at various laser fluences under the same NOP (i.e., 30). It is obvious that the increase of the laser fluences results in the increase of temperatures up to 1350.2 ± 50 K at the laser fluence of 11.49 mJ cm<sup>−2</sup>. In addition, due to the high repetition rate (30 kHz), the heat spike induced by each pulse was not able to cool down to the initial temperature between pulses. Therefore, the heat accumulation results in surface temperatures being over 493.2 K for a period up to ~150 ms.

Owing to the extremely small duty cycle of 1/6660 (5 ns, 30 kHz), the calculation of the entire process requires tremendous computing time. Thus, the simulation was conducted by depositing 30 successive pulses scanned across the surface probe at 1000 mm s<sup>−1</sup> with an interval of ~33.3 µs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). Each individual pulse possesses a Gaussian energy distribution and has a laser ON time of 5 ns. The simulated temporal thermal profile shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref> shows a short heating time of ~1 ms to reach up to 1692.2 K, and a fast thermal relaxation to 298.15 K within ~108 ms. At a given laser fluence, the rapid heating and cooling during and after the laser ON period were clearly shown, and the peak temperature gradually rises with increasing accumulated heat and spatial energy density. When the laser beam bypassed the probe, the accumulated heat reached the highest value of 998.9, 1348.2, and 1692.6 K which corresponds to the laser fluences of 3.83, 7.66, and 11.49 mJ cm<sup>−2</sup>, respectively.</p><p id="Par23">As described in Schweizer and Kerr’s work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, the thermal breakdown of H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub> to form platinum metal takes place through several steps as follows: H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub> → PtCl<sub>4</sub> + 2HCl at 423.2–453.2 K, PtCl<sub>4</sub> → PtCl<sub>2</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub> at 574.2–594.2 K, PtCl<sub>2</sub> → Pt + Cl<sub>2</sub> at 648.2–783.2 K. Therefore, the temperature of 1025 K achieved during the 1064 nm laser irradiation at the lowest laser fluence (3.83 mJ cm<sup>−2</sup>) was sufficient to induce in situ thermal decomposition of the adsorbed H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub> molecules in the EGO film to form Pt single atoms. The rapid heating and cooling during the laser processing inhibit the diffusion and aggregation of the Pt atoms, and the short thermal pulse at temperatures up to 1692.2 K is likely to promote the formation of stable bonding between the Pt single atoms and the graphene support. Interestingly, at the H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub> concentration of 5 mM, the as-formed Pt species remain as atomically dispersed single atoms with the increase of laser fluence from 3.83 to 11.49 mJ cm<sup>−2</sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S8</xref>), indicating that the rise in temperature had not promoted the diffusion of the single atoms, which suggested stable metal–substrate bonding and high stability of the atomic dispersion.</p><p id="Par24">This can be further supported by the consideration of two types of overlapping involved in the beam scanning. One is that as described in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the laser beam spot size was 1 mm in diameter and overlap ratio between the tracks was 50%. This means that 50% of the laser track with already formed Pt single atoms was re-treated and a portion adjacent to the successive track was re-heated. However, no Pt aggregation/clusters were evident. The other type of overlapping is always present in pulsed-laser scanning. For instance, with the beam size of 1 mm, the scanning speed of 1000 mm/s and repetition rate of 30 kHz, the number of pulses per point (NOPs) is 30, which means that the Pt single atoms were exposed to the successive pulses, but no Pt aggregation was observed. This further indicated the stability of the Pt single atoms once synthesized and anchored to the supporting material was formed. On the other hand, thermal reduction of EGO involves the removal of functional groups and restoration of carbon structures. Although the reduction of carboxyl groups with low stability starts at 100–150 °C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, total elimination of all the functional groups including highly stable carbonyl groups needs a high temperature (&gt;1000 °C)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, and carbon structural evolution is temperature-dependent. During the laser irradiation, the temperature range achieved was sufficient to induce the photothermal reduction of the EGO, and the re-heating caused by overlapping should be beneficial to the reduction degree.</p><p id="Par25">In order to investigate the effect of the laser irritation time, the scanning speed was set to be 800 mm/s with the same laser fluence to 7.66 mJ cm<sup>−2</sup> to avoid damage of the EGO layer. In this case, the Pt particles/clusters were found in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S9</xref>, implying that the duration, which also enhances the degree of overlapping, played an important role on atomic diffusion/aggregation of Pt single atoms.</p><p id="Par26">When the ps UV laser was applied, photochemical removal of functional groups was expected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.

While for the 1064 nm beam at a photon energy of ~1.17 eV, multiphoton process is required to excite EGO. However, the peak temperature raises of the EGO surface monitored by the thermal camera (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S10</xref>) reached 803.7 K at the laser fluence of 2.0 mJ cm<sup>−2</sup> and the number of pulses of ~404, suggesting that both photochemical and photothermal heating took place simultaneously. Since the UV laser (355 nm, ~4.86 eV) photon energy is far below the resonant excitation of C–O or C=O bond<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, direct excitation may occur through valence-to-conduction band transitions, which may lead to ejection of plasma in the material<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> and/or photoreduction of EGO film by photon excited electrons of residual water molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> or EGO itself<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. As the direct ionization occurs ahead of thermal accumulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, the photoreduction of the EGO could occur via combined mechanisms with the following sub-processes: (i) removal of oxygen-containing functional groups, (ii) conversion of reduced carbon sp<sup>3</sup> into sp<sup>2</sup> structure, and (iii) restoration of sp<sup>2</sup> network. The removal of functional groups and the conversion of sp<sup>2</sup> structure can be achieved by both photochemical and photothermal routes, but the restoration of sp<sup>2</sup> network might be dominated by thermal effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. As demonstrated in Supplementary Figs. S5e and 4f, the defect density of the LrEGO by the ps UV laser was higher than that by the ns IR laser, indicating the higher temperature in the ns IR laser irradiation might benefit the restoration of sp<sup>2</sup> carbon network.</p><p id="Par27">In addition, the EGO films contain multiple layers of EGO flakes, one of the reasons of the nonuniform reduction of EGO under UV laser irradiation might be from anisotropy of thermal conductivity in two-dimensional materials; and GO has over 100-fold anisotropy of heat flow between the in-plane and out-of-plane directions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. For an ultrashort pulsed laser in the ps or fs region, thermal diffusion volume is smaller than that of an ns laser, which results in a superficial reduction of EGO film with poor restoration of sp<sup>2</sup> carbon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Furthermore, laser beam conversion into thermal energy depends on not only the wavelength, pulse width, but also the stacked layers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. The penetration depth of the UV laser is smaller than that of the IR laser, and the ns pulse width also enhances heat conduction deeper than the ps pulse width. Thus, a thoroughly thermal reduction of EGO film can be expected when using ns IR irradiation. This was reflected by the XRD patterns (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S6</xref>) that the signals from the EGO were still present for the ps UV-treated Pt5-LrEGO, particularly for the low end of the laser fluences. This was also supported by the observation of the large error bars from ten measurements for various Raman parameters (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S5</xref>), suggesting that less uniform and smaller penetration of heating by the ps UV laser. Therefore, despite the effective removal of oxygen via photochemical dominating mechanism by the UV laser, reduction and structure restoration of the beneath layers are most likely achieved by thermal conduction with limited heat transport. Increasing the laser fluence of the ps UV laser caused ablation of EGO which accompanies endothermic phase changes and further impedes heat conduction. It could be concluded that the ns IR laser irradiation promotes an effective and uniform reduction of EGO throughout the EGO film in the thickness of 1.3 µm via a photothermal route.</p><p id="Par28">In comparison to other chemical and physical methods in the fabrication of SACs, the laser photoreduction method is a one-step process, ultrafast laser manufacturing technique for the fabrication of Pt single atoms on the LrEGO support.

The measurement was conducted in a N<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> electrolyte at a rotating speed of 1600 rpm. To reveal the intrinsic catalytic performance, the ohmic-drop correction was conducted in order to minimize the solution resistance. The linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) curves of the purchased commercial Pt/C (20 wt.%; Johnson Matthew, Highspec3000), LrEGO and Pt-LrEGO samples with varying Pt loading are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>. Note that the Pt1-LrEGO and Pt5-LrEGO have Pt species in the form of single atoms, while the Pt species in the Pt10-LrEGO present as clusters. The results show that the incorporation of Pt into LrEGO in a form of either single atoms or clusters enhances its HER activity, as the pure LrEGO exhibits negligible current change under the applied voltage of −0.3 V vs RHE. Using the thermodynamic HER potential (H<sup>+</sup>/H<sub>2</sub> = 0 V vs RHE) as a reference, the Pt10-LrEGO and Pt5-LrEGO exhibited small overpotentials of 40.2 and 42.2 mV to drive a cathodic current density of10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup>, respectively, which are comparable to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst (32.2 mV). With the further decrease of Pt loading to ~0.03%, the Pt1-LrEGO shows a large HER overpotential of 157.8 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup>, indicating the lack of active sites on the LrEGO support.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Hydrogen evolution performance of the Pt-LrEGO samples.</title><p><bold>a</bold> LSVs (10 mV s<sup>−1</sup>; after ohmic-drop correction) of the commercial Pt/C (20 wt<sub>Pt</sub>%) and the Pt-LrEGO catalysts prepared by laser irradiation (1064 nm; 7.66 mJ cm<sup>−2</sup>) of the EGO films infused with Pt precursor solutions at different concentrations; the LSVs were recorded in N<sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> at a rotation speed of 1600 rpm; the inset shows the overpotential of samples at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup>. <bold>b</bold> Tafel slopes of the commercial Pt/C and Pt10-LrEGO, Pt5-LrEGO, and Pt1-LrEGO. <bold>c</bold> Mass activities of the commercial Pt/C, Pt-LrEGO, and the literature reported Pt-based SACs at an overpotential 50 mV.

The Pt5-LrEGO<sub>UV</sub> sample shows a slightly increased overpotential of 52.6 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup>, possibly owing to the unevenly reduced LrEGO, which leads to a relatively larger charge-transfer resistance (<italic>R</italic><sub>ct</sub> = 14.2 Ω at an overpotential of 30 mV, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S11</xref>). Chronopotentiometric test at 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> has been performed to evaluate the HER durability of Pt5-LrEGO samples. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>, the Pt5-LrEGO-11.49 maintains a stable HER performance with a slight increase of overpotential by 39 mV after the 10 h testing. Nevertheless, the HER activity of Pt5-LrEGO-7.66 and Pt5-LrEGO-3.83 degrade remarkably after 10 h with a final potential of −0.1 and −0.13 V vs RHE to drive 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> current density, indicating the Pt5-LrEGO HER durability increased with increasing laser fluence. STEM images acquired from the Pt5-LrEGO samples after the durability test are shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S12</xref>. By comparing Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S8c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S12a, b</xref>, there is only a slight increase in Pt size due to aggregation for the Pt5-LrEGO-11.49 after the durability test. This result implies a better durability of Pt5-LrEGO-11.49 SAC in the HER. In contrast, the Pt atoms coalesced into clusters and larger particles in Pt5-LrEGO<sub>UV</sub>, Pt5-LrEGO-3.83, and Pt5-LrEGO-7.66 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S12c–h</xref>).

Therefore, graphene substrate with less structural defects and better mechanical property is expected to exhibit superior stability during the HER test. According to the Raman results mentioned above, the resultant LrEGO shows fewer structural defects at higher laser fluences. Therefore, LrEGO obtained at a higher fluence can bear the hydrogen evolution perturbation well. This is in good coincidence with the stability test mentioned above. In addition, high-temperature treatment (&gt;1173 K) can facilitate the stability of single atoms through a strong atom–substrate interaction, which potentially inhibits the migration and detachment of anchored atoms during HER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par34">In summary, for the first time, we have developed a rapid, versatile, solid-phase laser manufacturing technique for synthesizing graphene-supported Pt SACs.

The pronounced photothermal effect of the 1064-nm laser irradiation in combination with fast scanning enables a high processing temperature (up to 1692.2 K) with a short heating time (~1 ms) and a rapid quenching time of ~108 ms, which not only guarantee the through-thickness thermal reduction of both EGO and Pt ions but also prevents the migration of metal atoms. We also demonstrated that the Pt-LrEGO exhibits promising activity and high Pt utilization in HER with an overpotential of 42.3 mV at 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> and mass activity of 12.36 mA/µg<sub>Pt</sub> at 50 mV.
