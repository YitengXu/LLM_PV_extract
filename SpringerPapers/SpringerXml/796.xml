Other approaches focus on chemical screening to adjust culture conditions or culture media. We report for the first time the physiological changes of algal cells in response to a novel form of mechanical stimulation, or a pulsed wave at the frequency of 1.5 MHz and the duty cycle of 20%. We studied how the pulsed wave can further increase algal lipid production on top of existing biological and chemical methods. Two commonly used algal strains, fresh-water <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> and seawater <italic>Tetraselmis chuii</italic>, were selected. We have performed the tests in shake flasks and 1 L spinner-flask bioreactors. Conventional Gravimetric measurements show that up to 20% increase for algal lipid could be achieved after 8 days of stimulation. The total electricity cost needed for the stimulations in a one-liter bioreactor is only one-tenth of a US penny. Gas liquid chromatography shows that the fatty acid composition remains unchanged after pulsed-wave stimulation. Scanning electron microscope results also suggest that pulsed wave stimulation induces shear stress and thus increases algal lipid production.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>7223</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>10</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2017_Article_BFsrep42003.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>24</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Oleaginous plants, often food crops, store large amounts of lipids in seeds and provide energy for plant growth during germination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. However, to produce biofuel on a commercial scale, a controversial “food vs. fuel” issue arises. The United States Department of Energy launched the Aquatic Species Program (ASP) in 1978 to develop renewable fuel for transportation. The program focused on producing biodiesel fuel from algae and reached the following conclusions regarding the impact of algae on resources:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par3">Microalgae produce lipids with high efficiency – achieving yields up to 80% of the dry biomass using a photosynthetic mechanism for CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par4">Microalgae absorb greenhouse gases responsible for climate change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.

Wastewater contains organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphate, which support the growth of many species of microalgae in heterotrophic or mixotrophic growth conditions. Microalgae can use wastewater as its growth medium and the production of algal oils is biodegradable and non-toxic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Algal consumption of organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphate salts decreases the biological oxygen demand (BOD) in wastewater and thus makes biodiesel fuel production from algae economically feasible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory recently reported that crude algae oil was converted into aviation fuel, gasoline or diesel fuel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Various studies conclude that microalgae hold great potential as the next generation sustainable source of renewable energy for the next 10 to 15 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> with appropriate fuel grade algae growth. Recent drop in oil prices poses a short-term challenge for biofuel production, by rendering the production price of biodiesel more expensive than oil price on the market. While this trend may be temporary, biofuel production will still need federal support to make sure the industry survives at times when oil prices drop significantly. According to the implementation and finalization of the “Clean Power Plan” drafted by United States Environmental Protection Agency in August 2015, support for renewable energy becomes a global strategy in order to cut down green gas emissions.</p><p id="Par7">Microalgae can grow in phototrophic, heterotrophic, or mixotrophic conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In phototrophic growth conditions, carbon arising from greenhouse gases (CO<sub>2</sub>) is present in cells. Microalgae efficiently convert CO<sub>2</sub> into algal oil, a precursor to biodiesel fuel. One hundred tons of algae can capture 180 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> by photosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Phototrophic growth is an elegant conversion pathway, but it is not economically feasible for commercialization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Industries generally favor heterotrophic growth conditions due to the faster production of cell biomass and oil content. For instance, the heterotrophic growth of <italic>Chlorella protothecoides</italic> can accumulate lipid concentrations as high as 55% of the cell dry mass after 144 hours of cultivation with a feedstock of corn powder hydrolysate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Mixotrophic growth conditions have been reported to be even better than heterotrophic growth alone in terms of biomass productivity as well as algal oil content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">Microalgae are not naturally adapted to biofuel production. Its function involves complex regulatory networks and mutual interaction of physiological processes and organelles. To identify the optimal strategy to increase algal oil production, a systems biology approach, in particular <italic>in silico</italic> model, was used to identify genetic and physiological modification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Molecular toolkits were also used to prepare various algal strains most suitable for lipid production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In addition, methods to improve light absorption and photo-synthetic efficiency and to improve carbon fixation were reported in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, respectively. Because microalgae involve complex lipid metabolism, different metabolic engineering approaches were proposed to improve lipid production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par9">Microalgae do not directly produce biofuel, but they produce lipids, such as triacyl-, diacyl- and monoacyl-glycerols, which can be transformed in methanol esters to be used as biofuel. Despite improvements in optimizing microalgal growth, the price of biofuel is approximately 1.5 to 2 times higher than that of conventional fossil fuel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The search for growth conditions (nutrition, temperature, oxygen level) that maximize algal biomass productivity and oil storage continues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Stress responses of lipid metabolism in the oleaginous microalgae have drawn increasing research attention.

The growth of <italic>Nannochloropsis</italic> in nitrogen-replete media under a high light condition triggered a rapid acclimation of the microalgae to the high light stress in a salinity-dependent manner associated with a moderate decrease in eicosapentaenoic acid proportion of total fatty acid.

Although lipid content measurements based on the conventional <italic>Gravimetric</italic> extraction to determine lipid content have been widely used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, such a method requires 24 hours of sample preparation, and therefore unsuitable for real-time monitoring. Lipid staining with fluorescent dyes has previously been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> as a method widely used to screen microalgae species in both fresh water and brackish water for their potential to accumulate lipids. For instance, fluorescent lipid probes, like Nile Red, coupled with the flow cytometry technique have been successfully used to stain cell lipids in order to qualitatively select the most lipid productive cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Because these cells were used for culturing after selection, cell viability was important after staining. Studies to improve staining efficiency using Nile Red dye without damaging cells have been published recently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. The research shows that the use of carriers can achieve better dye penetration into algae cells while keeping them alive. Cell viability, however, is not important for lipid accumulation measurements. Accuracy, repeatability and easy staining protocol as well as small sample culture volume are more important criteria. Although a new dye BODIPY has recently been suggested as an alternative lipid staining method for algal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, its full potential for lipid quantification has not been fully explored. In this article, we suggest a new lipid staining method. Both BODIPY and Nile Red dyes were used for lipid staining in order to select an appropriate dye that meets the needs of real-time lipid content measurements while yielding more reliable results. We have used lipid droplets in emulsion as the model system to evaluate the two dyes. While the size of lipid droplets varies much in the cells, in the emulsion we can create a system with lipid particles of known size and see how fluorescence reflects the increase of lipid content. Particles were made using linolenic acid, one of the natural lipids accumulated in algae (e.g. <italic>C. vulgaris</italic>) cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. To allow for easy staining and also avoid interference from confounding factors, such as how different staining protocols can affect the accuracy of results, only a thin PVA shell was used to cover lipid particles. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7(e)</xref> shows a schematic diagram of the oil particle structure used as a model system for dye selection, where the oil content in the core of the particles (inside the PVA shell) increases from left to right. The staining procedure was similar to that for algae staining except that (i) particles did not require any carrier for the dye; and (ii) neither sonication nor heating was needed for the dye to penetrate the PVA shell and to stain the lipids. The procedure was fast and simple. Particles of different sizes within a range of 2.85 μm to 3.85 μm were obtained using different speeds of the homogenizer to form an emulsion (the higher the speed, the smaller the size of the droplets in the emulsion). Emulsions prepared in such a way yielded a narrow size distribution of lipid particles as measured using DLS. The data show that the size difference of the lipid droplets in different emulsion samples (obtained by different emulsification speeds) was within a range of 1 μm. Such a size difference can naturally occur in algae cells, when lipid content increases during the growth cycle. The size variation also provides an opportunity to evaluate sensitivity of our screening method.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Confocal laser scanning microscopy images: (<bold>a,c</bold>) <italic>C. vulgaris</italic> cells with lipids stained by (<bold>a</bold>) BODIPY staining, (<bold>c</bold>) Nile red staining.

The experimental results showed that larger sized particles correlated to higher lipid content, indicated by higher fluorescence intensity after staining. These results were consistent with our expectation. The size of oil droplets in our emulsions was close to the size of lipid droplets in the algae cells. This can be seen on the confocal images of both stained particles and stained cells using either BODIPY or Nile Red dyes (shown in <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7(a–d)</xref>). The size of oil particles was similar with the size of the lipids in the algae <italic>C. vulgaris</italic> cells at the end of their growth cycle. 10,000 particles were used in flow cytometry measurement to reduce statistical deviation. The flow cytometry machine counts the number of particles and measures their fluorescence, analogous to measurements performed on cells. Flow cytometry histogram plots of stained algae cell and stained oil particles are shown in <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8(a,b)</xref>, respectively. Along the Y-axis (HSSC-H) is the side-scattered light, which is proportional to the internal complexity. Along the X-axis (FSC) is forward scattered light, which is proportional to the size or the surface of cells or particles. These two histogram plots look very similar except that particle size distribution is narrower than that of algae cells. Therefore, our model system with emulsions could be used for selecting the more accurate dye for lipid content measurement (BODIPY vs. Nile Red). When the emulsions were used for calibration, repeatable and stable results were obtained by using BODIPY dye, while the Nile Red dye produced deviations too great to be used (refer to <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8(c,d)</xref>).<fig id="Fig8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Flow cytometry measurements of stained algae cells <bold>(a)</bold> and stained oil particles <bold>(b)</bold>, showing similar FACS histograms for both cases. 10,000 particles were used to reduce statistical deviation.

Therefore, BODIPY staining coupled with flow cytometry allowed quantitative measurement of the difference between samples. However, fluorescence measurements with Nile Red had poor stability and could not be used quantitatively because some measurements showed lipid content increase up to 75% or more between samples, which could not be true according to our extraction measurements. Although the Nile Red dye was extensively used for lipid staining<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, in our case better repeatability and more accurate results were obtained using the BODIPY dye.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par41">With the selection of the best algal strain for lipid accumulation or improvement of media, the pulsed ultrasound stimulation is a complementary physical method to induce physiological changes of algae cells. In this study, a pulsed wave stimulation technology was designed to increase efficiency and reduce cost of lipid production by microalgae. Both freshwater algae <italic>C. vulgaris</italic> and seawater algae <italic>T. chuii</italic> were studied. Pulsed wave stimulation was shown to yield an increase in lipid content up to 20%, which makes the technology very attractive. A contribution of this paper is proposing emulsion preparation techniques for creating a set of flow cytometry standards for lipid measurement. The tests of two different fluorophores on polymer particles showed that BODIPY could provide better accuracy of measurements compared to Nile Red dye. Because this fluorescent staining method for monitoring daily lipid accumulation requires only small volumes of culture sample, it is ideal for research labs or manufacturers to assess the increase of algal lipids and to optimize culturing conditions. We are developing a pulsed wave stimulation embedded in large-scale systems, such as open ponds, raceways, and photo-bioreactors, for microalgae biomass production.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Additional Information</title><p id="Par42"><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Savchenko, O. <italic>et al</italic>.
