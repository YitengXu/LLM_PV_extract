Distributed energy storage control is classified into automatic voltage regulator and load frequency control according to corresponding functionalities. These control strategies maintain a power balance between generation and demand. Besides, three basic electric vehicle charging technologies can be distinguished, i.e. stationary, quasi-dynamic and dynamic control. For realizing charge-sustaining operation at minimum cost quasi-dynamic and dynamic strategies are adopted for in-route charging, while stationary control can only be utilized when the electric vehicle is in stationary mode. Moreover, power system frequency stability and stabilization techniques in non-synchronous generator systems are reviewed in the paper. Specifically, a synchronverter can damp power system oscillations and ensure stability by providing virtual inertia. Furthermore, it is crucial to manage the massive information and ensure its security in the smart grid. Therefore, several attack detection and mitigation schemes against cyber-attacks are further presented to achieve reliable, resilient, and stable operation of the cyber-physical power system. Thus, bidirectional electrical power flows with two-way digital control and communication capabilities have poised the energy producers and utilities to restructure the conventional power system into a robust smart distribution grid. These new functionalities and applications provide a pathway for clean energy technology. Finally, future research trends on smart grids such as IoT-based communication infrastructure, distributed demand-response with artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions, and synchrophasor-based wide-area monitoring protection and control (WAMPC) are examined in the present study.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Aarhus University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>King Abdulaziz University</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004054</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Portfolio</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>17248</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>17</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2021_Article_96769.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">An electricity network that uses digital technology to monitor and manage the energy flows automatically from generating sources to electricity demand is termed as smart grid. This modernized electrical grid employs intelligent monitoring, control, communication, and self-healing technologies to minimize the costs and environmental impacts while maximizing system resilience, security, efficiency, reliability, flexibility, and stability. The smart grid enables active participation by consumers in demand response applications and provides higher power quality. It can accommodate all generations as well as storage systems and operate resiliently against physical and cyber-attacks. Recent advances in the smart grid have facilitated a smart and secure distribution network that requires some features illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Recent advances in smart grid.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2021_96769_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par3">Energy storage system such as pumped storage hydro (PSH), compressed air energy storage (CAES), flywheels, supercapacitors, superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES), fuel cell, lead-acid batteries, sodium-based batteries, Li-Ion batteries, flow batteries, and zinc-based batteries utilized in distribution network offers voltage support, peak shaving, power quality improvement, spinning reserve, capacity firming, load leveling and frequency regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Compared with the performance, safety and degradation of electrical energy storage systems, Li-ion batteries are the most widely deployed in the power system. Concerning the cost-effective approach to large-scale electric energy storage, smart grid technologies play a vital role in minimizing reliance on energy storage system (ESS) and adjusting the electricity demand. When designing a cost-effective storage system, it is essential to consider all possible factors such as discharge time, storage density, and storage capacity. However, the location of ESS is becoming a common trend in smart grid research. Recent evidence suggests that the energy storage system co-located with photovoltaics (PV) produces the provision of ancillary services, energy shifting, reducing energy curtailment, smoothing generation output, and cost-saving<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">In the modern age, many advanced technologies have been employed to integrate large-scale Electric Vehicles (EVs) with the power grid. Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology facilitates the interaction between the power grid and EV to ensure the reliability and sustainability of the power grid. Moreover, the V2G concept provides ancillary services such as voltage and frequency regulation and spinning reserve to the power grid. However, the EV charging system design for reliable power supply is crucial for EV demands. Recent evidence suggests that the flexible operation of the EV charger can interact with smart homes, microgrid, and power distribution grid. This mobile energy storage technology with aggregators provides opportunities for the next revolution in the electrical power grid for the benefit of energy consumers and power utilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Regarding measurement and sensing technologies, advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) including smart meters with the associated information and communication technology (ICT), power quality management (PQM), outage management system (OMS), peak load management (PLM), distributed generation (DG), Microgrids, Smart Home Solution (SHS), and Smart Analytics (SA) incorporated on existing distribution system evolve the power infrastructure <italic>smarter</italic>. Sensing and measurement technologies enable the transformation of data into information. It evaluates the equipmentâs health, grid integrity, and support advanced protective relaying. AMI facilitates monitoring and control through smart meters installed at consumer premises. It supports bidirectional communication between consumer and utility control centers. The advanced functionalities of AMI include accurate load characterization, real-time electricity pricing, and outage detection/restoration. The smart meter records the production and consumption of electricity at regular intervals, whereas the net meter only records the surplus power generation. Smart meters facilitate the record of electricity usage information, remote connect/disconnect switch, and Home Automation Network (HAN) gateway. It also enables Time of Use (TOU) and Real-Time Pricing (RTP) rate metering for Demand Side Management (DSM). The benefits of smart energy infrastructure are improved reliability, supply integration, shorter outages, increased efficiency, consumer cost-saving, and customer satisfaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Besides, an integrated network monitoring system provides a complete view of the systemâs health and faults as well as performance data from different network elements. This monitoring system optimizes the network resources for the network planning process to improve performance and quality of service. Expedited smart grid network diagnostics and decreased network operating costs are other benefits of network monitoring system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Communication enabled smart grid applications.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2021_96769_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par6">As far as communication is concerned, information and communication technologies enable the existing power grid to turn into the smart grid through information and data exchange. The communication-enabled smart grid applications are presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Utility commands delivered to the customers through smart meters is known as Direct Load Control (DLC). Sensor web services for energy management enable users to learn the energy consumption of their appliances, load shedding for the utilities, and monitor and control the stored energy as well as energy exported to the grid. For energy saving, the residential gateway can turn-off the appliances based on the threshold when they are in standby mode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">In the case of Demand Response (DR), consumers will be compensated for detaching their load during peak demand using their smart meters and Home Energy Management systems (HEMS). The energy management units and appliances communicate wirelessly over the wireless sensor network (WSN). However, WSN in the smart grid has few challenges such as resource constraints, severe environmental conditions, packet errors, variable link capacity, and reliability as well as latency requirements. Besides, transferring the data and power through the same conductor is known as power line communication. The combination of wireless and power line communication technologies is termed as an iPower. It implements an intelligent and personalized energy conservation system by WSN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Apart from that, Machine-to-machine (M2M) communications based demand management provides load shedding capabilities to utilities during critical peaks and enables remote access to appliance energy consumption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Furthermore, electric vehicle demand management controls its charging and discharging profile based on the solar power generation unit and the demands of smart appliances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">Concerning the cybersecurity in power systems, the new communication mechanism should consider security and reliability. Several research works have been published in recent years on unauthorized access, hardware as well as software from attacks, protection of the networks, and rejection of services. Besides, a cybersecurity framework is established for securing Industrial Control Systems (ICS) to support the reliable operation of the grid to ensure secure power delivery. This security process includes identifying infrastructure, assessing threats/vulnerabilities/ risks, implementing security controls, verifying the implementation of security controls, and ensuring compliance to audit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The international security standard for power control systems specifies the security requirement for generation, transmission, distribution, and trading of electric power<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Besides, the primary goal of the smart grid is to deploy large-scale distributed energy resources (DERs) with power electronic interface, microgrids, and wide-area monitoring, protection, and control (WAMPAC) in a distributed and networked manner. The real-time WAMPAC can facilitate the economic operation of the system, analyze system vulnerabilities, ensure acceptable power quality to consumers, take preventive as well as corrective control actions, and ensure supply-demand balancing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par9">Some reviews of smart grid advancements have been published in the recent literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.

For instance, the present investigation will entice new market participants, enabling a variety of new load management, distributed generation, energy storage, and demand-response options and opportunities. Moreover, the current study enables grid operators to see further into the system and allows them the flexibility to better manage the intermittency of renewables.

The integration of MW scale solar energy in distribution power grids, using an energy storage system, will transform a weak distribution network into a smart distribution grid. In this regard, more research is required for voltage control. To enhance the flexibility of distributed generations and provide ancillary services, active distribution networks are also necessary for transmission network support. Smart grid technologies are evolved for voltage control in DNs to achieve the best services. However, a reliable and robust system operation will be the main research challenges. Some studies suggest that optimization-based techniques are one of the most attractive control schemes to obtain loss minimization and voltage regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Renewable power generation and load uncertainties, and network disturbance are main concern that affects the network voltages. Therefore, further research is essential to regulate network voltages using smart grid technologies in DNs with real-time measurements. Managing the reactive power exchange between transmission and distribution networks by utilizing DG units is a potential concern for future research. Few studies have analyzed the causes of DGs on maximizing the reactive power output. However, these methods fail to meet the requirement at point of common coupling (PCC) when more than one network is integrated. Recently, there has been extensive research on transmission network support by DNs, either maintaining the voltage at PCC or reactive power exchange between transmission and distribution network within a specified range<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Future studies should focus on a centralized real-time short-term voltage control strategy for DNs. This work can be extended to investigate the interaction between DNs with high voltage network during transient and steady-state conditions. The development of robust, reliable, and cost-effective technology to each energy source is yet another prominent research topic.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Planning and operation of energy storage in DSO grid</title><p id="Par12">The traditional Distribution Network Service Provider (DNSP) is required to evolve into a flexible Distribution System Operator (DSO) for emerging smart grids in which generators, consumers, and network elements have actively managed to accomplish technical, environmental, and economic objectives. In general, there are certain technologies that may not be possible for network operators to manage storage, distributed production, etc. However, the Hungarian Energy and Public Utility Regulatory Authority had granted a possibility for distribution system operators (DSO) to install, operate, and control the electric energy storage systems to optimize power distribution using the least cost principle for PV based power networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. For a better operation of the distribution system, information exchange is essential between the DSO and the customers. Binary Controlled Step Position Information (BSC) controller is an essential component of the battery management system (BMS). The control objectives of BSC control are to operate the energy storage inverter (ESI) within the specified limits, control ancillary equipment, and communicate with top-level management. The establishment between the control center and the substations can transform the passive low voltage distribution network into an active smart distribution grid.</p><p id="Par13">In reviewing the literature, the voltage control module utilizes either hysteresis-based or internal model control (IMC). In hysteresis-based voltage control, as proportional control, does not use a network model, and the control parameters must be chosen very carefully to reduce oscillations. IMC-based voltage control, as an integral control, uses a network model that is characterized by the droop parameter. Droop values can be ascertained by experimental methods. However, small-signal modeling and stability issues of the complex network is a very challenging research task. The connection point voltage varies due to unknown disturbances. To establish a stable PCC voltage, the controller determines the required active power using desired and measured voltages. The power signal then passes through the power controller. This power control module protects the battery energy storage system (BESS) and controls the ESI. To summarize the network level control, the IMC based control significantly reduces voltage fluctuations of the affected feeders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Although BESS fulfilled the requirements, further modifications are needed in the control concept to obtain the best results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Distributed energy storage systems in wildfire events</title><p id="Par14">Recently, wildfire events increase the risk of electricity grid damage resulting in blackouts.</p><p id="Par15">Exploring solutions for providing continuous power supply to consumers under wildfires is a very active field of research.

The flammability and explosive characteristics of MW battery storage is a research concern regarding the deployment of battery storage technologies. Of particular concern are fire and explosion hazards in fuel cell technology. Lack of large scale energy storage capacity in energy storage technologies is another potential concern.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Battery energy storage system in damping control</title><p id="Par20">Maintaining the power system frequency within a specified range is a primary objective of power system planning and operation. Several studies have reported that increasing DER in power distribution networks causes insufficient system inertia, which leads to grid instability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Alternatively, some BESS have designed and operated using advanced control concepts to ensure the output power is proportional to system frequency. BESS with appropriate grid-supportive inverters evolved nowadays for enhancing recovery of power system frequency following a disturbance and thus increases grid stability.

Among these strategies, synchrophasor technology is one of the most successful methods for data acquisition, transmitting, and processing. It consists of phasor measurement units (PMUs) in the field and phasor data concentrator (PDC). PMUs can provide voltage and current measurements with high resolution/speed at a specific location on the power grid.

As a result, the electrical power network is more resilient. Future research should focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning-based real-time ARS for data authentication. Finally, future trends on the modernization of the electric power system are briefly discussed. Smart and secure grid-supportive EV Charging Infrastructure, reconfigurable distribution networks with or without DER integration, the resiliency capability of the power electronic system have become the mainstream trends. In addition, grid stability, cyber-security, power quality, power management, and cost-effectiveness on the entire value chain are still the main topics in the future research of smart power networks.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>All authors contributed equally.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>The study was funded by Aarhus University and King Abdulaziz  University.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement"><sec id="FPar1" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare no competing interests.</p></sec></sec><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>MajeedButt</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>Zulqarnain</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>MajeedButt</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Recent advancement in smart grid technology: Future prospects in the electrical power network</article-title><source>Ain Shams Eng.
