We use our self-constructed systems to conduct field measurements for up to half a year under various environmental conditions. According to the acquired results, it was surprising to know that in the area other than the focusing area, the so-called light leakage region, there always bears illuminance of about 20,000–40,000 lx whether it is a sunny day or a cloudy day with different cloud conditions. Such an interesting result is caused by the light scattering of the clouds and the inherent leakage characteristic of a Fresnel lens. To prove this important finding, we simulated the illuminance of the Fresnel lens structure used in the measurement with apertures of different sizes to determine the detected area. In the laboratory, the diffuse plates were used to mimic the situation of varying cloud layer thicknesses. The trend of calculated and measured results fitted well with the field measurements. Also, the experimental and simulation results show that the round angle and draft facet of the Fresnel lens were responsible for light leakage. This finding prompted us to propose a hybrid high-concentration solar module in which more cost-effective polycrystalline silicon solar cells are placed around the high-efficiency wafer of HCPV to capture the dissipated light leakage and convert it into usable electricity.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science and Technology

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Among the 17 interlinked global sustainable development goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015, affordable and clean energy is an essential indicator of a better, more sustainable future for all. Therefore, for clean and sustainable energy generation, researchers use various natural resources to obtain so-called green energy, including wind energy, geothermal energy, hydroelectricity, tidal power, solar energy, etc. Among these, solar photovoltaics are less limited by terrain or location and are an energy source that can be obtained almost anywhere in the world<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Therefore, effectively converting the light energy from the sun into electrical energy that can be easily used has always been the ultimate goal of the development of human life. Solar cell panels made from semiconductor materials are recognized as the most economical manufactured solar power generation device. Over the past few decades, this device has become widely exploited to generate electricity from the sun rays. They can be found on the roofs of public buildings and individual homes worldwide. Generally, the materials used in semiconductor-based solar panels are polycrystalline silicon or III–V and II–VI compound semiconductors, while their photo conversion efficiencies are 15% and 45%, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Regarding the product price, the cost of solar panels made with III-V or II-VI compound semiconductors is much higher than that of polysilicon solar panels. However, for efficiency considerations, III-V or II-VI semiconductors are still used for solar panels in solar power plants. They are used in accompanying sun-tracking systems to improve power generation efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Moreover, we can configure an optical lens above the compound semiconductor-based solar panel to effectively focus the nearly parallel incident sunlight on a limited area of such high-cost solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Solar cell modules with this configuration are called high-concentration photovoltaic (HCPV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, meaning that through the design and use of optical elements, most of the solar energy can be collected on a small-size solar wafer. In this way, not only can high-performance compound semiconductor materials be fully utilized for solar cell power supply, but also the cost can be greatly reduced due to the reduction of materials used.</p><p id="Par3">In the HCPV systems, the direction of sunlight on the lens is closely related to the amount of solar energy that can be collected by the solar cell, so we need to use a time-varying sun-tracking system to obtain the highest conversion efficiency. Therefore, the structure of the focusing lens also requires a particular design. In addition to the proper focusing distance, we aim to increase the number of focusing lenses per unit area and reduce the weight of the lens itself as much as possible. Conventional focusing lenses are generally challenging to design because of the acceptable focal length and the corresponding lens size, making it difficult to achieve these optimal requirements simultaneously, which in turn makes the price of the sun-chasing system higher. An effective way to solve this problem is to use a Fresnel lens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Xie and Sierra et al. studied the application of the Fresnel lens in high solar energy concentration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Chen and Yamada et al. proposed the Fresnel lens design to improve the distribution of illuminance uniformity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, but they didn’t consider the issue of light leakage of the Fresnel lens and power generation efficiency under heavy-cloud weather conditions. Although the HCPV system combined with the Fresnel lens effectively utilizes the energy of sunlight, as the clouds in the sky change, the Fresnel lens cannot effectively gather the rays from the sun, resulting in a decrease in HCPV power generation efficiency. This paper presents a novel discovery of light leakage in an HCPV, that could maintain a certain level of illuminance under different cloud conditions, and proposes a hybrid light collection system appropriate to different weather conditions, and the power generation efficiency stays optimal. New technical findings will be demonstrated through field measurement under various cloud conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>The light leakage by the Fresnel lens</title><p id="Par4">A Fresnel lens is a type of composite compact lens, and the structural design is schematically shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, allowing the construction of lenses of large aperture and short focal length without the mass and volume of material that would be required by a conventional lens design<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Therefore, a Fresnel lens can be made much thinner than a conventional lens. Fresnel lenses are designed to significantly reduce the weight of the lens so that it can meet the requirements of a sun-tracking system. However, unlike conventional lenses, non-smooth and non-continuous lens surfaces distributed in multiple segments may cause inevitable significant light leakage due to manufacturing errors such as the radii of curvature and draft angles of the fabricated Fresnel lenses, as indicated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b. Subtle changes in these structures may make part of the parallel incident sunlight unable to be effectively focused into the energy harvesting range in the solar cell module through the Fresnel lens, resulting in decreased power generation efficiency. We used a Fresnel lens for simulation calculation with Advanced System Analysis Program (ASAP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, where the radius of curvature of the round angles (RVRA) and draft angles were around 0.1 mm and 1°, respectively. The width of the Fresnel lens was 129 mm and the thickness is 1.81 mm. The simulation calculation results are presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c by Monte Carlo ray tracing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, where the total simulation ray number was 10,000,000. When using the Fresnel lens as the focusing lens of HCPV, although most of the incident beams can be effectively concentrated into the focus area, which may be equivalent to the energy collection area, still part of the light energy is dissipated out of the energy collection region. The size of the focusing area in the simulation was about 1.1 mm × 1.1 mm, the power ratio of focus was 63%, and the light leakage ratio outside the focusing area was 37%.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figures 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic diagram of the Fresnel lens structure and the simulated beam propagation.

So, when a cloud layer passes through the sunlight and the solar modules, the sun rays are multiply scattered by the water molecules inside the cloud, causing the change of the traveling direction of the light entering the solar module, which was nearly parallel. The change in the direction of sunlight travel is related to the thickness of the clouds. When the cloud thickness is thin, most of the sunlight's forward direction is not affected, so the sunlight can still be concentrated on the solar cell modules. However, when the thickness of the cloud layer increases to a certain thickness, the sun rays passing through the cloud layer collide with water molecules randomly, resulting in a random scattering path. Thus the sunlight is no longer collimated when it reaches the Fresnel lens, and therefore cannot be efficiently concentrated on the solar cell with a lens, and results in a decrease of illuminance on the solar cell. In this case, if an III-V semiconductor-based solar cell is used, the HCPV has almost no power conversion efficiency due to its small light-harvesting area.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Characterization of Fresnel lenses in light leakage</title><p id="Par6">To effectively obtain the dissipated light energy which is due to the use of Fresnel lenses and make high-efficiency solar cell modules that can be used in various weather conditions, this research work first calculated and measured the light energy in the light leakage area of Fresnel lenses with different structures under monochromatic light irradiation. Next, we used diffuse plates with varying penetration rates to mimic the outdoor conditions of different cloud layer thicknesses and measured the lateral light intensity distribution on the solar cell module. Finally, summarizing the results of outdoor field measurements, we propose a hybrid solar high-concentration photovoltaic module, expecting that such a system can combine the advantages of HCPV and polycrystalline-silicon-based solar panels simultaneously and achieve comparable power conversion efficiency under different weather conditions.</p><p id="Par7">As far as the structure of the Fresnel lens is concerned, neither the draft facet nor the RVRA caused by mold manufacturing can make the incident light converge on the same focal area. Therefore, a light leakage area is formed in the HCPV cell module. The draft facet is a side effect of the lens thinning process. The more the draft facet, the thinner the Fresnel lens. Another thing that occurs along with the draft facet is the round angle. The round angle is generated due to the large angle turning in the structure of the Fresnel lens. Similarly, the round angle structure cannot concentrate the sunlight in the central region. In the fabrication process of the Fresnel lens, a draft angle of at least 1° is required during the demolding process. The round angle usually has a radius of curvature of hundreds of microns or more. These factors can make the light concentration situation even worse. We can estimate its influence on light concentration according to the area ratio of the draft facet structure and the round angle in the Fresnel lens structure. The light leakage L caused by the draft facet and the round angle can be expressed<disp-formula id="Equ1"><label>1</label><alternatives><mml:math display="block" id="Equ1_Math"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>L</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>G</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mn>100</mml:mn><mml:mo>%</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math><tex-math id="Equ1_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

A<sub>G</sub> is the overall projection area of the draft facet, and A<sub>R</sub> is the projection area occupied by the round angle. Therefore, when the Fresnel lens is thinner, the number of segments will increase, so the proportion of light leakage will also increase. To verify the above statement, we used two Fresnel lenses with similar areas for luminous flux measurement, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. In the experiment, a monochromatic laser beam with a central wavelength of 532 nm was exploited to conduct light concentration experiments. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, the laser light passed through first an objective lens and then a large-aperture lens to form the collimated light beam. We used this collimated beam to mimic the characteristics of outdoor sunlight. The two Fresnel lenses are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, respectively, in the light irradiation path. Fresnel lens #1 is a thinner lens with more segments, and Fresnel lens #2 is a thicker lens with fewer segments. In the end, a light detector with a rectangle aperture of 10 mm × 16 mm was located at its focal plane to measure the luminous flux of the focusing spot. The light leakage ratios of the two lenses were measured 43% and 36%, respectively. Since the simulation shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> was for the thicker Fresnel lens #2, we could compare the measurement result with the simulation shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The light leakage of the measurement was 36% when the focusing area was 10 mm × 16 mm. The simulation of the light leakage was 37% when the focusing area was set 1.1 mm × 1.1 mm, which was much smaller than that in the measurement. The difference in the focusing area can be explained as follows. Although the major important optical parameters of the Fresnel lens were set in the simulation, the simulated Fresnel lens was still in an ideal condition. It means that there was no manufacturing error, and the incident light was well-collimated. These two factors were not possible in the experiment. Thus the focusing spot in the experiment could be laterally extended or blurred in comparison with that in an ideal case, such as in the simulation. However, the simulation and the experimental measurement showed that around 36–37% light leakage could be observed outside the focusing area in both the simulation and the experiment. Without a doubt, the leakage mechanism of a Fresnel lens was well proved.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Light leakage measurements of the Fresnel lenses in the lab.

When light waves pass through clouds with considerable thickness, part of the light will collide with water droplets, cause light refraction or reflection, and finally form random light scattering. Therefore, when the light enters a Fresnel lens, it can no longer be regarded as parallel light, while the concentrated beam will not focus on the center point of the HCPV module. To prove this effect, we used the experimental configuration presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and placed different diffusers between the collimating and Fresnel lenses. The three diffusers had different one-shot transmittances, defined as the ratio of the penetrating light flux and the incidence flux of a certain diffuser<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. These diffusers allow different penetration ratios of the collimating beam, which could be used to simulate the influence of clouds on sunlight. The experiment results are summarized in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. In Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, a clear concentrated beam spot could be observed around the center of the detected area, indicating that most of the energy was collected at a limited location. Such a result might be used to mimic the days with a clear sky. From Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b–d, we could observe from the photos that the background patterns became increasingly blurred. At the same time, the intensity in the central area decreased, and the illuminance of the surrounding area was closer and closer to the intensity in the central area. Fresnel lenses #1(blue) and #2 (red) exhibited similar properties.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Lens focusing performance with the use of diffusive glasses to mimic weather at different conditions.

To understand the optical effect affected by the Fresnel lens's structure, we needed to compare the illuminance by the sunlight illumination and by the corresponding simulation. Therefore, we measured the illuminance of the focused sunlight with the Fresnel lens. In the measurements, we chose Fresnel lens #2 for experiments and used a photodetector (Thorlabs PM16-12) that can be utilized at high-power illumination to measure the power of the focal spot point. Since the measurement was done under moving sunlight, and the focusing spot was not an ideal tiny spot, the illuminance related to the aperture size of the photodetector. The result was that precise measurement of the focusing sunlight became difficult. Alternatively, we changed the aperture of the photodetector to collect more data and tried to find the correlation between the illuminance and the aperture size. The measurement results are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, where the vertical axis indicates the illuminance ratio at the focus spot and the ground without a focusing lens. There are three simulation curves. The black curve is the calculated focused illuminance ratio for a conventional lens with the same f-number. The blue and pink curves are obtained using Fresnel lenses with RVRA of 0.2 mm and 0.5 mm, respectively. The slight difference among the three curves was caused by the geometrical structures of the Fresnel lens. The situation of the measurement was different. The moving sunlight made the illuminance measurement through a tiny aperture difficult. Therefore, we decided to change the aperture size and shape (including circle and square). The measurement is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, where the measurement result shows a similar trend of the ratio as a function of the aperture area. Thus, the Fresnel lens simulation helped predict the optical property of sunlight.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Fresnel lens performance measurements under sunlight.

We set up a 2 × 2 Fresnel lens array on a box with two rotation dimensions. The Fresnel lens array can be manually adjusted to face directly toward the sun at any time. During the measurement, different weather conditions occurred as the thickness of the cloud layer changed. Therefore, we could observe at the bottom of the box that the brightness of the light leakage area will vary depending on the change in the cloud thickness. The illuminance of this area was the physical quantity to be measured in this experiment.</p><p id="Par11">During the half-year measurement process, we can roughly divide the weather conditions into three situations according to the thickness of the clouds. The first is a clear sky, that is, there are no clouds when looking at the sky, and the ground illuminance exceeds 100,000 lx. The second is a lightly cloudy sky, that is, the thickness of the cloud layer is thin, and the sun can still be vaguely seen through the cloud layer. On light cloudy days, part of the light is still parallel, so the focus point can still be clearly observed. However, the light intensity at the focal point has been greatly reduced compared with the clear sky. The third is a heavy cloudy sky, that is, the cloud layer is thicker, and the brightness of the whole sky is more uniform. In this kind of weather, it takes work to know the correct position of the sun. That is to say, after the clouds scatter the sunlight, its wavefront is irregularly distributed. At this time, no focus point can be seen at the bottom of the box. After more than six months of measurements, we measured the ground illumination and light leakage under different weather conditions. The measured results and the ratio between the two physical quantities are summarized in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a–c shows the values of the ground illuminance (light-blue bars) and the leakage illuminance (dark-blue bars) for clear sky, lightly cloudy, and heavily cloudy days, respectively. The figure’s red curves record the occupation ratios of light intensity in the light leakage area under a clear sky, lightly cloudy, and heavily cloudy days, which were about 40%, 65%, and 80%, respectively. The experimental results show that the percentage of light leakage under the Fresnel lens was higher when the cloud layer was thicker. The ground illumination value decreased with the increase in cloud thickness, which means that the energy converged by the Fresnel lens at the focus point was also reduced.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Field measurement results under different weather conditions. (<bold>a</bold>) Clear sky, (<bold>b</bold>) light cloud, and (<bold>c</bold>) heavy cloud. Even on cloudy days, the area where the light dissipates can still have nearly 80% of the light due to the presence of the lens. This is quite helpful for developing solar photovoltaic and agro-ecological balance at the same time.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2023_32128_Fig5_HTML.png" id="MO5"/></fig></p><p id="Par12">From the above experimental results, it is important and interesting to find that the illuminance values of the light leakage area show no significant changes even at different cloud thicknesses. This is because the percentage of light leakage is lower when the ground illumination is higher. The ground illuminance value decreases when the cloud thickness increases, but the light leakage percentage rises. So we find that the illuminance of the leakage area will be close to a constant value regardless of the weather conditions. The light leakage of HCPV is caused by two optical phenomena, including the scattering of sunlight by clouds and the leakage of light caused by the structure of the Fresnel lens. This kind of light leakage should be adequately utilized. The first idea is to change the base plate of the conventional HCPV from a metal heat sink to a transparent medium so that light from outside the center can reach the ground. This distribution of sunlight between 20,000 and 40,000 lx should support the growth of some plants on the ground. Therefore, medium-illuminated agricultural activities can be carried out by switching to transparent baseboards. In addition, from a power generation point of view, we can also use low-cost solar panels to lay in the leakage area for power generation, so we designed a power generation installation that combines the advantages of both HCPV and polycrystalline solar panels.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Hybrid photovoltaic device</title><p id="Par13">A hybrid high-concentration photovoltaic system is designed and proposed by placing a high-efficiency III-V solar panel at the focus point and laying a polycrystalline silicon-based solar panel around it, as schematically shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a.

The light leakage from the Fresnel lens structure and the scattered light from the sunlight passing through the clouds can be directed to the polycrystalline silicon-based solar panel (PSSP) for power generation. When the sky is clear, the light is concentrated on the high-efficiency solar cell, so the power generation efficiency is high.

We pointed out that the light leakage is also caused by cloud scattering, which is an unavoidable factor for an HCPV. Then a series of experiments were done with the corresponding calculations to prove the light leakage mechanism, including from the Fresnel lens and the clouds. The corresponding field measurement with the use of a Fresnel lens to focus the sunlight was done for six months for various cloud sky conditions.</p><p id="Par21">According to the acquired results, the most valuable finding was that the solar concentrator based on the Fresnel lens has an illuminance of about 20,000–40,000 lx in the light leakage region, whether it is a sunny day or a cloudy day with different cloud thicknesses. This is an inherent characteristic of HCPV based on the Fresnel lens and the national sunlight characteristics. Such a property could be helpful in solar power factories with agricultural benefits.</p><p id="Par22">This finding prompted us to propose a hybrid high-concentration solar module in which more cost-effective PSSPs are placed around the high-efficiency wafer of HCPV to capture the dissipated light leakage and convert it into usable electricity. Such a system may exhibit extremely high conversion efficiency under different cloud conditions. Under the assumption that the conversion efficiencies are 15% and 45% of the PSSP and III–V compound semiconductors, respectively, the proposed hybrid system could reach 190% and 126% power generation efficiency compared with PSSP and HCPV systems, respectively, in the clear sky. When there are heavy clouds, the HCPV system has almost no power generation efficiency, while the proposed hybrid system can maintain more than 80% of the power generation efficiency of the PSSP system. Thus the proposed novel solar power system is useful for reaching optimal solar power generation under different cloudy skies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The author would like to thank Breault Research Organization (BRO), Inc. for sponsoring the ASAP software program.
