However, addressing sustainable biofuels and bioliquid routes and value chains which can limit or reverse the ILUC (indirect land-use change effect) is of paramount importance. Given this background condition, the present study targets the analysis and modelling a new integrated biomass conversion pathway to produce renewable advanced fuels, enabling the issue of indirect land-use change (ILUC) of biofuels to be tackled. The bioenergy chain under investigation integrates the decentralized production of biogas through anaerobic digestion and its upgrading to biomethane, followed by a centralized conversion to liquid transport fuels, involving methane reforming into syngas, Fischer–Tropsch (FT) synthesis, and methanol synthesis. The methodology adopted in this work stem from extensive literature review of suitable bio/thermo-chemical conversion technologies and their process modelling using a commercial flow-diagram simulation software is carried out. The major significance of the study is to understand the different modelling approaches, to allow the estimation of process yields and mass/energy balances: in such a way, this work aims at providing guidance to process modellers targeting qualitative and quantitative assessments of biomass to biofuels process routes. Beyond FT products, additional process pathways have been also explored, such as MeOH synthesis from captured CO<sub>2</sub> and direct methane to methanol synthesis (DMTM). The analysis demonstrated that it is possible to model such innovative integrated processes through the selected simulation tool. However, research is still needed as regards the DMTM process, where studies about modelling this route through the same tool have not been yet identified in the literature.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Biogas</kwd><kwd>Modelling</kwd><kwd>Biofuels</kwd><kwd>Biomethane</kwd><kwd>Fischer–Tropsch</kwd><kwd>Methanol</kwd><kwd>Conversion</kwd><kwd>BTL</kwd><kwd>Anaerobic digestion</kwd><kwd>Reforming</kwd><kwd>Syngas</kwd><kwd>Upgrading</kwd><kwd>Biomass</kwd><kwd>Aspen plus</kwd><kwd>Process modelling</kwd><kwd>Renewable fuels</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>HORIZON EUROPE Framework Programme</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018693</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">952872</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Testa</surname><given-names>Lorenzo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Politecnico di Torino</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>11</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/13399_2022_Article_3057.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>ReviewPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Renewable and Green Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Renewable and Green Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Biotechnology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction and scope of the work</title><p id="Par59">Nowadays, fossil resources still represent the main global energy source, covering about 80% of the world’s energy consumption. However, their production and use cause severe impacts on the environment, as they release carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (GHG), responsible for global warming and climate change: according to J. G. J. Olivier and J. A. H. W. Peters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], fossil fuel combustion accounts for 89% of all CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and 68% of all GHG emissions.</p><p id="Par60">Climate change is today a well-recognized global concern, and the urgent need to develop and implement alternative processes for sustainable energy generation is promoting research and development worldwide.</p><p id="Par61">At the international level, a major commitment to GHG emission reduction came with the adoption of the COP21 Paris Agreement in 2015, signed by 196 Parties. This binding international treaty marked the beginning of a new global effort in contrast to climate change, setting the aim of limiting global warming to well below 2 °C (possibly 1.5 °C) compared to pre-industrial levels (intended as 1850–1900) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In this context, an unprecedented boost to market deployment of renewable energies is an unavoidable component of a wider climate change fighting strategy.</p><p id="Par62">Along with wind and solar energy, another key solution is the use of biomass to produce transportation fuels (biofuels) replacing conventional fossil fuels, as they provide a renewable carbon-based source, being CO<sub>2</sub> utilized by crops and forests during the natural photosynthesis process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, biofuel production itself could induce other land-related emissions, either directly and/or indirectly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In fact, when biofuels are produced on existing agricultural land and conventional agronomic practices, the demand for food and feed crops might lead to the extension of agricultural land into areas with high-carbon stock such as forests, wetlands, and peatlands, to provide the same amount of feed/food replaced by biofuel production. If and when this happens, it may originate greenhouse gas emissions that will negatively impact on biofuels’ GHG balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and thus on climate. This effect is known as indirect land-use change (ILUC). ILUC is a very complex phenomenon, which accounting requires the understanding of a large number of different factors. It can be anyway contrasted by adopting sustainable agricultural rotations, photosynthetic intensification in agriculture, soil carbon accumulation, improved nitrogen and carbon use efficiency, etc.</p><p id="Par63">The objective of this study is to investigate a novel biomass-to-liquid fuel value chain that has the potential to address the ILUC impact of biofuels. To this aim, the upstream part of the biofuels production chain under consideration refers to the Biogas Done Right (BDR) sustainable model developed by Consorzio Italiano Biogas (CIB), being this a set of agronomic practices that links anaerobic digestion to sustainable farming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] to produce biogas. The scheme, among other elements, involves double cropping, with a primary crop for food or feed and a secondary one through crop rotation for energy production. The model is based on cover cropping, and contributes to improve the soil quality, as it is covered during the entire year, and reduces the use of fossil fertilizers, supporting in that way also the production of the main crop. In fact, BDR contrasts soil erosion and reduces nitrogen emissions, and increases the availability and use of organic fertilizers. By doing so, the BDR model ensures sustainable production of biogas, representing thus a valuable solution to the ILUC issue. Among the many possible applications, the biomethane produced through the BDR model could represent a suitable raw material for the production of sustainable biofuels, making it a good potential substitute to natural gas in several refinery processes and exploiting the natural gas pipeline infrastructure. For this reason, the value chain investigated in this paper employs biomethane as a basis to produce chemical products like Fischer–Tropsch (FT) liquids and methanol (MeOH), which, in this way, turn out to be low-ILUC-risk biofuels. Hence, the identified pathway includes the biogas production and upgrade to biomethane in decentralized farms, and integrated with a centralized biomethane-to-liquid conversion plants as FT-liquid fuels and MeOH. As said, this is approach is possible thanks to the availability of a natural gas infrastructure, where the biomethane produced through a decentralized distributed approach is injected, and the equivalent amount is collected at a centralized biorefinery site where the gas is processed into a liquid.</p><p id="Par64">The natural gas network would thus be used the same way electricity from photovoltaics uses the grid. This represents a very innovative use of renewables in the current context, valorizing the use of existing infrastructures.</p><p id="Par65">In brief, the key process steps of the selected value chain would be as follows: (i) decentralized biomethane production, based on sustainable models as the Biogas Done Right, (ii) injection of biomethane into the natural gas grid, (iii) extraction from the same volume of natural gas form the gas grid, and processing in centralized biomethane-to-liquid conversion plants, through FT synthesis and MeOH synthesis.

The final goal is to provide a complete set of information to study, through modelling, the efficiency, and the techno-economic feasibility of these integrated bio/thermo-chemical processes, allowing to optimize operational conditions, determine limitations, and design the distributed + centralized scheme here proposed. The current work focuses on process modelling, while the techno-economic, potential, and regulatory modelling of distributed biomethane production and centralized conversion to advanced fuels will be the subject of a subsequent research paper.</p><p id="Par67">To our knowledge, no systematic review of studies encompassing all the steps of the selected value chain and their modelling has yet been published.

Conference papers have been also included in the research, for instance Energy Procedia, IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, and papers of the 23rd European Biomass Conference and Exhibition. Thesis works developed within several universities have been also considered, such as Politecnico di Torino, University of Southern Denmark, University of Padua, Chalmers University of Technology, Norwegian University of Science and Technology.</p><p id="Par70">Searches were limited to articles published in the last two decades, written in English, Italian, and German.</p><p id="Par71">As regards the modelling papers, the first step was to choose a simulation software able to simulate all the technologies included in the identified value chain. Currently, there are lots of process modelling software packages available and used in papers in the literature, such as DWSIM, Engineering Equation Solver, COCO Simulator, Engineering Base by AUCOTEC, Aspen Plus, Aspen HYSYS, and GateCycle Software. The software chosen for this analysis is Aspen Plus, being it one of the most used process simulation tools for both industrial and research applications. The search for modelling studies has therefore been restricted to those using the selected commercial software.</p><p id="Par72">After examining the titles, abstracts, and reference lists for related studies, a further screening has been also carried out, using the following inclusion criteria: (i) the application of the technologies in the papers must be similar to those of our study, (ii) clarity in modelling description and details, and (iii) in articles where the overall process is wide and complex, it must be possible to extrapolate the single technology of interest for the present study. Papers including model validation with experimental data were preferred.</p><p id="Par73">The modelling studies collected have been then deeply analysed, focusing on information such as process configuration, modelling assumptions, process yield, and energy consumption of the system.

This complex microbiological path is based on the work of several groups of bacteria and archaea, working in synergy to decompose organic matter into a mixture of CH<sub>4</sub> (53–70% vol), CO<sub>2</sub> (30–50% vol), N<sub>2</sub> (2–6% vol), O<sub>2</sub> (0–5% vol), and lower fractions of H<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>S, and NH<sub>3</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], depending on the type of biomass digested and the process conditions. Substrates could be dedicated crops, agricultural residues, food and household wastes, animal manure, industrial wastes, etc.</p><p id="Par77">The AD process consists in four crucial phases, i.e. hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis. During the hydrolysis step, the complex substrates mainly composed by carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are hydrolyzed into their respective monomers, i.e. glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids. These monomers are then turned into volatile fatty acids (VFA), i.e. valeric, butyric, caproic, iso-valeric, iso-butyric, propionic, and acetic during the acidogenesis, and subsequently converted into acetic acid, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide (acetogenesis). Finally, methanogenesis holds the conversion of these products into methane and carbon dioxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].

These impurities need to be reduced, as they can cause corrosion, are toxic, can cause catalyst deactivation, and reduce gas heating value, but also to meet gas specifications and standards. Additional to the direct use in an engine for power production, in fact, biomethane can be injected into the natural gas grids. Therefore, many countries formulated standards to ensure gas quality before the injection of biomethane into the natural gas grid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In Italy, the biomethane quality for injection is regulated by the Decree of the Ministry for Economic Development of 19th of February 2007, the M/475 Mandate to CEN for standards for biomethane for use in transport and injection in natural gas pipelines, and the technical report UNI/TR 11,537:2019 (updated version of UNI/TR 11,537:2016).</p><p id="Par80">Typically, the purification from contaminants is referred to as “biogas cleaning”, while the CO<sub>2</sub> and steam removal process is called “upgrading” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].

The most widespread and consolidated technologies for biogas upgrading are (i) physical absorption, using water or organic solvents, (ii) chemical absorption, using amine or saline solutions, (iii) pressure swing adsorption (PSA), (iv) membrane separation (MB), or (v) cryogenic upgrading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par82">Physical absorption techniques (i) exploit the different solubility of CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> (and possibly other trace compounds) in the absorbent liquid: raw biogas meets a counter flow of liquid in an absorption column, thus the leaving liquid will contain CO<sub>2</sub> while the remaining gas stream will have an increased concentration of methane. The absorbent medium can be water, i.e. pressurized water scrubbing (PWS) technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], or organic, in organic solvents such as polyethylene glycol, in which CO<sub>2</sub> is more solvent than in water.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] developed a two-stage simulation model: one first step for the hydrolysis phase, and a second one for the other three phases, i.e. acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis. The <italic>Property Method</italic> (a collection of methods and models that the software uses to compute thermodynamic and transport properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]) chosen for the simulation is the non-random two-liquid (NRTL). In line with ADM1, the substrate feed rate is assumed to be made of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, and therefore the introduction of material components is treated accordingly. The feed stream is mixed with H<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O through a mixer and a heat exchanger is employed to model heating of this stream, necessary to maintain the required temperature in the ranges favourable for AD. The hydrolysis step is simulated using a stoichiometric reactor (RSTOIC), in which the reaction kinetics are not considered, but stoichiometry and conversion of a reactant must be specified. Thirteen chemical reactions are considered for this step, and the reaction rates have been calculated by Aspen Plus calculator blocks, using a FORTRAN code. The subsequent AD steps have been simulated in a continuous stirred tank reactor (RCSTR), which requires the reaction kinetics to be known; thus, specifications from ADM1 and comprehensive models have been used, involving more than 33 kinetic reactions. The reaction rates have been calculated through calculator blocks, using a FORTRAN code. The RCSTR reactor releases two streams at outlet: one is the gas stream, which is the biogas and small traces of other gases, and the liquid stream. The gas stream goes through a splitter and then a flash separator, which separates the water from the biogas. Subsequently, the biogas stream passes through a gas filter, which separates the hydrogen component from the produced biogas. On the other hand, the liquid stream goes through a splitter to separate a part of it as recycle and is connected to the feed stream. The model was validated against experimental data in terms of % CH<sub>4</sub> in the produced biogas. Three different feed cases have been tested, i.e. (i) cattle manure, (ii) cow manure, and (iii) wastewater generated from industrial and agricultural activities. Results match the literature data; in detail, the deviation from simulation results and experimental data are 5.4% for the case of cattle manure, 8.54% for the case of cow manure, and 15.83% for the case of wastewater generated from industrial and agricultural activities. In the paper, a sensitivity analysis has also been carried out to study the effect on CH<sub>4</sub> yield in case of introduction of hydrogen in the process. The investigation revealed that, for H<sub>2</sub> feeding rates below a maximum value, there is an increase in methane gas composition in the produced biogas.</p><p id="Par132">The model developed by Rajendran et al.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] developed a model for the PWS process: absorption and stripping columns are modelled as two RADFRAC distillation blocks, which is a column type designed for general vapour-liquid multistage separation. The thermodynamic method used is electrolyte non-random two-liquid (ELECNRTL): absorption of biogas components in water is accounted for by Henry coefficients, while the dissolution of H<sub>2</sub>S and based on a first stage in which biogas is compressed to 12 bar, cooled to 313.15 K and then sent at the bottom of the absorption column, which is also fed from the top with water. The column is operated at 12 bar. Upgraded biogas leaves the column from the top of the column, and impurity-rich sour water leaves from the column bottom. Sour water is then sent to a flash separator (operated at 3 bar) to remove residual CH<sub>4</sub>,and then fed to the stripping column for regeneration at 1 bar, which uses air as a stripping medium. In the reported case study, biogas is fed at 2000 ppm of H<sub>2</sub>S. For better removal of H<sub>2</sub>S, activated carbon impregnated with ZnO is considered, and the resulting cleaned biogas has a composition characterized by less than 10 ppb of H<sub>2</sub>S and NH<sub>3</sub>, 99%, and 79% recovery of CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="Par140">Cozma et al. used an Aspen Plus model to simulate a high-pressure water scrubbing (HPWS) system applied to biogas upgrading in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] studies. The simulation model is characterized by operational conditions based on data taken from the literature (in particular, the work by Götz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]). The model is equilibrium-stage, and the thermodynamic method chosen for the analysis is a non-random two-liquid model with ideal gas and Henry’s law (NRTL); the method has been chosen based on a preliminary study in which the authors compared the performance of different thermodynamic models available in the software to calculate the solubility of the main biogas components (CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>S, N<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>2</sub>) in pure water. The simulation model assumes pressurization at 10 bar and cooling to 293.15 K of the biogas stream (60% vol CH<sub>4</sub>, 38.9% vol CO<sub>2</sub>, 300 ppm vol H<sub>2</sub>S, 0.5% vol N<sub>2</sub>, and 0.5% vol O<sub>2</sub>), which is then sent to the bottom of the absorber, which is also fed with water from the top. The scrubber is a RADFRAC column, working at <italic>T</italic> = 293.15 K, <italic>p</italic> = 10 bar. The number of stages and the absorbent flow rate required to achieve equilibrium have been determined through a preliminary study. The bottom stream (CO<sub>2</sub>-enriched water) is transferred to a flash column, where the pressure is reduced from 10 to 3 bar to minimize methane loss. The gas containing CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>S, N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and water, released from the flash column is mixed with the raw biogas and re-circulated to the inlet of the compressor. After leaving the flash column, the rich solution is sent to the stripper, also modelled as a RADFRAC column, where it meets a counter flow of air. Here, CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>S are released from the water at atmospheric pressure and at a temperature of 293.15 K. Subsequently, the water is recirculated back to the top of the scrubber. Based on these conditions, it was calculated that the gas leaving the absorber contains 96.72% vol CH<sub>4</sub>, 0.937% vol CO<sub>2</sub>, 0.006 ppm vol H<sub>2</sub>S, 1.1% vol N<sub>2</sub>, and 0.976% vol O<sub>2</sub>.

The simulation scheme is similar to those cited above. The <italic>Property Method</italic> chosen is the Predictive Soave–Redlich–Kwong equation of state (SRK). In the simulated process, biogas is compressed to the absorption pressure of 10 bar through a two-stage intercooled compression, and water is removed via condensation. Then, biogas enters a packed column, which also receives a stream of liquid water; here, biogas upgrading occurs, thus a stream containing biomethane and a stream containing water, CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>S, and small amounts of CH<sub>4</sub>. This latter stream is flashed to 3 bar to recover methane; two streams exit the flash: one, containing vapour CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>, is recycled to the second compression stage, while the second one, liquid, is sent to a stripper. An air stream entering the stripper desorbs CO<sub>2</sub> (and H<sub>2</sub>S) from the feed, and the solvent is then re-generated and recirculated to the absorber. The biomethane stream produced in the absorber is then dried: the CH<sub>4</sub> recovery of the process is 99.6%.

For what concerns PWS, there is no water regeneration step, and the biogas is first sent to a three-stage intercooled compression, then to the absorption column. Regarding the MEA chemical scrubbing, the model accounts for an absorption and a regeneration step in backed columns, operating at atmospheric pressure with a solution composed of 15% wt MEA. The MDEA chemical scrubbing case has the same process scheme of the MEA case. Here, absorption is carried out at 2.7 bar, using a 50% wt MDEA solution in water, and the regeneration at atmospheric pressure. All three simulated upgrading processes reach a biomethane purity higher than is 98% vol on a dry basis. For what matters in the PWS case, the upgraded biogas has a molar percentage of CH<sub>4</sub> of 98.86% mol on a dry basis, with a methane recovery to fed biogas of 95.8%. Regarding the MEA case, the upgraded biogas has a molar percentage of CH<sub>4</sub> of 98.71% mol on a dry basis, with a methane recovery to biogas of 99.9%. About the MDEA case, the upgraded biogas has a molar percentage of CH<sub>4</sub> of 98.73% mol on a dry basis, with a methane recovery to fed biogas of 99.98%.</p><p id="Par149">The biogas upgrading technologies of PWS and chemical absorption with alkanolamine solutions have also been simulated in Aspen Plus by Pellegrini et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. In this study, three different biogas compositions have been tested, representing landfill gas, biogas from wastewater treatments, and gas from co-fermentation. The gases considered in these feed streams are CH<sub>4</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>2</sub>. The layout of the water scrubbing process takes as a reference the one developed by Bortoluzzi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. The biogas inlet stream is first compressed to 8 bar and cooled, then purified in a packed absorption column also fed with water. The bottom stream is then sent to a flash chamber and afterwards to a stripping column using air. Compression is here carried out in more steps. In each step separation of water from methane takes place too, using flash separators. The chemical scrubbing has been simulated referring to the process scheme of the study carried out by Gamba et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. The raw biogas is fed to the absorption column (2.7 bar), after being subjected to a single-stage compression and cooling down to 308.15 K. Both the absorption and stripping columns are packed columns (packing: metal Pall rings). The column specifications have been adjusted from the ones used in a previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. In all the case studies, the total flow rate of feed biogas is such that the volumetric flow rate of biomethane leaving the plant is 500 Sm<sup>3</sup>/h, to have a common basis for an economic feasibility comparison.</p><p id="Par150">Similarly, Worawimut et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>] used Aspen Plus to simulate and compare the processes of water scrubbing and chemical scrubbing with diethanolamine (DEA) solution with regeneration and recirculation. The studies by Cozma et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] (PWS) and Niu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>] (chemical absorption) have been taken as references to set process conditions and for results validation. The NRTL property method has been selected and RADFRAC distillation columns without condenser and reboiler have been used to model the absorber and the desorber, both set as equilibrium based. Biogas from swine farm wastes was used in this work, with a composition of 68% vol CH<sub>4</sub>, 24% vol CO<sub>2</sub>, 3000 ppm vol H<sub>2</sub>S, 2% vol N<sub>2</sub>, 0.1% vol O<sub>2</sub> and 5.6% H<sub>2</sub>O. The biogas flow rate of the plant is 1000 kmol/h. Both water scrubbing and chemical scrubbing were simulated to find the absorbent flow rate needed to obtain at least 96% v/v biomethane purity. Total water flow rate of the plant is 16,000 kmol/h, which is the same amount of the total DEA solution flow rate of the plant. The product gas of the PWS process is characterized by a composition of 96.005% vol CH<sub>4</sub>, 0.32% vol CO<sub>2</sub>, &lt;  &lt; 0.001% vol H<sub>2</sub>S, 3.098% vol N<sub>2</sub>, 0.154% vol O<sub>2</sub>, 0.424% vol H<sub>2</sub>O. The methane recovery is 89.96%, while the energy consumption of the process is 11309 kW. The product stream of the chemical absorption with DEA has a composition of: 96.026% vol CH<sub>4</sub>, 0.310% vol CO<sub>2</sub>, &lt;  &lt; 0.001% vol H<sub>2</sub>S, 3.114% vol N<sub>2</sub>, 0.155% vol O<sub>2</sub>, 0.395% vol H<sub>2</sub>O.

The simulation is rate-based, the thermodynamic property method is ELECNTRL, and also here the main blocks of the flowsheet are the absorber and stripper (RADFRAC distillation columns), but no solvent recirculation is included. The cleaned gas then enters 20-stages distillation column, operating at 44.6 bar, where methane gets separated from C-2 to C-3 components. A 99.5% mole recovery of methane is obtained from the process.</p><p id="Par152">Membrane separation technique has been simulated by Scamardella et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].

The model refers to Fick’s law with diffusive model assumptions. In the model, the output of the membrane are two streams, i.e. a CH<sub>4</sub>-rich gaseous stream, a CO<sub>2</sub>-rich gaseous stream, and the off-gas of the process. The resulting biomethane can reach high purity percentages (&gt; 95% vol) for operating pressures higher than 3 bar.</p><p id="Par153">As Aspen Plus is a steady state calculator, no dynamic options are available in the software.

The components obtained are then mixed, to obtain the H<sub>2</sub>/CO ratio required for the downstream utilization. Multistage compressors and valves are also used in the process. The Peng-Robinson with Boston Mathias function method was selected for the simulation. As a result, about 80% of the CO<sub>2</sub> and 95% of CH<sub>4</sub> fed in the PSA system were sequestrated.</p><p id="Par155">Similarly, Ortiz et al.

The obtained gas streams are then mixed to obtain the H<sub>2</sub>/CO ratio required for downstream utilization. Distillation columns for purification and valves for depressurization are involved in the process. NRTL property method has been selected.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] simulated dry reforming and steam reforming for syngas production from natural gas. The simulation scheme consists of a first step dedicated to acid gas removal (H<sub>2</sub>S and CO<sub>2</sub>) from natural gas through chemical absorption with DEA, followed by methane separation from higher hydrocarbons in a distillation column, steam production in heat exchanger and finally SMR. Methane exiting the acid gas removal step is mixed with steam in a mixer, which uses heat from the SMR reactor output stream. The mixture is then sent to another heater and then to the plug flow reactor (RPLUG), where the SMR and WGS reactions take place over a Ni/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalyst at a constant temperature of 890 K. The output stream is then sent to a heat exchanger, used to generate steam, and then to a flash separator, where syngas and water are obtained. The thermodynamic property method selected is Peng-Robinson, and the convergence criteria have been relaxed due to issues in the PFR convergence with the default criteria. The rate expression for the catalytic reactions occurring in the PFR reactor have been modelled using the Langmuir–Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson kinetics formulation (LHHW), obtained from the work of Xu and Froment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. The produced syngas is characterized by a composition of 72.22% mol H<sub>2</sub>, 21.71% mol CO, 3.56% mol H<sub>2</sub>O, 1.77% mol CO<sub>2</sub>, 0.48% mol CH<sub>4</sub>, and 0.26% mol N<sub>2</sub>. The authors also simulated a combination of SMR and DMR. In this process, the syngas generated by SMR is sent to a heat exchanger. Here, the syngas is cooled and passed through a CO<sub>2</sub> membrane separator, separating CO<sub>2</sub> from the syngas mixture, which contains CO, H<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, and unreacted CH<sub>4</sub>. Then, the stream is sent to a flash separator, where the separation of syngas and water takes place. The CO<sub>2</sub> separated by membrane filtering is sent to the dry reformer, where the methane reacts with CO<sub>2</sub> for increased production of syngas. As for the SMR process, LHHW kinetic expressions are used to determine the rate of reaction of the DMR process. The resulting syngas has a composition of 73.61% mol H<sub>2</sub>, 23.85% mol CO, 1.20% mol H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.51% mol CO<sub>2</sub>, 0.55% mol CH<sub>4</sub>, and 0.27% mol N<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="Par158">Giwa et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>] simulated the SMR for hydrogen production. The authors modelled two different versions of the process, i.e. with and without feed (CH<sub>4</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O) mixer. For reforming, an equilibrium reactor was chosen, in which the stoichiometry of the reaction was specified, i.e. the reforming reaction (<xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>) and the water–gas-shift reaction (<xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="disp-formula">2</xref>). Several case studies have been simulated. In the case of the reactor operating at 1173.15 K temperature and 1 bar pressure, the syngas compositions obtained in both versions of the model were characterized by the same molar composition, i.e. 62.56% mol H<sub>2</sub>, 16.06% mol CO, 17.77% mol H<sub>2</sub>O, 3.59% mol CO<sub>2</sub>, and 0.02% mol CH<sub>4</sub>.</p><p id="Par159">The SMR process of natural gas has been also modelled by Amran et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>], using a kinetic-based approach with the Redlich-Kwong-Soave equation of state with modified Huron-Vidal mixing rules (RKSMHV2) thermodynamic model. Natural gas and steam are first mixed, fed to a heat exchanger and then to a RPLUG reactor to model the methane reforming reaction, and finally to another RPLUG reactor for WGS reaction. Both reactors follow a rearranged LHHW kinetic model. It is assumed that natural gas does not contain H<sub>2</sub>S and CO<sub>2</sub>. The modelling approach was validated against data from other published studies, showing a good agreement with the literature. A sensitivity analysis of the reaction performance has also been performed.</p><p id="Par160">Gopaul et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>] simulated the syngas production from biogas through dry reforming. In particular, three different cases have been simulated, i.e. (i) DMR alone, (ii) DMR and POX, (iii) DMR and hydrogen oxidation (HOX). The target H<sub>2</sub>/CO ratio is 1.6–1.7, for downstream Fischer–Tropsch synthesis. The study also compares different types of biogas in terms of H<sub>2</sub> and CO yield: landfill, corn cob, whole stillage, and combined cob and stillage. The compositions of the analysed biogas types do not include H<sub>2</sub>S or NH<sub>3</sub>. Biogas is not upgraded to biomethane prior to reforming, thus the reforming reactor is directly fed by the biogas stream. About the thermodynamic model, the <italic>Property Method</italic> chosen here is IDEAL, which uses both Raoult’s law and Henry’s law. The DMR alone case was simulated using a RGIBBS reactor, i.e. an equilibrium reactor whose output is computed following the method of Gibbs free energy minimization at specified operating conditions (pressure, temperature, flowrates). Biogas is fed into the reforming reactor at 1123.15 K and 1.01325 bar. The reactor operates at 1223.15 K and 1.01325 bar. The DMR + POX case is similar to the previous one in terms of reactor configuration and operating conditions. However, in this case, a second feed stream containing oxygen at 1.01325 bar and 473.15 K is used, and therefore the exothermic partial oxidation reaction satisfies the energy demand of the endothermic DMR process. The amount of oxygen required was determined using the Design Specification function available in Aspen Plus, taking also into account the desired syngas H<sub>2</sub>/CO ratio of 1.6–1.7. The case of DMR + HOX modelling comprises two RGIBBS reactors, one for DMR and one for H<sub>2</sub> combustion to provide energy to the DMR process. Biogas feed and DMR reactor have the same conditions of the other two cases. The HOX reactor is fed under stoichiometric excess conditions of O<sub>2</sub> at 473.15 K and 1.01325 bar, H<sub>2</sub> at 1123.15 K and 1.01325 bar, and combustion occurs at 1273.15 K and 1.01325 bar. Also in this case, the required H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> feed rates were determined through the Design Specification function in Aspen Plus. The optimal process conditions to maximize syngas yield and quality were determined through a sensitivity analysis on the DMR case with landfill biogas type, which turned out to be similar also for the other biogas types. The analysis showed that, however, the desired 1.6–1.7 H<sub>2</sub>/CO ratio is found at temperatures and pressure ranges for which syngas quality is low. Therefore, other values of H<sub>2</sub>/CO ratio, slightly outside the desired range have been accepted in favour of a better CH<sub>4</sub> conversion (from 96 to 100%) and syngas quality (meaning, for high-quality syngas, a syngas composed mainly of H<sub>2</sub> and CO, with a minimal amount of by-products). Authors also performed an energy analysis of the processes, which are both exothermic and endothermic. DMR reactor heat duty ranges from + 14.88 to + 28.74 kW<sub>th</sub>/kmol, while the DRM + HOX process values of − 23.93 and − 4.58 kW<sub>th</sub>/kmol depending on biogas type (resulting in exothermicity); the combined DMR + POX process was able to counterbalance the high energy demand of DMR, achieving thermal-energy neutrality.</p><p id="Par161">The DRM process has been modelled in Aspen Plus also by Ashraf et al.

A sensitivity study to find the optimum process conditions has also been carried out. As a result, a syngas stream characterized by a H<sub>2</sub>/CO ratio of about 1.58 was obtained, with a methane conversion of about 99%.</p><p id="Par162">Er-rbib et al.

As the selectivity of FT-crude products depends on the reaction temperature and feed syngas (H<sub>2</sub>/CO ratio), a sensitivity study has been carried out, and these parameters optimized to maximize kerosene and diesel fraction using the solver function in MS Excel. In order to achieve 80% CO conversion and maximize kerosene and diesel yield fractions, the optimal values have been estimated between 1.6 and 2 for the H<sub>2</sub>/CO ratio, and between 473.15 and 573.15 K as regards the reaction temperature.

In the proposed approach, syngas is generated through a reverse water–gas-shift (RWGS) reaction and then converted through the FT reaction into a broad range of hydrocarbons. Product separation is performed downstream hydrocarbon production: long-chain hydrocarbons are sent to a hydrocracker to increase the yield at the desired chain length for transport fuel production (&lt; C-22). Gas products and unreacted species are recycled to increase the carbon efficiency of the process. Operational parameters are optimized to maximize energy efficiency. In Aspen Plus, the thermodynamic method here selected is the Peng-Robinson with Boston-Mathias modifications (PR-BM), H<sub>2</sub>, CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub> and alkanes are the chemical species considered in this model. It is assumed that carbon is not a possible product. The FT reactor is a tubular fixed bed: it has been simulated as a stoichiometric reactor (RSTOIC) with Co catalyst, without considering reaction kinetics. The reactor operates at 493.15 K and 25 bar, while the H<sub>2</sub>/CO ratio is set at 2. CO conversion is assumed equal to 40%, and inert gas share is fixed at 50%. Under these conditions, the chain growth probability factor α is equal to 0.839, calculated using the expression proposed by Vervloet et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>].

Basically, the process consists in a first part related to syngas generation from gasification, which is then split and sent into the FT unit, where it is converted to fuel, and the combined power cycle generates electricity and power. Focusing on the Aspen Plus model section related to the Fischer–Tropsch unit, the reactor chosen by the authors is a stoichiometric reactor (RSTOIC) in which 31 reactions have been considered. The property method selected is Peng-Robinson. The feed syngas is characterized by H<sub>2</sub>/CO ratio of about 2, and the process is carried out at about 513.15 K and 20 bar. The syngas is thus mainly converted to C-1 to C-30 hydrocarbons and water. Chemical reactions have been defined up to C-30 as the database of software does not contain hydrocarbons that are heavier than the C-30. The products of the Fischer–Tropsch reactor undergo downstream separation under gradual cooling in the three separators.

The plant is divided into two main sections, i.e. (i) the electrolyzer unit and (ii) the liquid fuel synthesis unit. In (i), H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub> are converted into H<sub>2</sub> and CO (syngas) via co-electrolysis, whereas in (ii), syngas conversion into hydrocarbons occurs. In the process modelled, the FT synthesis occurs at 20 bar and 503.15 K, and only a first FT crude separation is considered, which divides purge water from hydrocarbons and light refinery gases. The main Aspen Plus simulation blocks considered for the FT modelling part are a splitter, a stoichiometric reactor, a mixer, and a flash separator. The splitter divides the feed syngas (H<sub>2</sub>/CO = 2.1) into two streams: one enters the RSTOIC block, while the other bypasses the reactor and is mixed with the FT products. The FT reactor (Co-based) accomplishes several reactors, and the product distribution is assumed to follow the ASF products distribution model with a chain growth probability factor α equal to 0.94. The synthesis of alcohols, aromatics, and other oxygenated compounds is neglected; only alkanes and alkenes are considered products.

The author developed two Aspen Plus models for the Fischer–Tropsch reactor: a conversion-based model, whose operating conditions were varied, and a kinetic-based model, using a plug-flow reactor (RPLUG) in which the conversion of CO is studied. The <italic>Property Method</italic> used is Peng Robinson-Boston Mathias (PR-BM). The conversion-based involves two stoichiometric reactors (RSTOIC). In the first reactor, the three main FT reactions occur (paraffin, olefin, and alcohol formation), modelled according to the ASF distribution with a method of lumping high-weight hydrocarbons described in Hillestad et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>]. The products are assumed to be composed by paraffins (up to C-20 with a C-21 + lump), olefins (up to C-10 with a C-11 + lump), and alcohols (up to C-5 with a C-6 + lump). Each FT product is characterized by its specific probability function <italic>α</italic>: in the case of paraffins and olefins, <italic>α</italic> is assumed to be temperature- and pressure-dependent and formulated through Todic et al.’s correlation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>], while for the oxygenates, <italic>α</italic> is assumed to be constant (i.e. equal to 0.5). To figure out the ASF underestimation of methane in the products, a stand-alone reaction describing the CH<sub>4</sub> formation from CO and H<sub>2</sub> is added into the reactor, as well as an additional reaction for CH<sub>4</sub> among the olefins formation. A total CO fractional conversion has been set to 60%, which is split between the four reactions involved in the first RSTOIC reactor; its values were adjusted for each reaction in order to yield approximately the same carbon selectivities found in the experimental study carried out by Shafer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>]. The second RSTOIC reactor considers the ethylene deviation, referring to Pandey et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. Computations have been performed in Aspen Plus calculation blocks. The kinetic-based model uses Langmuir–Hinshelwood (LHHW) adsorption kinetics and the consorted vinylene mechanism, a modified ASF distribution model. The model considers also ASF deviation and the effect of water over the reaction rate. The oxygenates are not included in this model. The product separation flowsheet is the same for both reactor configurations. After the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, the liquid and gaseous FT products are separated in a FLASH at the temperature of the FT reactor outlet; in fact, at this temperature (more than 450 K), the hydrocarbons of 17 carbons or higher are liquid and unreacted syngas and hydrocarbon of 16 or lower are gaseous. The gaseous stream is then cooled in a countercurrent heat exchanger, which recovers the heat to warm the syngas feed, and then further cooled to 283.15 K. The cooled gaseous stream enters a three-outlet FLASH separator, which gives (i) a C1-C5 hydrocarbons gaseous stream, (ii) a C6-C16 hydrocarbons stream, and (iii) a water stream. The C6–C16 hydrocarbons stream undergoes further separation, involving a pressure decrease to 5 bar through a VALVE, a temperature increase to 483.15 K, in order to evaporate the C6-C7 hydrocarbons, and then a separation of the C6–C7 hydrocarbons from C8–C16 hydrocarbons in a second FLASH. Different operating conditions have been tested (i.e. 493.15 K, 27.6 bar, H<sub>2</sub>/CO = 2; 483.15 K, 25 bar, H<sub>2</sub>/CO = 1.95; 483.15 K, 25 bar, H<sub>2</sub>/CO = 1.60; 483.15 K, 20 bar, H<sub>2</sub>/CO = 1.95; 493.15 K, 25 bar, H<sub>2</sub>/CO = 1.95) for both reactor configurations, and the simulations results showed that, at the same operating conditions, the conversion-based reactor results in higher selectivity towards lower-weight hydrocarbons. For both models, carbon selectivity increases with carbon number and has a peak around C-13.</p><p id="Par183">Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> summarizes the selected research works modelling Fischer–Tropsch synthesis in Aspen Plus.

In the model, the cleaned syngas stream is compressed and heated up to the operating pressure and temperature. Then, the stream is introduced into the methanol synthesis reactor, which has been simulated as an equilibrium reactor (REQUIL). This kind of reactor requires the stoichiometry to be specified. The equations involved in the synthesis are (9) and (11), with a conversion of 36% for CO and 17% for CO<sub>2</sub>. The selected catalyst is Cu/ZnO. The reaction product is then depressurized and cooled down, and then sent to a column separator, in order to condense and separate methanol from the gas phase, getting at the bottom pure methanol as the final product. The H<sub>2</sub>/CO in the feed stream is about 2.4–2.5. As regards the thermodynamic method, the Peng-Robinson with Boston Mathias function was selected as appropriate for the process application, in particular for high-temperature gasification. Operating conditions have been varied, evaluated, and optimized through a sensitivity study.

This kind of reactor can simulate thermodynamic equilibrium reactions with good accuracy. Products (methanol and water) are expanded and then separated in a flash unit. Recycling unreacted syngas to improve the methanol yield is also performed by using a splitter with a recycle ratio.

In the study, it is assumed that no by-product formation occurs. The reactor effluent is then cooled down to condensate the crude methanol, and thus separated from the gas phase, which is then recompressed and recycled to increase the overall CO conversion to methanol. A fraction of the recycled gas is purged to prevent the accumulation of inert gases and sent to the furnace to support energy self-sufficiency of the process.

In the simulation model, CO<sub>2</sub> (1 bar, 298.15 K) is compressed to 78 bar in a series of intercooled compressors, while H<sub>2</sub> (30 bar, 298.15 K) is compressed to 78 bar in a single stage. The two gases are mixed and then re-mixed with the recycle stream, heated to 483.15 K, and finally injected into the RPLUG reactor for methanol synthesis, which is a fixed bed adiabatic reactor. The stream leaving the reactor is then split into two streams, one used to heat the fresh feed and the other in the reboiler and to heat the feed of the distillation column. These streams are then re-mixed, cooled to 308.15 K by water, and then sent to a knock-out drum, where condensed water and methanol get separated from the non-reacted gases, which are partially purged to minimize the accumulation of inerts and by-products in the reaction loop. The crude methanol obtained (composed of CH<sub>3</sub>OH, H<sub>2</sub>O, and residual dissolved gases) is expanded to 1.2 bar through two expansion valves, fed into a flash separator where residual gases are almost completely removed, heated to 353.15 K, and finally sent to a distillation column (RADFRAC). Here, water and methanol are separated, and the resulting CH<sub>3</sub>OH stream, in gaseous form, contains 69 ppm wt. of H<sub>2</sub>O and some unreacted gases.

The condensed components are then separated in a distillation column, to get into lights (dissolved CO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and minor light impurities), MeOH and water. The authors included a stripping unit in the process, in which wet hydrogen flows in counter-current mode with the condensed water mixture from the high-pressure low-temperature separator after the reaction. In this way, there is a complete recycle of CO<sub>2</sub> as CO/CO<sub>2</sub> is removed from the methanol–water mixture, and at the same time, by removing water from the wet hydrogen, there are no negative impacts on the reaction equilibrium conversion. The chosen <italic>Property Methods</italic> are the Soave–Redlich–Kwong EOS and NRTL with Henry components. The feed stream entering the PRF reactor is composed of 2.96% mol CO, 25.14% mol CO<sub>2</sub>, 71.39% mol H<sub>2</sub>, and 0.51% mol CH<sub>3</sub>OH. The product stream exiting the PRF reactor has a composition of 3.24% mol CO, 22.78% mol CO<sub>2</sub>, 63.95% mol H<sub>2</sub>, 4.74% mol H<sub>2</sub>O, and 5.29% mol CH<sub>3</sub>OH. The methanol stream exiting the system is characterized by a molar concentration of 0.01% mol H<sub>2</sub>, 0.02% mol H<sub>2</sub>O, and 99.98% mol CH<sub>3</sub>OH. The H<sub>2</sub> conversion is 18.17%, while the CO<sub>2</sub> conversion is 17.20% and the MeOH yield of the overall process is 99.83%. In this process, all the carbon from the CO<sub>2</sub> feed is converted into MeOH product, whereas only two-thirds of H<sub>2</sub> are converted into MeOH product, while the rest is converted to the water by-product.</p><p id="Par198">Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref> summarizes the reviewed studies on modelling methanol synthesis. The analysis revealed that the process (either from syngas or CO<sub>2</sub> as main feedstock) has been largely simulated in Aspen Plus. On the other hand, no studies simulating the process of direct methane to methanol (DMTM) conversion in Aspen Plus have been found in literature, probably because the technology is still in the developing phase.<table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Studies reviewed modelling MeOH synthesis in Aspen Plus</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Authors</p></th><th align="left"><p>Publication year</p></th><th align="left"><p>Feedstock</p></th><th align="left"><p>Thermodynamic method</p></th><th align="left"><p>Main simulation blocks</p></th><th align="left"><p>MeOH % in the products</p></th><th align="left"><p>Remarks</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Atsonios et al.

In this research, authors considered a relatively small-scale biogas to FT liquid conversion route, including biogas upgrading through PWS, biomethane reforming through DMR, syngas cleaning through chemical absorption with MEA, FT synthesis, and product upgrading in distillation columns. The study showed that, for 10,000 Nm<sup>3</sup>/h of dry biogas, the process requires 7.08 MW of power in addition to 35 of heating and 185 GJ/h for cooling, and from 4000 kg/h of methane in the biogas feed, 1602 kg/h of FT products could be produced. The process investigated is thus characterized by a carbon conversion efficiency of 45% and energy efficiency of 30%.</p><p id="Par202">Another article that could be taken as a reference to study the sustainable biofuel production chain proposed is that of Bao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>], even though the feedstock considered in the process is natural gas.

The low-ILUC nature of the value chain is ensured by the implementation of the Biogas Done Right (BDR) model for the production of biomethane in a farm-scale decentralized configuration; the biomethane produced through this sustainable pathway serves as a basis for the production of synthetic fuels and chemicals in centralized refineries, making use of the natural gas grid to connect the two environments (farm and refinery). Existing and under-development technologies for the conversion of biomass-to-liquid fuels have been reviewed, and their modelling in the various studies available in the literature analysed, focusing on model assumptions, process conditions, applications, yields, and consumptions.</p><p id="Par204">After a quality-based initial screening, a total of about 57 reviewed modelling papers were selected among the available literature; these included anaerobic digestion, biogas cleaning and upgrading to biomethane, methane reforming to syngas, syngas conversion to hydrocarbons through Fischer–Tropsch synthesis and MeOH synthesis from syngas and CO<sub>2</sub> hydrogenation.</p><p id="Par205">In the reviewed papers, many of the technologies of interest to this paper have not been modelled as stand-alone cases, but are embedded in broader contexts, with more complex flowsheets. For this reason, it was often difficult to extrapolate detailed information on yields and consumptions of the individual processes from their original framework. For example, in the study of Cinti et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>], aimed at simulating the production of synthetic green fuels through a system integrating solid oxide electrolyzer and FT synthesis, our analysis did not cover the electrolyzer unit, but was focused only on modelling the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis.</p><p id="Par206">As discussed, the first step of the value chain under investigation foresees the anaerobic digestion process following the BDR model to produce biogas in a sustainable manner. In the literature, no studies that specifically apply this model in Aspen Plus simulation environment have been found (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Therefore, we searched for generalized anaerobic digestion models, which turned out to be not so numerous (i.e. 6); this could be due to the high complexity of the process, which turns out to be particularly difficult to model, especially as regards the biological activity of microorganisms. Nguyen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] and Scamardella et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] opted for a one-stage model in a single reactor, in which the whole AD phases occurs. In the RSTOIC reactor (used in Nguyen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]), the reaction kinetics is not considered, whereas in the RCSTR (used in Scamardella et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]) detailed information on the reactions and their kinetics must be input; this means that the first represents a more simplistic modelling approach. However, the two studies ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]) refer to different AD models (i.e. Buswell equation, ADM1, and comprehensive models), and the papers do not provide information showing a comparison with experimental data. Al-Rubaye et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] and Rajendran et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] adopted a very similar approach, i.e. a two-step model using a RSTOIC reactor for the hydrolytic phase and a RCSTR reactor for the other AD phases, in reference to the ADM1 and comprehensive models. The two studies have been validated against experimental data, resulting in both cases in good agreement. The AD model developed by Serrano Peris [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], which involves two RSTOIC reactors in series, does not take into account the hydrolytic step, and its application is thus limited to post-hydrolyzed wastes. Besides, a higher modelling complexity is given in that of Llanes et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], which integrates ADM1, flow pattern and biofilm characteristics implemented through FORTRAN subroutines; this model is thus not limited to completely mixed flow pattern (as in the case of RCSTR reactors), and results are in agreement with experimental data.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Number of selected studies reviewed and based on Aspen Plus modelling.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13399_2022_3057_Fig5_HTML.png" id="MO5"/></fig></p><p id="Par207">Biogas upgrading to biomethane is a fundamental step in the proposed sustainable value chain, as biomethane must comply with strict Country-specific technical standards in order to be injected into the natural gas grid. Therefore, accurately modelling this step is crucial. In the literature, there is a relevant number of papers (i.e. 16) simulating upgrading processes; these are in large part set in the context of gas sweetening, but nevertheless, in some studies ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]), the upgrading technologies are employed for syngas upgrading (i.e. CO<sub>2</sub> removal). Many of the upgrading processes modelled in Aspen Plus turned out to be physical absorption (i.e. PWS) and chemical absorption using amine solutions (i.e. MEA, DEA, MDEA). The modelling approach of these technologies is almost the same in every paper: a distillation column for both absorption and stripping processes. The Aspen Plus distillation unit operation chosen in most of the reviewed simulations was the RADFRAC column, which is the most generic column block type. Some models have opted for an equilibrium-stage approach for both absorption and stripping column, which assumes that each plate of the column is a theoretical plate (equilibrium plate), and thus, the vapour and the liquid leave any plate at thermodynamic equilibrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>]. In other simulations, instead, the distillation columns are rate-based, which means that the mass and energy transfer across the interface are taken into account using rate equation and mass transfer coefficients; therefore, this approach provides a more rigorous modelling of the columns. At the same time, there are studies ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]) that opted for a combined equilibrium-based and rate-based approach.</p><p id="Par208">Not many models simulating the pressure swing adsorption process in Aspen Plus were found in the literature. As a matter of facts, the PSA process is a dynamic process, and as Aspen Plus is a steady state calculator, no dynamic options are available in the software. For this reason, many authors preferred to model the process in Aspen Adsorption, this being a comprehensive flowsheet simulator more specific for adsorption processes. Finally, only one study (i.e. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]) modelling the biogas upgrading through membrane separation has been found, consisting in a user-defined model developed in Excel referring to Fick’s law with diffusive model assumptions.</p><p id="Par209">About the modellization of the reforming technologies, a discrete number of studies have been found (i.e. 7), most of them assessing the SMR process, which is the most consolidated one in this matter. A good number of papers addressed the process of dry reforming, which is an emerging technology whose reaction kinetics has not been fully described yet. Anyway, there are many studies in which DMR is combined with SMR, as well as POX, while a smaller number of articles assessing the ATR process was found. Most of the reviewed models are aimed at simulating processes for hydrogen production in spite of syngas production, and consequently, in many studies, SMR is combined with WGS. The modelling approaches of the analysed studies are various: the Aspen Plus reactor blocks employed in the simulations are RGIBBS ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]), REQUIL ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]), and RPLUG with Langmuir–Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LHHW) kinetics ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]). The RPLUG reactor type that unlike the RGIBBS and the REQUIL, encompasses the process reaction kinetics and allows for a complete description of the process under variable conditions and proper reactor sizing; however, a suitable reaction set and the relative kinetic model and thermodynamic data must be provided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>].</p><p id="Par210">A large number of studies (i.e. 17) modelling the Fischer–Tropsch process in Aspen Plus have been found in the literature. As mentioned, the FT process is particularly complex and the full understanding of all mechanisms involved has not yet been reached, though it is not a novel technology. The reference model for most of the reviewed articles is the Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF) distribution, a fairly simple model which gives a reasonable description of FT products by representing the synthesis as an addition polymerization reaction with chain growth probability α [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. Nevertheless, despite the mathematical simplicity of the ASF model, studies have shown that there are deviations of the FT product composition from the ideal distribution (i.e. higher methane selectivity, lower ethylene selectivity, increasing chain growth probability, and lower olefin-to-paraffin ratio with increasing carbon number) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>]; therefore, correlations accounting for the ASF distribution deviations and dependence of <italic>α</italic> on process conditions have been developed and are well documented in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>]. In many modelling studies reviewed, the produced hydrocarbons have been assumed to be composed only by paraffins; this assumption is acceptable, as the alkanes are the main product of the FT synthesis. However, there is also a large number of studies considering olefins in the products, while only one model (i.e. Dahl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>]) among those found includes also alcohols. Moreover, it was noticed that in many studies ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>]) the chain growth probability α has a constant value, while others use correlations to relate its values to the process conditions; the most used expression in the reviewed papers is the one derived by Song et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. Another significant parameter for determining the accuracy of a FT model is the carbon number (<italic>n</italic>) for the product chain termination; in the modelling studies reviewed, this number was found to be always higher than 20 for the main products (i.e. paraffins). Setting a high <italic>n</italic> for the hydrocarbon chain termination definitively represents a higher accuracy in describing the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis; in fact, the product slate synthesized ranges from methane up to C-120 + [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. However, as the product selectivity significantly decreases after peaking at around C-7 to C-13 (depending on the process conditions and the catalyst), cutting the chain from <italic>n</italic> = 20 could be considered satisfactory.</p><p id="Par211">Most of the reviewed Aspen Plus models employ reactor types such as RSTOIC and RYIED, in which the reaction kinetics is not explicitly considered, and the product distribution is imposed. Nevertheless, a small number of modelling studies assessing the FT synthesis reaction kinetics (through external subroutine) were also found (i.e. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>]); these models provide higher flexibility when changing the process conditions.</p><p id="Par212">As concerns the MeOH synthesis from syngas, 5 studies have been found, whose modelling procedures are diverse. Some authors did not consider the reaction kinetics, opting for a RSTOIC reactor ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]) or for a REQUIL reactor ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>]), which performs chemical and phase equilibrium reactions. At the same time, De Maria et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>] and Trop et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>] described the reaction kinetics of the catalytic reaction, using, in the former case, a user-defined reactor type developed in Matlab, and a RPLUG reactor in the latter case.</p><p id="Par213">Additionally, opportunities for further pathways have been investigated, including methanol synthesis from captured CO<sub>2</sub>, which represents an excellent opportunity from an environmental sustainability point of view. Indeed, CCS and CCU technologies, if associated with bioenergy, can make the production chain considered not only carbon neutral but also carbon negative. In this perspective, in the proposed bioliquid production chain, the CO<sub>2</sub> separated from biogas through upgrading processes represents again a further feedstock for the MeOH production, and in this way would not be dispersed in the atmosphere. Lots of studies simulating this in Aspen Plus have been found (i.e. 7), meaning that this topic is of great interest to the scientific community. The modelling approaches of the MeOH synthesis from CO<sub>2</sub> adopted in the reviewed papers are very similar to those of in the case of syngas as a feedstock: REQUIL reactor ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>]) and RPLUG reactor with LHHW kinetics ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>]).</p><p id="Par214">As an alternative to MeOH synthesis from syngas, the straight conversion of methane into methanol (DMTM) could be an interesting route, as it gives the possibility to by-pass the very energy-intensive step of methane reforming, representing an economical-advantage and environment-friendly option. However, as mentioned, this method still needs to be improved to be suitable for industrial applications. As a matter of fact, no Aspen Plus models simulating this process have been found in the literature.</p><p id="Par215">In view of these considerations, it can be concluded that the simulation system provides all the necessary tools to model the entire sustainable biofuel production chain selected for this work. Moreover, through browsing the suitable technologies (either consolidated or under development) that could be employed, and by analysing and commenting on the diverse options identified in literature, this study could serve as a guideline to assess the feasibility of bio-thermochemical conversion pathways.</p><p id="Par216">The references collected in the literature could be used for further studies aimed at qualitatively and quantitatively assessing multiple aspects related to biofuels production, and besides the possibility to build an overall Aspen Plus simulation model of the proposed sustainable biogas-to-liquid production chain would be an interesting object for future works.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par217">Biomass-to-fuel pathways are of interest for many sectors, in particular those relying on liquid fuels also during the short-medium term ecological transition, such as maritime and aviation. The present survey reviewed biogas-biomethane conversion pathways to Fischer–Tropsch liquids and methanol, as an alternative to fossil-based fuels. More specifically, a sustainable biofuel production chain, producing low-ILUC-risk biofuels, has been analysed, and the possibility to model it through a commercial simulation software has been explored. The low-ILUC-risk nature of the value chain is guaranteed by the implementation of the Biogas Done Right (BDR) model for the production of biomethane in decentralized farms through anaerobic digestion. The produced biomethane constitutes the base to synthesize bio-liquids and bio-chemicals in centralized conversion plants, making use of the natural gas grid to connect the farm and the refinery environments. The value chain includes thus biogas cleaning and upgrading to biomethane, injection of biomethane into the natural gas grid resulting in downstream extraction, methane reforming to syngas, and syngas conversion to hydrocarbons through Fischer–Tropsch synthesis and to methanol through MeOH synthesis. Several suitable technologies and process solutions have been reviewed and, in addition, opportunities for further pathways to be included have been investigated, in order to integrate the proposed biofuel production chain even more into a perspective of sustainability; these are methanol production from captured CO<sub>2</sub> and direct methane to methanol (DMTM) conversion.</p><p id="Par218">Moreover, a comprehensive literature review of studies modelling the identified conversion pathways using Aspen Plus process simulation software has been carried out, in order to evaluate the maturity of available simulation models. To this aim, 57 publications were selected, which have been deeply analysed from the point of view of plant configuration, modelling approach, and process yield, focusing on understanding the diverse schematizations and assumptions, as well as mass/energy balances. It has been observed that many of the technologies of interest to this article were not modelled as stand-alone studies, but were embedded in broader contexts; thus, it was often difficult to extrapolate detailed information on related yields and consumptions. Anyway, the survey showed that comprehensive and sufficiently complete kinetic data to model well-established technologies (i.e. SMR and MeOH synthesis) are available in the literature, and thus a considerable number of Aspen Plus simulation models addressing them exhaustively was found. Likewise, a large experience in modelling upgrading technologies, such as physical and chemical absorption, has been observed, as well as a remarkable coherence in the modelling approaches. At the same time, the mechanisms involved in the high-complexity processes embedded in the proposed value chain (i.e. AD and FT) still need to be fully understood, but yet studies simulating them satisfactorily and with a good match with experimental data have been found. However, the only technology for which no modelling studies were identified is DMTM, being this process still under investigation.</p><p id="Par219">By investigating a broad spectrum of suitable biomass-to-liquid conversion pathways, either consolidated or under development, and by analysing and commenting on the diverse options retrieved in literature studies, this work could represent a guideline for further studies aimed to analyse qualitatively and quantitatively multiple aspects related to biofuels production.</p><p id="Par220">Moreover, the review revealed that the commercial software chosen for the analysis provides the necessary tools to model the multiple technological solutions that could be employed in the identified sustainable biofuel production chain. Besides, this study contains enough references to build an overall biomass-to-liquid value chain simulation model, making it a solid basis for future works, such as optimizing operational conditions, determining limitations due to process configurations, and possibly exploiting the high potential of process waste streams to further support the sustainability of bioliquids production.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contribution</title><p>Lorenzo Testa (lorenzo.testa@polito.it): data curation, formal analysis, investigation, methodology, visualization, writing — original draft; David Chiaramonti (david.chiaramonti@polito.it): conceptualization, writing and review — review and editing, supervision, methodology; Matteo Prussi (matteo.prussi@polito.it): writing — review and editing, conceptualization, visualization; Samir Bensaid (samir.bensaid@polito.it): writing — review and editing, visualization.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Open access funding provided by Politecnico di Torino within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.
