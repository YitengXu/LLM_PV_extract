It is reported that the perovskite solar cells achieve remarkably high efficiency of 19% for both mesoporous metal oxide scaffolds and planar heterojunction architectures because CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>(MAPbI<sub>3</sub>), as light harvesting material, offers all the desirable characteristics such as large absorption coefficient, high charge carrier mobility and long diffusion length<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Planar architecture has been developed due to the enhanced device flexibility and multijunction construction application<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. TCO/cp semiconductors oxide/perovskite materials/HTM/cathode is the standard configuration for planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells. The cp layer and CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> layer are indispensable in a perovskite solar cell and their high quality directly plays an important role in reducing the structural and electronic defects in the films which can affect the device performance significantly. For the cp layer preparation, Spray pyrolysis and spin-coating precursor solution methods are two typical methods to prepare electron collecting cp layer for planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells. However, these two methods are also associated with certain disadvantages. First, the cp layer obtained by these two methods is not high-quality condensed layer. Second, it is difficult to control the cp-layer thickness for these two methods. Third, they involve high temperature preparation and non-flexible devices, which limits the applications of perovskite solar cells. In addition, spin coating technique is not suitable for commercial large-scale production of solar cells. Therefore, the investigation of cp layer preparation methods that involve high-quality condensed layer, easy control of thin film growth, low temperature preparation and flexible devices is necessary and will provide important insight on these issues. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has been used to fabricate cp layers for perovskite solar cells, but ALD requires a relatively long time and high-cost for the thin film preparation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. For the CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> thin film synthesis, typically, the deposition of MAPbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite thin films is accomplished using a one-step or two-step solution-processing method. However, it is difficult to control perovskite crystallinity and film uniformity due to the annealing process, which is unavoidable for the one-step solution-processing method. In general, the two-step method offers better control of the perovskite morphology compared with the one-step method. However, the spin-coating technique in the two-step method is related with low quality of films and limitation of large-scale production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> thin film synthesis approach with a big achievement, which is based on a dual-source evaporation technique, has been developed for planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. However, this method requires special lab equipment.</p><p>In this work, we report for the first time a high-quality, easy-control, physical-deposition approach, which allows low temperature preparation for cp layer synthesis and the fabrication of large area and flexible devices for perovskite solar cell applications, which is based on RFMS technique. RFMS is a low-cost method for preparing semiconductor and metal thin films on various substrates and it is particularly suitable for the growth of nanostructured films<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. For CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> thin film preparation, we also modified the traditional two-step solution-processing method by E&amp;I approach, instead of spin-coating, in which PbI<sub>2</sub> thin films were prepared via thermal evaporation followed by immersing the PbI<sub>2</sub> thin films in CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>I solution. This E&amp;I approach with great film reproducibility overcomes the problems of traditional one-step and two-step methods including incomplete conversion and uncontrolled growth of CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> thin films and it is suited for large-scale production of solar cells. In addition, considering the rapid energy payback time of photovoltaic device<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, RFMS technique and E&amp;I method could be one alternative way to realize large area, low cost and commercialized devices.</p><p>In this research, planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells based on cp TiO<sub>2</sub> electron transport layer and MAPbI<sub>3</sub> thin film by RFMS combined with E &amp; I method were fabricated and their performance was characterized.

The film thickness was controlled by varying the sputtering time from 0 to 60 min (0, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50 and 60 min) to investigate the influence of the thickness-dependent TiO<sub>2</sub> on the device performance. Because some deposited TiO<sub>2</sub> films are extremely thin within a few nanometers, the thicknesses are estimated by the film thickness monitor set in RFMS chamber.</p><p>We also fabricated the devices without the cp TiO<sub>2</sub> electron transport layer. The device performance was characterized by current density (<italic>J</italic>)-voltage (<italic>V</italic>) measurements under simulated AM 1.5 G (100 mW/cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>) solar irradiation in the air.

When the cp TiO<sub>2</sub> electron transport layer was introduced into the perovskite solar cells, the device performance was significantly enhanced compared to that without cp layer.

In general, the devices exhibit <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>sc</italic></sub> = 21.5 ± 0.9 mA/cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>oc</italic></sub> = 1.02 ± 0.1 V, <italic>FF</italic> = 50  ± 4% and the resulting <italic>PCE</italic> = 10.9 ± 1.2%. The <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>sc</italic></sub> increased with increasing cp-layer thickness, as the sputtering time is increased from 15 to 30 min. This can be attributed to the improved electron collection and effective hole blocking caused by the inserted TiO<sub>2</sub> layer. However, with increasing time from 35 to 60 min corresponding to the thickness from 80 to 200 nm, the decreased device performance is observed due to lower electron transport in thicker cp layers and longer transmission distance leading to increased recombination rates. This can also be confirmed from the apparent decrease of <italic>FF</italic> parameters. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement was also carried out for the devices based on TiO<sub>2</sub> with different thicknesses. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3(b)</xref> shows the typical IPCE spectra of perovskite solar cells, which is consistent with those in previous papers published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. After integrating the product of AM 1.5 G photon flux with the IPCE spectrum, the calculated <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>sc</italic></sub> is found to be 20.9 mA/cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> which is in good agreement with measured <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>sc</italic></sub> value (21.5 ± 0.9 mA/cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>) obtained for the device with sputtering time of 30 min.

Herein, we prepared MAPbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite film by an improved two-step approach (E &amp; I).This is an improved two-step process in which PbI<sub>2</sub> was evaporated to form a PbI<sub>2</sub> film in the first step rather than spin-coating a PbI<sub>2</sub> precursor in DMF solution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. This process can also avoid the extremely high reaction rate of lead halide perovskite film often observed in the co-deposition process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. This homogeneous PbI<sub>2</sub> film acts as a superior framework and “nucleation” centers for the MAPbI<sub>3</sub> formation with large crystals and regular morphology.</p><p>Evaporation is the deposition of lead iodide film by thermal evaporation method which is commonly used to prepare Au or Ag electrode. The evaporation temperature of PbI<sub>2</sub> (~954 °C) is lower than that of Au (2807 °C) or Ag (2210 °C) under standard atmospheric conditions and can be evaporated easily in vacuum environment. Immersion process, the perovskite material is formed, has dramatic influences on the crystallinity of MAPbI<sub>3</sub> and internal structure of perovskite solar cells. Here, we systematically analyze the effects of conversion from PbI<sub>2</sub> to MAPbI<sub>3</sub> in immersion process on perovskite solar cell performance. Our results show that the suitable immersing time is critical to obtain full conversion from PbI<sub>2</sub> to MAPbI<sub>3</sub> to achieve optimized photocurrent and excellent photovoltaic performance.</p><p><xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4(a)</xref> shows the <italic>J-V</italic> curves of different devices based on different immersing time of PbI<sub>2</sub> in MAI. In order to monitor the conversion of the PbI<sub>2</sub> phase to the perovskite phase, time-dependent X-ray Diffraction (XRD) (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4(b)</xref>) and corresponding SEM measurements (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4(c–f)</xref>) for different immersing time were also conducted. During the reaction process, it can be observed that the appearance and evolution of MAIPbI<sub>3</sub> structure can be confirmed from XRD results and SEM images, which is consistent with literature results about cubic (<italic>Pm3m</italic>) phase of the perovskite MAIPbI<sub>3</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. When the immersing time is increased from 0 min to 240 min, the short-circuit photocurrent density first increases and then decreases. In <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4(b)</xref>, the <italic>2θ</italic> peaks at 12.56<sup>°</sup> (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4(b)</xref>, marked with *) can be assigned to PbI<sub>2</sub> as the immersing time is 0~10 min indicating the presence of unconverted PbI<sub>2</sub>. From <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4(c)</xref>, the thermal-evaporation PbI<sub>2</sub> shows a stacked nanosheet structure which exhibits much larger surface area than traditional film to fully contact with the MAI in isopropanol solution. The changes in the crystal structure of the material compared with the original PbI<sub>2</sub> film, suggests that E &amp; I method promotes a rearrangement of PbI<sub>2</sub> in CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>I solution via intensive diffusion during film growth. One XRD peak (14.2<sup>°</sup>) is observed corresponding to the perovskite phase as the immersing time is 10 min (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4(b)</xref>). Simultaneously, some nanocrystals can be observed in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4(d)</xref> for the 10 min immersing time due to perovskite material formed on the surface of the film. The photovoltaic performance shows a rising trend as the immersing time is increased from 0 to 45 min due to the improved photocurrent caused by the more light absorber formed during the immersing process. The rising <italic>PCE</italic> trend from 0~45 min can also be concluded that the residual PbI<sub>2</sub> layer in films that are not fully converted inhibits charge transfer from the perovskite to the cp TiO<sub>2</sub> electron transport layer. PbI<sub>2</sub> XRD peaks disappear (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4(b)</xref>) and larger nanocrystals with the size of ~150 nm can be observed (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4(e)</xref>) as immersing time is increased to 45 min, which indicates that the reaction of CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>I and PbI<sub>2</sub> is complete. Meanwhile, the <italic>PCE</italic> reaches the highest value which also confirms the complete perovskite conversion during the immersion process. Such a behavior has been observed previously for this family of materials and is currently under intensive investigation by several research groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. <italic>FF</italic> parameters of these devices decrease significantly with increasing immersing time from 60 min (<italic>FF</italic> = 51%) to 240 min (<italic>FF</italic> = 25.5%). The same trend can be observed for the conversion efficiency, decreasing from 10.9% for 45 min to 0.21% for 240 min. To better understand the influence of longer immersing time (&gt;60 min) on the perovskite film growth, XRD and SEM of the sample with 240 min immersing are measured and shown in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4(b,f)</xref>. It is clear that there is no apparent difference in crystallinity, crystal size and surface morphology, which indicates that longer immersing time has limited influence on MAPbI<sub>3</sub> light absorbing films. Similar results were also obtained in other work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. But the cross-sectional images of the MAPbI<sub>3</sub> films on TiO<sub>2</sub>-coated FTO in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S1(a)~2(c)</xref> can explain the decreased device performance for the longer immersing time. It can be observed that the MAPbI<sub>3</sub> films peel off from Glass/FTO/cp-TiO<sub>2</sub> for the samples with immersing time 120 and 240 min (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S1(b,c)</xref>) in comparison with that of 45 min in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S1(a)</xref>. It is possible that the surface tension of the MAI solution affects the stability of the film leading to decreased device performance for the longer immersing time. Thus the conversion extent of the lead iodide film determined by immersing time is critical for optimizing device performance. (PbI<sub>2</sub>)<sub>1-x</sub> (MAPbI<sub>3</sub>)<sub>x</sub> films are not converted completely when the immersing time is less than 10 min and longer immersing time (more than 60 min) leads to fracture of the device. The transformation process of PbI<sub>2</sub> into CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> has been investigated by Lang <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. They proposed that the diffusion of Pb allows the formation of CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> from stacked PbI<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>I by inter-diffusion and the perovskite crystallites at the surface are associated with the diffusion. We believe that similar mechanism happened to our system. The transformation time in their study is shorter from PbI<sub>2</sub> to CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> compared to the reaction time in this work. However, PbI<sub>2</sub> was dissolved in Dimethylformamide solution and infiltrated into np-TiO<sub>2</sub> mesoporous structure by spin coating in their work. That may lead to shorter transformation time compared to PbI<sub>2</sub> dense films prepared by thermal evaporation in this work.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The <italic>PCE</italic> of the devices as a function of immersing time. 12 solar cells were repeated and measured for each immersing time; (<bold>b</bold>) XRD patterns of PbI<sub>2</sub> film with different immersing time in MAI solution; (<bold>c</bold>) SEM image of the PbI<sub>2</sub> film deposited by thermal evaporation on Glass/FTO/cp-TiO<sub>2</sub> substrate without immersing in MAI; (<bold>d</bold>) SEM image of the product obtained by immersing PbI<sub>2</sub> film in CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>I for 10 min; (<bold>e</bold>) SEM image of MAPbI<sub>3</sub> layer prepared by immersing PbI<sub>2</sub> film in MAI for 45 min; (<bold>f</bold>) SEM image of MAPbI<sub>3</sub> layer fabricated with immersing PbI<sub>2</sub> film in MAI for 240 min.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep17684_Fig4_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Anomalous hysteresis for the best efficient device</title><p>Anomalous Hysteresis has been studied to determine the performance of perovskite solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.

The physical method with easy control of thin film growth requires a much shorter time and overcomes low-quality of thin films, high-temperature annealing, non-flexible devices and limitation of large-scale production which are involved in the traditional methods. The best device on FTO obtained in this study exhibits an average efficiency of 10.9% and the best performance of 12.1% which is based on ~60 nm TiO<sub>2</sub> cp layer. A of 8.9% was achieved for the flexible solar cells on PET/ITO, which is comparable with traditional methods. The photovoltaic performance of the flexible solar cells still can be evaluated up to 300 cycles bending indicating the suitability for roll to roll processing. Additionally, large active area (40 × 40 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>) devices were also fabricated via this new strategy and a <italic>PCE</italic> of 4.8% was obtained. This RFMS combined with E &amp; I method could be utilized in other thin film-based solar cells and it also could be used to investigate the fundamental issues and enhance photovoltaic performance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>RFMS technique</title><p>RFMS is accomplished by the collision of the incident Ar<sup>+</sup> ions and the target (semiconductor oxide). In this process, with an electric field E, some ultrafast electrons collide with argon atoms when flying to substrate. Ar atoms produce positive ions (Ar<sup>+</sup>) and new electrons (e<sup>−</sup>) and then the Ar<sup>+</sup> ions as the incident particles experience in scattering target and colliding with the target. A part of the momentum of incident (Ar<sup>+</sup>) ions is delivered to the target atoms and these target atoms and other target atoms collide to form a cascade process. In this cascade process certain target atoms near the surface with sufficient momentum move away from the target to be sputtered toward substrate. It has fast-deposition and surface-cleaning characteristics. Specific schematic process can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S4</xref><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Specific procedure for the assembly of the perovskite solar cells</title><p>Process 1: Initially FTO was removed from regions under the anode contact by etching the FTO with 30% HCl and zinc powder. Substrates were then cleaned with deionized water, acetone and methanol and finally treated under oxygen plasma for 10 min to remove the last traces of organic residues.</p><p>Process 2: Cp TiO<sub>2</sub> electron transport layer was deposited onto Glass/FTO or PET/ITO substrates to obtain electron collecting cp layer by RFMS. The TiO<sub>2</sub> target has a purity of 99.99% and is 52 mm in diameter and 5 mm in thickness. The distance between the target and the substrate was approximately 50 mm. Prior to deposition, the chamber was evacuated to a pressure of ~4 × 10<sup>−4</sup> Pa. The RF sputtering processes were performed in pure Ar gas (99.999%). The gas flow rate of Ar was controlled by a mass-flow controller and the chamber was kept at a working pressure of 3.5 Pa. In order to clean the target surface, a pre-sputtering process was introduced for 10 min before the deposition. The flow rate of pure Ar was fixed at 32 sccm (standard cubic centimeter per minute) and the TiO<sub>2</sub> target was sputtered with a sputtering power of 120 W. The film thickness can be adjusted by the sputtering time and monitored by the film-thickness meter which is mounted on the substrate stage in the chamber.</p><p>Process 3: The PbI<sub>2</sub> film was deposited on the TiO<sub>2</sub> cp layer to form FTO/TiO<sub>2</sub>/ PbI<sub>2</sub>. The PbI<sub>2</sub> powders were used to fabricate PbI<sub>2</sub> films via thermal evaporation process (evaporation electric current: 50 A; evaporation voltage: ~220 V; Chamber pressure: ~8 × 10<sup>−4</sup> Pa). The PbI<sub>2</sub> film thickness, which is detected by the film-thickness meter in the chamber, can be controlled by the evaporation time.</p><p>Process 4: Immersing the FTO/TiO<sub>2</sub>/PbI<sub>2</sub> film in a solution of MAI in isopropanol (10 mg/ml) allows the formation of MAPbI<sub>3</sub> through the reaction of PbI<sub>2</sub> and MAI. The color of the film changed immediately from red-brown to dark brown, indicating the production of MAPbI<sub>3</sub>. When the reaction was finished, the devices were transferred into pure isopropanol solution to rinse off excess MAI and then kept 5 min at 70 °C for drying on hot plate.</p><p>Process 5: The HTM was deposited by spin-coating a solution of spiro-OMeTAD at 2000 rpm for 35 s in nitrogen atmosphere and left in a closed dry box for 25 min. The spiro-oMeTAD solution was prepared by adding 75 mg of spiro-oMeTAD, 30 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine and 10 mg /m LiN(CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> N to 1 mL of chlorobenzene then stirred for 1 hour before spin-coating.</p><p>Process 6: Au electrode with a thickness 100 nm was deposited on the top of HTM via thermal evaporation in a vacuum chamber (9 × 10<sup>−4</sup> Pa). An evaporation mask was used to define the areas of the devices and the active area of each device was controlled to be 0.1 cm2 (2 × 5 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>), 1 cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> (5 × 20 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>), 4 cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> (20 × 20 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>) and 16 cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> (40 × 40 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Raw chemicals and precursor preparation</title><p>All reagent grade chemicals were obtained commercially from Sigma-Aldrich. The TiO<sub>2</sub> target was bought from China New Metal Company with 5N purity.

In a typical procedure, Methylamine (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>) (13.5 mL, 40 wt% in aqueous solution) reacted with hydroiodic acid (HI) (15.0 mL, 57 wt% in water) in 250 ml round bottomed flask at 0 °C for 2 h with stirring. The solvent and excess CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> were removed using a rotary evaporator and the initial MAI powders were obtained.
