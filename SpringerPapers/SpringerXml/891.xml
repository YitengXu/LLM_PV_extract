The Chinese government has established ecological civilization as a basic strategy guiding China’s future development. The principles of “green development for a beautiful China” and “people-centered development” constitute the core values and visions for China in the new era of civilized development with a sound ecosystem.</p><p id="Par3">The fundamental purpose of ecological civilization is to ensure ecological safety through lower and more efficient use of natural resources, exerting the service function of ecological capital. With reduced emission of carbon and other pollutants, extensive and unsustainable growth mode should be changed to an ecologically friendly development path. Through green development, green prosperity can be realized and people can share benefits of green development, reaching the harmonious coexistence of humanity and nature.</p><p id="Par4"><bold>Respond to climate change</bold>. By 2015, three international legal instruments addressing climate change—namely the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement—had set the framework for global climate governance and low-carbon green development. The Paris Agreement determined “to keep the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels,” and stipulated the “common but differentiated responsibilities” among countries. As a signatory, China has made a commitment to reach a peak of carbon emissions by 2030 and to reduce carbon emission intensity by 60–65% compared with 2005 so as to undertake its responsibilities as a major country in dealing with climate change.</p><p id="Par5"><bold>Green development</bold>. Western countries, especially the EU countries, pay close attention to green development. According to the European Green Deal issued in 2019, by 2050, Europe will become the world’s first “carbon–neutral” area. The newly elected EU institutions came up with the concept of “Green New Deal.” For the first time, China's 13th FYP clearly proposed the green development goal of “overall improvement of ecological environment” by promoting the implementation of resource conservation and intensive utilization, increasing comprehensive environmental governance, strengthening ecological protection and restoration, actively responding to global climate change, and developing green and environmentally friendly industries—it also identified 27 green development projects in four categories. Green development has become one of the five concepts and a strategic and programmatic idea guiding the development of China in the new era.</p><p id="Par6">“<bold>Green city</bold>”. Many European and North American cities have put forward goals and action plans of building green cities and carbon–neutral communities, and published important documents to promote urban green development, such as the <italic>Aalborg Charter</italic>, <italic>Aalborg Commitment</italic>, <italic>Leipzig Charter</italic> and <italic>Freiburg Charter</italic>. In its Vancouver: 2020 action plan of the greenest city, Vancouver has proposed the goal of “zero-carbon, zero-waste, and sound ecosystem” and a series of target areas, including energy, water and transportation, to build a green city of prosperity and development.</p><p id="Par7">Chinese cities are areas with concentrated population and economy and intensive resource consumption and emission; green development becomes the only choice for Chinese cities. In recent years, the Chinese government and relevant departments have promoted development action plans such as “sponge city,” “ecological city,” “green new area,” “low-carbon city,” “low-carbon community,” “ecological restoration,” “urban repair,” and “waste-free city,” carried out many pilot and demonstration projects, and explored the ways of urban green development.</p><p id="Par8"><bold>Green technology</bold>. The term “green technology” refers to technologies that can reduce consumption, decrease emission, and improve ecological environment, including technologies applied in exploitation, production, manufacturing, construction, planning, design, utilization, maintenance, and management. A wide application of green technology is necessary for cities’ development. China's international commitments to addressing climate change and its emission reduction policies, as well as its increasingly stringent environmental governance policy requirements are driving the application of green technology in urban areas on a larger scale.</p><p id="Par9">The 14th FYP period is a critical one for China's urbanization and urban development transformation. Boosting new urbanization with the development of green and low-carbon technology and promoting green development and application of green technology during new urbanization are core tasks for China to cope with climate change, as well as to stimulate the green economy after COVID-19.</p><p id="Par10"><bold>Popularization and application of green technology</bold>. In 2018, the Chinese government proposed that we should promote green development, accelerate the building of legal institutions and policy guidance for green production and consumption, establish and improve the economic system of green, low-carbon, and circular development. It also proposed that we build a market-oriented green technology innovation system to develop green finance. According to the <italic>Guidance on Building a Market-Oriented Green Technology Innovation System</italic> issued in 2019, the market-oriented green technology innovation system should be basically completed by 2022.</p><p id="Par11">Green technology has good positive externalities, good social and environmental benefits; green technology has a certain public welfare nature, and has huge potential market demand, and should be supported by society and government. Under the traditional resource utilization model and market pricing mechanism, green technology often lacks price competitiveness. We should adopt a resource pricing mechanism and ask producers or users to cover all the costs (including external costs) so as to realize fair competition between green and non-green technologies and products. Or we can give support to green technologies and products through proper fiscal subsidies. Green technology should continue to innovate so as to lower costs and increase market competitiveness.</p><p id="Par12">Green technology is an emerging high-tech and innovative sector attracting a lot of attention. We should actively encourage and support its development and build a credible information distribution system and full life-cycle assessment procedure to avoid falling into the trap of blind promotion.</p><p id="Par13">Popularization of green technology should involve wide participation from the government, higher learning institutions, professional organizations, enterprises, social entities, and the public. The government should establish a complete system of laws, regulations and policies to encourage universities and professional institutions to participate in the research and development of green technology; encourage enterprises to actively research and develop, produce, and apply green technology, while paying more attention to the differentiated demands and consumption abilities of different gender, age, and capability groups; advocate green lifestyle and green consumption concepts to the society and the public; and form a good environment for the whole society to participate in green development and apply green technology.</p><p id="Par14"><bold>The research emphasis of green technology SPS</bold>. The SPS on <italic>Major green technology innovation and its implementation mechanism</italic>, issued by China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development (CCICED) is committed to the research of green development, promotion and application of green technology, evaluation methods, laws, and policies in urban areas. Through research, it recommends 10–20 scalable green innovation technologies, conducts a comprehensive assessment from the perspective of the full life cycle to provide technical support for the green development policy of the 14th FYP, and at the same time, puts forward suggestions on the policy guarantee system of green technology promotion.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Characteristics, Problems and Opportunities of Urbanization and Urban Development</title><p id="Par15"><bold>Urbanization and urban population growth have created an increasing amount of pressure and opportunities for urban transformation</bold>. With the urban population accounting for 60% of the total population in 2019, China has transformed from a traditional agricultural society to an urban society, and it will see a further increase in its urban population by about 150 million over the next 10 years. Among the floating population who are already working and living in urban areas but not officially registered as urban residents, about 100–150 million will settle down in cities and counties to enjoy family reunion. The population increase and the need to settle down will generate huge new demand and resource consumption, and also provide the cities with opportunity to change the development mode and optimize resource allocation.</p><p id="Par16"><bold>Cities are where most resources are consumed and most carbon is emitted, but also the core places for green and low-carbon development</bold>. Industry, construction, and transportation are the three major resource consumers and are mainly concentrated in cities. Cities are where most emissions are generated and also the core places for achieving green and low-carbon development throughout society. Under the influence of GDP-oriented policies and existing financing and taxation policies, a model featured with extensive use of resources and blind expansion of land was formed in Chinese urban areas. Fragmented urban layout, inefficient use of land, dislocation of infrastructure and public services, and inefficient transportation operations have led to a perpetuating high level of carbon footprint and created a “lock-in effect.”</p><p id="Par17"><bold>Increases in expansion of consumption are putting greater pressure on supply, and also driving a transformation of lifestyle and consumption</bold>. Rising per capita income has witnessed a continuous expansion of China’s middle-income group which now accounts for about 30% of the total population. The driving force for social development has shifted from meeting the needs for food and clothing to pursuing a better life. The values and lifestyles of the middle class are taking shape. On the one hand, increased consumption power of urban residents is leading to more resource consumption for material and cultural needs and more emissions. On the other hand, the emerging middle class and well-educated young people are more open to green and low-carbon value and rational lifestyles. It is a good opportunity to advocate low-carbon lifestyles and consumption, and to promote green development and green technology in cities.</p><p id="Par18"><bold>Policy change from focusing on seeking additional resources to focusing on utilizing existing resources has created new space for applying green technologies</bold>. Chinese cities have accumulated a large amount of existing assets, including inefficiently used or idle land, infrastructure, industrial, and civil buildings. China is asking its cities to shift the focus of their development from increasing additional assets to utilizing existing assets efficiently. It proposes new ways and scenarios of promoting green technologies, including but not limited to multifunctional and hybrid land development, low-carbon reconstruction and multiple use of buildings, organic renewal of cities, development of low-carbon communities, green slow-moving transportation, distributed energy supply, and the principles of the circular economy.</p><p id="Par19"><bold>Huge differences between cities require different green development strategies and green technology supplies</bold>. China's natural resource and population are extremely unevenly distributed, there is a gap of natural condition and development level among the eastern coastal, central and western regions, and the northern and southern regions. There are also big differences in development levels, needs, and capabilities between large cities, mid-size cities, and small towns. Different areas respond differently to natural disasters caused by extreme weather, rising sea levels caused by climate change, etc. Urban green development should have a “common but different” strategy and path; green technology research and promotion should be highly targeted and adaptable. It also provides various driving forces for the development and innovation of green technology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Vision and Criteria for Urban Green Development</title><p id="Par20"><bold>The vision of urban green development</bold> is to make green industrial production and everyday life the mainstream choice of society through green technology innovation, promotion, and application, and to <bold>build beautiful cities that are green and prosperous, low-carbon and intensive, recycling and reusing, fair and inclusive, safe and healthy to set a “Chinese example” for global sustainable development</bold>.</p><p id="Par21"><bold>Green and prosperous cities</bold>: We should build a high-quality green economy, promote the development of low-carbon industries, circular economy, and green consumption, and make green development the core competency of cities and the core value of society.</p><p id="Par22"><bold>Low-carbon intensive cities</bold>: We should optimize urban layout, advocate mixed land use, encourage green transportation, promote green buildings, green infrastructure and low-carbon communities, and completely abandon the urban development model of high consumption and high emission.</p><p id="Par23"><bold>Recyclable and reusing cities</bold>: Cities should aim to use all resources to their maximum efficiency, including underused city and building space, transportation that shares resources such as bikes and cars. Waste can be recycled or reused. Resource recycling replaces the expanding and incremental development mode.</p><p id="Par24"><bold>Fair and inclusive cities</bold>: We should provide residents with fair access to quality life and ecological capital services regardless of gender, status, age and identity (<italic>hukou</italic>) status; provide residents with equal access to and participation in green development.</p><p id="Par25"><bold>Safe and healthy cities</bold>: With a continued focus on ecological conservation, we should mitigate conflicts between cities and nature, protect valuable natural resources and ecological capital for contemporary and future generations of residents, so as to create a healthy and livable environment, and improve the health and well-being of urban residents.</p><p id="Par26"><bold>In order to achieve the vision, urbanization and urban development should follow:</bold><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par27"><bold>Criterion 1</bold><bold>:</bold> Urban development serves to meet people’s need for a good life and to achieve harmony between humanity and nature, not just for economic growth;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par28"><bold>Criterion 2</bold><bold>:</bold> We must pursue prosperity, but just as importantly we must make direct contributions to the reduction of global resource consumption and carbon emissions while adopting climate-resilient development strategies to cope with changes;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par29"><bold>Criterion 3</bold><bold>:</bold> Urban green development not only requires the government to make great efforts but also should give full play to market entities and encourage broad participation by enterprises and the public;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par30"><bold>Criterion 4</bold><bold>:</bold> Urban green development should be oriented toward fairness and justice, and should not harm the welfare of women, the elderly, children, and mobile residents or deprive vulnerable groups of their development rights;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par31"><bold>Criterion 5</bold><bold>:</bold> Urban green development should establish differentiated strategies and paths to adapt to all natural conditions, different stages of development, and development needs and capabilities of cities and regions at different levels;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par32"><bold>Criterion 6</bold><bold>:</bold> Urban green development should be oriented toward effectiveness and applicability, and requires multi-dimension life-cycle assessments of green technologies to avoid following suit and steer away from “new technology pitfalls.”</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Goals and Approach for Urban Green Development</title><p id="Par33"><bold>General goal</bold>: Based on the concept of “ecological civilization” and new development outlook, we aim to realize modernization in a way that human and nature live in harmony, with such spatial layout and economic activity distribution pattern that are conducive to conserving resources and protecting the environment. “Green and low-carbon” will become the theme of both work and life, and the idea of green development will be implemented in all aspects and processes of urban economy, as well as social development and environmental evolution. Ultimately, green and low-carbon development will become the norm, and the vision of “beautiful China” will be materialized.</p><p id="Par34"><bold>2020–2025</bold> (The 14th FYP in China): Priority is given to the green development and green technology application in key sectors including water, energy, architecture, urban planning, transport, food, etc. to overcome the lock-in effect. Starting with pilot programs, policy measures and framework of standards should be improved; meanwhile, a green finance market that harmonizes with its international counterparts should be put in place. Promotion of green solutions and products among industry and consumers will be boosted through the constant improvement in measures such as emission permitting, supervision, reporting, monitoring, auditing, and standards formulation. During this stage, the total emissions of greenhouse gases will be significantly cut and the eco-environment quality notably improved.</p><p id="Par35"><bold>2025–2030</bold>: Put in place a world-leading technical system for green development; popularize the concept of urban green development and the application of green technology. Sophisticated legal, institutional, and policy frameworks should be established so that the way of production and life is directed to shift toward a greener style. China should aim for the early-attainment and over-achievement of its national commitments under “2030 UN Sustainable Development Goals” and the Paris Agreement.</p><p id="Par36"><bold>Post-2030</bold>: With reference to the national development objectives and the goals of 2 and 1.5 °C in the Paris Agreement, drawing lessons from the EU’s zero-emission goals and roadmap for 2050, green technology should be applied in cities across China. An economic system featuring green development will be established. Resource conservation, circular use of materials, and in-depth emission cutting should become the universal themes. Relevant legal instruments and policy measures should be institutionalized to guide and support green production and consumption. By 2050, green development will be the paradigm of choice for the whole of China, where according to the plan, the vision of “beautiful China” will be realized. With these achievements, China will make its outstanding contributions to the global 1.5 °C goal.</p><p id="Par37">In accordance with the general goals and stage goals stated above, the objectives for urban green development in six key sectors are listed in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">7.1</xref>.

In order to cover all relevant processes in life, work, and leisure of urban citizens, the system should account for each link of the value chain: “resource conservation and utilization; production and building; consumption and use; decomposition and recycling.” The green technical system would facilitate the realization of green development goals by addressing the salient issues of “not green enough” and high emissions in urban development in China. For a green technical system to be established, technologies on the following fronts should be developed and promoted:</p><p id="Par39"><bold>Conservation and reduction in the use of shared natural resources</bold>. Ecological red lines must be strictly observed, and the natural landscape should be left undisturbed as much as possible.

The policy document emphasizes that urban construction must be “people-oriented,” taking into account the multi-dimensional development goals of economy, society, resources, environment, and culture, and attaching importance to the role of reform and innovation and technological progress. These policy documents show that the Chinese government attaches great importance to urban green development and also proposes goals and requirements for urban green development (Tables <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">7.2</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 7.2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Selected macro-level policy documents for urban green development</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Time</p></th><th align="left"><p>Title of document</p></th><th align="left"><p>Key points</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td char="." align="char"><p>2014.3</p></td><td align="left"><p>“National New Urbanization Planning (2014–2020)”</p></td><td align="left"><p>Enhance urban sustainability; build livable, dynamic, and modern cities with unique characteristics</p></td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char"><p>2015.4</p></td><td align="left"><p>“Opinions on Accelerating the Development of Ecological Civilization by the Central Committee of CPC and the State Council”</p></td><td align="left"><p>Building a society featuring resource conservation and environmental friendliness; mainstream the values of “ecological civilization”</p></td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char"><p>2015.12</p></td><td align="left"><p>“Gazette for the 2015 City Work Conference of CPC Central Committee and the State Council”</p></td><td align="left"><p>Sustainable urban development and livability</p></td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char"><p>2016.2</p></td><td align="left"><p>“Opinions on Driving New Urbanization to Greater Depths by the State Council”</p></td><td align="left"><p>New urbanization, sustainable and healthy economic growth</p></td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char"><p>2016.2</p></td><td align="left"><p>“Opinions on Improving the Management of Urban Planning and Construction”</p></td><td align="left"><p>Manage orderly construction, moderate land development, and efficient operation of cities; build livable and dynamic urban environment with unique characteristics</p></td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char"><p>2016.3</p></td><td align="left"><p>“Outline for the Thirteenth Five Year Plan”</p></td><td align="left"><p>“Urbanize the people”; optimize urban spatial layout and morphology; build harmonious, livable cities; achieve coordinated development of urban and rural areas</p></td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char"><p>2016.9</p></td><td align="left"><p>“China’s National Plan on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”</p></td><td align="left"><p>Build inclusive, safe, disaster-resilient, and sustainable cities and human settlements</p></td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char"><p>2016.12</p></td><td align="left"><p>“China’s National Plan on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”</p></td><td align="left"><p>Build innovation demonstration zones for National Sustainable Development Agenda</p></td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char"><p>2017.4</p></td><td align="left"><p>“Chapter on Urbanization and Technology Innovation for Urban Development” of the Thirteenth FYP</p></td><td align="left"><p>Technological innovation system in urban development</p></td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char"><p>2017.10</p></td><td align="left"><p>Report of the CPC 19th National Congress</p></td><td align="left"><p>New type industrialization, informatisation, urbanization, and modernization of agriculture; shared responsibility and benefits of growth; harmonious coexistence of humans and nature</p></td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char"><p>2018.8</p></td><td align="left"><p>“Opinions on Developing Safe Cities by the Central Committee of CPC and the State Council”</p></td><td align="left"><p>Urban security, disaster prevention, and public security</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par45">In response to climate change, promoting energy conservation, emission reduction, and low-carbon development, the Energy Conservation Law was promulgated in 1998, and the Renewable Energy Law was promulgated in 2006, gradually forming three types of systemic policy tools: policies to address climate change, climate change assessment report, energy-saving and emission reduction work plan. The country has successively issued the “China National Plan to Address Climate Change,” “The 13th Five-Year Comprehensive Work Plan on Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction,” “The Medium- and Long-Term Development Program for Energy,” “Administrative Measures for the Operation of the Clean Development Mechanism Project,” and “Green Travel Action Plan” along with many other policy documents. In terms of standard specifications and technical regulations, national or local technical regulations have been formulated for cities, communities, buildings and other fields, including “Green Building Evaluation Standards,” “Guidelines for Corporate Greenhouse Gas Accounting and Reporting,” and “Low-Carbon Community Pilot” Construction Guide, etc. However, compared with the EU's green and low-carbon laws, policy financing, and market standards that complement each other, China's urban green development and green technology promotion and protection systems are still not perfect (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">7.1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">7.2</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 7.1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The development course of low-carbon development policy in China</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/513789_1_En_7_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 7.2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The major law and policy of China's energy-saving and low-carbon development</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/513789_1_En_7_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Analysis of Existing Problems of Urban Green Development</title><p id="Par46">Despite the consensus on green development among cities, some problems remain prominent in its implementation.</p><p id="Par47"><bold>Legislation lags behind practice</bold>. When it comes to green development, China lacks a systematic legislation framework. Existing laws and regulations are primarily single-purpose for issues such as environmental protection, pollution prevention and treatment, or energy use, etc., with stress on the limits. There are no laws to direct comprehensive green development and carbon reduction. Green development is more driven by government policy rather than continuously bolstered by laws and regulations.</p><p id="Par48"><bold>Goals and indicators for emission reductions are absent</bold>. The currently binding targets for emissions reductions are too conservative and fail to match the commitments China made at the Paris Climate Conference and the global trend of going green. The lack of systematic objectives has made it difficult to allocate tasks and responsibilities to local governments.</p><p id="Par49"><bold>Coordination between departments is weak</bold>. Green development is a systematic cause that requires the coordination of multiple departments. However, because the division of responsibilities is not clearly defined, and the coordination mechanism is weak, no one embraces the responsibility. Take the shared bike service as an example: it involves over 10 departments and various layers of the government. Some departments welcome the service while some others prefer putting restraints. Such inconsistency among different decision-makers finally gave rise to a large-scale “quick flood and ebb” phenomenon.</p><p id="Par50"><bold>The green financing system is still next to non-existent</bold>. China has seen a significant increase in green and environmentally themed investment year-on-year over the last couple of years. However, the source of green funding is rather limited: companies relied almost solely on themselves to raise the capital needed since there are few other options available. Green finance is still in its infancy in China. Problems such as the inconsistency in green accreditation and the confusion in claiming green finance collateral have kept financial institutions away from funding green projects. Besides, there are no expressly stated principles and guidance for green investment in the financial sector.</p><p id="Par51"><bold>Businesses are not keen on the idea, and thus the green value chain has not taken shape</bold>. At present, the popular way of encouraging businesses to participate in green technology innovation and application is through fiscal subsidy. But candidate technologies were often not evaluated in a scientific manner; consequently, many projects that are truly “green” are not properly subsidized. Also, China doesn’t have a mature carbon trading market that can generate enough profit as reward. The poor liquidity and low pricing of carbon in the current market have held companies back from taking part. Besides, China doesn’t have the policy tools to encourage and facilitate knowledge transfer, commercialization, consumption, and application of green technology.</p><p id="Par52"><bold>The support system for green technology innovation is not well developed</bold>. Technological innovation is the key underpinning pillar for green development. Unfortunately, on that front, the current situation in China is that while universities are enthusiastic about R&amp;D, businesses take quite the opposite attitude when it comes to green technology and products. International collaboration is another weak point. The status quo makes the innovation community slow in picking up market demands and incapable of effectively translating R&amp;D results into solutions and products that address business and household needs.</p><p id="Par53"><bold>Public awareness and participation are low</bold>. The values of green and low-carbon have not yet taken root in society. The reasons for this include: the general public don’t know where and how to take part in urban green development; there is a lack of a trustworthy platform to disclose green performance and emissions data; there is not yet a professional and inviting social education system; etc. On the other hand, as people’s incomes rise, consumerism and hedonism are becoming widespread, which has aggravated the problems of environmental degradation, resource depletion, and carbon emission.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Challenges in the Innovation and Application of Green Technology</title><p id="Par54">Urban green development has great bearing on the fulfilment of national emissions commitments. Over the past two decades, urban development in China has been moved toward heavy investment, large consumption, and high emissions. Tremendous resources have been invested in the water, energy, and transport sectors. This approach has addressed the supply shortage problem but did not give much consideration to the green transformation of supply and services. In urban planning and land use, the expansion of built-up areas has consumed huge amounts of land and construction materials. As a result, while work and life conditions have improved, the problems of misallocation of land supply, overcrowding of residents and buildings, and an excessive number of high-rises have become more serious. Studies reveal that material production, construction, and operation of buildings in China account for as much as 40% of its total carbon emissions—and this percentage is still rising sharply as urban development continues. It is imperative that China adopt more stringent carbon emission standards and renew its commitment to shifting development mode toward urban green development and wider application of green technologies. That is the path China must take in order to fulfil its “intended national independent contribution” to the Paris Agreement.</p><p id="Par55"><bold>Urban development mode is built upon the old approach and short of motives and measures for adopting green development</bold>. Under current circumstances, including the fiscal and tax regime and the GDP-based performance assessment method, city governments cannot help keeping economic growth high on their agenda. Cities continue to source capital for infrastructure construction from the proceeds of land supply, instead of actively seeking to change modes and pursue green development. Though green development slogans were occasionally invented, many efforts were aborted once a city faced setbacks. On one inspection tour made by a central government task force to detect environmental breaches, a total of RMB 1.43 billion fines were ordered and over 18,000 cadres were punished. Those figures suggest that local governments haven’t done a perfect job on pollution control and the implementation of green development concept.</p><p id="Par56"><bold>The lack of scientific evaluation and performance assessment mechanisms has led to the uncoordinated application of green technologies</bold>. When green technologies and green products were scaled up, more credit is given to their economic performance over green features. More often than not, they were pitched in “promotion campaigns” that ignore the systematic nature of a city and the life-cycle value flow of green products. Some so-called “green” technologies had not been evaluated on their life-cycle performance and potential externalities before they were commercialized, thus causing waste of resources. Examples to this point include shared bikes and integrated underground corridors. In the “Opinions on Nurturing a Market-Oriented Innovation System for Green Technology” issued by the central government in 2019, it was stressed that a good evaluation system should be established to step up evaluation of green technology, demonstrating the importance of proper evaluation and the urgency to catch up on that front.</p><p id="Par57"><bold>Priorities should be set for the whole range of green technologies</bold>. Green city and technology have countless aspects, including “technology clusters” in various areas, e.g., material technology, biotechnology, pollutant treatment, resource recycling, clean production, etc. which are relevant to carbon emissions, environment, energy, resources, manufacturing, transport, infrastructure, building, food, land, and other areas. On the other hand, cities are suffering increasingly from problems such as carbon emission, energy consumption and resource depletion, environmental degradation and pollution, heat island effect, big city malaise, etc. Therefore, while a comprehensive approach is needed in promoting green technologies, priorities should be set to address pressing issues and the near-term demands of citizens. Technical breakthroughs can thus be made by selecting key issues and concentrating resources on solving them.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Green Technology Key Area Identification</title><p id="Par58">The realization of urban green development needs to focus on material green technologies and methods in all aspects of urban planning, construction, operation, and maintenance.

One is systematic scoring based on a detailed indicator framework, with weight being given to each indicator. Evaluation conclusions are based on the final score. This approach applies mostly to clearly defined evaluation objects. Examples include the U.S.’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standards in green architecture evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], the DGNB system of Germany [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], the Green Building (GB) Tool in Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], etc. The other approach is framework evaluation, in which the priorities of evaluation are preset with an evaluation framework. This approach is mostly applied to the evaluation of green technologies in the broad sense. For example, the S&amp;P Global Ratings Green Evaluation takes transparency, governance, and mitigation/adaptability as the primary dimensions; under each, there are secondary evaluation items to be scored or rated against [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The evaluation is then summarized around the three topics of low-carbon, finance, and governance/management. This approach can be used for seven sectors, including green architecture, green energy, water resource, green mobility, energy efficiency, nuclear energy, and fossil fuel-fired power generation.</p><p id="Par65">The promotion of green technologies in China has mostly taken the form of promotion catalogues, and no evaluation method or system has been established for green technologies. The <italic>Evaluation Standards for Green Architecture</italic> published by the Ministry of Housing and Urban and Rural Development have not been widely applied nor substantiated by the capabilities of professional technical institutions. In the absence of a comprehensive life-cycle all-in-cost evaluation, many so-called green technologies in China have actually created negative impacts such as waste of resource and safety hazards once scaled up. Examples include shared bikes, EVs, and integrated infrastructure corridors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Recommended Framework for Evaluation</title><p id="Par66">Evaluation of green technologies should be done based on measures of life cycle and all-in cost to investigate their effectiveness, economic feasibility, scalability of emissions, and consumption reductions as well as user acceptability.</p><p id="Par67"><bold>Life-cycle evaluation: Before, during, and after the application</bold>. The focus of green technologies should not be just on their application per se with no regard given to pre- and post-application green performance. We should use the life-cycle evaluation of green technologies from their conception to scrapping. That is, conception and design, resource pooling, operation, maintenance, decommissioning, and decomposition should be investigated to demonstrate the technology’s performance in terms of emissions reductions.</p><p id="Par68"><bold>Multi-dimensional, all-in cost evaluation: Incremental cost versus incremental benefits</bold>. When defining the dimensions for green technologies, consideration must be given to economic returns and financial feasibility because that is the foundation for scaling up; in the meantime, the acceptance and recognition from the general public must be considered in addition to the carbon-reduction benefits and economic returns. Benefits should thus be understood as a comprehensive package of economic, environmental, and social returns. In view of that, we propose a multi-dimensional evaluation framework that covers the aspects of economics, environment, and social, in which the breakeven is defined based on overall cost.</p><p id="Par69"><bold>An evaluation framework involving three stages and three core dimensions</bold>. The life-cycle evaluation of a green technology covers the three stages of <bold>before, during, and after its application</bold> and the three main aspects—<bold>economic, environmental, and social.</bold> The evaluation makes overall cost and benefits analysis for green technologies through formulating a comprehensive evaluation framework.</p><p id="Par70">The economic dimension looks into the incremental cost and incremental benefits of a green technology in its three stages of before, during, and after the application.

This technology can achieve a full record of food information at the production site and circulation links so that it can be documented; at the same time, each link is interlocked to avoid data loss or human intervention in the circulation process, to ensure food safety and reliability. It allows consumers and managers to easily and quickly understand food sources and transportation processes, as well as enhance food safety monitoring.</p><p id="Par147"><bold>Vertical agricultural technology</bold>: This is a combination of environmental control technology and architectural agriculture integration, that is, in urban buildings, making full use of renewable energy and greenhouse technology, with the help of hydroponic cultivation, modern LED lighting and seed selection and other innovative technologies, to increase agricultural production and land utilization.</p><p id="Par148">This is a major technology for urban agriculture and a popular investment field in developed countries. Vertical farms have the advantages of having a small footprint and high yield per unit area; intensive use of water and fertilizers, no heavy metals and pesticide residues; localized production and distribution to make food fresher, etc., which can achieve efficient planting under resource shortage conditions and meet green food demand. It can also improve environmental efficiency, with multiple benefits. The United States and Japan have already carried out pilot projects, and Singapore has adopted it as one of the main technologies for realizing food self-sufficiency with a target of producing 30% of food within the city by 2030.</p><p id="Par149"><bold>Digital food platform technology</bold>: This platform will connect the various supply chain links from production to consumption, allowing consumers to directly connect with producers to ensure the fresh and convenient supply of agricultural products and the efficient allocation of resources.</p><p id="Par150">This technology is a major one in the field of transportation and sales in the field of smart agriculture. Research by the International Food Policy Research Institute shows that from production to consumption, the global food waste rate is as high as about 30% due to the influence of middlemen, but the freshness is difficult to guarantee. This technology can eliminate intermediate links and directly target agricultural products and food procurement. Studies have shown that if implemented properly, the loss rate can be reduced by 50%.

However, positive change is not inevitable, and city leadership must be forward-looking and agile enough to steward this change for the benefit of all society.</p><p id="Par152">In cities, the 4IR can be thought of as the layering of a series of technologies that brings physical infrastructure into the digital realm. Ubiquitous connectivity is provided by the Internet and the high bandwidth of the 5G network; this enables the IoT of a city, which consists of sensors that can detect and digitize everything from the temperature of buildings to leaks in pipes and the prevalence of viruses in wastewater. The digitizing of the physical space creates a digital twin of the city in the form of data streams that can be manipulated using AI algorithms or logged and traded on blockchains.

The circular economy is a system of production and consumption that aims to keep all products and materials at their highest value at all times and in which the output of one process becomes an input to another, eliminating waste from the system and minimizing the need for the extraction of virgin materials while eliminating the use of toxic materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. China was among the first countries in the world to legislate for a circular economy, implementing the Circular Economy Promotion Law in 2009 and has continued to be a leader in the field. A recent study by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation found that the further application of circular economy principles in Chinese cities could save Chinese consumers RMB 70 trillion (around USD 9.9 trillion) and reduce greenhouse gases by 23% through 2040 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p id="Par170"><bold>Circular Economy Support Green Technologies Across the Six Pillars</bold>. The circular economy touches all pillars outlined in the report, as it deals with the flows of resources around a city. These flows are complex systems that intersect across different aspects of the city. Therefore, the implementation of the circular economy is intimately tied to systems analysis and thinking. Illustrations of this approach in food, building, and consumer waste show how various changes at different points of the cycle can shift the whole system.</p><p id="Par171">For example, the urban food system touches on the food, water, mobility, and energy pillar and is a good example of where the circular economy can be applied. Key raw material inputs into food production are nitrogen, phosphorous, and potash, of which China consumed 54.16 million tons in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. China is self-sufficient in nitrogen and phosphorus but dependent on potash imports (43.8% dependence in 2017) mostly from Russia, Canada, and Belarus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Food then enters the city by truck, affecting mobility by adding to traffic and pollution. Before it is eaten, globally, one third of all calories are lost in the form of food waste either at the transport, processing, or retail stage or in individual households [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p><p id="Par172">Under a circular system enabled by green technology, land and water would be used as efficiently as possible with some degree of vertical farming in cities that could be built in under-utilized space in the urban environment and save water by using hydroponics in a closed water system while decreasing traffic from transport. Food waste would be minimized along the value chain and in the home, in part by using digital platforms. Any unavoidable waste would be converted into usable products or processed industrially using anaerobic digestion. This would produce an output of methane gas for renewable energy production and compost to be returned to food production. Sewage sludge can also be harvested and used as an input into agriculture. For example, in the Netherlands, the Amersfoort sewage treatment plant produces 900 tonnes of high-grade fertilizer per annum as well as purifying wastewater for reuse in cities. According to government figures, wastewater in China contains nearly 120,000 tonnes of phosphorus, which could be better captured with the implementation of the right technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par173">In construction, which globally consumes 42.4 billion tonnes of material per year, there are many interventions and technologies which could better use construction waste, including the 3D printing of new buildings using waste materials. However, the most important lever comes at the design stage. Buildings such as Circl, a mixed-use restaurant and office building in Amsterdam, are designed and built with eventual disassembly in mind—a concept known as “buildings as material banks.” To accompany these buildings and record the valuable materials inside, developers create materials passports; these log a blueprint of the building, including the value and location of valuable components, to allow for easy disassembly and assessment of embedded material value, leading to higher recycling rates. Using recycled steel uses only 16–20% of the energy of virgin steel, while in the case of aluminum, the number goes down to 5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p><p id="Par174">At a global level, only 20% of Waste of Electrical Electronic Equipment (WEEE) is formally collected and recycled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. These products can be a valuable source of scarce and valuable materials. The global value of WEEE is estimated to be more than USD 60 billion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. A study by the World Economic Forum and Tsinghua University found that in China only 10% of aluminum, 6% of tin, 0.6% of cobalt and 0% of rare earths are captured from scrap electronics products. If 100% of these metals were recycled, the material value alone would be worth USD 3.3 billion by 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].</p><p id="Par175">China has also outlined ambitious policies for the circular economy in industry, including recycling of 50% of key products by 2025 and the inclusion of 20% recycled materials in all new products. Many companies with production facilities in China have also made commitments to the circular economy and the use of recycled material in products. There is a significant opportunity for public and private stakeholders to come together around this goal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].</p><p id="Par176"><bold>Incorporating the Circular Economy Into Urban Development Planning</bold>. There are a number of ways that the circular economy can be implemented into urban planning and the application of green technology.</p><p id="Par177">Firstly, it is important to have a circular economy plan based on a system analysis of the city. This should outline the opportunities for all stakeholders including startups, research institutes, government departments, urban planners, and the private sector, as well as aiming to engage citizens in the circular economy.</p><p id="Par178">For example, the London Circular Economy Roadmap provides guidance for the acceleration of the British capital’s transition to become a circular city.

These could include: charges that take into account the negative externalities of single-use items such as plastic bags; tax breaks for the use of recycled materials in products; and incentive mechanisms such as extended producer responsibility. Consider also unproductive policies, such as those which inhibit or tax waste movements in and out of manufacturing zones or subsidize virgin feedstocks.</p><p id="Par180">Thirdly, facilitate investment with government funds or blended finance models into innovation for the circular economy.

Governance for the circular economy can be complex: as outlined above, material often flows in cities across many different areas and therefore different departments. Changing an entire system to implement the circular economy in cities requires collaboration with many stakeholders including the private sector, responsible for much of the innovation and implementation; citizens, who need to change how they use resources; and academia, who have specialized knowledge. Due to the cross-cutting nature of the circular economy, many cities, regions, or countries have made use of a platform approach which brings together all of the key players in a structured way to collaborate on implementing the circular economy in a city or region or around a particular challenge, examples include:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par182">The European Sustainable Phosphorus Platform (ESPP): The ESPP works with a diverse range of stakeholders and ensures knowledge sharing; creates network opportunities in the phosphorus management field; and addresses regulatory obstacles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par183">The Platform BAMB—Buildings as Material Banks—connecting 15 partners from seven European countries to create circular solutions in the building sector.

In the promotion of food safety technology, then, consideration must be given to the different roles, needs, and opinions of women and men, and a women-friendly approach will be adopted in technology design.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec40"><title>Policy Recommendations</title><sec id="Sec41"><title>List of Recommended Major Green Technology During the 14th FYP Period</title><p id="Par215">Based on the prominent problems, visions, and goals of green development in Chinese cities, and combined with Chinese and foreign practices and current technical progress, Chinese and foreign experts jointly proposed the technical development direction of six major sectors, and recommended the following 20 technologies during the 14th FYP which shall refer to Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">7.6</xref> for details.<table-wrap id="Tab6"><label>Table 7.6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Recommendations for green technology in six major sectors during the 14th FYP</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Major sectors</p></th><th align="left"><p>Technical development director</p></th><th align="left"><p>Recommended technology</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3"><p>Water</p></td><td align="left"><p>Sewage Treatment and Water Recycling Economy</p></td><td align="left"><p>Sewage Treatment and Plant, Network and River Integrated Quality and Efficiency Improvement Technology</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Utilization of Reclaimed Water</p></td><td align="left"><p>Water Quality Guarantee Technology for Recycled Water System</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Utilization of Reclaimed Water and Non-Revenue Water Management</p></td><td align="left"><p>Smart Operation Technology for Recycled Water</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="4"><p>Energy</p></td><td align="left"><p>Integrated Green Energy Grid</p></td><td align="left"><p>Microgrid Technology</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2"><p>Near-Zero-Emission Cooling and Heating</p></td><td align="left"><p>Industrial Waste Heat Central Heating Technology</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Middle-deep Geothermal Heating Utilization Technology</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Energy Internet</p></td><td align="left"><p>Integrated Energy Internet Management Platform Technology</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="4"><p>Transportation</p></td><td align="left"><p>Intelligent Transportation System</p></td><td align="left"><p>MaaS Travel Service Technology</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2"><p>New Energy Vehicles and Supporting Facilities</p></td><td align="left"><p>Hydrogen-powered Vehicle Technology</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Intelligent Charging System Technology</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Transportation Demand Management and Cycling Trip</p></td><td align="left"><p>Bicycle Special Road Technology</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="4"><p>Building</p></td><td align="left"><p>Healthy Building</p></td><td align="left"><p>Building Three-dimensional Greening Technology</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Green Building</p></td><td align="left"><p>“Steel Structure + Modular Internal Space” Technology</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Near-Zero Energy Building</p></td><td align="left"><p>Photovoltaic, BIPV, Distributed Energy Storage and DC Power Supply Technology</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Smart Operation and Maintenance of Building</p></td><td align="left"><p>Intelligent Building Cluster System Technology</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2"><p>Land Utilization and Planning</p></td><td align="left"><p>Green Urban Form</p></td><td align="left"><p>Technical Package for Green Urban Form</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Green, Livable, and Carbon–Neutral Block</p></td><td align="left"><p>Technical Package for Green, Livable, and Carbon–Neutral Block</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3"><p>Food</p></td><td align="left"><p>Food Traceability</p></td><td align="left"><p>Food Safety Information Monitoring and Tracking Technology</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Urban Agriculture</p></td><td align="left"><p>Vertical Agricultural Technology</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Smart Agriculture</p></td><td align="left"><p>Digital Food Platform Technology</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec42"><title>Policy Recommendations for Green Development and Technological Innovation During the 14th FYP Period</title><p id="Par216">Lessons were drawn from developed countries (e.g., EU members, Japan, the United States) on how they successfully promoted green development at the state level to municipal and then to community levels. Recommendations are therefore made on how China should improve its green development and technological innovation, not least by developing favourable legal, policy, and institutional measures. The recommendations are hereby elaborated from the following four perspectives: legislation, government policy and management, market player contributions, and public engagement.</p><p id="Par217"><bold>The National Strategy and Legislative Security</bold>: Green development has become a statement of the country’s development strategy. We should also clearly propose the overall national green and low-carbon strategy and the overall goal of low-carbon development. We should also accelerate the construction of related legal systems.</p><p id="Par218"><bold>Firstly, a national plan for green development and low-carbon development should be created,</bold> which proposes to fulfill the commitments of the Paris Agreement, to achieve the 2 °C goal and to move toward a carbon–neutral systemic plan.</p><p id="Par219"><bold>Secondly, it is necessary to clarify the total amount of carbon emissions in stages before 2050, to control the target, timetable, and road map</bold> for achieving the target, and to break the total amount down according to provinces and cities. Economically developed regions and cities should be encouraged to assume more responsibility for reducing emissions.</p><p id="Par220"><bold>Thirdly, we have to accelerate the development of a legal system for green and low-carbon development and resource consumption and emission control</bold>. This should encourage cities to formulate and implement carbon-reduction targets, achieve green development, and promote local laws and regulations on green technologies.</p><p id="Par221"><bold>The mechanism construction from government perspective</bold></p><p id="Par222">A complete framework of administrative, fiscal, and tax policy should be built to fully engage the government in promoting, incentivizing, and disciplining green development and green technology.</p><p id="Par223"><bold>Put in place a quota system for carbon emissions</bold>. In such a system, emissions quotas should be determined based on the existing carbon intensity control program and assigned to various levels from state to provinces to cities and counties. The carbon emissions quota will be included in the emissions cutting program and annual work plan of governments at all levels. The quota system can be piloted in more-developed provinces and cities before being rolled out more widely.</p><p id="Par224"><bold>Stress the role of strategic planning as the guidance</bold>. Establish an international alliance of green technologies and innovations to build a communication platform for domestic and foreign companies, decision-makers, and expert groups, and promote continuous communication and joint resolution of green development issues in Chinese cities.</p><p id="Par225"><bold>The mechanism construction from market perspective</bold></p><p id="Par226">A healthy market should be nurtured in order to allow businesses to play their due role in promoting green development and green technology.</p><p id="Par227"><bold>Encourage the market to lead the trend</bold>. The role of businesses as the main market players and the determinant in resource allocation should be respected. A market system that mobilizes businesses to work dynamically on developing green technology and manufacturing green products should be formed.</p><p id="Par228"><bold>Enhance financial support</bold>. The private sector should be encouraged to partake in the green development course. Fundraising by green technology companies should be made easier. The finance market should uphold green principles and devise a complete green financial system.</p><p id="Par229"><bold>Promote research and innovation</bold>. A market-oriented green technology innovation system will be developed in order to attract businesses and professional institutions far and wide to join the cause.</p><p id="Par230"><bold>The mechanism construction from society perspective</bold></p><p id="Par231">Citizens and communities will be educated to follow a green lifestyle; the green well-being of cities and communities will be safeguarded and upheld. A green governance system that has extensive engagement with the public will be championed.</p><p id="Par232"><bold>Implement the emissions data publication system; expand sources for environment data acquisition; and improve transparency</bold>. Catalogues will be published to disclose the environmental performance of businesses and cities. Incentives and punishment will be given according to transparency performance. Statistics from various departments will be integrated into one platform to put all entities under the monitoring eyes of the general public.</p><p id="Par233"><bold>Establish institutional mechanisms that encourage public participation</bold>. We need to shift low-carbon green development from administrative management to social governance, to clarify citizens’ responsibilities, powers, and interests in protecting the environment, to use social media to explain to the public the importance of the promotion and application of green technologies, and how behaviour changes can achieve better green development, thereby raising the awareness of green and low-carbon development in the whole society. Issue laws and regulations to ensure that the public and social organizations participate in decisions related to low-carbon emissions reduction, and introduce relevant policies to encourage the public and society to participate in green and low-carbon development.</p></sec><sec id="Sec43"><title>Policy Recommendations for Green Technology Implementation in the Six Pillars During the 14th FYP Period</title><p id="Par234">On the basis of the overall policy recommendations, combined with the two working methods of technical standards and norms and pilot projects, further specific policy recommendations in six key areas are presented, see Table <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7.7</xref>.
