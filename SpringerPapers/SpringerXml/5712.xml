There is a clear need for ensuring research across the world can be compared, understood and where necessary replicated by fellow researchers. A common set of guidelines to educate, assist and encourage comparativeness is of great importance. On the other hand, the level of effort and attention to detail by an individual researcher should be commensurate with the particular research being conducted. For example, a researcher focusing on interactions of light and temperature should measure all relevant parameters and report a measurement summary that includes sufficient detail allowing for replication. Such detail may be less relevant when the impact of environmental parameters on plant growth and development is not the main research focus. However, it should be noted that the environmental experience of a plant during production can have significant impact when subsequent experiments investigate plants at a molecular, biochemical or genetic level or where species interactions are considered. Thus, researchers are encouraged to make a critical assessment of what parameters are of primary importance in their research and these parameters should be measured and reported.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Content</title><p id="Par2">This paper brings together a collection of parameters that the authors, as members of International Committee on Controlled Environment Guidelines (ICCEG) in consultation with members of our three parent organizations, believe constitute those which should be recorded and reported when publishing scientific data from experiments in greenhouses. It provides recommendations to end users on when, how and where these parameters should be measured along with the appropriate internationally standardized units that should be used.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Science communication</kwd><kwd>Data sharing</kwd><kwd>Quality assurance</kwd><kwd>International standards</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>BioMed Central</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/13007_2015_Article_83.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Life Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Plant Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Biological Techniques</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Biomedical and Life Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="Misc"><p>Deceased: L D Incoll</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p id="Par3">Research greenhouses are important tools for scientists and engineers studying the effects of environmental parameters on the growth and development of a large range of agronomic and ornamental plant species. In addition, the greenhouse environment allows for research to continue year-round so that external environmental influences have minimal effect on the experimental set points. The design and operation of research greenhouse facilities vary significantly from one facility to the next [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Therefore, accurate environmental control and data collection are essential to ensure that experiments can be adequately evaluated by research colleagues and replicated among different facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The paper builds on two previous ICCEG guidelines covering minimum sets of
parameters that should be reported when working in plant growth rooms and chambers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and in tissue culture facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The focus on greenhouses in this publication is complemented by earlier works relating to plant growth chambers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">It is the researcherâs responsibility to become familiar with the operational principles of the sensor(s) used during experimentation. The principle of operation, the manufacturerâs design of the sensor, and the specific sensor installation can all have an effect on the readings collected. These effects should be understood and considered when evaluating the measurements. Due to the spatial and temporal variability of many environmental parameters in greenhouse environments, it is important to carefully consider sensor placement, method of data processing, and the impact this variability may have on the experimental conclusions presented.</p><p id="Par5">When reporting experimental results, it is recommended that the equipment and instrument information (model, manufacturer, town, country) is included, including information on precision and accuracy, when it is of specific importance to the experiment(s) conducted. In addition, the calibration procedure and the time of the most recent calibration should be reported. It is good practice to calibrate sensors before and after experiments so that any changes in calibration can be evaluated and incorporated into the data analysis. Periodic factory re-calibration of sensors is recommended (follow manufacturersâ recommendations), and proper calibration can be verified by comparing sensor output with the output from calibrated sensors that are otherwise stored and only used for the purpose of calibration. Note that such calibration sensors may require periodic re-calibration also. In all cases, multi-point calibration of sensors is recommended.</p><p id="Par6">These guidelines describe and discuss environmental parameters that affect plant growth and development. These parameters are divided into five categories: radiation, temperature, gases, water, and nutrients that are each discussed. In addition, greenhouse structure, growing system and environmental control system/strategies are included as a sixth comprehensive parameter. Greenhouse designers, managers and researchers conducting plant experiments in greenhouses are encouraged to review and implement the monitoring and reporting practices discussed in these guidelines. The guidelines conclude with a sample report describing how the environmental conditions during an experiment should be reported in the literature.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Compliance and quality assurance</title><p id="Par7">Whether growing conventional plants, genetically modified organisms (GMOs) or quarantine crops, producers (including those operating in research facilities) need to comply with an increasing range of regulations, codes of practice, legislation and/or standards. For example, compliance is often needed regarding hazardous material and waste management and/or environmental and health and safety regulations such as the Australian/New Zealand Standard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Other regions of the world may have similar compliance requirements that need to be followed. In addition, sponsors of research increasingly expect a minimum standard of scientific practice, as described for example in the Research Councilsâ United Kingdom Policy and Guidelines on Governance of Good Research Conduct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It specifies âweak procedures, inadequate documentation of procedures or inadequate record-keepingâ are inappropriate research behaviour. Furthermore in the UK, many grants by Research Councils and other government departments are made conditional on abiding by the Joint Code of Practice for Research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] that includes the statement âAll equipment must be appropriate for the measurements to be made, calibrated at the appropriate interval, and be in good working conditionâ.</p><p id="Par8">For greenhouse experiments, there are no standards that are equivalent to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) ISO/IEC 17025 used for testing and calibration laboratories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, some of the practices that laboratories adopt to meet this standardâs requirements could be beneficial for research in greenhouse facilities. Although they may appear daunting at first, they can be implemented with little effort and give rewards in terms of more effective operation. These include documenting methods (i.e. calibration and measurement), listing all staff competent in those methods, records of their training, and identification of sensors and equipment. For each item of measurement equipment there should be a log book recording when and how it was calibrated, who undertook the calibration and records of any observations on performance. Annotated records of all measurements should be stored in multiple locations.</p><p id="Par9">It is recommended to utilise an independent set of sensors to measure environmental parameters in greenhouse environments, separate from those sensors used for monitoring and control. The reasons are:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par10">Sensors used for monitoring and control may not have the same specifications and/or operational requirements as the ones recommended for experimental measurements (e.g. response time, resolution, physical location).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par11">Even if sensors used for monitoring and control are serviced and calibrated, they may still malfunction during an experiment. Therefore, an independent set of sensors provides added assurance.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par12">Many sensors include, in addition to the actual probe, electronics and software that interpret and in some cases display the signals. Using different probes in the same hardware package does not offer truly independent assurance.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par13">Some regulatory bodies require that experiments are conducted using monitoring where the data recording the environmental conditions have assured integrity. This integrity includes not allowing any of the raw data collected to be altered by the user. Systems to monitor and control the greenhouse environment may not allow such a level of data integrity.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Definitions</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Radiation</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par14">Irradiance: The incident radiant energy flux per unit plane surface area (JÂ m<sup>â2</sup>Â s<sup>â1</sup> or WÂ m<sup>â2</sup>).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par15">Photon: The smallest packet (âparticleâ) of electromagnetic radiation having no mass, and no electrical charge.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par16">Photon irradiance: The incident photon flux per unit plane surface area (also known as photon flux density; ÂµmolÂ m<sup>â2</sup>Â s<sup>â1</sup>).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par17">Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR): The part of the radiation spectrum that is by definition used by plants for photosynthesis (between 400 and 700Â nm; ÂµmolÂ m<sup>â2</sup>Â s<sup>â1</sup>).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par18">Radiation integral: The radiation flux summed over a period of time (typical units for plant experiments: molÂ m<sup>â2</sup>Â d<sup>â1</sup>).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par19">Red:far red (R:FR) ratio: The red to far red ratio (ratio of radiation emitted at or close to 660 and 730Â nm).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par20">Solar radiation (short wave radiation): The radiation emitted by the Sun (approximately between 280 and 3,000Â nm; WÂ m<sup>â2</sup>).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par21">Spectrum: The distribution of energy (light) emitted by a radiation source in relation to wavelength.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par22">Waveband: A consecutive portion of the radiation spectrum.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par23">100â380Â nm Ultra violet (UV)<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par24">100â280Â nm UVC</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par25">280â315Â nm UVB</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par26">315â380Â nm UVA</p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par27">380â770Â nm visible</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par28">400â700Â nm PAR</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par29">770â3000Â nm near infrared (NIR)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par30">3000Â nmâ1Â mm far infrared (Long wave)</p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par31">Wavelength: The distance between one peak (crest) of a wave of light and the next corresponding peak (nm).</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Temperature</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par32">Aspirated sensor: A sensor placed in an enclosure equipped with a downstream fan to provide continuous air movement around the sensor (with an air speed of approximately 3Â mÂ s<sup>â1</sup>).

This absorption can be used to measure the volumetric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration with non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) CO<sub>2</sub> sensors, typically in an IRGA (infrared gas analyser). Since water vapour also absorbs infrared radiation, particularly in the 2,500â3,000Â nm waveband, it is important to either remove the water vapour before measurement (by drying for example with a desiccant), adjust the sensor reading to account for the presence of water vapour, or alternately, install a pass-filter (interferometer) in front of the IR detector to ensure that only wavelengths that are absorbed by CO<sub>2</sub> are able to reach the detector. Zero calibration is performed by supplying the sensor with pure nitrogen gas. Additional calibration can then be performed using a calibration gas with a known CO<sub>2</sub> concentration at the high end of the measurement range. When air samples are drawn from (warm) greenhouse sections and pumped to a (colder) CO<sub>2</sub> sensor located outside the greenhouse, care should be taken to avoid condensation in the sampling tube, pumping system, and sensor components.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Dissolved oxygen</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par62">Dissolved oxygen meter: The dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in a nutrient solution is most easily measured with a DO meter.

Very small DO sensors consume very little oxygen, removing the need to stir the solution. A DO probe requires special care: the membrane must be kept wet and the probe filled with electrolyte.

In addition, the radiation flux and spectrum changes when measured at different locations within a plant canopy. Unless light transmission in a plant canopy is the focus of research, PAR and its integral should be measured at the top of the plant canopy while assuring that no parts of the plant canopy shade the sensor. The location of the top of the plant canopy should be referenced relative to a fixed object in the greenhouse (e.g. the floor or the bottom of the supplemental light fixtures).</p><p id="Par75">When a combination of sunlight and supplementary light is used to grow a crop, it is important to quantify how much of the total light was provided by each source. If this is not done, it is virtually impossible to repeat the experiment under similar conditions. Solar irradiance can be modified as it passes through greenhouse cladding material and/or interacts with the plant canopy. As a result, changes in the amount of UV and/or the R:FR ratio can occur and these should be monitored and reported when they have an impact on plant growth and/or development.</p><p id="Par76">When conducting supplementary or photoperiod lighting experiments, researchers need to be aware of the impact these treatments can have from unintended spillage of light into neighbouring greenhouse sections.

Significant spatial and temporal fluctuations can result from daily or seasonal changes in outside conditions. As for radiation measurements, structural elements can generate shadows that can (temporarily) affect temperature measurements. In addition, these fluctuations can be the result of the management strategy used to maintain indoor conditions, including the heating, ventilation and cooling system as well as internal air circulation systems such as horizontal airflow fans or perforated polyethylene tubing distribution systems (poly-tube). During ventilation and cooling (especially when using an evaporative cooling pad or fog cooling), it is common to experience significant temperature gradients from the air inlet to the outlet. Minimizing these gradients requires understanding of the airflow patterns resulting from the ventilation system and/or additional internal air recirculation. As a result, continuous measurements, preferable at multiple locations, are needed to assess the average temperature conditions experienced by the plants. If only one measurement location can be monitored, care should be taken in selecting the most appropriate location for sensor placement (typically near the canopy in the centre of the growing area).</p><p id="Par83">Maintaining optimum root zone temperatures can be critical for timely and/or maximum production of many plant species. For those plant species, root zone temperatures should be measured and recorded in at least one, but preferably more, representative location(s). Vertical temperature gradients can be expected and are typically more significant when plants are grown on the floor, whether that floor is heated or not. For hydroponic systems, the temperature of the (recirculating) nutrient solution should be reported.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Effect on plant growth</title><p id="Par84">The rates of chemical reactions typically increase with temperature. Within plants, most chemical reactions, including photosynthesis, are enzyme driven. Hence, the rate of reaction often decreases above an optimum because high temperatures damage the enzymes. Many plants produce compounds to protect against high and low temperatures. On the other hand, in some plants species extreme temperatures can result in abnormal morphological characteristics. In some cases, it is useful to record not just the average temperature and standard deviation, but also the maximum and minimum values the plants were exposed to. For the production of field crops (e.g. cornâ<italic>Zea mays</italic> L.) in greenhouses, the calculation of the crop heat units (growing degree days and associated base temperature) should be reported.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Effect on plant development</title><p id="Par85">For many plant species, especially ornamentals, changes in temperature can trigger physiological responses (e.g. flower initiation).

Water vapour will condense onto another surface only when that surface is cooler than the dewpoint temperature, or when the water vapour equilibrium in the air has been exceeded. When water vapour condenses onto a surface, a net warming occurs on that surface. When water vapour evaporates from a surface, a net cooling occurs on that surface and/or the surrounding air. Condensation of water vapour on plant surfaces should be minimised as not to increase disease and pest issues. In plants, water loss from the stomata by evaporation and diffusion is termed transpiration. Excessive transpiration should be avoided as it can cause wilting.</p><p id="Par87"><italic>Measurements</italic> Water vapour concentrations are typically measured in the air in/around the plant canopy. The amount of water vapour present in the greenhouse air can be expressed in different ways: while RH is a function of temperature, and is therefore a less desirable parameter to report, it is the parameter most often used to express the moisture content of greenhouse air. Many crops perform well when the RH ranges between 50 and 80%. Optimum vapor pressure deficit (VPD) values for most plant species range between 0.8 and 1.0Â kPa. Small VPD values indicate humid conditions, making plant transpiration more difficult. Large VPD values indicate dry conditions, making plants susceptible to wilting. While many researchers report the relative humidity observed and/or maintained during their greenhouse experiments, it is more appropriate to use VPD because of its independence of temperature and because it is the driving force for transpiration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</title><p id="Par88"><italic>Description</italic> CO<sub>2</sub> is a trace gas comprising approximately 0.040% (by volume) of the Earthâs atmosphere. CO<sub>2</sub> is toxic to humans at higher concentrations: 1% may cause drowsiness, above 5% is dangerous. During photosynthesis, plants, algae, and cyanobacteria absorb carbon dioxide, sunlight, and water to produce carbohydrates and oxygen as a waste product. During (dark) respiration, plants reverse this process and absorb oxygen and emit carbon dioxide. In greenhouses, the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration can become the limiting factor for photosynthesis under high light conditions, necessitating adequate ventilation or active enrichment.</p><p id="Par89"><italic>Measurements</italic> Carbon dioxide concentrations are typically measured in the air in or around the plant canopy. When detailed information about photosynthesis and/or respiration is needed, continuous measurements are necessary. Because accurate CO<sub>2</sub> measurements require expensive equipment, a single sensor can be supplied with air samples from different locations and/or different greenhouse sections. These air samples can be supplied sequentially to the sensor with the help of a gas handling unit (sequencer). Readings can be stored using data acquisition systems (dataloggers). Sensor calibration can be accomplished using carefully prepared calibration gases. It is recommended that calibration is performed at no less than two concentrations: one at the low end and one at the high end of the measurement range. Depending on sensor type, temperature fluctuations (e.g. due to fluctuating exposure to solar radiation) can have an effect on measurements. In that case, sensors should be shielded from such fluctuations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>)</title><p id="Par90"><italic>Description</italic> In plant nutrient solutions, the dissolved oxygen concentration can be an important indicator of the ability of the roots to respire. Similarly, in rooting media, the porosity (volumetric pore space fraction) is used as an indicator of the availability of O<sub>2</sub> in the root zone.</p><p id="Par91"><italic>Measurements</italic> Oxygen concentrations of the greenhouse air are not often of concern and are therefore almost never measured. When plants are grown in rooting media, the availability of oxygen to the roots is often assessed by determining the volumetric pore space fraction of the media. In nutrient solutions, the available oxygen to the roots is assessed by measuring the dissolved oxygen concentration. The dissolved oxygen concentration measurement is dependent on the nutrient solution temperature: the warmer the solution, the less oxygen it can contain. Thus, when the nutrient solution temperature is not controlled, frequent measurements are needed. A dissolved oxygen concentration in equilibrium with the oxygen concentration in the air above the solution is called the saturation concentration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Effect of gaseous pollutants on plant growth and development</title><p id="Par92">A variety of gaseous pollutants, some in very small quantities, have been reported to cause negative effects on plant growth and development, particularly in controlled environments when ventilation rates are limited. Many plastics, paints, sealants, glues, etc. release chemical compounds over time that can result in cumulative effects. Chemicals used in and around greenhouses can also release harmful compounds. High temperatures resulting from solar radiation or from inefficiencies in energy conversion (e.g. in electrical components) can increase the release of gaseous pollutants (e.g. NO<sub>x</sub>, SO<sub>x</sub>). Some plant species are highly sensitive to ethylene gas, a known plant hormone that is released, for example, from improperly operating combustion heating systems. People exhaling CO<sub>2</sub> can significantly increase their surrounding CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, particularly in small spaces. The most effective strategy to reduce the effect of gaseous pollutants is to minimise the use of materials that release (volatile) chemicals and to maintain adequate ventilation rates. Accurate measurements of (small) quantities of gaseous pollutants can require expensive equipment (e.g. gas chromatograph).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Liquid water</title><sec id="Sec38"><title>Specifications</title><p id="Par93">Water content of the rooting medium can be expressed in terms of volume, mass, filled pore space, matric (matrix) potential or water potential.

The typical plant contents, as proportion (%) of dry mass, for C, H, and O are approximately 41, 6, and 42%, respectively. All other essential nutrients (the remaining 11%) are typically provided to the rooting medium so they can be taken up by the roots. These essential nutrients are divided into two groups, the macro (or major) and the micro (or minor) nutrients based on the quantities needed by the plant. The macro nutrients include N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and S. The micro nutrients include Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, B, Mo, Cl, Co, and Ni, and some of these are required only in extremely small amounts. When nutrients are provided (dosed) as part of the irrigation system, they need to be dissolved in water as ions (with a few exceptions, e.g. urea and boric acid). When nutrients are provided in solid form (e.g. as a slow release fertilizer incorporated into or placed on top of the rooting media), they need to be dissolved before they can be taken up by the roots.

Of the structural elements, the glazing material will have the most significant effect on the radiation flux and spectral distribution reaching the plant canopy. Therefore, greenhouse orientation and structural features, including the type of glazing material and whether a shading compound was added should be reported. Note that dust or dirt accumulation on the glazing can reduce light transmission, but this issue can be minimized by periodic cleaning. Since physical properties of some cladding materials can change over time, it is recommended to report on the age of the material and its general status.

In addition, information about additional measures implemented to improve energy distribution, such as perforated poly-tubes or horizontal airflow fans, should be reported. Typical greenhouse heating options include forced air (e.g. unit heaters, air furnaces), hot water (e.g. radiant floor and/or perimeter and overhead radiant pipe) and infrared systems. Typical ventilation options include natural (using sidewall and/or roof openings) and mechanical (using electrical fans and sidewall openings) systems. Typical (evaporative) cooling systems include pad-and-fan and high-pressure fog systems.</p><p id="Par111"><italic>Growing system</italic> In order to provide a uniform growing environment for plants, it is important to assess the temperature distribution and variability. The number and capacity (at a specific static pressure) of all fans should be reported. The direction of airflow should also be reported in order to assess whether temperature gradients may be present. Despite increased airflow to improve the uniformity of temperature distribution throughout the greenhouse, the cropping system (particularly tall crops) can have a significant effect. A dense canopy can significantly reduce air movement and vigorous crop transpiration can (locally) reduce air temperature (converting sensible heat to latent heat). These factors should be taken into account and discussed when measuring and reporting air temperatures in greenhouse environments.</p><p id="Par112"><italic>Environmental control system</italic> In order to save energy and reduce the plant respiration rate, many greenhouse operations implement different temperature set points during the day (photoperiod) and night [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These temperature differences can also be used to control specific growth stages, e.g. stem elongation. Specific temperature regimes can also be used to vernalise some plant species (resulting in induction of germination or flowering). Different control strategies can be implemented to maintain greenhouse temperatures. Each control system and strategy uses a different method (control algorithm) to reach the desired outcome, resulting in different spatial and temporal temperature distributions. Some control strategies deliberately allow the temperature to fluctuate depending on outside conditions provided some daily average temperature can be achieved. Because of the effect of the various control systems and strategies, pertinent information about the systems and the control algorithms should be reported.

Air distribution systems (e.g. horizontal airflow fans or poly-tube distribution systems) can help distribute the air and thus improve uniformity.

Humidifiers produce water droplets of various sizes depending on their design and operation. Ideally, droplet size is minimised so as to speed up evaporation without wetting plant tissues. Air circulation is often used to enhance the distribution of the humidified air. Note that evaporative cooling, using either a pad-and-fan system or a high-pressure fog system, humidifies as well as cools the greenhouse air. Dehumidification using a refrigeration cycle to remove water vapour is an energy intensive and thus expensive approach. Instead, greenhouses can be dehumidified using the heat-and-vent strategy: heated air can hold more moisture that is then removed by ventilation. While energy is required for the heat-and-vent strategy, the benefits can outweigh the costs.</p><p id="Par116"><italic>Enrichment/removal systems</italic>â<italic>carbon dioxide</italic> Carbon dioxide enrichment can be accomplished by distributing (pure) CO<sub>2</sub> gas into the growing area. CO<sub>2</sub> gas can be derived from different sources: from vapourised liquid CO<sub>2</sub> stored in a refrigerated and pressurised container near the greenhouse site, or from burning natural gas and releasing the (scrubbed) exhaust gases inside the greenhouse. Uniform distribution is often accomplished by distributing the gas through small inflatable polyethylene tubes that have small openings along the length of the tubes. Typical target enrichment concentrations are 2â4 times the normal ambient concentration (approximately 750â1,500Â ÂµmolÂ mol<sup>â1</sup>). Often, CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment is suspended when the growing space needs to be ventilated to maintain the temperature set point. However, enrichment up to a certain minimum ventilation rate may still be beneficial and result in increased plant growth.</p><p id="Par117"><italic>Enrichment/removal systems</italic>â<italic>oxygen</italic> Increasing the dissolved oxygen concentration of a nutrient solution can be accomplished by bubbling air or pure oxygen gas through the solution (e.g. using air stones). When using air, the maximum dissolved oxygen concentration attainable is by definition the saturation oxygen concentration (temperature dependent). When using pure oxygen gas, the maximum oxygen concentration attainable is approximately five times the saturation concentration (because air contains approximately 21% oxygen). Whether plants benefit from a super-saturated dissolved oxygen concentration in the nutrient solution has not been demonstrated, but using (pressurised) pure oxygen typically does not require additional energy to move the gas. When using air, compressors are often used and in that case care should be taken to ensure that the gas is not contaminated with lubrication particles that were inadvertently released from the mechanical components of the compressor.</p></sec><sec id="Sec50"><title>Liquid water</title><p id="Par118"><italic>Growing system</italic> When watering multiple pots or large areas, the expected or measured variance in water application should be reported as should whether watering is to excess or until soils or pots are at field capacity or even left standing in water.

For example, top-down (e.g. overhead irrigation) or bottom-up (e.g. ebb and flood irrigation) will affect the movement of water and nutrients through the growing media and can result in zones with higher or lower nutrient concentrations. The type of growing media used can affect the availability of nutrients for uptake by the plants (e.g. certain nutrients will bind to clay particles, making them less available to plants). Hydroponic growing systems are typically designed to eliminate the possibility that the availability of water and/or nutrients becomes rate limiting. When growing in pots, researchers should be mindful that size, shape, material and even surface colour can influence root zone conditions and this should be considered when measuring and reporting plant responses.</p><p id="Par132"><italic>Environmental control system</italic> Details about the nutrient control system (if used) should be reported. When data are available, the nutrient uptake rates should be reported. The temperature of the root zone will have an effect on the uptake rate of nutrients by roots, and is therefore more carefully controlled for some crop species. In some cases, the root zone temperature is actively controlled.</p><p id="Par133"><italic>Distribution systems</italic> Liquid nutrient applications can be incorporated into the irrigation system (in that case, these systems are sometimes called fertigation systems). In most cases, small volumes of concentrated nutrient solutions are injected into the irrigation stream at a rate that ensures the proper dosing of the nutrients. Combinations of nutrients or individual nutrients can be injected this way, depending on the design and complexity of the nutrient delivery system. The injection can be passive (e.g. using a venturi system), or active (e.g. using an injection pump). Proper mixing is needed to ensure uniform distribution of the nutrients throughout the growing system. Adequate supply of nutrients throughout the rooting environment is critical since the uptake of nutrients by the roots will result in a gradient that could result in depleted regions.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec52"><title>How to report experimental conditions</title><p id="Par134">Here is an example of a report suitable for publication:</p><p id="Par135">âThe experiment was conducted in a research greenhouse section (located at 40Â°N, 90Â°W at 180Â m elevation above sea level) with a floor area of 20 by 20Â m and a bench area of 240Â m<sup>2</sup> elevated 0.75Â m above the floor. The ridge of the greenhouse section was oriented NorthâSouth. The section was bounded to the East and West by identical, but differently controlled greenhouse sections and to the North by a central corridor. The eave (gutter) height was 2.5Â m and the ridge extended 7.2Â m above the floor. The greenhouse was mechanically ventilated with intake fans located in the South-facing side wall and capable of providing a maximum air flow rate of 0.06Â m<sup>3</sup>Â s<sup>â1</sup>Â m<sup>â2</sup> of floor area. Except for an entry door, the entire North-facing side wall was outfitted with 18.9Â m<sup>2</sup> of louvered ventilation opening and covered with an evaporative cooling pad and an insect screen designed to exclude white flies The greenhouse section was clad with 4-mm thick tempered glass and outfitted with an automated shade curtain with a manufacturerâs specified reduction in light transmission of 50%. The greenhouse was equipped with a supplementary lighting system powered by high-pressure sodium lamps and capable of providing a PAR flux of 200 (SD Â±20) ÂµmolÂ m<sup>â2</sup>Â s<sup>â1</sup> at a distance of 1.75Â m below the bottom of the luminaires. During the light period, the supplementary lighting system was turned on when the sunlight radiation flux was below 300Â ÂµmolÂ m<sup>â2</sup>Â s<sup>â1</sup> at bench level, and turned off when the PAR flux reached 750Â ÂµmolÂ m<sup>â2</sup>Â s<sup>â1</sup>. A 15-min control delay was used to prevent excessive cycling of the supplementary lighting system. The greenhouse section was heated by a hot-water distribution system consisting of overhead pipes, perimeter pipes and tubes embedded in the solid concrete floor. Air temperature at canopy height was maintained at 20/15 (SD Â±1)Â°C Day/Night. A 16-h photoperiod was imposed and centred on solar noon by operating the supplementary lighting system when no sunlight was available. The vapour pressure deficit (VPD) in the greenhouse section was maintained by operating a stand-alone humidifier or by employing the heat-and-vent control strategy. The VPD was continuously maintained at 1.0 (SD Â±0.1) kPa. In the control hierarchy, VPD control had priority over temperature control. All sensors and instruments were calibrated annually following manufacturersâ specifications. The greenhouse section was outfitted with two horizontal airflow fans that operated continuously to improve mixing of the greenhouse air.</p><p id="Par136">Starting on March 1, a geranium (<italic>Pelargonium</italic>Â ÃÂ <italic>hortorum</italic>, cv. Maverick Red) crop was grown in the greenhouse section. Two cuttings were placed in a peat-vermiculite soil-less mixture (1:1 sphagnum peat:vermiculite by volume, and amended with 0.5Â kg of ground dolomitic limestone per m<sup>3</sup> of mixture) contained in 0.75Â L plastic pots. Each pot received a dose (at an equivalent rate of 3Â kgÂ m<sup>â3</sup>) of slow release fertiliser (10-10-10) and was irrigated with a drip system fed with deionised water. The initial pot density on the benches was 64Â m<sup>â2</sup> for the first 6Â weeks, followed by a density of 36Â m<sup>â2</sup> for the remainder of the experiment. The experiment was terminated on May 15.</p><p id="Par137">This reporting example describes only those parameters that the researcher deemed important for the particular experiment conducted. While the information reported may be sufficient for the intended audience (e.g. fellow researchers doing similar experiments), other researchers may find the report insufficient, in particular when they study environmental parameters not specifically discussed in the report. Therefore, researchers are strongly encouraged to consider carefully which parameters to measure and report on and the impact this decision may have on the usefulness of their work to other researchers including those not directly involved in their field of interest.</p></sec><sec id="Sec53"><title>Endnotes</title><p id="Par138"><sup>a</sup>The information presented was compiled by the International Committee on Controlled Environment Guidelines (ICCEG).
