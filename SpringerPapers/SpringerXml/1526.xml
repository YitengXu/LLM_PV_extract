Here, we report earth-abundant embedded aluminum in cuprous oxide antenna-reactor heterostructures that operate more effectively and selectively for the reverse water-gas shift reaction under milder illumination than in conventional thermal conditions. Through rigorous comparison of the spatial temperature profile, optical absorption, and integrated electric field enhancement of the catalyst, we have been able to distinguish between competing photothermal and hot-carrier driven mechanistic pathways. The antenna-reactor geometry efficiently harnesses the plasmon resonance of aluminum to supply energetic hot-carriers and increases optical absorption in cuprous oxide for selective carbon dioxide conversion to carbon monoxide with visible light. The transition from noble metals to aluminum based antenna-reactor heterostructures in plasmonic photocatalysis provides a sustainable route to high-value chemicals and reaffirms the practical potential of plasmon-mediated chemical transformations.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary" specific-use="web-only"><p id="Par2">Plasmon-enhanced photocatalysis holds promise for the control of chemical reactions.

Each year, trillions of dollars of value-added chemicals are manufactured using heterogeneous catalytic processes that rely on active transition metal catalysts such as Pd, Ru, Rh, Cu or Ni<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, transition metal catalysts frequently demand energy-intensive conditions, such as high pressure and heat, to shift equilibrium toward the formation of products. To minimize energy consumption and cost, while achieving maximum efficiency in large-scale chemical processes, new alternatives to extreme operating conditions need to be pursued. This challenge can be addressed by introducing robust, light-activated photocatalysts that lower reaction barriers at ambient conditions instead of relying on traditional, phonon-driven chemical conversion.</p><p id="Par4">Recent advances have brought metal nanoparticles that support localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) to the forefront for enhancing photocatalytic efficiencies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Until recently, light-driven chemical transformation on plasmonic nanostructures has relied primarily on Ag and Au. However, practical applications of noble metals as photocatalysts are ultimately limited due to their high cost, low abundance, and modest reactivity. In contrast, aluminum (Al), the most abundant metal in the Earth’s crust, also has outstanding plasmonic optical properties, including a highly size-tunable localized plasmon resonance that spans the UV and visible regions of the optical spectrum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Al has been demonstrated to be a photocatalyst for plasmon-mediated chemical reactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and has recently been adopted as a plasmonic antenna in a heterometallic antenna-reactor photocatalyst design<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Taking into account its low cost, abundance, and plasmonic and catalytic activity, Al is a highly promising candidate for eventual industrial implementation of plasmonic photocatalysis.</p><p id="Par5">Here we demonstrate a plasmonic Al@Cu<sub>2</sub>O antenna-reactor heterostructure based on entirely earth-abundant materials instead of precious metals for charge-carrier generation to drive chemical transformation of CO<sub>2</sub> into CO at significantly milder operating conditions compared to its purely thermal driven counterpart. The conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to CO is considered to be an important approach for the mitigation of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub>. Currently, industrial conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to CO occurs through the reverse water-gas shift (rWGS) reaction. The rWGS (CO<sub>2</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>→CO+H<sub>2</sub>O ΔH<sub>298 K</sub> = +41.2 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup>) has emerged not only as a promising approach for CO<sub>2</sub> transformation into CO but also as an important reactant for synthesis of high value chemicals by subsequent hydrogenation (i.e., the Fisher–Tropsch synthesis)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. We observe better selectivity in the plasmon-induced rWGS at lower temperatures than the thermally driven rWGS at elevated temperatures. Through combined experimental studies and theoretical modeling of the Al@Cu<sub>2</sub>O photocatalyst using finite element method (FEM) electromagnetic and Monte-Carlo simulations, we are also able to provide definitive evidence to support plasmon-induced carrier generation mechanism to drive rWGS, and to clearly distinguish it from photothermal heating. Our results serve as an example of Al as a plasmonic antenna promoting reactivity on adjacent materials, in this case, the semiconducting oxide Cu<sub>2</sub>O. The antenna-reactor geometry not only improves surface reactivity, but also more efficiently harnesses and utilizes the radiative LSPR damping in Al to enhance carrier generation in the metal oxide shell. Rational design and independent control over the catalytic and light-harvesting components in the Al@Cu<sub>2</sub>O heterostructure results in an efficient and selective plasmonic photocatalyst.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Photocatalyst characterization</title><p id="Par6">Electron microscopy and elemental composition analysis of the particles are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The pristine Al nanocrystals (Al NCs) with a nominal diameter of 100 nm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>) were colloidally synthesized according to our previously published protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> with minor modification. To prepare the plasmonic antenna-reactor nanoparticles, we grew a ~15 nm thick cuprous oxide (Cu<sub>2</sub>O) shell around the Al core (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b and c</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>), which was separated from the Al metal by a 2–4 nm self-limiting amorphous Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> layer (see Methods for synthesis details). A high-resolution transmission electron micrograph (HRTEM) of the as-synthesized Al@Cu<sub>2</sub>O nanoparticles revealed that the shell was highly polycrystalline, with lattice fringes that can be assigned to the (111) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>) and (110) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>) planes of Cu<sub>2</sub>O. The high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron micrograph (HAADF-STEM) of particles in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref> shows a strong contrast between bright and dark regions, which arises from the Z-contrast of different atomic nuclei: Cu atoms appear brighter than Al due to their higher atomic number. The elemental compositions were mapped using energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. The elemental mapping (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e–h</xref>) illustrates the distribution of each element in the nanoparticles. The HAADF-STEM image and combined elemental mapping shows that coating the Al NCs surface with Cu<sub>2</sub>O shell is achieved in high quality. The UV–vis-NIR extinction spectrum (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>) in solution shows a dipolar plasmon mode at 465 nm for pristine Al NCs that shifts to ~550 nm after growth of the Cu<sub>2</sub>O shell. Diffuse reflectance spectra of the photocatalyst nanoparticle/γ-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> mixture were obtained, where both indicated the strong interband transition of Al (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis shows identical spectrum at binding energies of the copper in the Al@Cu<sub>2</sub>O/γ-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> photocatalyst before and following illumination under reaction conditions, confirming the oxidation state of copper in the Al@Cu<sub>2</sub>O nanoparticles remained unchanged during photocatalytic reaction (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref> and Supplementary Method <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Characterization of plasmonic photocatalysts. <bold>a</bold> TEM image of the pristine Al NCs with nominal size before and <bold>b</bold> after growth of Cu<sub>2</sub>O shell around Al core.

Photocatalytic measurements were performed using about 20 mg of nanoparticle/γ-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> mixture, loaded into a fixed-bed reactor equipped with a quartz window. The chamber outlet was connected to a gas chromatograph for on-line quantitative analysis of products in effluent (see Methods section for details). Preliminary photocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub> hydrogenation experiments were performed in CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> (1:1, total flow rate of 10 s.c.c.m.) and also separately in He (10 s.c.c.m.) atmospheres under visible light illumination (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). CO formation was detected when CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> were both present, upon illumination of the nanoparticle/γ-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> photocatalyst mixture. Illumination of the photocatalyst in an inert He atmosphere did not produce any measurable product, verifying CO formation was not from the decomposition of any organic contamination. Also, there was no measurable product from illuminating the pure γ-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, verifying that the Al@Cu<sub>2</sub>O plasmonic photocatalyst was the active component. The rate of CO formation as a function of visible-light intensity under ambient conditions is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>. The rate of CO formation catalyzed by Al@Cu<sub>2</sub>O is significantly higher than that of Cu<sub>2</sub>O and pristine Al without the reactive Cu<sub>2</sub>O shell, particularly at higher illumination intensities. Similarly, the Al@Cu<sub>2</sub>O heterostructure exhibits higher external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of CO formation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>).

The measured rate of CO formation is on par with or higher than previous reports on photocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub> conversion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. We also note that the measured EQE of about 0.35% for Al@Cu<sub>2</sub>O is higher than previous reports for plasmon-enhanced CO<sub>2</sub> conversion over Au and Ag<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. However, significant diversity in materials and experimental conditions make direct comparison of reported efficiencies for photocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub> conversion a challenge. The majority of homogenous and heterogeneous photocatalytic systems for CO<sub>2</sub> conversion have relied on rare elements. They often suffer from very low aqueous CO<sub>2</sub> solubility, utilize expensive co-catalysts and/or sacrificial organics, and in many cases, utilize an electrochemical bias or elevated temperatures to activate the photocatalyst. Despite a measured quantum efficiency of less than 1%, plasmon-induced rWGS at room temperature and pressure, all while utilizing a non-precious, earth-abundant Al@Cu<sub>2</sub>O antenna-reactor photocatalyst holds promise for light-driven CO<sub>2</sub> mitigation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Plasmonic carrier-driven mechanism and photothermal effects</title><p id="Par9">In principle, plasmon-induced chemistry should always be accompanied by heat generation from the thermalization of the hot carriers generated by plasmon decay, through the mechanism of nonradiative plasmon damping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.

The weak peak at 400 nm that appears in both Figs. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a and b</xref> is due to excitation of the Al quadrupolar plasmon mode. The weak feature at 900 nm is due to the dispersion of the real part of the Al permittivity (interband transition). We note that the magnitude of the near-field induced carrier generation in the Cu<sub>2</sub>O shell depends on the density of states on the exposed surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. FEM simulations do not account for imperfections, but the highly polycrystalline nature of the synthesized Cu<sub>2</sub>O shell (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>) introduces defects within the crystal lattice. It is likely that near-field energy transfer can generate carries at energies below the band gap of Cu<sub>2</sub>O, i.e., the sub-band gap transitions at 900 nm. The dual mechanisms of carrier generation either in the Al core with subsequent injection into the Cu<sub>2</sub>O shell and/or the direct excitations of hot carriers in the Cu<sub>2</sub>O shell, as suggested by the calculations in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref> both provide enhanced hot carrier densities for chemical transformations. To separate the influence of the plasmonic core, a similar structure was modeled, where the Al core was replaced with a dielectric Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> sphere of the same size. In this case, the calculated local electric field enhancement in the volume of the Cu<sub>2</sub>O shell did not reproduce the features in the experimental EQE spectrum (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>).

In addition, varying the ratio of H<sub>2</sub> to CO<sub>2</sub> in the gas steam had negligible effect on product selectivity for light-induced rWGS, which continuously exhibited selectivities towards CO of over 99.3% (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>).

This carrier generation pathway, however, is not efficient for 100 nm Al NCs used in this study as the main damping pathway for nanocrystals of this size is through a radiative process. The FEM calculations in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>, clearly shows that the enhanced carrier generation in Al@Cu<sub>2</sub>O can be attributed to non-radiative plasmon decay in the Al core and near-field excitation of carriers in the Cu<sub>2</sub>O. Quantitatively ascertaining the ratio of carriers generated by each pathway is non-trivial. The efficiency of resonance energy transfer primarily depends on the overlap between the LSPR absorption and the optical transitions in nearby semiconductors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Calculated absorbed photon fractions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>) show significant LSPR overlap with the band edge absorption of Cu<sub>2</sub>O, which can induce interband/sub-band transitions in the semiconductor shell. The localized resonance energy transfer within a 15 nm thick Cu<sub>2</sub>O shell allows for carrier generation at volumes much lower than the bulk carrier diffusion lengths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, thereby significantly decreasing the carrier recombination rate. This is particularly important because, based on absorption coefficient values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, carrier generation from interband transitions in Cu<sub>2</sub>O is being achieved at absorption depths much higher than its carrier diffusion length. This is also evidenced by our results where the obtained EQE at the band gap of 15 nm thick Cu<sub>2</sub>O (below 500 nm) is much lower than that of at LSPR frequency near the band edge of Cu<sub>2</sub>O (see Figs. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a and c</xref>). In addition to plasmon-induced resonance energy transfer, the proper energy band alignment of Al and Cu<sub>2</sub>O (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>) satisfies the requirement for plasmon-induced hot electron transfer to the Cu<sub>2</sub>O layer. Therefore, Cu<sub>2</sub>O should further improve the efficiency of hot-carrier injection to adsorbates by increasing the lifetime of excited-states by facilitating their extraction from the Al core at the interface of native oxide layer. Compared to Au or Ag, Al has a higher Fermi energy and a favorable band structure so that Al has non-competing direct excitation pathways (interband transitions) at higher photon energies.

We demonstrate that rationally and predictively designing the Al@Cu<sub>2</sub>O antenna-reactor nanoparticles provides independent control of both the catalytically active surfaces and plasmonic light absorption. Separating catalytic (Cu<sub>2</sub>O) and light harvesting (Al) functions into different materials is the key to achieving higher quantum efficiencies in chemical conversion. We have shown that the Al@Cu<sub>2</sub>O antenna-reactor complexes also yield increased selectivity over traditional thermal-driven reactions. Utilizing hot carriers generated from plasmon decay can greatly influence reactivity and selectivity under mild conditions. The present work represents a significant step toward understanding how plasmonic photocatalysts can be used as sustainable alternatives to traditional energy-intensive heterogeneous catalytic processes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Synthesis of photocatalyst</title><p id="Par26">Al NCs with an average diameter of 100 nm with a 2–4 nm self-limiting oxide surface layer were chemically synthesized according to our previously published protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> with minor modifications. Briefly, 5 ml of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF) and 15 ml of anhydrous 1,4-dioxane (Sigma-Aldrich) were mixed in a 100 ml dry Schlenk flask under an Ar atmosphere at 40 °C. Under stirring, 6.5 ml of N,N-dimethylethylamine alane (0.5 M in toluene, Sigma-Aldrich) was injected into the reaction vessel, followed by rapid injection of 0.5 ml of 2 wt% Ti(OiPr)<sub>4</sub> in toluene. The color of the solution turned to brown within a few seconds, and to gray within an hour, indicating formation of Al NCs. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 h, before being removed from the heat source. 1 ml of oleic acid was injected into the mixture to quench the reaction. The as-synthesized nanoparticles were isolated by sonication and centrifugation (2,000 g) in dry toluene, followed by three cycles of washing and centrifuging in 2-propanol (IPA). Finally, Al NCs were dispersed in IPA and the solution purged by Ar and stored at room temperature for future use.</p><p id="Par27">For the synthesis of Al@Cu<sub>2</sub>O, 2.5 ml of as synthesized Al NCs (1 mg ml<sup>–1</sup> in IPA) were transferred to an oven-dried Schlenk flask and the total volume of the solution adjusted to 10 ml using IPA. The reaction solution was degassed at room temperature for about an hour and then under Ar atmosphere the flask was heated to reflux. While refluxing, 1 ml of 0.01 M fresh Cu (II) acetate (99.999% trace metal-basis, Sigma-Aldrich) in dry acetonitrile was rapidly injected into the reaction with constant stirring. The reflux continued for 2 h to yield Al@Cu<sub>2</sub>O nanoparticles. The as-synthesized nanoparticles were isolated by centrifuge at 2000 g and washed three times with IPA, and finally dispersed in IPA. For control experiment, we have prepared Cu<sub>2</sub>O through an alcoholic reduction method similar to the technique used to grow a Cu<sub>2</sub>O layer around Al.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Preparation of catalyst and reactor set-up</title><p id="Par28">The photocatalysts were prepared by mixing a homogenous dispersion of plasmonic particles with a commercial γ-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> support (Alfa Aesar) at 5 wt% loading with respect to the oxide support. Briefly, the proper amount of oxide support was added to the nanoparticle solution in IPA. The mixture was shaken thoroughly to obtain a homogenous mixture and then centrifuged to remove the excess IPA. The remaining solid pellet was dried overnight under vacuum. The powdered catalyst/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> mixture was ground using a mortar and pestle to homogenize the dry catalyst before being loaded into the reaction chamber. The percentage of Cu in the Al@Cu<sub>2</sub>O supported oxide catalyst was as low as 1 wt% based on quantifying the Cu precursor. For measuring the photocatalytic activity, about 20 mg of oxide-supported plasmonic nanoparticles were loaded into a customized stainless steel chamber flow fixed-bed reactor (Harrick Scientific Product Inc.), equipped with a precise thermocouple and a quartz window for illumination. At a total pressure of 1 atm, high purity H<sub>2</sub> (99.999% Matheson trigas) and CO<sub>2</sub> (99.999% Matheson trigas) were continuously flowed into the reaction chamber at a total flow rate of 10 s.c.c.m.. For online monitoring of product formation, the reaction chamber was connected to a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu) equipped with a pulsed discharge helium ionization detector (PDHID) (connected to a molecular sieve 13× column) and a flame ionization detector (FID) (connected to a fused silica PLOT column).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Photocatalytic and thermal processes</title><p id="Par29">Photocatalytic and thermaocatalytic measurements were performed at a 1:1 ratio of CO<sub>2</sub>:H<sub>2</sub> (total flow rate of 10 s.c.c.m.). The CO<sub>2</sub>:H<sub>2</sub> stoichiometry of 1:1 was sustained throughout all experiments except when specified to the contrary (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>). Thermal activity measurements were conducted in the absence of light, and by heating the chamber with a precise temperature controller (Harrick Scientific Product Inc.). For photocatalytic experiment without external heating, a supercontinuum fiber laser (Fianium, 400–850 nm, 4 ps, 80 MHz, see Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref> for laser spectrum) was used as the visible excitation source. For Visible light studies, a lens (Thorlab, 150 mm focal length) was used to focus the light to a 1.5-mm spot size onto the photocatalyst, through the quartz reactor window. Wavelength dependence measurements were obtained over the range of 350–1,000 nm. Monochromatic light from a tunable Ti:sapphire laser (Coherent, Chameleon Ultra II, 150 fs, 80 MHz, bandwidth ~10 nm) was utilized the wavelength range of 680−1,080 nm, and coupled to a second harmonic generator (Angewandte Physik und Elektronik GmbH) for the output wavelength range of 350–530 nm. For wavelength dependence measurements in the range of 500–700 nm, we used the supercontinuum fiber laser and the appropriate bandpass filters (Edmund, bandwidth ~50 nm, 80 MHz). The average power of the incident beam was fixed at 130±2 mW for each wavelength. A 90° off-axis parabolic mirror (PFL 76.2 mm) was used to focus the light to a sub-millimeter spot to avoid chromatic aberration.</p><p id="Par30">The EQE was calculated from the rate of CO formation at incident photon energy impinging the surface (EQE<sub>CO</sub> = 2 × rate [CO] (μmol cm<sup>–2</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>)/photon flux (μmol cm<sup>–2</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>)). For visible light illumination, an average photon energy at 700 nm was used according to the light source spectrum (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). For Wavelength-dependent study the photon energy at each illumination wavelength was used for EQE calculations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Photothermal heating measurements</title><p id="Par31">A highly sensitive thermal imaging camera (FLIR A65) was used for high-resolution (640 × 512 pixels) photothermal imaging and as a temporal monitor of temperature variation. Photothermal measurements were performed under white light illumination and as a function of illumination wavelength. The sample was exposed to the lab atmosphere environment during illumination (due to limited transparency of the quartz reactor window at thermal infrared wavelengths). The thermal camera was positioned above the sample at a slightly tilted angle with a few centimeters off from the center of the stage to allow for top illumination of the sample.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Monte-Carlo simulations</title><p id="Par32">Monte Carlo simulations were performed to model light transport using a customized code that was verified using both analytic and computational standards. Each calculation included the simulation of between ~1 and 4 × 106 photon trajectories, depending on the simulation wavelength. Each calculation was terminated when 106 absorbed photons was reached for each incident wavelength, keeping the statistical error for the calculations relatively constant. The simulation domain approximated the experimental photocatalytic geometry using a rectangular cell of dimensions 8 × 8 × 0.1 mm. A nanoparticle concentration of 1.14 × 1014 cm<sup>–3</sup> (5 wt% loading of particle) was multiplied by the appropriate optical cross sections for the photocatalyst nanoparticle obtained from FEM calculations, to obtain scattering and absorption coefficients as input. The scattering coefficient ranged from 55 to 673 cm<sup>–1</sup>, while the absorption coefficient ranged from 31 to 520 cm<sup>–1</sup>. The alumina support was assumed to be a purely scattering medium with a scattering coefficient of 70 cm<sup>–1</sup>. Each photon was simulated until it was either absorbed or exited the simulation domain. Photon scattering followed a dipole scattering cos<sup>2</sup>(θ) distribution. Upon absorption, the position of the photon was saved in order to calculate the photon absorption distributions. Absorption efficiencies were calculated by dividing the number of photons absorbed by the total number of photons simulated. When needed, the obtained spectra were normalized to take into account the different photon energies for different wavelengths of light.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Electromagnetic simulations</title><p id="Par33">Modeling of the Al@Cu<sub>2</sub>O antenna-reactor nanoparticles was performed using the Finite Element Method (FEM, COMSOL Multiphysics 4.2a).
