In analogy with graphene, other kinds of single-layered or few-layered inorganic two-dimensional (2D) materials and their heterostructures such as hexagonal BN and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) derived from their layered bulk counterparts have been attached much attention due to their promising properties and a broad range of applications including electronics, optoelectronics, catalysis, energy storage and conversion devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p>Molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>) as a typical layer-structured TMDs where the Mo layer is sandwiched between two sulfur layers by covalent bonds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> has been intensely studied for electrochemical energy storage and conversion, including as an electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, for electrode materials in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> and as supercapacitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, due to its good anti-corrosion, catalytic abilities and electrochemical activities. Theoretical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> and experimental<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> results have demonstrated that the edges of 2D MoS<sub>2</sub> layers are coordinative unsaturated and thermodynamically unfavorable and the basal surfaces are chemically inert. Consequently, the excellent electrochemical properties of 2D MoS<sub>2</sub> layers are closely related to the active sites located along the edges of the material<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. On the other hand, due to the high surface energy and strong interlayer Ï-Ï interactions, the MoS<sub>2</sub> layered nanostructures tend to re-stack and condense which results in poor stability and the loss of active sites and unusual properties during practical applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Moreover, the intrinsic poor conductivity and structural pulverization of MoS<sub>2</sub> usually limit the energy storage and conversion process. Up till now many approaches have been adopted to overcome the limitations and improve the electrochemical performance. One feasible approach is the design and synthesis of MoS<sub>2</sub> based materials with reasonable composition, morphology, microstructure and architecture on the nanoscale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. In particular, hierarchical hybrid structures, which are assembled by 2D MoS<sub>2</sub> layers and composited with electronically conductive agents for example, carbon nanofibers, carbon nanotubes, graphene, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets and so on<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, have drawn special interest. In the respect of hierarchical structures, three-dimensional (3D) architecture assembled with 2D MoS<sub>2</sub> layers not only well inherits the advantages from the single 2D layer but also arises novel properties due to the synergistic interactions between the layers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. The 3D architecture is also favored for preventing the aggregation of these 2D layers and thus retaining active sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. The nano-building blocks, 2D MoS<sub>2</sub> layers, can maximize the number of exposed active sites and provide extra active sites for ion storage. In addition, the 2D MoS<sub>2</sub> layers subunits can reduce effective distance for ions diffusion, enhance fast mass transport of reactants and products and provide large electrode-electrolyte contact area. Furthermore, when the 3D architecture is composited with carbonaceous matrix, the hybrids possess good electrical conductivity to facilitate electronic transfer and decrease the inner resistance of the electrochemical system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. All of the above are crucial for improving the HER and LIB performances.</p><p>Herein, we report a facile method for the assembly of 3D MoS<sub>2</sub> nanorose cross-linked by 3D rGO network (MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR/rGO) through a solution reaction route. In this system (As shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>), the 3D MoS<sub>2</sub> nanorose is constructed by single-layered or few-layered MoS<sub>2</sub> which is interconnected by 3D graphene network. MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR/rGO exhibits high reversible capacity, excellent rate capability and significantly enhanced cycling performance making it promising for application in high-power LIBs. They also show excellent hydrogen-evolution catalytic activity and durability in an acidic medium, which is superior to MoS<sub>2</sub> nanorose and their nanoparticles counterparts. As depicted in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>, the excellent electrochemical properties are attributed to the 3D assemble architecture and the enhanced electrical conductivity and this may facilitate the transport and storage of lithium ion or mass to better withstand the volume change on cycling and expose more contact sites with active materials. In addition, the strong electronic coupling between single-layers of MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR and ultrathin layer of 3D graphene network makes the electrons filled in the whole system quickly. 3D graphene network works as branches which transport the electrons from the electrode root to the MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR quickly which bring a superior electrochemical performance than the single component MoS<sub>2</sub>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(a) Schematic representation of the 3D architectures assembled from single-layered MoS<sub>2</sub> cross-linked by 3D rGO.

The crystal structures of the yielding nanohybrids were characterized by XRD as shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>. The results for the sample without addition of rGO, MoS<sub>2</sub> 3D assembled tubes, rGO and standard pattern of MoS<sub>2</sub> are also displayed for comparison. It can be seen that the diffraction patterns of MoS<sub>2</sub> related samples are similar and the identified peaks of the three samples can be indexed to hexagonal MoS<sub>2</sub> (JCPDS No. 37-1492). The broadening of the diffraction peaks indicates the fine size of the samples. Moreover, the absent (002) diffraction peak that was observed in the case of well-stacked layered MoS<sub>2</sub> indicates that stacking of the single layers has not taken place in the samples, which suggests that the MoS<sub>2</sub> in the as-prepared samples should have single or few layers. Those results are in good agreement with our previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. For the nanohybrid sample, in addition to the peaks from MoS<sub>2</sub> phase, there is additional diffraction peaks located at 2Î¸ = 23.4Â° (marked with red star) which can be attributed to the (002) reflection of reduced GO sheets (JCPDS No. 75-1621).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>XRD patterns of the MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR (black) and MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR/rGO nanohybrids (blue).</p><p>Red star (*) represents peak related to rGO nanosheets.

From the high magnification SEM image (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>) it can be clearly seen that the MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles present rose-like characteristic (termed as MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR in the following text), which are assembled with ultrathin MoS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c,d</xref>).

The MoS<sub>2</sub> microspheres also possess rose-like morphology by employing ultrathin MoS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets as nanobuilding blocks in the composites, forming MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR/rGO nanohybrids. The special architecture of MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR/rGO nanohybrids was attributed to the graphene self-assembling during the reaction process, in which GO was reduced to graphene and the flexible graphene nanosheets served as substrate for the growth of MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR.

The peak at 1575âcm<sup>â1</sup> (<italic>G</italic> band) is attributed to the vibration of sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized C-C bond of in-plane hexagonal lattice. The peak at 1358âcm<sup>â1</sup> (<italic>D</italic> band) is associated with the vibrations of carbon atoms with dangling bonds in plane terminations of the disordered graphite from the defects and disorders of structures in carbon materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.

In this work, the electrochemical HER tests are performed using three-electrode system in the acidic condition of 0.5âM H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution (see Experiment section for details). As a reference, we also performed measurements using a commercial Pt/C catalyst which exhibits high HER catalytic performance. Typical linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve (<italic>j</italic>-<italic>V</italic> plot) exihites that MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR/rGO electrode presents a low onset overpotential (Î·) of ~115âmV (versus RHE) for taking off HER activity (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a</xref>). Further negative potential induces rapid rise of cathodic current. The HER performances of commercial Pt/C catalyst, MoS<sub>2</sub>-NT, MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR and MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (MoS<sub>2</sub>-NP) are compared in the same experimental conditions. Commercial Pt/C (with 20 wt.% Pt loading, YiBang/RuiBang New Power Sources Technology Co. LTD.) catalyst shows the highest HER activity with negligible onset overpotential. MoS<sub>2</sub>-NP exhibits negligible HER activity during the studied electrochemical window. The characters of other samples are among them, the MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR/rGO hybrid catalysts and MoS<sub>2</sub>-NT catalysts exhibited best HER activity. As a typical reference metric for electrochemical catalytic performance, the overpotential value for 10âmA/cm<sup>2</sup> current density is frequently employed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Interestingly, MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR/rGO hybrid catalysts require ~ 210âmV to achieve 10âmA/cm<sup>2</sup>, which is far better than free MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR. Because the latter one is limited by the less exposed sites for proton reduction and low electrical conductivity the HER performance particularly in terms of current density. As shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, when the rGO nanosheets were inserted into the MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR, electrons can be rapidly delivered to the active MoS<sub>2</sub> sites for proton reduction and H<sub>2</sub> evolution, which is especially important for the high overpotential polarization region. Tafel plots based on polarization curves are acquired to calculate their electrochemical dynamic parameter of Tafel slope, as shown in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b</xref>. The linear regions of Tafel plots were fit to Tafel equation (Î· = a + blog<italic>j</italic>, where <italic>j</italic> is the current density and b is the Tafel slope) to obtain slope<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>, which yields Tafel slopes of ~38, ~46, ~60 and 175âmV/decade for Pt/C, MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR/rGO, MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR and MoS<sub>2</sub>-NP, respectively. Obviously, MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR/rGO hybrid catalysts possess lower Tafel slope than free MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR and MoS<sub>2</sub>-NP. Lower Tafel slope gives rise to less overpotential demand toward high current density acquired. Moreover, we can deduce the HER mechanism based on Tafel slope.

Similar to many other HER catalysts such as Ni<sub>2</sub>P (46âmV/decade)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>, the observed Tafel slope of ~46âm V/decade for MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR/rGO hybrid catalysts in the current work is close to that of Heyrovsky reaction with 39âmV/decade, so we can assign HER mechanism as quasi-Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism that electrochemical desorption is the rate-limiting step, although the observed Tafel slope of ~46âm V/decade does not absolutely match any value of the above discussed three steps. While, Tafel slope of 60âmV/decade of free MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR catalysts may indicate that the reaction is to some extent to be determined by the discharge step with higher Tafel slope. This catalytic process mainly occurs either on the surface or at the exposed edges of the MoS<sub>2</sub> layers. However, the freshly prepared MoS<sub>2</sub> layers have a tendency to aggregate during practical application even in the drying process, resulting in the loss of active sites of ultrathin 2D nanostructures. This rose structure assembled by single-layer will expose many edges, which is closely related to the large surface area of the layers and decrement the agglomeration efficiently. In addition, this 3D graphene network composed of interconnected ultrathin graphene layer penetrates the whole system and supports these MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR from different direction, which facilitates the electron transportation from the electrode to the surfaces and edges of the single-layer of MoS<sub>2</sub>. The strong electronic coupling between single-layers of MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR and 3D graphene network make the electrons filled with whole system quickly. 3D graphene network works as branches which transport the nutrient (electron) from the root (electrode) to the roses (MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR).</p><p>As shown in the inset of <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6c</xref>, the electrochemical interface electrode and solution for HER can be modeled by a equivalent circuit, which consists of Ohm resistance (<italic>R</italic><sub>Î©</sub>), double layered capacitance (<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub>) and charge transfer resistance (<italic>R</italic><sub><italic>ct</italic></sub>, Faradic resistance). We ignore the Warburg resistance (<italic>R</italic><sub><italic>W</italic></sub>) due to the low overpotential polarization. It is well known that <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>ct</italic></sub> is highly associated with the electrochemical dynamics of HER. The characterizations of the above circuit elements including fluent charge transport could be identified by electrochemical AC impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6c</xref>). Under the same bias of -0.40âV (vs. Ag/AgCl), MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR/rGO shows much lower charge transfer resistance than other contrast samples. According to the Nyquist plots, the electron transfer resistance <italic>R</italic><sub>ct</sub> of MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR/rGO is only 170 Î©, which is far less than that of MoS<sub>2</sub>-NT (230 Î©) and MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR(450 Î©). Moreover, the stable-state method of chronopotentiometry curves (with current density of 1âmA/cm<sup>2</sup>) was carried out to further investigate the HER performance. For the MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR/rGO, MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR and MoS<sub>2</sub>-NT, they all reached stable state quickly (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6d</xref>).

The shape of the first discharge curves is not significantly altered indicating the stability of the nanostructures as anode. Specifically, as shown in <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7a</xref> for MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR, in the initial discharge process, a voltage plateau at ~0.7âV followed by tail at a lower voltage is observed, which is attributed to the irreversible reaction between the electrolyte and MoS<sub>2</sub>. In the second and third discharge curves, the potential plateau at ~0.7âV in the first discharge disappears. In the first three charge curves, the MoS<sub>2</sub> NRs electrodes display an inconspicuous potential plateau at ~2.3âV due to the lower crystallinity and defect sites of the graphene-like MoS<sub>2</sub>.

The values of initial discharge and charge capacities for MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR/rGO nanohybrid electrodes are much larger than the capacity of MoS<sub>2</sub>-NT, MoS<sub>2</sub>-NP.

In the subsequent cycles, the anodic peaks intensity decreased sharply, suggesting an irreversible conversion reaction during the lithium-ion insertion/extraction process. The reversible capacity loss arising is due to the incomplete conversion reaction and the formation of SEI layer due to the irreversible degradation of electrolyte and other secondary reactions. Similar phenomena have also been reported by others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.</p><p>The involved reactions can be described as follows: <disp-formula id="Equ1"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep08722_Equ1_HTML.jpg"/></disp-formula><disp-formula id="Equ2"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep08722_Equ2_HTML.jpg"/></disp-formula><disp-formula id="Equ3"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep08722_Equ3_HTML.jpg"/></disp-formula><disp-formula id="Equ4"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep08722_Equ4_HTML.jpg"/></disp-formula></p><p><xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7d</xref> shows the cycling performance of the MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR and MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR/rGO cells at rate of 0.1âAg<sup>â1</sup> in the voltage range of 0.01â3âV (versus Li<sup>+</sup>/Li) up to 80 cycles. The cycling performance of MoS<sub>2</sub>-NT and MoS<sub>2</sub>-NP measured at the same conditions are also shown in <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7d</xref> for comparison<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. It can be seen that the MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR/rGO nanohybrids electrode exhibit a much better cycling performance than MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR, MoS<sub>2</sub>-NT and MoS<sub>2</sub>-NP cells. It is obvious that the MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR/rGO nanohybrids cell possesses the highest lithium storage capacity and the reversible capacity reaches 973âmAhg<sup>â1</sup> after 80 cycles. For the case of MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR cell, the reversible capacity is 703.5âmAhg<sup>â1</sup> after 80 cycles. The improved capacity and cycle life of MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR/rGO cell may be attributed to the hierarchical porous nature arisen by single-layer MoS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets assembled flowers and 3D rGO network, which is more convenient and accessible for electrolyte diffusion and intercalation of Li ions into the active phases.</p><p>Rate capability is an important parameter for rechargeable batteries applications. We also investigated the electrochemical performance of the samples at various rates between 0.1 and 5.0âAg<sup>â1</sup> as shown in <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7e</xref>. The charge/discharge rates are programmably modified from 0.1âA g<sup>â1</sup> to 0.5âA g<sup>â1</sup>, 1.0âA g<sup>â1</sup>, 5.0âA g<sup>â1</sup> and then back to 0.1âA g<sup>â1</sup> for 10 cycles. It can be observed that the reversible capacity of MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR/rGO nanohybrid cell varies from 1008âmAhg<sup>â1</sup> to 601âmAhg<sup>â1</sup> at current rates of 0.1âA g<sup>â1</sup> and 5.0âA g<sup>â1</sup>, respectively. The reversible capacity of the MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR cells rapidly drops from 783 to 303âmAhg<sup>â1</sup>. When the rate return to the initial 0.1âA g<sup>â1</sup> after 40 cycles, MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR/rGO nanohybrid cell almost recovers its original capacity (983âmAhg<sup>â1</sup> for the 50th cycle) and the MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR cells do not recover its original capacity (722âmAhg<sup>â1</sup> for the 50th cycle) as illustrated in <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7e</xref>. The rate capability of MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR/rGO nanohybrid cell is still superior when MoS<sub>2</sub>-NT and MoS<sub>2</sub>-NP cells are taken into consideration (<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7e</xref>). For a better understanding of the rate performance of the MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR/rGO cells compared with the MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR cells for lithium storage, electrochemical impedance measurements are carried out to determine the Li ion transfer behavior. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7f</xref> shows the Nyquist plots of the AC impedance analysis for MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR/rGO and MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR cells. In the impedance spectrum, the high frequency semicircle is attributed to the contact resistance occurring because of the SEI film, the medium-frequency semicircle is related to the charge-transfer resistance on electrolyte and the electrode interface and the inclined lines correspond to the Li diffusion process inside the electrode material<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. The Nyquist plots in the frequency range from100âkHz to 0.01âHz clearly show that the diameter of the semicircle of MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR/rGO nanohybrid cell is much smaller than that of the MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR cell, indicating that the addition of rGO enhanced the charge transfer process compared to the bare MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR, which is beneficial for improving rate capability. The detail kinetic parameters of the cells are further investigated by modeling AC impendence spectra using the standard equivalent circuit as shown in the inset of <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7f</xref>. The values of the electrolyte resistance <italic>R</italic><sub>e</sub>, charge-transfer resistance <italic>R</italic><sub>ct</sub> and SEI resistance <italic>R</italic><sub>SEI</sub> of MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR/rGO cell are 2.2, 203.1 and 140.5 Î©, respectively, which are significantly lower than those of MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR (2.8, 252.2 and 173.2 Î©). The smaller charge-transfer impedance value can lead to highly utilization of the cell even under high rate discharge conditions as reported. The EIS results show that the addition of rGO not only preserved the high conductivity of the composite electrode, but also largely enhanced the electrochemical activity of MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR during the cycling processes. After the rate capability testing (50 cycles), the morphology and structure of the MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR/rGO nanohybrid electrodes were checked by FESEM observations. The sample still maintain the initial morphology after the cycling test (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S6</xref> in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Information</xref>), which reveals the good stabilities of the nanohybrid structures during charge/discharge cycling.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The excellent lithium storage performance of the MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR/rGO can be attributed to the rational design of the unique MoS<sub>2</sub> nanostructure and the synergistic effect between MoS<sub>2</sub> NRs and rGO. (1) 3D assembly of single-layer MoS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets into flowers. Firstly, the single-layer MoS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets as the nanobuilding blocks can provide extra active sites for the storage of lithium ions, which is beneficial for enhancing the specific capacity. Secondly, the single-layer MoS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets subunits can reduce effective diffusion distance for Li ions diffusion and large electrode-electrolyte contact area for high Li ions flux across the SEI layer, resulting in enhanced rate capability. Thirdly, the MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR can accommodate the local volume change upon charge/discharge cycling and is able to alleviate the problem of pulverization and aggregation of the electrode material, hence improving the cycling performance. Fourthly, The 3D nanoflowers architecture assembled with MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR and rGO nanosheets is favored for preventing the aggregation of these nano/microcrystals and graphene sheets, which is also essential for the cycling stability. (2) The addition of rGO nanosheets. Firstly, rGO nanosheets in the obtained nanohybrids can act as an buffer zone to accommodate the volume change of MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR during charge/discharge cycling processes. Secondly, the rGO sheets have a good electrical conductivity and serve as the conductive channels between MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR, which decrease the inner resistance of LIBs. Finally, The electron transfer induced by the interaction between MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR and rGO is also beneficial for decreasing the inner resistance of batteries and are favorable for stabilizing the electronic and ionic conductivity, therefore leading to a higher reversible capacity.</p><p>In summary, we have successfully constructed a 3D MoS<sub>2</sub> nanorose cross-linked by rGO network by a facile route, in which the 3D MoS<sub>2</sub> nanorose is constructed by single-layered or few-layered MoS<sub>2</sub>. When used as the anode materials of LIBs and catalyst for HER, the as-prepared MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR/rGO nanohybrids delivered high performance as compared to rGO free MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR, MoS<sub>2</sub>-NP and MoS<sub>2</sub>-NT. It is suggested that the good electrochemical performance can be attributed to the 3D assembled hierarchical architecture and the interconnection of 3D rGO network. We believe that the properties of the electrode materials and catalyst can be further optimized by carfully tailoring the microstructures, including morphology, composition, crystal plane structure and assembled fashion of the building blocks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Synthesis of MoS<sub>2</sub>-NR/rGO nanohybrids</title><p>1.2âmmol of S powder was dissolved in 14âmL of octylamine, into which 0.0375âmmol of ammonium molybdate [(NH)<sub>6</sub>Mo<sub>7</sub>O<sub>24</sub>Â·4H<sub>2</sub>O] was added. 42âmg GO was dispersed 13.5âmL of ethanol by ultrasound for 2âh.
