Specifically, the dimensions of current collection ribs as well as the rib distribution were optimized to get a maximized power density in a fuel cell. In the modeling process, the power output from a fixed area of membrane is calculated through analysis of an electrical circuit simulating the current from electrochemical reaction flowing to the current collectors. Current collectors of two-dimensional ribs and three-dimensional pillars were considered. Analyses found that three-dimensional pillars allow higher power density in a PEM fuel cell. Considering the mass transfer enhancement effect, three-dimensional pillars as current collectors in gas flow field may be a good choice if the fuel cell operates at low current density and there is no liquid water blocking the flow channels. The analyses did not consider the existence of liquid water, meaning the current density is not very high. The study concluded that decreasing the size of both the current collector and its control area yields a significant benefit to a higher power density. A preliminary experimental test in a PEM fuel cell has verified the conclusion of the analytical work.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Proton-exchange-membrane fuel cell</kwd><kwd>Optimization</kwd><kwd>Current collectors</kwd><kwd>Analysis</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>33</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2012</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2012</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>20</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/40095_2012_Article_2.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Renewable and Green Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1186/2251-6832-3-2" ext-link-type="doi">10.1186/2251-6832-3-2</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>As environmentally friendly power sources, proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells have received increased attention in recent years. Emphasis of research has either been placed on producing high power density with adequate energy conversion efficiency for mobile power source applications or on high energy efficiency with adequate power density for stationary power source applications. One of the big hurdles to the widespread commercialization of fuel cells is due to the high cost and insufficiently high power densities.</p><p>One of the important approaches to having high power density in a fuel cell is to reduce the internal losses. The internal losses can always be attributed to the three types of polarizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]: activation polarization, concentration polarization, and ohmic polarization. As these polarizations increase, the overpotential can become too large for the fuel cell to produce a high power density with reasonably high energy efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The minimization of polarization will largely depend on the mechanism that causes each specific type of polarization. The activation polarization is caused by the slowness of the electrochemical reactions taking place on the surface of the electrodes. Consequently, a proportion of the available ideal voltage is sacrificed in the electrochemical reaction. The concentration polarization is due to mass transfer resistance from bulk flow to the surface of the electrodes when fuel and oxygen are consumed and water is generated. The ohmic polarization is the straightforward resistance to the flow of electrons through the material of the electrodes and the various interconnections as well as the resistance to the flow of protons through the electrolyte.</p><p>The reduction of activation polarization is largely related to membrane and catalyst properties. The electrical potential loss due to ohmic and concentration polarization is strongly related to the configurations of the current conduction and collection elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These elements also significantly affect the mass transfer process since the current collectors are ribs or walls that guide the flow of reactant and product species in a fuel cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The total of ohmic polarization and concentration polarization may take a large proportion in the overall losses of fuel cell if the flow channels are not well designed or if the contact resistances between cell components are large [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>A qualitative description of the control and optimization of ohmic loss is worth reviewing here. On an electrode/electrolyte layer with a fixed area, using small current collectors can expose a larger membrane area to reactant gases, therefore extracting greater current from the electrochemical reaction. However, a smaller current collector has a small contact area to electrodes and also makes the pathway for current conducting along the in-plane direction of electrode layers longer. This increases the ohmic loss. To strike the best balance between the two competing effects, an optimal arrangement of the current collectors on a bipolar plate is needed. This raises issues about optimization of the size of a current collector and the area from which the current due to electrochemical reaction is collected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Obviously, the objective of this optimization is to obtain a maximum power density on an electrode/electrolyte membrane in a fixed area.</p><p>The minimization of the fuel cell voltage losses due to mass transfer and ohmic resistances will largely depend on the design of gas flow fields and current collecting system on the bipolar plates. The bipolar plates perform functions including the electrical connection between cells, supply of reactant gases, water and heat management, and support for membrane electrode assembly (MEA). Improvement in the design of current collecting and flow delivery system is therefore important to the high efficiency and maximized power density in fuel cells.</p><p>Various bipolar plate designs have been tested and evaluated by researchers worldwide in the field of PEM fuel cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The considered factors include the following: properties of materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], cost benefit analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], the optimization of flow field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], etc. The essential objective of these analyses is to achieve a maximum power output at low cost of materials of bipolar plates.</p><p>In this study, the analyses for the optimization of a current collection system will consider two different structures of current collectors. The first type is a two-dimensional (2D) rib design which is very common in proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) products so far; the second type is a three-dimensional (3D) pillar design. The analysis will find optimal sizes of ribs and pillars in a given area of membrane to meet the objective of maximum power density. The same optimization analysis will be carried further for different sizes of the given area of the membrane. Using these results, optimal sizes and ratios of the current collectors and their control areas will be recommended for fuel cell design.</p><p>There are several published papers that present optimization of the flow channels and current collecting ribs using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The models and methods used in these papers are CFD-based and inconvenient for a quick design optimization as might be incidentally required. To avoid the heavy-load numerical computations, the current paper presents a model that can be easily implemented. It considered typical flow channel and current collector structures as they possess the common features of current collection processes in PEM fuel cells. The model and results presented are of significance to the practical design of fuel cells when heavy CFD analysis is unavailable.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Structure of current collectors</title><p>The long gas channels and two-dimensional ribs shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> are typical characteristics of a bipolar plate in a fuel cell.

With the decrease of the contact resistance, the maximum output power density increases. The contact resistance is related to many parameters such as clamping force, elastic modulus, thickness of MEA, the pressure of fuel and oxidant, temperature, and humidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Of these various parameters, the clamping force is relatively important. If the clamping force is unreasonably small, the interfacial contact resistance between the gas diffusion layer and current collector will increase and the maximum power output will decrease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The curves of <italic>d</italic><sub>o</sub> versus <italic>d</italic><sub>c</sub> in Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> show that ideal current collector sizes exist for the specific contact resistance. This result reminds fuel cell manufacturers that the assembly of PEM fuel cell components should be carefully considered in order to attain the optimal compaction pressure for the appropriate contact resistance.

From the analysis, the dimensions of current collecting ribs and the rib distribution can be optimized in order to have maximum power density in a fuel cell. The analytical models consider current collectors of two-dimentional ribs and three-dimensional pillars. Upon optimization, using three-dimensional pillars in a flow field can obtain higher power density in a PEM fuel cell. This conclusion is drawn without considering the liquid water effect in PEM fuel cells.</p><p>It is also found that higher power densities can be obtained using smaller current collectors with optimized distribution in a flow field. Considering the mass transfer enhancement effect, three-dimensional pillars, as current collectors in gas flow field, are recommended. However, when liquid water exists in a PEMFC, two-dimensional ribs are usually better as the liquid can be excluded with more ease than in the case of three-dimensional pillars. A preliminary, yet not comprehensive, experimental test at low current density without liquid water in PEM fuel cells has found better performance when small sized 3D current collecting pillars and optimal distribution are adopted in a flow field.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Authors’ information</title><p>PL earned his Ph.D. (1995) degree in energy and power engineering area from Xi’an Jiaotong University, China.
