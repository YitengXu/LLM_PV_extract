opportunities is materials chemistry, and, more interestingly, the synthesis of novel nanomaterials. Ball-milling procedures and ultrasonic techniques can be regarded as the most important mechanochemical synthetic tools, since they can act as attractive alternatives to the conventional methods. It is also feasible for the utilization of mechanochemical forces to act synergistically with the conventional synthesis (as a pre-treatment step, or simultaneously during the synthesis) in order to improve the synthetic process and/or the material’s desired features. The usage of ultrasound irradiation or ball-milling treatment is found to play a crucial role in controlling and enhancing the structural, morphological, optical, and surface chemistry features that are important for heterogeneous photocatalytic practices. The focus of this article is to collect all the available examples in which the utilization of sonochemistry or ball milling had unique effects as a synthesis tool towards zero- or one-dimensional nanostructures of a semiconductor which is assumed as a benchmark in photocatalysis, titanium dioxide.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Graphical Abstract</title><p id="Par2"><fig id="Figa" position="anchor"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41061_2019_262_Figa_HTML.jpg" position="anchor" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Mechanochemistry</kwd><kwd>Sonochemistry</kwd><kwd>Ultrasound-assisted synthesis</kwd><kwd>One-dimensional titanium oxide</kwd><kwd>Photocatalysis</kwd><kwd>Ball milling</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Narodowe Centrum Nauki</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004281</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">OPUS-13 project nr 2017/25/B/ST8/01592</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Colmenares</surname><given-names>Juan Carlos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>20</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature Switzerland AG</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>10</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>22</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-collection-editor</meta-name><meta-value>Mario J.

Nanostructured and nanoengineered materials garner continuously enhanced research attention and focus due to their unique and novel properties, especially in comparison to bulk materials/counterparts. Application of nanoscaled materials covers a broad range of fields, from electronics and catalytic reactions, to medical and environmental remediation, while novel nanomaterials for new applications are highly desired. The properties of nanomaterials depend on the morphological (shape and size), structural (surface area and porosity), optical (bandgap and light-harvesting capability), and surface chemistry features (nature and availability of the reactive sites). Another important aspect is to obtain well-defined phase composition of high homogeneity. All the above features are directly linked and dependent on the method/protocol of preparation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. By tuning specific synthetic parameters, such as temperature, aging, and washing protocol, it is feasible to control the vital features for a targeted use. For instance, the chemical composition and the porosity are crucial features regarding catalytic synthesis and environmental applications. On the other hand, the optical and morphological features are more important for fabricating crystals for photonic devices.</p><p id="Par4">Another important target in laboratory as well as in industrial research is to find novel ways to conduct reactions following “green” approaches. And toward this direction, photocatalysis is a favorable tool, since it is feasible to utilize a natural source of energy, solar light. The harvesting of light from a photocatalyst can promote specific reactions even without the use of additive chemicals or another source of energy. The most important part in heterogeneous photocatalysis is the development and usage of materials that can function as sufficient photocatalysts, and nanotechnology has been shown capable of providing solutions. Synthesis of nanomaterials and tuning specific features of them like nano-morphological and optical features is an ultimately important and efficient strategy to achieve the above. Even though the synthesis of nanoscaled photocatalysts has been a hot topic during the last decades with many published articles and end-use applications, the use of mechanochemical-based synthetic approaches is not so broadly explored. By gathering the existing knowledge on the effects derived from the mechanochemical forces like ultrasound (US) irradiation and ball milling, it will be realistic to go a step further. The focus of this work is to collect all the reports in which the two above-mentioned techniques were applied during the synthesis of two benchmark semiconductor photocatalysts, titanium dioxide or titanate, in order to obtain various polymorphs with different structural, morphological, and optical features.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Mechanochemical Synthesis</title><p id="Par5">The exploration and discovery of new synthetic approaches as well as the incorporation of advantageous techniques for the development of new or improved properties of already known nanomaterials as photocatalysts is an ongoing and interesting field of research, with fascinating potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In recent years, mechanochemical processes were found to hold great promise, since they are effective and can lead to nanomaterials of novel properties. Another important aspect is that various reported active nanocatalysts can be synthesized in a shorter time compared to traditional wet-chemistry synthesis. In many cases, the design of mechanochemical-based methods can have a positive effect on the “green” character and environmental footprint: consumption of less energy, less or even no use of ﻿hazardous solvents, need of recycling, purification, etc. According to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the definition of a mechanochemical process is: “<italic>a chemical reaction that is induced by the direct absorption of mechanical energy</italic>” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The utilization of mechanochemical forces holds great promise and begets novel approaches in nanocrystalline synthesis (mechanosynthesis), and, more specifically, on how to control the desired features, crucial for different applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Herein, two mechanochemical sources will be introduced: (1) US irradiation (sonochemistry) and (2) ball milling. The rapid growth of the research interest around the utilization of mechanochemistry methods is due to their unique effects. By the correct selection of these effects, it is feasible to obtain novel nanomaterials, and to control desired physical, chemical, and optical properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Simultaneously, it is possible to eliminate the environmental footprint of the synthesis, avoiding, for instance, the usage of high energy, hazardous and non-recyclable chemicals, or by decreasing the duration and the number of steps of the synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Sonochemistry</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>A Brief History</title><p id="Par6">Sound waves not detectable by the human ear with frequencies ranging from 20 kHz to 200 MHz are referred to as ultrasound (US) waves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The effects of sonication are linked to the cavitation phenomena, and they can be chemical, physical, mechanical, or optical. The first reference to the cavitation phenomena by Thornycroft and Barnaby dates from 1895 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. By the time Neppiras introduced the term “sonochemistry” in 1980 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and Makino et al. showed the formation of radical species during the sonolysis of water in 1982 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], the research attraction of sonochemistry had increased dramatically. In general, sonochemistry is linked with the understanding and interpretation of the processes and the effects initiated by US irradiation due to the cavitation phenomena. The main derived results are the enhancement of the reaction rate, radical species formation, as well as mass and heat transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Cavitation Phenomena—Mechanistic Aspects on “How Does Everything Work?”</title><p id="Par7">The formation of cavitation bubbles is due to pressure changes upon the travel of US waves in a liquid. The initially formed microbubbles, consisting of vaporized solvent or/and dissolved gases, grow continuously in size by absorbing energy during the irradiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. After growing to a certain size, they violently collapse, creating a localized “hot spot.” The local pressure and temperature can be above 1000 bars and 5000 K, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The hot-spot concept and the consequential effects can be described by distinguishing three zones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Zone 1 is inside the bubble (primary sonochemistry), zone 2 is at the gas–liquid interface (secondary sonochemistry), and zone 3 is the bulk liquid phase surrounding zone 2. At the interior of the cavity, cleavage of bonds and formation of radicals occurs due to the harsh energetical environment and to the fact that the gaseous concentration is extended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. These radical species can also be transported to zone 2, where reaction of free radicals and pyrolysis can take place, or even to the bulk liquid zone 3. In an aqueous environment, the sonolysis of water can lead to the formation of hydroxyl (HO<sup>·</sup>) or hydroperoxyl (HO<sub arrange="stack">2</sub><sup arrange="stack">·</sup>) radicals, and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). These species can initiate secondary reactions that can play a key role in material synthesis or for catalytic reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Even if the “hot-spot” theory is the most accepted to explain these phenomenas, several studies lead to the proposition of plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], electrical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and supercritical water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] theories, demonstrating that all the mechanisms involving US are not completely known. In addition to the chemical effect of US, various other mechanisms exist, such as physical, mechanical, or light emission (sonoluminescence). The latter one is also valuable in order to determine the active regions and intensity of the US waves using a hydroxyl radical trapping agent, luminol (through chemiluminescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The physical/mechanical effects can be the formation of microjets, turbulence, microstreaming, shockwaves, and agitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. These effects can positively promote the reaction rates by affecting the mass (mixing) and heat transfer phenomena or resulting in some structural alterations of the solids, such as erosion, exfoliation, fragmentation, or deformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">The utilization of US irradiation is a complex aspect, since the formation of cavitation in liquids can be affected by numerous parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Some of them are described in most of the articles, but some were not reported. The frequency and the power of the irradiated US waves can be considered the most fundamental parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Increase of the US frequency leads to shortening of the expansion and compression pressure cycle, and, as a result, to a negative impact on the effectiveness. The formed bubbles/cavitation at higher frequencies have a smaller size and less violent implosion effects, although they have a better size distribution and rate formation. At lower frequency, the cavitation phenomena is more violent and intense with a consequent of higher localized pressure and temperature, as well as higher concentration of free radical formation. However, there are many cases where the high frequencies have desired impact on reaction rates and material synthesis.</p><p id="Par10">Other important parameters that should be taken into consideration for the effective US utilization in synthesis of catalysts and catalytic reactions are the solvent, the presence/concentration of dissolved gases, temperature, and pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The physicochemical parameters of the solvent, for example, the solubility of air or oxygen, viscosity, surface tension, or vapor pressure, play key roles in the cavitation threshold. The increment of the latter parameter has a negative impact on the cycle formation, while, on the contrary, increment of the rest has a positive effect. Initiation of cavitation is facilitated by the presence of dissolved gases. However, the extent of the assistance upon cavitation is related to the physical properties of the gas. Contrary to the chemical processes, the increase of the temperature (until a specific range) has a negative impact on the sonochemical reaction due to increase of the vapor pressure and to the decrement of the gaseous solubility. However, there are many circumstances revealing that the temperature increase has positive and desired effects. An increase of the reactor pressure could cause a decrease of the solvent’s vapor pressure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Ball Milling</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>A Brief History</title><p id="Par11">﻿The earliest recorded mechanochemical process, according to Takacs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], dates to the fourth century BC, in which Theophastus of Eresos noted the synthesis of elemental mercury by grinding cinnabar (HgS) with acetic acid in a Cu vessel, the first documented separation of an elemental metal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Since a solvent was needed even in a minimal amount, this process is regarded nowadays as liquid-assisted grinding (LAG). From this point and afterward, mechanochemistry-based approaches were applied widely in metallurgy and mining, and more details can be found elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. By the use of a pestle and mortar and without a liquid (dry grinding), it was the great experimental physicist, Michael Faraday (discovered the laws of electrolysis, electromagnetic induction, and the rotation of polarized light by magnetism) who conducted displacement reactions between a metal and oxides of less reactive metals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In his first research published in 1820, which can be assumed as the first systematic study of the mechanochemical process, he showed the oxidation of Zn by the reduction of AgCl to Ag by simple mortar grinding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, there was no specific evidence indicating if the grinding promoted the reaction mechanochemically of just thermodynamically by heat generation through friction.</p><p id="Par12">The American chemist and pioneer of photographic chemistry, Mathew Carey Lea (1823–1897), systematically studied and determined (between 1889 and 1894) that the above kind of redox reactions were initiated/activated by mechanochemical effects rather than thermochemical effects.

Although mechanochemistry started to be assumed and accepted as a distinct/separate subdiscipline of chemistry in 1919, a physical chemist and philosopher, the Nobel Laureate Friedrich Wilhelm Ostwald (Nobel prize in Chemistry, 1909, “in recognition of his work on catalysis and for his investigations into the fundamental principles governing chemical equilibria and rates of reaction”) introduced it as a separate chemistry sub-discipline alongside electrochemistry, photochemistry, and thermochemistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].

This is also linked with the diversity of the utilized techniques/equipment (like mortar/pestle, mixer and planetary mills, glass vessel or tube disperser milling, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]) and the reaction types (dry or wet), conditions (gaseous atmosphere, temperature, etc.), and precursors (minerals, metal oxides, metals, chemicals, etc.). Several processes take place during the ball milling like heat and mass transfer.</p><p id="Par15">However, the most crucial driving force is believed to be the generation and relaxation of mechanical stress that have a direct effect on the crystalline lattices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The theory of “hot spots” formation during ball milling is a widely accepted one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Hot spots can be created by the cracking of crystals, resulting in local temperature (up to 5000 K) and pressure, electric fields up to 108 V/m, crack propagation with velocity close to that of sound (105 cm/s), and lifetimes for bond excitation around 100 fs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. These effects are analogues of those of US irradiation in a liquid, even though the formation of a hot spot results from the cavitation phenomena. And it is important that the high amount of added energy is localized microscopically, even nanoscopically, without affecting the macroscopic system to a great extent. This localized high amount of energy can lead to a diversity of consequences, such as lattice deformation, cleavage of bonds, or formation of radicals. And these phenomena cannot be achieved by other synthetic approaches in solution.

Even though Boldyreva did not consider US irradiation in her work, the latter can be utilized for the same fields and applications when a liquid phase is required. The rapid growth of the research interest around the application of mechanochemistry is due recent discovery of unique effects.

Use of titanium dioxide started intensively in 1972, when Fujishima and Honda revealed photocatalytic water splitting by titania electrodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].

However, one crucial drawback arises due to the fact that TiO<sub>2</sub> has a wide bandgap ranging from 3.1 to 3.7 eV, and UV light irradiation is required in order to trigger the photoreactivity. Considering that solar light consists predominately of ﻿visible and infrared light, with ultraviolet light less than 5% of the total solar light, a persistent research effort is focused on narrowing of the bandgap and, as a result, increase of light absorption and photoreactivity under sunlight.

The sol–gel method is the most often applied method, but, unfortunately, it leads to amorphous nanomaterials, and, so, further treatment is needed to induce crystallization, like annealing. On the other hand, hydrothermal-based methods can promote the crystallinity and shape morphology formation, and can be used for larger scaled synthesis compared to the sol–gel method. Crystallinity in relation with the particle size is found to determine the photo-reactivity not only in the case of Ti-based catalyst [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], but also for other materials like ZnO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], MnO<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], graphitic carbon nitride [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>], or other metal oxides/hydroxides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>].

Since the application of mechanochemistry has only lately been assumed and recognized as a useful process-intensification tool, in most works where US or ball milling were applied, the reports have predominately a materials point of view approach without studying a potential photocatalytic reaction. Additionally, the one-dimensional-inspired spatially ordered nanotubular-shaped titanate has gathered intense attention upon its discovery in 1995 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Although the utilization of mechanochemistry in order to improve the synthesis and control specific features has been explored, the photocatalytic capabilities of these titanate nanotubes (TiNTBs) was studied in only a few of these reports. We believe that TiNTBs can display important photocatalyst behavior, and we actively work towards this direction. Based on the above and the available articles, we organized this article into two main parts/sections. In the first part, we collected the reports in which sonication was used in order to obtain nano-engineered materials with enhanced specific features for photocatalytic application, like light absorptivity, decreased bandgap, defects like surface oxygen vacancies, hydroxylation, porosity, etc. The second part is focused on the ball milling-based synthesis/modification approach. Each part is separated in two subsections. The first subsection is focused on zero-dimensional (0-D) photocatalysts, with an emphasis on how to promote the most vital of photochemistry features. In the second subsection, we collect all the research on the synthesis of one-dimensional (1-D) nanostructured titanate, like nanotubes (NTBs) and nanorods.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>PART A—Sonication-Assisted Approaches</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>0-D Particles</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Increasing the Porosity</title><p id="Par21">The supramolecular assembly sol–gel method using surfactant molecules as a template/structure-directing agent for the synthesis of mesoporous titania was reported firstly in 1995 by Antonelli and Ying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. The main drawback of the obtained hexagonally packed mesostructured TiO<sub>2</sub> was the presence of residual phosphorous from the alkyl phosphate surfactant. From then, different long-chain organic molecules were studied as phosphorus-free surfactants. In 2000, Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>] reported a novel synthesis of mesoporous nanostructured titanate of a high porosity, by simultaneous ultrasonication during the synthesis (1.13 cm in diameter Ti horn, 20 kHz, 100 W/cm<sup>2</sup>). An ethanolic solution of the organic amine and titanium isopropoxide was added slowly to a doubly distilled water, followed by aging for 6 h. The addition and the aging occurred under high-intensity ultrasonication, with the maximum temperature reaching 80 °C. The removal of the surfactant from the obtained powder by centrifugation was achieved by dilute ethanolic HNO<sub>3</sub> solution and washing with ethanol. The dried powder was also calcinated in a vacuum at 350 °C (8 h) or 450 °C (4 h). Three different long-chain organic amines (decylamine, dodecylamine, and octadecylamine) were studied as the structure-directing agents.</p><p>The result was spherical or globular particles between 50 and 200 nm as an aggregation of very small nanoparticles, as can be seen from the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM) image (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed an amorphous nature even after calcination at 350 °C, but the rise of the calcination temperature to 450 °C led to an anatase crystallinity. The surface areas after extraction, and calcination at 350 °C and 450 °C, were 853, 467, and 79 m<sup>2</sup>/g, respectively. These values are high for metal oxides and higher than analogous titanate hexagonal mesoporous framework structures synthesized by hydrothermal and then thermal treatment with dodecylamine as a structure-directing agent (710 m<sup>2</sup>/g) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. The most interesting outcome was the that the obtained nanoparticles had a structure of disordered wormhole framework, rather than a long-ranged hexagonal structure. This kind of channel motif and the high surface area are ultimately important for catalytic application, due to the improved diffusion and the availability of the active reaction sites. Compared to various other reports for the synthesis of mesoporous TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles, the benefits of this sonochemical method is the simplicity and rapid rate of synthesis, that leads also to nanoparticles of a high porosity. The authors linked the role of US irradiation to the accelerated condensation/polymerization of titanium hydroxide at the interface of the gas phase of the hotspots and the bulk solution.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>HRTEM images of the as sono-chemically prepared mesoporous titanium oxide with wormhole-like framework structures.</p><p>Reprinted with permission from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>].

The synthetic protocol was based on the addition of different precursors (TPT: tetraisopropyltitanate, TTC: titanium tetrachloride, or a mixture of TPT and TTC) in water under sonication by a directly immersed horn (20 kHz, 100 W/cm<sup>2</sup>). The suspension was ultrasonic-aged for 3 h, with the temperature reaching 80 °C. The precipitates were obtained by centrifugation and subsequently washed with deionized water and ethanol, following by overnight vacuum drying. Compared to the sol–gel-derived materials that were amorphous prior to calcination, the samples obtained via US irradiation showed a high degree of crystallinity. Rutile-phased nanoparticles (crystallographic size based on the application of Scherrer's formula at the XRD: 8.2 nm) were obtained when TTC was used, and anatase phase (3.5 nm) in the case of TPT. The materials synthesized via US were also found to have relatively high surface areas, 103 m<sup>2</sup>/g for the rutile phase and 201 m<sup>2</sup>/g for the anatase phase. The TPT-derived sample (anatase) had a broad size distribution of mesopores (average of 5 nm), linked by the authors to the aggregation of nanoparticles. The rutile phase TTC-derived sample had a non-mesoporous nature.</p><p id="Par24">When a mixture of TPT and TTC were used in a molar ratio of 63.4:36.6, a mixed anatase/rutile phase was determined. Analysis of the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data revealed a crystallographic ratio of anatase to rutile phases of 47.6:52.4, suggesting that in the case of the mixture, part of the rutile phase formed at the expense of TPT. It should be pointed out that without US irradiation, the material obtained with the same mixture of precursors as above mixture was amorphous. The authors also studied the role of temperature. When the synthesis was conducted at 30 °C instead of 80 °C and TPT as precursor, the result was mixed brookite and anatase phases. On the contrary, when TTC was hydrolyzed under sonication at 10 °C, rutile phase was obtained. The role of pH was also studied, but not in detail. When TPT was hydrolyzed under sonication at pH 0.7, the obtained sample of limited mass had a mix of rutile and anatase phases. Increasing the pH of the supernatant of the above synthesis to 8.6 and further sonication for 3 h led to a pure anatase phase. Based on all the above, it is obvious that even though US irradiation and temperature play a key role by promoting the crystallization, the pH can determine the finally crystallographic phase. Another outcome derived by the authors was that the hydrolysis of TPT in water is slower compared to TTC, resulting in a more homogeneous and partly condensed gel. The formation of a hotspot due to US waves inside the gel phase promotes the polycondensation of the Ti–OH species and the formation of a large number of seed nuclei, leading to smaller nanoparticles.</p><p id="Par25">In 2001, Yu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>] studied the effect of US irradiation (cleaner bath, 47 kHz, 120 W<sub>elec.</sub>) as well as the role of the ethanol-to-water ratio during the hydrolysis upon precipitation of titanium tetraisopropoxide in pure water or mixed EtOH–H<sub>2</sub>O solution at different ratios, followed by in-air calcination at 500 °C for 1 h. The ratio of ethanol to water was found to play a key role in the crystallinity of the final powder, and, as a result, in the photocatalytic reactivity. While in pure aqueous solution, the obtained material had a mix of anatase and brookite phases (in a ratio of around 80:20); the addition of methanol led to the elimination of the brookite phase. The materials obtained without using methanol were found to possess a higher photoactivity against the oxidation of acetone in air compared to P25. On the contrary, the material with a solely anatase phase showed the lowest oxidative performance. The authors linked this to the fact that the presence of two crystallographic phases has a positive impact on the photocatalytic activity, by decreasing the combination of the photogenerated e<sup>−</sup>/h<sup>+</sup> pairs. In 2010, Ghows et al. synthesized nanosized TiO<sub>2</sub> by hydrolysis of titanium tetra-isopropoxide in a solution of ethanol/water under low-intensity and high-frequency (500 kHz) sonication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>], although they did not study their photocatalytic properties. The crystalline phase and particle size were dependent on the ethanol-to-water ratio, US irradiation time, and temperature.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Altering the Surface Chemical Features and Bandgap</title><p id="Par26">In 2011, Chen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>] reported that the distortion and doping of the outer surface of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles by high-pressure and high-temperature hydrogenation led to an enhancement of the visible light absorption. Interestingly, and for the first time, the obtained TiO<sub>2</sub> powder did not have the characteristic white color, but a deep dark one. The reported synthesis of this material was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, titanium dioxide nanocrystals of an ~8-nm diameter were synthesized by a sol–gel method, using an organic template and acid (pluronic F127). The white powder obtained after calcination (500 °C, 6 h) underwent hydrogenation under a high-pressure (20 bars) H<sub>2</sub> atmosphere at ~ 200 °C for 5 days, resulting in a black powder, stable even after 1 year.</p><p id="Par27">The HRTEM analysis revealed no shape alteration upon hydrogenation; however, an outer disordered layer around 1 nm in thickness appeared. The X-ray diffractogram of both white and black samples revealed the characteristic peaks of the anatase structure. The Raman spectrum of the white sample showed the six typical Raman-active modes of the anatase structure. The Raman spectrum of the black sample revealed a broadening of the six typical Raman-active modes which were appeared in the white powder, and some additional new bands not linked to any of the three classic polymorphs of TiO<sub>2</sub>. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis revealed an almost identical and impurity-free bonding environment for Ti. On the contrary, the hydrogenation also resulted in a new O 1s peak (at 530.9 eV) which was attributed by the authors to the formation of Ti–OH moieties. Since the dangling bonds tends to attract hydrogen, the authors expected that the H doping occurred predominately in the outer disordered layer where more dangling bonds exist compared to the inner crystalline core. The bandgap of the non-hydrogenated materials was determined by diffuse reflectance as 3.3 eV (slightly higher than bulk anatase). The black TiO<sub>2</sub> showed a dramatically narrower bandgap , while the onset of the optical absorption started from ~ 1200 nm (1.0 eV). The authors linked this to the “band tail states” phenomena, where the valence and conduction bands narrow. ﻿The density of states (DOS) of the black sample compared to the white one can be seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. The photocatalytic activity against methylene blue dye was found to be faster by ~ 7.5 folds under solar irradiation, and the photo-activity was found to be stable even after eight cycles. More interestingly, the black titania sample was found capable of photocatalytic hydrogen production from water under sunlight, with a rate two folds higher than the best semiconductor catalysts at that time. The non-hydrogenated sample was not found photoreactive for water splitting, even after loading with Pt. The H production was repeatable for more than 20 cycles. The authors showed that the hydrogenated TiO<sub>2</sub> did not act as an H reservoir, since 40 mg of H<sub>2</sub> were formed after 100 h of irradiation, with the sample having around 0.05 mg of hydrogen.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>A schematic illustration of the density of states (DOS) of disorder-engineered black TiO<sub>2</sub> compared to that of the white TiO<sub>2</sub> precursor.</p><p>Adapted with permission from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>].

Since the materials were porous, the removal/reactivity in the dark was evaluated in detail prior the evaluation of photocatalytic performance. It was found that the black nanomaterial had an almost three times higher removal capability in the dark compared than the white one, due to the higher surface area and pore volume. The analysis of the interactions (by eliminating the effect of physical adsorption) showed that the US-assisted synthesis led to samples that possess an improved solar- and the visible-light-driven photocatalytic reactivity. The first-order rate constant obtained by the Langmuir–Hinshelwood model for the black sample was 5.8 and 7.2 times higher under solar and visible light irradiation, respectively, compared to the non-US-treated white sample. The decomposition capability was linked to the formation of hydroxyl radicals. The fact that the photocatalytic reactivity improvement was more pronounced in the case of visible light was linked to the enhanced light utilization/harvesting, photo-response range, and the narrowing of the bandgap. Photoluminescence tests showed that the increase of the ultrasonication duration led to a decrement of the photo-generated electrons and holes pairs, with the latter being trapped at the disordered phase.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>1-D Particles</title><sec id="Sec18"><title>1-D Titanium Oxide and Titania</title><p id="Par35">In the literature, various different names/terminologies are used for the characterization of the structure and shape of the 1-D synthesized materials, like fibers, whiskers, nanotubules, fibrils, nanocable, rods, nanowires, belts, since the definition and nomenclature are not well stablished [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>].

Compared to other methods used for the synthesis of ﻿1-D structured titania ﻿(template synthesis, supra-molecular assembles, hydrothermal synthesis, and inductive synthesis), this synthetic approach taking place in a one-pot synthesis is faster, while avoiding the use and removal step of the templates and the need of calcination for crystallization as the last step.</p><p id="Par42">The used synthesized TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles as precursors were prepared ﻿by hydrolysis of titanium butoxide, followed by calcination at 650 °C for 1 h.

Extended dehydration by water washing promotes the transformation to titanate bronze. The role of US is vital since it promotes the reaction between the raw nanoparticles and the base, as well as controls the oriented growth. The synthesis is faster by the application of US compared to the reported hydrothermal methods of nanorod formation. It is worth mentioning that without ultrasonication, no whiskers were obtained. A lower US irradiation power and the hydrothermal treatment promotes the formation of bigger titanate sheets and the exfoliation of nanosheets. The latter roll into NTBs during the washing due to the removal of the ions and, as a result, to alterations of the electrostatic forces/equilibria. Even though the above US-assisted hydrothermal approach successfully led to the preparation of NTBs significantly faster and easily compared to the hydrothermal synthesis, there is a drawback. The synthesis of the precursor starting with titanium butoxide hydrolysis is time-consuming and complex.</p><p id="Par46">In 2005, Joo et al.

The latter monosaturated fatty acid is among the most common fatty acids in nature, produced both from vegetables and animals, and in this work, it was utilized as surfactant and shape stabilizer during the synthesis.

Increase of the irradiation time to 30 min led to swelled nanoparticles with an average diameter of 100 nm, probably as a result of the spherical particles merging. By increasing the duration of irradiation to 60 min, the observed morphology was found to be nanorods like, with lengths in between 100 and 300 nm. By hydrothermal and acidic treatment after the 60 min of US irradiation, the length of the nanorod-like particles increased up to 600 nm. Additionally, the diameter of the tubes was also smaller, but the shape homogeneity was not so perfect. Based on these observations, it can be proposed that the US effects can originate the reaction of the TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles with the base, by promoting the cleavage of the Ti–O–Ti lattice bond and the intercalation of Na<sup>+</sup> at the lattice. The spherical ﻿forms are swollen and transformed to nanorods by increasing their length. Calcination at 300 and 450 °C of the sample obtained after the two-step process was not accompanied with notable shape alterations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">15</xref>c, d).

The majority of the NTBs had a length above 300 nm, while the diameter was in the same range with that of the short ones. Based on the previous analysis by XRD of the <italic>d</italic>-spacing between the adjacent layers of the tube walls by Suzuki and Yoshikawa, the authors concluded that the US irradiation and the resulted increase of the length was not accompanied with an interlayer spacing change. Additionally, the strong intensity diffractions of the initial TiO<sub>2</sub> (anatase phase) were totally diminish in all synthesized TiNTBs.</p><p id="Par53">﻿The dynamic light scattering (DLS) results showed average sizes of 53, 490, and 1760 nm for the samples prepared under 0, 7.6, and 38.1 W, respectively. Additionally, the size distribution was very narrow in the case without US irradiation, and the distribution was dramatically increased by increment of the applied US power. The formation of NTBs in size many folds higher the pristine particles can be linked to bigger peeled nanosheets prior the rolling, and/or to the connection of the formed tubes. An increasing trend was found between the specific surface area (<italic>S</italic><sub>BET</sub>) and the power of US irradiation. The raw powder had an <italic>S</italic><sub>BET</sub> of 8 m<sup>2</sup>/g, and the short NTBs 179 m<sup>2</sup>/g. The US wave exposure at the pretreatment stage led to <italic>S</italic><sub>BET</sub> of 258 and 245 m<sup>2</sup>/g, for US power of 7.6 and 38.1 W, respectively. The positive effect of ultrasonication is via the enhancement of the de-aggregation of the particles, resulting in the peeling thorough swelling of large nanosheets that role to NTBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>]. Without US waves, the size of the peeled nanosheets and, as a result, the size of the formed NTBs is smaller.</p><p id="Par54">The same research team studied (in 2009) the effect of different preparation variables and combinations like particles size of the raw TiO<sub>2</sub> (400 nm and 1 μm), temperature during the synthesis (90–180 °C), and sonication power, with valuable conclusions on how these variables can adjust the morphological and structural features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>]. The hydrothermal treatment at 150 °C without sonication of the commercial TiO<sub>2</sub> particles of size ~ 400 nm led to NTBs of an average length of 79 nm and a specific surface of 179 m<sup>2</sup>/g. The respective values were 143 nm and 118 m<sup>2</sup>/g when the largest (1 μm) raw particles were used. This was linked to the formation of bigger but less in number intermediate sheets during the peeling. By studying the effect of different temperatures (90, 120, 150, and 180 °C), it was concluded that the transformation of titanium dioxide to titanate was complete even at 120 °C. However, increase of the temperature to 180 °C led to a shift of the characteristic diffraction at around 10° 2<italic>θ</italic> to a higher angler (~ 12°), suggesting a narrow interlayer spacing between the layers of walls. Suzuki and Yoshikawa assigned the characteristic XRD reflection peak at 2<italic>θ</italic> = ~ 10° of the hydrothermally synthesized H<sub>2</sub>Ti<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub>.nH<sub>2</sub>O NTBs to an interlayer distance of 0.92 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. An interesting parenthetical fact can be added at this point. The high-temperature XRD pattern obtained at 100 °C was almost identical with the one at room temperature, but at 200 °C, the reflection was shifted to 11.2°. This narrowing of the interlayer space to 0.79 nm was linked to the removal of the water moieties between the layers of the wall. It is worth mentioning that thermogravimetric analysis of the NTBs showed that above 200 °C, the weight loss was very limited.</p><p id="Par55">Going a step further, the team of Tanthapanichakoon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>] chose to study the effect of temperature during the synthesis with or without US pre-treatment by using raw particles of an ~ 400-nm diameter, due to the fact that this raw TiO<sub>2</sub> gave higher <italic>S</italic><sub>BET</sub> compared to the raw one with average particle size of 1 μm.

The latter can be either elemental Ti, either TiO<sub>2,</sub> or a different source of titanium like a mineral. The duration and the power of the BM plays a crucial role, as does the atmosphere in which the process takes place. The achievement of high temperature is found to be in some cases a drawback, and for this reason, the ball milling is performed with breaks or even with the use of a liquid phase. The latter case is referred to as wet ball milling. In most reported cases and especially towards the formation of one dimensional TiO<sub>2</sub> nanostructures, ball milling was utilized as a mechanochemical pretreatment to obtain metastable polymorphs, that can be further tuned in morphology by annealing or wet chemistry. In this part, we collected some reports in which the application of ball milling dramatically affected the final properties of the nanomaterials.

They observed that the phase transformation was not direct, since different transient phases appeared, with the one of type II being predominant. However, no electron microscopy analysis was performed. The importance of this study was the conclusion that the anatase-to-rutile transformation is not a direct process. Based on that, the authors emphasized that the ball-milling technique is feasible to obtain alloys with various non-equilibrium crystallographic phase materials. The intermediate crystallographic phases can further be tuned with various methods, in order to obtain desired photocatalytic properties.</p><p id="Par59">An ultimately serious drawback of the ball-milling technique, especially when the target is a material of a high purity, is the possibility of atmospheric nitrogen incorporation into the structure or metal (predominately iron) from the used ball-milling apparatus.

A high amount of ilmenite exists in the Earth’s crust on all five continents, and on the Moon. The price of the raw material was around 80–107 USD per metric ton in 2004, while a peak was achieved in 2012 reaching even 350 USD per ton. In recent years, the cost has been around 250 USD/ton.

The ilmenite mineral was ball-milled with the presence of activated carbon at a ratio 4:1 at room temperature and under vacuum. The role of the latter as mechanical activation agent was to trigger the initial reduction to TiO<sub>2</sub>. The obtained ultra-fine powder was annealed first at different high temperatures (900–1200 °C) in order to form the metastable phases. The low and controlled heating rate (5–10 °C) in an argon atmosphere with hydrogen flow was a critical step in order to obtain the desired metastable phases. It was reported that the presence of nitrogen led to an alternative redox reaction and ﻿iron nitride was formed. At temperature less than 1100 °C, the formed phase was rutile, which could remain in the same form after the second annealing step. The optimum duration of annealing was 8 h at 1200 °C, since prolonged heat treatment led to the formation of FeTi alloys. The second step of annealing was conducted at 700 °C in a ﻿N<sub>2</sub>–5%H<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. The result was the gradual formation of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorods and iron.

It can be suggested that the thermal effects during the synthesis when the temperature is higher than 150 °C overcome the effects of the US pre-treatment. Especially in the case of a basic hydrothermal process, the utilization of sonication (US) as the pre-treatment has a vital role in the formation of 1-D nanostructures.

The goal of the present work is to highlight the developments in the area mechanochemical approaches when designing new synthetic strategies of nanostructured materials, as well as to call and initiate the attention for the possibilities for future utilization and exploration. We believe that nanoscaled and especially nanotubular-shaped titania can be further studied as photocatalyst, and we actively work towards this direction. Applying mechanochemistry will also be interesting to conduct for the design and synthesis of novel nanostructured electrodes for electrochemical catalytic reactions. Even though it is impossible these two techniques are simultaneously combined, the utilization of both at separate steps of synthesis can beget innovative approaches towards the synthesis of highly photo-active zero- and/or one-dimensional titanium-based catalyst, pure or doped with heteroatoms, like nitrogen or metals. In-depth study of the photocatalytic properties and applications of the TiO<sub>2</sub> NTBs, as, for instance, advanced oxidation processes or biomass valorization, can lead to interesting and important outcomes, as occurred in the case of their application in electrocatalysis and photo-remediation. Additionally, the use of a simple and economic US bath or ball-milling grinder can be utilized as a powerful synthetic tool. It is also important to point out that the use of mechanochemical processes in lab during the synthesis can lead to effects not yet studied, hypothesized, or imagined. Last but not least, we would like to emphasize that it will be absolutely beneficial if more details are provided when mechanochemistry is applied, such as calorimetric evaluation of the setup,
