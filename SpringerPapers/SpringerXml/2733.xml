Typically, in political debates the aim and the technologies of the transition are subject to belief, prejudice or a hidden agenda. Governments in a democratic system may be forced by public pressure to take action, however, in order not to lose majorities, only small steps are taken to have a minimum of collateral damage to existing power structures and interest groups and to minimize opposition. The government tries to give these small steps approximately the right direction with respect to the aim and the external pressure. In the best case, this approach will improve the current energy situation but it will not necessarily lead to a solution of the energy problem. From the mathematical point of view, the solution follows incrementally a promising gradient in a multidimensional parameter space, but it may still be useless in view of the best path to the optimum position.</p><p id="Par3">In this chapter the opposite approach is taken. It is attempted to find the optimum and consistent energy model for the future (e.g. in 80 years from today), guided by general scientific and technological considerations, without taking the detailed status quo into account. The pathway to achieve this future goal by an energy transition process is regarded as an independent, second step that will be determined largely by economic and political considerations.</p><p id="Par4">This chapter will describe the basic technologies that are available to produce renewable energies. It will point out the necessities and options of energy transport and energy storage and set up a concept for an integrated global energy system that includes trade of electricity and gas and combines the sectors of electricity, heat and mobility.</p><sec id="Sec1"><title>Overview of the Future Energy System</title><sec><p id="Par5">The energy system can be divided into four categories: energy production, transport, storage and consumption. The proposed future configuration of these four categories is subject of this chapter and depicted in Box 3.1.</p></sec><sec id="FPar1"><title>Box 3.1 Energy in Times after the Energiewende [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]</title><p id="Par6"><inline-graphic xlink:href="MediaObjects/430174_1_En_3_Figa_HTML.gif"/>The envisaged future energy system is structured as follows: Energy production will be done at the most cost-efficient places but also locally at the consumer side.</p><p id="Par7">A distribution network will connect all consumers and all small producers using an AC high voltage grid. In addition, a HVDC overlay network will connect distant centres of electricity consumption and/or production. A gas network will exist in parallel to allow for international trading and for special applications, e.g. for chemical industry and for fuel cell applications in mobility.</p><p id="Par8">A dual energy-storage system is needed: one system that has large (but cheap) capacity and one that has high efficiency. The highly efficient storage with limited capacity is needed to absorb daily fluctuations. A second, large-capacity storage is needed for seasonal storage. It may have low efficiency, as its cycle time is long, and it will be based on gas or other chemical fuels.</p><p id="Par9">The energy consumption is divided into the electricity, the mobility and the thermal sector. A load management system will allow for a central regulation of the electricity consumption, especially in the mobility and the heat sector.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Energy Production: Locally or at Best Sites?</title><p id="Par10">More than ten years ago, when people thought about the options of renewable energy production at large scale, the technologies for solar and wind energy were still in their infancy and quite expensive. At that time physicists and engineers from Germany and North Africa developed the DESERTEC idea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It was based on the insight that it is cheaper to produce solar energy at large scale in Africa and transport it to Europe instead of producing it in Europe and save the investment of the long cables. It has been calculated that the technical solar energy potential of the deserts is about 340,000 GW<sub>el</sub> on day/night, all year average, using current technology and a land use factor of 4.5%. That means that there is potentially about 20 times more energy available in deserts than needed to solve all energy problems of the world.</p><p id="Par11">DESERTEC has generalized this concept and proposes to use a mixture of all suitable renewable energies, but to focus the energy production in those areas, where the production is most cost effective. This means, that preferentially the relatively stable and strong winds offshore and the stable and strong solar radiation in deserts should be harvested (see Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">3.1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">3.2</xref>). DESERTEC had its highlight in 2009, when Dii, the DESERTEC Industrial Initiative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], was formed as a consortium of a number of major German players from power industry, banking and insurance companies in cooperation with a few other European and North African companies. One of the shareholders of Dii was the DESERTEC Foundation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], a non-profit NGO, that had been founded a year before to foster the realization of the DESERTEC concept between Europe and MENA (Middle East and North Africa). Investments on the order of 400,000,000,000 € were discussed to supply 15% of the (electrical) power of Europe. For comparison: According to the European Environment Agency, this number equals the economic losses in their member countries due to climate-related extreme events since 1980 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 3.1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The solar radiation in deserts (<italic>red</italic>) is sufficient to supply the energy for the whole mankind. The technical potential of solar energy in deserts is about 20 times larger than the current global energy demand. The <italic>yellow</italic> points show the electrical lights at night, pointing to today’s centres of electricity demand. 90% of the world population lives in a distance of less than 3000 km from the next desert and can easily be supplied with solar power from deserts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/430174_1_En_3_Fig1_HTML.gif" id="MO1"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 3.2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Wind power can be harvested anywhere, but the most suited areas are regions with strong average wind, especially in coastal areas.

It was attractive for the companies because it was at the same time forward-looking, sustainable and it preserved the predominance of big companies, as only big players could handle the technology and the scale of the investments.</p><p id="Par13">The alternative draft to this concept is the production of energy locally as proposed by e.g. Hermann Scheer, Eurosolar and many others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The idea behind this concept is to promote energy autonomy and to disempower big power companies, using the—at that time—very expensive photovoltaics in combination with local on-shore wind power and biogas production. This idea became very popular in the solar community in Germany and was picked up by the (green) government by releasing the “Stromeinspeisungsgesetz” (Act on the Sale of Electricity to the Grid) and the “Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz” (Renewable Energy Law, EEG) in 1991 and 2000 respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In combination with a high feed-in-tariff, the installation of PV became a money-spinner. While originally, after the German unification in 1990, the newly created East-German PV industry and many German house owners profited from this political decision, very soon the dominant PV producers came from China, and also the owners of the PV fields were—to an increasing extend—foreign investors. As a collateral damage of this boom, the German PV industry collapsed and private German electricity consumers will have to payback a high EEG feed-in compensation payment for the coming 20 years.</p><p id="Par14">With the Arab Spring in 2010 and major conflicts in the Arab World, the realization of the DESERTEC concept, i.e. to set up a strong power trading between Europe and MENA, became more and more difficult. The political situation made any long-term planning and investments difficult for occidental investors. At the same time, the power market in Europe was saturated, the oil prices fell and the political atmosphere in Europe was not in favour of creating additional dependencies with Arabian energy markets. As a consequence, most of the big players left Dii, and its headquarter moved from Germany to Dubai. Dii started to focus on the fast-growing domestic market in MENA. The new players of Dii are mainly Arabian and Chinese companies with only one German company left from the original Dii. It can be expected that these companies try to dominate the renewable energy market in MENA in future, and once the domestic market is saturated and the prices are down, MENA will have the potential to flood the European market with low priced renewable energy. In case this scenario is realized, Germany would have missed the opportunity to profit from its pioneering position in renewables.</p><p id="Par15">One of the geopolitical aims of DESERTEC was to increase prosperity and stability in MENA by a closer economic interdependence with Europe through energy trade and an increased employment rate in MENA. Also this objective failed for political reasons and the states in both regions were unable to build these new bridges between Africa and Europe, at least for the time being. Instead, unemployment, destabilisation of political structures and wars lead to migration of Arabic people to Europe, which caused new political problems there. All that emphasizes the importance to reconsider the political approach of DESERTEC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Technologies for Renewable Energy Production</title><p id="Par16">Which renewable energy technologies will we use in future? Even if forecasts of the future usually fail, valid predictions, based on certain preconditions, can still be made when they are based on scientific facts. Various renewable energy sources are distributed very unequally in time and in space around the globe. Therefore, there is not one technology that will take over the future renewable energy production, but a locally adjusted mixture of several technologies.</p><p id="Par17">Renewable energies fluctuate at all relevant time scales: minutes (the timescale of passing clouds), hours (the timescale of the day/night rhythm), weeks (weather conditions), months (seasons, monsoon, …) and years (e.g. good and bad years for biomass production, or phenomena like El Niño). Figures <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">3.1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">3.2</xref> show examples of the geographical potential of solar and wind power around the globe. The by far strongest source is solar energy. Its technical potential exceeds the energy demand of humans by large factors. The most suitable areas for solar energy production are the deserts of the world in Africa, Asia, America and Australia (e.g. the Deserts Sahara, Gobi, Atacama, Kalahari etc.). The wind potential is especially large offshore, in coastal areas, on mountains, and in the areas of trade winds (e.g. Morocco) and anti-trades (Westerlies) north of the Horse latitudes. Biomass production is best in areas that have sufficient water and sun and good soil. Hydro energy is best in rain-laden, mountainous areas like Norway. Marine hydro energy can be easily harvested in areas with large tidal amplitudes. Geothermal energy is best suited for areas with recent volcanic history (New Zealand, Iceland). It cannot be predicted which energy technology political and economic leaders will foster in their region of interest. Nevertheless, it can be expected that sooner or later the most suitable technology will establish in the most suited areas, provided that a global energy exchange and a global free market for renewables will be established.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par18"><bold>Photovoltaics</bold></p></list-item></list>Today, photovoltaic modules are highly efficient and less and less expensive devices to convert solar power to electricity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. They have the advantage to be scalable, i.e. to use the same technology for small and for large devices (from mW to GW), to be easy to use, to have low maintenance costs, to need hardly any infrastructure, and especially no cooling water. PV panels sometimes are installed on devices that track the sun in order to maximize output. Today, due to the decreased prices of PV modules, the tracking mechanism usually does not pay off any more, especially in cloudy regions with a large contribution of stray radiation where tracking has a limited effect. The prices dropped dramatically as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3.3</xref>. Energy generation costs for PV were as low as 3 $ct/kWh in a recent bid in Dubai for an 800 MW power station and 2.91 $ct/kWh in a bid for a 120 MW station in Chile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3.3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>In agreement with the economies of scales, the prices for PV modules dropped by about 20% for every doubling of cumulative shipped volume, which corresponded to about halve costs every 10 years. The module production is given in the unit MW<sub>P</sub> which is defined as the (peak) power of the modules at nominal solar irradiation in megawatts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/430174_1_En_3_Fig3_HTML.gif" id="MO3"/></fig><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par20"><bold>Concentrated Solar Power</bold></p></list-item></list>Concentrated solar power (CSP) uses direct radiation by tracking the sun and focusing the solar radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This makes the technology suitable only for regions that usually have clear sky without clouds, mist, dust or sand storms. Four different technologies are available: Sterling Dishes, Concentrated Photovoltaics (CPV), Solar Troughs and Power Towers.</p><p id="Par22"><bold>Stirling Dishes</bold> use parabolic mirrors in combination with a Stirling engine. This technology is not economically viable any more due to the cost decline of PV.</p><p id="Par23"><bold>CPV</bold> uses arrays of mirrors or lenses that focus the solar radiation on an array of small PV cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The advantage of CPV is the largely reduced size of the PV cells, that allow for the use of more expensive but highly efficient cells. The disadvantage of CPV compared to PV is that it requires movable parts, that it cannot make use of diffuse radiation, and that it—due to the concentration of the radiation—may need cooling in hot environment. The cost advantage of CPV compared to PV is currently diminishing due to the cost decline of standard PV.</p><p id="Par24"><bold>Solar Troughs</bold> and Power Towers convert solar radiation into heat and heat into electrical power. The advantage of the solar thermal technology is that it converts the whole radiation spectrum of the sunlight into heat and not only parts of the visible light. Further, it does not require semiconductor technology, and the conversion of heat to power uses mature, conventional technology as developed for fossil power stations. The most important advantage of solar thermal power plants is their ability to produce electrical power on demand by storing thermal energy. In addition to electricity production, the CSP plants can also deliver thermal energy for industrial applications that need process heat, e.g. for desalination plants. During periods of insufficient solar irradiation (e.g. bad weather periods), thermal power plants can be fired with fossil or renewable fuel to guarantee 100% operation without having to invest in a separate backup power station.</p><p id="Par25">Today, most CSP installations use parabolic troughs as 1-dimensional focus elements. The whole system is turned and follows the position of the sun. Light is focused on a central moving absorber pipe that receives the energy and transports it to the generator. In an advanced design, a Fresnel reflector with small movable mirrors and a fixed absorber pipe replaces the large movable parabolic mirror system.</p><p id="Par26">The <bold>Power Tower</bold> technology uses a 2-dimensional tracking system of numerous heliostats, which are realized as more or less flat mirror systems (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">3.4</xref>). This technology is still in its infancy, but first commercial systems are operating successfully. The 2-dimensional focusing allows for very high temperature (~1000 ℃), which leads to a higher Carnot efficiency compared to solar troughs. There has been much progress to reduce the price for the heliostats and the tracking system.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 3.4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The Power Tower technology focuses solar radiation onto a central tower where the high temperatures of the focus are used to generate electricity with high efficiency. Tanks with molten salt store the solar thermal energy to allow for a continuation of electricity production after sunset. The storage tanks are visible as small cylinders at the bottom of the tower. This photo shows a plant in Spain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/430174_1_En_3_Fig4_HTML.gif" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p id="Par27">The Power Tower has the advantage, that except for the central installation of the heat exchanger and the turbine, the rest of the solar field is low technology that can be fabricated locally in developing countries. Therefore, this technology will have large cost saving potential in mass production and a large part of the investment will have local value added. One example is the new Solar Tower station <italic>Khi Solar One</italic> in South Africa. In contrast to a trough system, the power tower field does not require a horizontal surface and can be installed in hilly areas. The size of a power tower field is limited by light diffusion to an output of about 100 MW. Larger power stations require multiple towers, which makes the technology scalable. The high temperatures of around 1000 ℃ are a challenge to material scientists, but their effort will pay back, as high temperatures increase not only the Carnot efficiency of the generator but also reduce the costs and conversion losses of the heat storage.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par28"><bold>Wind Power</bold></p></list-item></list>Since decades, wind turbines are well established as a very profitable technology of producing renewable power, especially in coastal regions and on top of mountain ridges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Wind turbines have problems with public acceptance, especially in the well-populated Germany, where the fight of residents against the landscape disfiguring pylons reminds us of Don Quixote’s tilting at windmills. Possibly, the eye-catching continuous movement of the propellers in a steady landscape and the unconscious perception of subsonic noise might disturb sensitive people, however, one can expect that future generations will get used to the view of wind farms like our generation got used to the view of busy and noisy roads everywhere in our originally peaceful landscapes.</p><p id="Par30">It can be expected that wind turbines will be—together with solar energy—the prime choice for large-scale renewable power production. Wind power has the drawback of being volatile, but it is a means to produce power at night and at least in the northern hemisphere it is complementary to solar energy in the cycle of the year as solar power has its maximum in summer and while wind has its maximum in winter.</p><p id="Par31">The question if onshore or offshore wind farms are more economical is not decided yet and depends on the architecture of the total energy system. The German offshore wind farms are far away from the coast, which makes the technology very expensive, as long high voltage DC (HVDC) cable connections are needed and the maintenance costs increase with the distance from the coast. On the other hand, the offshore winds are stronger and less volatile, and the potential for a future expansion is much larger offshore than onshore.

This leads to two extreme constructions: the run-of-the-river hydroelectricity with only a small difference in height but a large flux and the hydroelectric stations with a huge dam and a moderate flux.

The origin of the biomass is versatile: wood from forests, bushes from scrubland, energy plants from agriculture, algae and plants from lakes, ocean, or hydro culture, waste from agriculture or households, faeces from livestock or communities. To make use of biomass, it can be treated in several ways. Besides direct burning, the main two methods are pyrolysis and fermentation. Pyrolysis can be applied to produce gas (mainly methane and hydrogen), oil, tar and/or to produce charcoal. Fermentation is used to produce biogas or alcohol (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">3.7</xref>). Certain energy plants are used to directly produce biodiesel, e.g. seeds from Jatropha Curcas that contain up to 40% oil. The big advantage of biomass as energy carrier is that it is easily storable e.g. as pellets, liquids or gas and can be used as “energy on demand”.

Due to the compression pump, there is a large pressure difference before and behind the expansion valve. Due to the low pressure behind the valve, the liquid evaporates. While the molecules separate during evaporation, the intermolecular potential slows the relative motion of the molecules down, which means that the vapour becomes very cold.

Electricity is only about 17% of the total energy consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The main, and the most difficult part of the energy transition is not the electricity sector but the rest. A second common mistake is to predict that due to energy saving and efficiency increase the electricity demand will decrease in future. Instead, a dominant part of the heat and mobility sector, which is currently predominantly energized by fossil sources, will have to be converted to electrical supply for the following reasons: First, the future primary energy source will be solar and wind, which can be directly harvested as electricity. Other energy carriers (like biogas) will not be available in the required amount. Secondly, electrical engines and heat pumps are more efficient than fuel or gas driven devices. Therefore, the electricity sector will experience an increase in volume by a factor of somewhere between 2 and 6, depending on the efficiency increase and saving potential of the future heating and mobility sector.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par59"><bold>Mobility</bold></p></list-item></list>The most efficient engines for the mobility sector are electric engines.

This problem has been avoided for the electrification of trains, subways, and trolleybuses by overhead lines or conductor rails. First examples of overhead lines on highways that supply trucks are currently tested in several countries. In future, the charging of batteries can possibly be achieved by contactless inductive charging stations at parking lots, bus stops or even as subsurface rails along certain roads and highways. If the charging of batteries has to be done in short time during a stopover, one has to take into account that the required peak power of the charging station has to be quite high. Take e.g. a Tesla Model S car with an 85 kWh battery and a consumption of 24 kWh/100 km [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The range of the car is nominally 85/24*100 km = 350 km. If one wants to charge it at a standard home connector with a 16 A fuse, it requires nominally 85000 Wh/230 V/16 A = 23 h to recharge it. To charge it within about one hour, a connection with 85 kW is required. This numerical example illustrates, that the electrification of mobility requires not only an overall increase of electricity supply, but also dedicated connectors with high power wherever people want to charge their cars in short time.</p><p id="Par63">While private vehicles normally can be charged over night or during working hours, commercially used vehicles and especially long distance trucks cannot operate with limited range and long recharging times for batteries. A much more useful concept for long-distance routes is a business model where the battery is semi-automatically exchanged at charging stations and replaced by a charged battery. Another option is to use a redox flow battery instead of a standard battery (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">3.9</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In this case the truck driver just has to exchange the “discharged” electrolytes by “charged” electrolytes. In both cases the stopover time of the truck or motor coach is short.

This power is distributed to the consumers in a common grid. The power consumption has more or less known variations over the day. It can be split into a large base load and an additional varying contribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p id="Par72">The regulation of the power stations with respect to the load changes is described in a simplified way as follows: If the load on rotating generators increases, the rotation becomes slightly slower, and the frequency and the voltage decrease slightly. When a frequency shift is observed, the operators of the power station will increase the power production of the power station, e.g. by additional firing in case of a fossil power station or by additional water flow in a water power station. This way the frequency rises again to its original value and is kept constant over the day.</p><p id="Par73">In a large, international power grid the frequencies and phases of the power grid need an overall synchronization. If two sub-nets start to be out of phase, there will be voltage differences at the two ends of the power line that connects the subnets. These out-of-phase voltages can generate huge electric currents in the connecting lines. This effect has to be strictly avoided as otherwise the wires will overheat. If a sudden load or production change happens in the grid, this transient has to be compensated within a short moment. If this is not done, the subnet where the transient happened will start to be out of phase and it will be (automatically) disconnected in order not to destroy the power lines. In some cases, switching off a subnet causes load problems in the neighbouring subnet. In a chain reaction, a large-scale blackout can be produced. These large-scale blackouts are a direct consequence of the archaic design of the AC power grids.</p><p id="Par74">In future, large-scale grids should get rid of the frequency synchronization by using DC instead of AC grids as described in Sect. <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">3.8</xref>. In principle, power transients can be compensated not only by controlling generators but also by fast load and storage control. The brute force method of load control is to switch off electricity in whole subnets in case the demand is higher than the production. In some African cities it is common to switch off electricity in several districts of big towns every evening. In this case, not only air conditioning and washing machines, but also light, computers, TV’s and lifts get stuck. A more sophisticated system, called “smart grid” is needed to regulate the consumption in a more intelligent way.</p><p id="Par75">In a renewable energy system, the few large-scale power stations are replaced by a large number of power generators at all scales, from small PV panels to large solar power stations, wind farms and hydroelectric dams. In this system, not only the power consumption but also the power generation is volatile. Therefore, it is of increasing importance to control the power generation and also the power consumption in a large-scale coordinated but still decentralized manner in order to keep the grid stable. In the past, the power generation followed the power demand. In a smart grid, both, production and consumption should be matched in the most economic and safe manner. The smart grid has three ingredients:</p><p id="Par76"><bold>Monitoring</bold>: Online metering and monitoring allows for a better forecast of power consumption and production.</p><p id="Par77"><bold>Accounting</bold>: Time-dependent accounting allows for tariffs that encourage power consumption at times where power is abundant and that discourages power consumption at times where renewable power is scarce.</p><p id="Par78"><bold>Remote control and time shifting</bold>: Switching on and off producers and consumers as well as loading and discharging power storage are means to guarantee a safe power supply, to avoid power failures, and to maximize the economic output. The typical example is the washing machine that is running at night when there is little power consumption or at lunchtime when there is too much solar power. Studies have shown that today the impact of smart metering in households is small, because the average consumer does not care about small additional costs for electricity. Today, the number of devices that can be delayed in power consumption without comfort loss of the consumer is small and not really relevant compared to the overall electricity production. In contrast to the average person’s feeling that electrical power is very expensive, even in a German household with large additional EEG charges the electricity costs are usually small compared to the monthly costs for heating and mobility.</p><p id="Par79">In a 100% renewable energy system, this will be completely different. The main consumers of power will not be the electric lighting, the hover, hairdryer and the TV set in the households, but heat pumps, air conditioning and batteries of cars. Power consumption peaks can be avoided by time shifts in the operation of these devices. This is uncritical most of the time and can be done in an intelligent way without notice by the consumer.

If a consumer owns a home-battery, the situation will be even more flexible. The private home-battery can be a device to earn money by allowing the grid operators to charge and discharge it in a remote-controlled mode to minimize fluctuations and loads on the grid.

There are basically two ways to handle the volatility: storage capacities level out the temporal fluctuations and power grids average out spatial fluctuations. An intelligent combination of the two methods will yield the most economical way to provide everybody with the power that is needed. According to the laws of statistics, the relative amount of fluctuations of uncorrelated sources and consumers becomes smaller and smaller the more sources and consumers are connected to the network. In the simplest example of uncorrelated fluctuations, the relative amount of fluctuations is proportional to the root of the inverse number of participants. In reality, the sources and the consumptions are both correlated statistically. For example, the production of a single PV module fluctuates according to the clouds that are passing by, so that two modules at a distance of e.g. 1 km are statistically independent at a first glance, but on an over clouded day all PV modules in a certain region produce low output at the same time, which means they are correlated. Weather phenomena that define the output of PV and wind energy are typically correlated on scales of a few hundred kilometres.</p><p id="Par82">One needs to interconnect solar and wind power on scales of 1000 × 1000 km<sup>2</sup> or more (depending on the geographical region) to average out a large fraction of the spatial fluctuations of renewables that are induced by weather phenomena. This is in line with the proposal of DESERTEC. It proposed to have an overlay network in Europe and to connect it with North Africa. This way Europe can take advantage not only of the averaging of the European energy consumptions (e.g. different times of rush hour) and of different weather conditions from the Mediterranean to the Scandinavian countries, but it can also take advantage of the stable conditions of the trade winds in North Africa and the stable solar irradiation in the Maghreb region (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">3.10</xref>).<fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig. 3.10</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The original DESERTEC concept suggests a HVDC transmission network to trade electricity between Europe and Middle East and North Africa (MENA).

Such a global grid could produce solar power 24 h a day, and the dark side of our planet could be powered by solar energy from the illuminated side of the planet. This sounds like science fiction, but nevertheless connections between Europe, and various regions in Asia and Africa make a lot of sense, regardless if the circle around the globe will be closed or not (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">3.11</xref>).<fig id="Fig11"><label>Fig. 3.11</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The global power grid.

Electricity is usually transported by AC overhead transmission lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In the future, fossil sources will lose their pre-eminence and electricity will become a prime energy carrier. Energy transport by electrical lines will have to be enforced and extended.</p><p id="Par85">One has to distinguish between a distribution network and a so-called overlay network. In future, the task of the distribution network is to connect every small producer (e.g. PV module) and every small consumer (e.g. household) with a general network. The range of the distribution network covers typically a town or a rural area up to a diameter of a few hundred kilometres.</p><p id="Par86">The task of the overlay network is to interconnect distribution grids and major consumers and producers of electrical energy on a scale of up to several 1000 km. To a large extend, the existing electricity networks in many countries (e.g. Germany) were designed 50 years ago, centred on the main conventional and nuclear power stations. They connect to almost every household and are interconnected and synchronized throughout most of Europe. However, even if today most of the European countries are interconnected, this does not mean that there is an efficient way to trade electricity from one country to another one over long distances. The AC power lines have large losses at large distances. This is due to the emission of electromagnetic radiation at 50 Hz (also called electro-smog), due to the heat loss in dielectrics that surround the cables, and also due to the skin-effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The skin effect is caused by electro-magnetic induction. It produces circular currents inside the conductor that heat it up and expel the transmission current to the outer surface of the cable. The transport of AC electricity over more than a few hundred km is not very economic.</p><p id="Par87">This problem can be overcome by using high voltage DC currents. Today, this technology is well established for point-to-point connections, using voltages of almost 1 GV with losses of less than 3% every 1000 km. Only very recent technologies allow for a designs of HVDC networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] that are multiply interconnected, and where the direction and amount of the power flow can be well controlled. They will likely be the basis for future overlay networks. Inverter stations are needed to connect the AC distribution networks with the HVDC overlay network. The problem of large-scale blackouts should be solvable in DC networks, as the various AC distribution networks can run asynchronously, so that a power failure in one network does not necessarily screw up the other ones. The converter stations will adjust the frequency of the AC networks electronically.</p><p id="Par88">What is the reason why AC has been established as the prime choice in the old days, if DC is the better choice for transmission lines? There are two main reasons: The generation of electricity was mainly done by rotating generators and the main users were rotating engines. Rotating devices use naturally AC, or, more precise, three-phase alternating current. More important is the next reason: The transmission of power in cables requires voltages that are as high as possible to minimize ohmic losses. On the other hand, the voltage in households has to be sufficiently low for safety reasons. Therefore, the transformation of voltages is an essential part of any grid. Until recently, there was no technology available to transform DC voltages on the MW or GW level, whereas the transformation of AC voltages can easily be done using transformers. This is the reason why AC was the only choice for high voltage lines in the old days. Today, more and more producers (e.g. PV modules) and consumers (LEDs, electronic devices) use direct currents (DC), so that in principle the whole grid could be DC. However, DC-DC transformation requires still expensive power electronics. Therefore, the AC technology will probably remain the best choice in future for distribution networks, while DC will be the choice for efficient long distance lines.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Gas or Electricity?</title><p id="Par89">In addition to the electricity network, Germany and many other countries have a widely ramified distribution network for natural gas to supply gas for heating. In addition, there is an overlay network of gas pipelines as interconnection for international trading and to connect to gas fields in Russia, the Netherlands and Arabic countries.</p><p id="Par90">In principle, the future energy distribution system can be based either on (renewable) gas or electricity or both. Also other renewable energy carriers (liquid or solid) are conceivable in a future renewable system. Examples are liquid ammonia or solid burnable metal like magnesium, both (re-)generated by renewable energies. Today’s double infrastructure of gas and power is historic in the sense that gas was required for affordable heating energy and power was needed for electrical equipment.</p><p id="Par91">In principle one can imagine that in future a pure gas distribution system without a power grid is sufficient. Today there are efficient ways available to convert gas to power on demand in individual households or blocks of houses, e.g. by using fuel cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p id="Par92">However, it seems more likely, that a pure electricity distribution system will be the future of the typical household for the following reason: An electrical connection is simple, cheap, efficient, and has low maintenance costs. It allows for an immediate feed-in of self-produced power from PV into the grid, and it allows for easy load management (smart grid). Due to improved insulation of houses, the future energy consumption for heating will be reduced significantly, so that a gas supply system in addition to the electrical supply will probably not be economical any more. Instead, electrically driven heat pumps will be the most economical way of heating and cooling, possibly in combination with rooftop solar heaters or geothermal heat collection. Also cooking is more ecological by using modern induction cooktops or microwaves compared to gas cookers.</p><p id="Par93">While the question of gas or electricity is probably decided for the distribution network in favour of a pure electrical system, the situation may be different for the overlay network where a combined system of HVDC and gas may be the most economical choice:</p><p id="Par94">The necessity of a HVDC overlay network has been described above. It is needed to average out power fluctuations at large distances, and it can save costs by reducing the need for large local storage capacities and local power stations. Nevertheless, there is one major problem for the expansion of the overlay network: There is a strong public opposition against new overhead lines, especially in Germany. The arguments can be mitigated by using underground cables, by repowering existing AC lines by stronger HVDC lines, or by locating new lines along train and highway structures or rivers. A successful approach is also to share planning and profit with local stakeholders, as studied for example by the Renewables Grid Initiative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p><p id="Par95">In addition to the electrical overlay grid, a gas pipeline infrastructure may be useful and necessary for the following reasons: In the next chapter, a gas-based storage system for uninterrupted electricity supply is introduced. This storage system will profit strongly from (renewable) gas trading within a transnational, long-distance pipeline system. A gas infrastructure is also useful for mobile applications, e.g. for hybrid vehicles with fuel cells.</p><p id="Par96">Gas pipelines have several advantages compared to HVDC lines: Typically, they have 10 times the capacity, a fifth of the costs, they have basically no environmental impact, are accepted by the public and there is an existing infrastructure of long distance exchange pipelines in many countries. The disadvantages are the large loss in the conversion processes of renewable power to gas and back to power and larger energy costs for transmission (pumps and leaks).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>The Dual Storage Concept</title><sec><p id="Par97">In order to provide power to the consumer at all times, energy storage is required to average out the volatile nature of renewable energies. To some extent, a large power grid can take over this task without using storage, as it averages out not only spatial but also temporal fluctuations at a given spot. For example, individual PV modules show fast transients if clouds pass by, but these transients are flattened if many spatially distributed PV modules are interconnected in one distribution grid, especially at timescales in a range of minutes. The flattening of the output could also be done using a local storage at each PV module, but a large-area power interconnection is usually much cheaper than any storage.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par98">On the other hand, by far not all of the volatility averages out spatially, even if the grid covers a whole continent. The dominant time scales that remain are the day/night rhythm and the cycle of the year (Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">3.12</xref>). Not only the production, also the consumption has the same two dominant timescales: the day/night rhythm (electric lighting in the morning and evening, rush hour, industrial production at day, air conditioning during midday heat, etc.) and the cycle of the year (heating in winter, air conditioning in summer, reduced industrial consumption at vacation times, etc.).<fig id="Fig12"><label>Fig. 3.12</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The renewable energy production by wind (<italic>green</italic>) and PV (<italic>red</italic>) in January (<italic>left panel</italic>) and July (<italic>right panel</italic>) in Germany 2013 show the typical mix of periodic and random fluctuations.

In the extreme, the short-term storage has to be able to cover timescales somewhere between 15 min and 1–2 days, as it should be able to handle power transients in rush hours but also the storage of surplus energy at weekends. The storage system must have high power input capacity <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>in,max</italic></sub> to cover the solar peak power production in summer at midday and it must have high power output <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>out,max</italic></sub> to cover the peak power consumption in winter in the evening hours.

An exact capacity of the storage system cannot be calculated from first principles. It has to be tuned using system simulations and can be adjusted to an economic optimum that depends on an trade-off between the long-term and the short-term storage system costs and the load management capabilities of the consumers. The turnaround of the short-term storage is on the timescale of several days. The efficiency <italic>η</italic> of the storage has to be as high as possible, as the power loss from storage inefficiencies accumulates day by day. Typical realizations of efficient short-term storage are batteries (including redox-flow batteries and future super-super-capacitors), pump-storage power stations (including intermittently operated hydro power stations), thermal storage in connection with CSP, and others.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par102">The <bold>Long-Term Storage</bold> is optimized to handle power deficits and power excess on the scale of several days, weeks, months, and from one year to the next one. It does not have to handle daily power peaks, as those are covered by the short-term storage. The maximum power output capacity <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>out,max</italic></sub> of the long-term storage is adjusted to the maximum of the power consumption averaged over about 1–2 days. This means that the power output is significantly smaller than the one of the short-term storage as peaks are handled only by the short-term storage and not by the long-term storage. In contrast, the capacity of the long-term storage has to be much larger than the capacity of the short-term storage. It has to cover the maximum expected deficit of renewable power production in the timescale of several months up to a few years. Therefore, the storage medium has to be inexpensive. The cycle time of the long-term storage is about one year or longer. Therefore, the integrated energy loss during the charging (i.e. power-to-gas conversion) occurs only once per year. In other words, the long-term storage has to have a large, inexpensive capacity but it does not have to have high storage efficiency.

Only for times where these measures are not sufficient, a dedicated storage is needed.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par122"><bold>Hydropower by Demand Control</bold></p></list-item></list>An especially elegant way to use hydroelectricity is to operate the station as regulating power device instead of as base load device, i.e. to run the station in an interrupted mode where the output power is adjusted to the power consumption (Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">3.13</xref>). The “storage”-efficiency of this device is about 100%, as the average regulated power is basically equal to the base load that it would provide in continuous operation. The investment costs for a hydropower station that runs on demand are a bit higher than for a station for base load due to stronger or additional turbines that are needed for peak power production. The impact of the interrupted operation has to be made compatible with needs from agriculture, ecology, shipping and other requirements, which may mean to construct a second, downstream dam to average out the downstream water flow.<fig id="Fig13"><label>Fig. 3.13</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>A hydropower storage dam collects water continuously but produces hydropower only at times where there is specific demand, e.g. when wind and solar energy are insufficient.

They consist of an upper and a lower reservoir where power is used to pump up water at times when abundant power is available, and they produce hydropower when there is a power demand. Pump-storage devices have an efficiency of typically 80%. The maximum charging and discharging power depends on the size of the pumps and can be very large. The capacity of the pump-storage plant depends on the height difference of the upper and the lower basin, and on the effective volume of the lake. To have large capacities, pump storage is often built in mountains with large height differences. Alternatively, it requires large area storage lakes or large rivers. One option is to use an ocean as the lower basin at the edge of a steep coast. Other unusual options are to use a large basin that is sub-sea-level as lower basin (as available e.g. in the south of Morocco) or to disconnect a “Fjord” (e.g. in Norway) by a dam from the sea and use seawater that is pumped in or out. These kinds of seawater pump-storage plants could have huge capacity, but their environmental impact may be large.</p><p id="Par126">Plans for the construction of new pump-storage plants often affect recreation areas or nature protection areas. This may be disliked by the population and/or excluded by law. Some experiments have been made to use abandoned mines for underground pump-storage plants. When the mines are deep enough, they can act at the same time as geothermal energy supply. The problem with abandoned mines is that they often are not suitable because they have solvable wall materials or are not tight and too ramified. The more economic approach is to build new, dedicated, deep (e.g. 2000 m) shafts in suited rocks for underground pumped-storage hydropower stations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].</p><p id="Par127">Another option is to go under water instead of under ground: In this approach, large concrete sub-marine bowls are anchored in deep sea (e.g. at −2000 m, see Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">3.14</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Electric pumps evacuate the seawater. The energy stored in the evacuated bowls depends on the volume and the water pressure. At a depth of 2000 m the energy density of such a bowl equals the energy density of a natural gas storage tank at normal pressure and of the same volume. The energy can be recovered by using the pumps as generators during the refill of the bowls.

It can be the base for offshore wind power plants to ease construction and maintenance, including hotels for maintenance workers and a platform for helicopter landing. In addition, it can host HVDC converter stations that connect to undersea cables. The most important feature is that the inner lagoon can be used as energy storage: It can be stabilized by a round inner concrete wall and pumped out. The ring island itself can be formed from the excavated interior. The inner water basin serves as pumped-storage hydropower station to stabilize the power on the HVDC cables or to provide power on demand from the stored wind power. In addition, depending on the phase and amount of the tidal range, tidal power can be harvested by this device. An atoll with a radius and depth of for example 200 m can store an energy of 1.7 GWh. An ideal European site for such an Artificial Energy Atoll is the area close to the Dogger Bank [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] in the centre of the North Sea, where it could be a point of intersection for North-European power exchange between England, Scotland, Norway, Denmark, Germany, and The Netherlands.<fig id="Fig15"><label>Fig. 3.15</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>An Artificial Energy Atoll can be used as base for off-shore wind power plants and as location for HVDC converter stations for undersea cables.

The integrated power of a CSP station is not much different if it runs directly on solar heat or if it runs on stored heat. This means that also in this case the storage efficiency is close to 100%, except for losses from heat exchangers. The actual number depends on the size of the storage, the storage medium, and the mode of operation. If the power of the CSP station is exported (e.g. from Africa to Europe), the interconnecting power line has to be dimensioned to the peak power transmission. As long as the power line is the limiting bottleneck, it does not make sense to run the CSP station on demand control. Instead, the CSP storage will be used to produce a 24 h stable base load on the cable.<fig id="Fig16"><label>Fig. 3.16</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>A solar thermal power plant can deliver electricity on demand 24 h a day.

In this concept, it is assumed that a large number of vehicles is connected to the grid during parking. The charging of the vehicles can be time-shifted (e.g. over night) and even a certain percentage (e.g. the upper 20%) of the battery can always be disposable for the grid operator. In the industrialized countries, basically everybody has his private car. If we project today’s mobility concept to the future, indeed a huge number of vehicles are parking most of the time, and can be connected to the grid and are available for charging and discharging. As an example, we take a BMW i3 vehicle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] with a battery of 33 kWh and a 3 kW grid connection. Germany has currently 45 million passenger cars. If in future this number of cars would have batteries equivalent to the i3 and all cars would be available and connected to the grid, this yields a total power of 135 GW and a total energy of 1.5 TWh. Today’s total power consumption in Germany is about 600 TWh/y, which means that the integrated power in car batteries would be able to back up the total German electricity grid for 1.6 days, and already a small fraction of the car pool would be sufficient to supply electricity demands during peak hours.</p><p id="Par135">If in a sustainable future most of the people will use public transportation or self-driving cars from a car-sharing-pool, the concept will not work, as the number of unused cars that fill up our parking lots will diminish, and cars that are used all day in a sharing mode cannot be used as free storage devices for the grid.</p><p id="Par136">However, it may well be that another concept makes more sense: Batteries in cars are typically exchanged when their capacity drops below 80% because otherwise the range of the vehicle becomes too small. These second-hand batteries are still fine for home storage. They will probably be cheap and can have a second, long life as short-term storage connected to the distribution grid.</p><p id="Par137">Battery research made a lot of progress in the last decades and will provide further economical options in future. As described in chapter 3.4, flow batteries are an interesting option as they may offer cheap solutions for large-scale storage at high efficiencies.

If biogas is anyway used for electricity production, the storage of the biogas has (almost) no additional efficiency loss; therefore, the efficiency η of the storage is approximately 100%.</p><p id="Par140">With power-to-gas we denote the production of hydrogen, methane or other gases from electricity. Hydrogen is produced by electrolysis of water. Carbon in the form of CO<sub>2</sub> or from certain biological material can be used to produce methane or other hydrocarbons, using chemical reformers plus water and electrical energy.

Lithium nitride can be used to form ammonia. Ammonia is a liquid fuel that can be used in fuel cells in vehicles. The lithium can be regenerated using solar energy, for example in solar thermal power plants in the desert.

Energy can be exported in the form of gas or electricity, or even as liquid or solid energy carrier. In the original DESERTEC concept, it was discussed whether solar power should be converted to hydrogen to be transported to Europe or if it should be transported directly as electricity. It turned out that HVDC power lines were the most economic choice, as a gas transport would require the conversion of power to gas and back to power, which includes large conversion losses.</p><p id="Par146">From the point of view of the dual storage concept, the situation is different. Gas is needed for the long-term storage anyway, therefore one can consider filling the gas storage with imported renewable gas using the existing pipeline system from Arabic countries to Europe. Solar energy can be used to produce hydrogen at quite low costs in future. The higher solar radiation in the deserts compensates the efficiency losses of electrolysis. The gas could be synthesized either using the electricity of CSP or PV devices, or directly using thermal energy in catalytic reactions at high temperature in CSP devices. Also, photochemical reactions or biological reactions of solar light are studied to produce gas from water and possibly from CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="Par147">For certain applications, the production of other energy carriers might be useful, e.g. the production of ammonia for the fertilizer industry or the production of burnable metals.</p><p id="Par148">Part of the reason for the failure of the DESERTEC idea in the 2010s was that European’s did not want to create immediate dependencies by power lines from Africa that could be cut at any time and were regarded by some people as a potential instrument for the abuse of power by the desert countries. This (psychological) problem will probably not be present when gas is imported, as gas import from Arabian countries is nothing new for the public and it has no immediate effect on the stability of the electricity supply in Europe.

Prices of renewable power are decreasing, and in preferred regions power prices beat those of conventional power production already today.</p><p id="Par150">There is a large <bold>variety of technologies</bold> available to harvest renewable energies. The most mature ones are hydro power stations, wind power plants and photovoltaics. In desert regions, concentrated solar power with thermal storage is of special importance due to its ability to deliver solar power at night. Offshore wind power is expected to have an increased importance in future due to its large capacity and reduced volatility. Marine hydropower is still in its infancy and has a huge potential. Tidal power is very predictable and reliable and wave power has a certain time-shift with the corresponding wind power, which makes it a complementary source of power especially for the use on islands. Biomass, especially biogas, is of prime importance as storable energy carrier. Geothermal energy has its niche for power production in volcanic regions.</p><p id="Par151">In a renewable energy future, it is of prime importance to <bold>electrify the mobility and heat sectors</bold> to abolish fossil energy carriers and to increase the energy efficiencies. This will multiply the demand of electrical power by a factor of 2–6.</p><p id="Par152">The first choice for heating and air conditioning of buildings are <bold>electric heat pumps</bold> in combination with heat recovery and, most importantly, a good <bold>insulation</bold> of the buildings. The cogeneration of power and heat is useful in (renewable) gas power stations for district heating, however small, combined heat and power generators have low efficiencies in power production and are also less efficient than heat pumps for heat production. Therefore, small combined heat and power generators are only useful for certain niche applications.</p><p id="Par153">As batteries are improving drastically, it can be expected that <bold>electric vehicles</bold> will be a good option for efficient passenger mobility. However, today’s business model where everybody has his/her own car has a lot of disadvantages with respect to the consumption of resources, fatal accidents, traffic jam, parking problems, limited space in cities, noise, roadkill etc. A mixture of efficient public transportation, self-driving cars on demand and car sharing, in combination with (electric) bikes and scooters will allow future communities to be much more resource conserving and more worth living in.</p><p id="Par154">The main challenge of a 100% energy supply with renewables is their volatility. It has been argued many times that “base load” cannot be provided by renewables in an economic way due to the immense costs of energy storage. Here we show that a clever combination of different devices and methods allows for a cost-effective handling of the volatility of power. A main feature of this proposal is the <bold>Dual-Storage System</bold>, where the required storage capacities are split into expensive powerful and efficient Short-Term Storage with limited capacity and into Long-Term Storage with large inexpensive gas storage capacity with limited turn-around efficiency.
