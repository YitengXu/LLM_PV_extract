Each waste was tested individually and as a combined blend to assess feedstock influences on biochar properties. In addition, various pyrolysis temperatures ranging from 300 °C to 600 °C and two particle size fractions (less than 75 µm, 75–125 µm) were considered. Biochars were characterized for various properties that can influence the biochars’ effectiveness as a soil amendment. It was found that pyrolysis temperature was the most dominant factor on biochar properties, but that individual feedstocks produced biochars with different characteristics. The biochars had characteristics that varied as follows: pH 7.2–11.6, ECE 0.15–1.00 mS cm<sup>−1</sup>, CEC 17–cmol<sub>c</sub> kg<sup>−1</sup> and ζ-potential − 0.24 to − 43 mV. Based on optimal values of these parameters from the literature, cauliflower and banana peels were determined to be the best feedstocks, though mixed vegetable waste also produced good characteristics. The optimum temperature for pyrolysis was around 400 °C, but differed slightly (300–500 °C) depending on the distinct feedstock. However, smaller particle size of biochar application was always optimal. Biochar yields were in the range of 20–30% at this temperature range, except for corn cobs which were higher. This study demonstrates that pyrolysis of dried vegetable wastes is a suitable waste valorization approach to produce biochar with good agricultural properties.</p></abstract><kwd-group

Degradation of soil fertility and nutrient depletion are common threats to agroecosystems and a challenge for modern agricultural practices for balancing soil fertility factors. Global food production is further threatened through water security because of increasing population and climate change, requiring improved agricultural water efficiency (Gao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2020</xref>). Biochar, a carbon-rich material produced by pyrolysis of biomass material, is a suitable soil amendment to provide long-lasting carbon enrichment of the soil while enhancing water retention (Safian et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2020</xref>); macro- and micro-nutrient retention and microbial activity of the soil (Pokharel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2020</xref>), which can also aid in nitrogen fixation. Biochar achieves these benefits due to its highly porous structure, wide range of functional groups (Lam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2020</xref>; Foong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2020</xref>), high negative surface charges and large cation exchange capacity (CEC) (Bradford and Hsiao <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1982</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">Biomasses from agricultural wastes are highly suitable for pyrolysis and biochar production due to their high lignocellulosic content. Pyrolysis is an effective process that offers agronomic and environmental benefits by reducing waste biomass volumes by 44–90% (Sait et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2012</xref>; Sakhiya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2020</xref>). The pyrolysis temperature and the specific feedstock employed are the primary factors influencing biochar yields and characteristics. Characteristics of biochar that distinguish its effectiveness as an amendment to improve soil fertility, water retention capacity and crop productivity include pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), organic carbon content (OC) and nutrients adsorption capacity (Jien and Wang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2013</xref>; Junna et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>; Alotaibi and Schoenau <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">Jien and Wang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2013</xref>) reported biochar of pH 9.94 and CEC 22.3 cmol<sub>c</sub> kg<sup>−1</sup> produced from wood at 700 °C increases the pH in Paleudults soil from 3.95 to 4.65, CEC from 7.41 to 9.26 cmol kg<sup>−1</sup> and saturated hydraulic conductivity from 16.7 to 30.0 cm h<sup>−1</sup> after amendment at 2.5%. Palm tree residue biochar produced at a lower temperature of 300 °C with pH of 7.67, ECE of 1.22 mS cm<sup>−1</sup> and CEC of 9.86 × 10<sup>–2</sup> meq showed a 3.5% increase in water holding capacity than biochar produced at 600 °C when added at 50 t ha<sup>−1</sup> to sand (Alotaibi and Schoenau <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2019</xref>). For fruit bunch biochar, optimum water retention in sandy soil was observed for biochar produced at 400 °C. These aspects indicate that biochar properties and performance are highly dependent on feedstock types, pyrolysis temperatures and soil types. In addition to improving water retention capacity, biochar produced at lower temperature is effective to improve soil fertility and plant growth. For instance, biochar produced from three different types of agricultural wastes at 300 °C with pH of 6.93–8.01, ECE of 0.404–3.975 mS cm<sup>−1</sup> and CEC of 18.8–50.5 cmol<sub>c</sub> kg<sup>−1</sup> improved the yield of <italic>Suaeda salsa</italic> from 11.7% to 115% in saline soil (Junna et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">In 2017, it was estimated that 1.3 billion tonnes of food waste is generated per year globally within the food supply chain, in which approximately 0.31 kg of food waste is generated per person daily (FAO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2017</xref>). Around 630 million metric tonnes (MMT) of fruit and vegetables are wasted during agricultural production, transportation and packaging, postharvest handling, distribution/retail activities and by consumers. Of fruit and vegetable waste, 35% are banana peels (220 MMT), 8% are cabbage waste (50 MMT), 2% are cauliflower and brassicas (13 MMT), 15% are potato peels (94 MMT) and 20% are tomatoes (126 MMT) (Gustavsson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2011</xref>; Sagar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2018</xref>). Such fractions can easily be collected from supermarkets and from kitchen preparation side waste of canteens and restaurants (Abdelaal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2019</xref>). It is therefore useful to find potential outlets for these waste fractions. According to the European Union, approximately 143 billion EUR can be recovered by recycling the 88 MMT of food wastes per year generated in the region (Stenmarck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2016</xref>). While composting and anaerobic digestion are obvious choices (Al-Rumaihi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2020</xref>), biogas is not always a competitive energy source and biochar provides a stable, non-odorous soil amendment with lower transportation costs than composting.</p><p id="Par6">Pyrolysis studies have assessed various types of biomass feedstock for biochar such as industrial byproducts, animal wastes, sewage sludge and forest byproducts (Elkhalifa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2019</xref>; Saleem et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2019</xref>; Reza et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2020</xref>). However, pyrolysis of vegetable wastes, particularly the largest fractions mentioned above, has received less attention. Cheng et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2018</xref>) undertook pyrolysis of purple cabbage with ZnCl<sub>2</sub> activation and acid-leaching processes to create a nitrogen-doped carbon-based electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction. The electrocatalyst promoted high oxygen reduction activity due to high contents of pyridinic- and pyrrolic-nitrogen inside the prepared carbon material. However, very few other studies exist. In particular, there is a lack of assessment of pyrolysis conditions on vegetable wastes and how that influences characteristics that may benefit agricultural applications, or how the blend of such wastes, as may be expected in post-consumer collection from plate or food preparation waste impacts characteristics. Such wastes are very different in composition to the non-edible agricultural residues typically used for pyrolysis and therefore are expected to produce different characteristics to many other biochars. This may be in part due to the high moisture content that makes direct pyrolysis uneconomical. However, in arid areas, solar drying can be easily implemented. In such cases, appropriate size reduction prior to drying can be highly effective to enhance surface area. However, excessive size reduction can be highly energy intensive, particularly with wet biomass. Therefore, providing one suitable size reduction step that supports both solar drying and pyrolysis is of benefit.</p><p id="Par7">Thus, a set of objectives was defined to check the possibility of biochar production from common vegetable and consumer fruit wastes: raw banana peels, cabbage wastes and cauliflower wastes. In addition to this, we also selected to investigate corncobs, since they are significantly different in composition and also can be commonly collected from plate waste. Conversion of these four vegetables wastes and their mixture to biochar under various temperatures was undertaken to understand how food waste composition and pyrolysis temperature influence biochar properties. In addition, as feedstock particle size could influence feedstock drying and pyrolysis, two particle sizes were also assessed. This study focuses on a detailed analysis of the biochar properties of relevance to soil including particle size, CEC, surface structure, adsorption of nutrients and fraction of organics which will effect microbial activity, water retention and plant growth.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Feedstock preparation</title><p id="Par8">To prepare biochar, cauliflower and cabbage wastes were collected from a waste bin in the preparation section of a university canteen in Qatar. A detailed process of biochar production is demonstrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Corn and raw banana were collected from a local supermarket. After collection, the leaves and cobs of corn, and banana peels were separated from the edible portion to use as a feedstock. After collection, the wastes were washed thoroughly with tap water several times to remove impurities. Vegetable wastes were then segregated into different batches and cut into small pieces (&lt; 3 cm). The weight of all batches was measured before and after drying at 75 °C in a Fisher Scientific Isotemp mechanical convection laboratory oven until completely dry (Mazac <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2016</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>A detailed process of biochar production from vegetable wastes</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/42773_2020_69_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Biochar production</title><p id="Par9">Five feedstocks were prepared for pyrolysis under different conditions. These were each of the four individual dried food wastes and an equal-weighted mixture of the four wastes. Pyrolysis was conducted in the absence of oxygen using a muffle furnace (Lindberg Blue M-3504, Thermo Scientific) in batch mode at the following temperatures to assess their influence on biochar yield and properties: 300, 400, 500 and 600 °C (Xue et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2019</xref>). Fifty grams of each dried feedstock was pyrolyzed at the four different temperature conditions to produce biochar. Samples were put in a furnace and raised to the defined temperature at a ramp rate of 5 °C min<sup>−1</sup> and held at the desired temperature for 15 min.

In general, lower hydrogen and oxygen contents were associated with greater hydrophobicity of the biochar by Hardy et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2017</xref>). O/C ratio indicates the polarity and abundance of polar oxygen-containing surface functional groups in biochar and H/C ratio indicates the aromatic content and stability of the biochar.

The C concentration and the H/C and O/C ratios control the formation of surface functional groups and have a large influence on nutrients adsorption.

All biochar samples showed a similar thermal degradation profile with the weight loss proportionally increasing with pyrolysis temperature, which according to Jindo et al.

In general, a consistent ECE response with temperature between the two particle sizes was observed. Yuan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2011</xref>) reported ECE values of biochar produced from sludge increases with increased pH and pyrolysis temperature due to the decrease in soluble ions and increased mineral formation. However, Wang et al.

Patriquin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1993</xref>) reported soil microbial activity, water holding capacity and solubility of nutrients in soil decline with increasing ECE. Therefore, the most desirable ECE is achieved at 400 °C for most feedstocks in this study.</p><p id="Par34">Cation exchange capacity (CEC) is an important factor to measure soil's ability to hold and exchange nutrients such as nitrogen, calcium and potassium (Weil and Brady <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2017</xref>), while its ability to bind with phosphorus, an important anionic nutrient, is also crucial. Soil with a lower cation exchange capacity is not able to retain nutrients and the nutrients are easily leached under wetting events. Therefore, application of biochar with high CEC in soil will help to improve the nutrient assimilation efficiency by the crop during the growing season and also improve the ability of the soil to adsorb and retain nutrients from other sources at non-growing times (Kizito et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2019</xref>). Different behavior of CEC was observed for biochar produced from different feedstocks, particle size and temperature as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c.

The CEC was less for 125 µm particle size than 75 μm, although relative patterns between temperature and feedstock were similar and the differences small (<italic>ω</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.025). The CEC for the biochars of cauliflower, banana peel and the mixed feedstocks was the greatest at 400 °C (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c), while cabbage waste showed its maximum CEC at 300 °C and corn cob at 500 °C. Only cabbage waste showed a consistent trend with temperature, decreasing almost linearly as the temperature increased. All others showed their minimum at either 300 or 600 °C, with both temperatures typically producing a low CEC. Mukherjee et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2011</xref>) and Lehman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2011</xref>) both reported the CEC of biochars from different feedstocks increase from 250 °C to 400 °C and then decrease with increasing pyrolysis temperatures and found a minimum at 600 °C. Such behavior is expected with increasing pyrolysis temperature due to the oxidation of the carbon compounds and loss of carboxyl groups in biochar (Luo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2018</xref>). There is a confirmation by Lehman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2011</xref>) who reported that much of the CEC of biochars pyrolyzed at low temperatures may arise due to the presence of non-carbonized organic matter. However, Mulabagal et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2015</xref>) observed in their study an increase in CEC of biochar with increasing temperature for various feedstocks up to the maximum tested temperature of 600 °C. Therefore, the observations of this study seem to fit well with the general literature.</p><p id="Par35">The highest CEC was from banana peels (58.2 cmol<sub>c</sub> kg<sup>−1</sup>), although both corn cob (58.2 cmol<sub>c</sub> kg<sup>−1</sup>) and mixed feedstock (53.2 cmol<sub>c</sub> kg<sup>−1</sup>) were statistically similar, all at 75 μm particle size. At 125 μm size, corn cob gave the highest CEC value. Although cabbage biochar shows the minimum CEC, its value is still greater than 20 cmol<sub>c</sub> kg<sup>−1</sup>, meaning it can be effective to hold nutrients and support plant growth (Mukherjee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2011</xref>). Very similar behavior to CEC was observed for ζ-potential, with a high degree of correlation between the two (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.72 for 75 μm biochar and R<sup>2</sup> = 0.69 for 125 μm biochar) as shown in Fig. S1. This is expected as a higher negative surface charge provides a stronger attraction to cations. The particle size also played an important role in the ζ-potential with the smaller 75 μm biochar particles showing a relatively more negative surface charge (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Therefore, grinding of the biochar can be used to develop target surface charge properties that will influence CEC.</p><p id="Par36">Phosphorous (P) is a finite resource with concerns over its future supply and availability.

Maximum phosphorus adsorption was generally a result of pyrolysis at 400–500 °C, except, like CEC, for cabbage which showed maximum phosphorus adsorption when produced at 300 °C (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d). The degree of dependence on temperature, however, was not as noticeable for phosphorus adsorption as it was for CEC. Overall, a positive correlation was observed between CEC and phosphorus adsorption by the biochar produced from different feedstocks, as shown in Fig. S2, with a pooled feedstock R<sup>2</sup> of 0.74 for 75 μm biochar and 0.67 for 125 μm biochar.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>FT-IR analysis</title><p id="Par37">Biochar derived from different feedstocks shows the presence of aromatic, aliphatic and alcohol compounds with different behaviors of peak intensity at 400 and 600 °C compared with biomass (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The bands at about 2700 and 3400 cm<sup>−1</sup> correspond to aliphatic C–H, O–H and N–H stretching vibration, illustrated in Table S1. These are found maximum in biomass and least in biochar produced at 600 °C (Hossain et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2011</xref>). The maximum peak at 3400 cm<sup>−1</sup> in the biomass decreased with increasing temperature and less stretching was observed in the biochar produced at 600 °C. This bond represents the stretching vibration of hydroxyl groups and indicates that organic O–H groups are very unstable at increasing temperatures (Hossain et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2011</xref>; Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2012</xref>). It is also attributed to acceleration in dehydration reactions of the biomass (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2012</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The FT-IR spectrum of different feedstocks and biochars produced at 400 °C and 600 °C. <italic>FS</italic> feedstocks, <italic>CLF</italic> cauliflower wastes, <italic>CAB</italic> cabbage wastes, <italic>BAN</italic> banana peels, <italic>COR</italic> corn wastes, <italic>MIX</italic> mixture of cauliflower, cabbage, banana and corn wastes</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/42773_2020_69_Fig6_HTML.png" id="MO6"/></fig></p><p id="Par38">The visible bands at 1250–1420 cm<sup>−1</sup> in biomass were assigned to C–O stretching of aromatic ester (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2012</xref>) and these bonds were removed by increasing temperatures. This was supported by removal of the peak at 2924–2956 cm<sup>−1</sup> in biomass with increasing pyrolysis temperature which is attributed to the presence of alkene (C–H) groups in carbohydrates (Chun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2004</xref>). Aliphatic stretching vibration reduced as the temperature increased to 600 °C, possibly due to the breaking of the weak bonds between the C and the H of the alkyl groups (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2012</xref>).</p><p id="Par39">Similarly, the bands in the region of 1250–1800 cm<sup>−1</sup> (alkanes and aromatics) also decrease with increase in the pyrolysis temperature, most notably in the area relating to polyphenols. The large peak at 1461–1640 cm<sup>−1</sup> is related to O–H together with C=C and C=O in the aromatic ring that indicated the presence of polyphenols, and also slightly decreased with increasing temperature (Lin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2007</xref>). These peaks are due to the presence of primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols, phenols, ethers and esters showing the C–O stretching and O–H deformation vibrations (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2012</xref>). The decrease in the intensities of these bands showed that the surface concentration of the acidic functional groups has sufficiently decreased. However, there is an alteration in aromatic structure of biochar samples in comparison with biomass samples.</p><p id="Par40">The stable peak at 1583 cm<sup>−1</sup> in biochar represents the C=C ring stretching vibration of lignin (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2012</xref>) and is more prevalent in biomass. The peaks between 500 and 900 cm<sup>−1</sup> shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, corresponding to an aromatic C–H stretching vibration, indicates the presence of adjacent aromatic hydrogen in the biochar at 600 °C sample that is not seen in biomass sample. High peak intensity of the wagging vibrations of C–H bonds of biochar at 400 and 600 °C indicated the stability of the aromatic and heteroaromatic compounds and possible cyclization. These results are in agreement with the observed changes in elemental atomic ratios which suggest an increase in the carbonization as a result of cracking and the rebuilding of aromatic rings.</p><p id="Par41">FT-IR analysis indicates the maximum CEC of biochar at low temperature is due to the presence of various charged groups. Oxygen (O) containing alcohol, carbonyl and carboxylate functional groups are generally believed to contribute to biochar cation exchange capacity (CEC) because they may carry a negative charge and serve as sorption sites for cations. Thus, the distribution of O and N containing functional groups greatly influences the relative hydrophilic/hydrophobic nature of biochar surfaces.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>XPS analysis</title><p id="Par42">The chemical composition of feedstocks and biochar at 400 and 600 °C was evaluated by XPS shown in Fig. S3. The results of deconvolution of the C1s spectrum illustrate five bands at 284.76, 286.35, 287.75, 285.85 and 288.8 eV which can be assigned to sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized carbon (C–C), hydroxyl (C–OH) and carbonyl (C–O), amines (C–N) and carboxyl (O=C–OH), respectively (Naderi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2016</xref>). The O1s band of both feedstocks and biochar was deconvoluted into three primary peaks (Fig. S4), acidic amides (O=C–N) at 531.18 eV; carbonyl oxygen (O=C–O) at 532.66 eV and O–C–O at 533.26 eV. Furthermore, the N1s spectrum of biochar is deconvoluted into two Lorentzian peaks, with the binding energy of 400.00 and 399.61 eV which can be attributed to pyrrolic N and pyridinic N, respectively. The XPS data agree with the findings in FT-IR that indicates a loss of functional groups and predominance of C–C bonding based on the C1s spectra, particularly a loss of alcohol and carboxylic acid groups. This is also evidenced in the O1s spectra where this type of group diminishes, with an increased predominance of O=C–N, although the makeup of these functional groups differs significantly between the different biomasses at 400 and 600 °C. Similarly, in most samples, an increase in pyridinic N was observed, although pyrrolic N remained the dominant form.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>SEM analysis of morphology</title><p id="Par43">Figure <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> shows the surface structures of biochars from different feedstocks at two temperature conditions of 400 °C and 600 °C. Corn waste biochar at 400 °C and mixed feedstock biochar contain some holes which may be attributed to insufficient carbonization. Many small pores are seen in the biochar due to devolatilization at 600 °C (Luo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2018</xref>). The cracks and pores in the biochars occur due to the release of volatiles and intermediate-size organics (Luo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2018</xref>).

This is important as combined vegetative waste collection and pyrolysis are significantly more simple and economic to implement. The key characteristics that influence agricultural performance of a biochar are pH and CEC. Considering these factors, the biochar produced from cauliflower, banana and mixed vegetable waste at temperature of 400 °C are found to have the most optimum pH (7.62 ± 0.03) and CEC (37–60 cmol<sub>c</sub> kg<sup>−1</sup>) to enhance plant growth and water retention capacity (Laghari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par45">In the literature, studies on biochars produced from waste vegetables are rare. The study by Lee et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2017</xref>) is the most similar study, where mixed food waste was converted to biochar, including meats, grains, fruits and egg shells in addition to vegetables (51% by mass). The overall composition of the biochar was relatively similar, with an optimum produced at 400 °C, with CEC of 63 cmol<sub>c</sub> kg<sup>−1</sup>. One of the more similar individual materials investigated is orange peel biochar. Sial et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2019</xref>) produced such material at 350 °C. The biochar had less favorable properties than vegetable waste biochar. Although the ECE was similar at 0.29 mS cm<sup>−1</sup>, it had much higher pH of 10.0. The values for individual and mixed vegetable waste biochars are also comparable and competitive with biochars produced from more lignocellulose rich materials (Palansooriya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2019</xref>). ECE is generally higher in vegetable waste, which is less desirable, but other properties such as cation exchange capacity and pH are typically improved with regard to target values for optimum soil improvement.</p><p id="Par46">However, there is a need for further demonstration of food waste-derived biochars in soil test experiments with different soils and plants. Mazac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2016</xref>) prepared five different batches of mixed food wastes including vegetables, fruits, leaves and egg shells to produce biochar at a slow pyrolysis temperature condition of 260 °C for 3 and 6 h and tested them with tomato plants (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>) over 30 days. Similarly, Islam et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2019</xref>) tested banana peel biochar produced at 400 °C for 2 h duration and tested it at 1, 2 and 4% loading with <italic>Ipomoea aquatica</italic>. Although both experiments observed improved yield with biochar, neither test showed statistically significant differences.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par47">The results of this study demonstrate that pyrolysis of various vegetable wastes at temperatures of 300–500 °C produces biochars with desirable characteristics for agricultural application. Vegetable waste biochar is therefore a suitable approach to reduce food waste environmental burdens and obtain the economic benefits of food waste valorization. This study demonstrated temperature is a dominant factor with low temperatures, suitable for slow pyrolysis, favoring optimum biochar characteristics. Particle size had a minor influence on biochar characteristics, mainly allowing changes to CEC and ζ-potential. This is important as it means size reduction of raw waste can be optimized for energy consumption and handling prior to pyrolysis. The type of vegetable waste played an important role in biochar properties and it was found that mixed vegetable waste performed as well as the individual vegetable wastes. This confirmation is advantageous, supporting the combined collection and direct conversion of mixed vegetable food waste to biochar. While Keske et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2019</xref>) have shown biochar application to land for agriculture can have significant economic benefits, both soil testing to confirm the performance of vegetable waste biochar and subsequent economic analysis are necessary in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Qatar National Research Fund for supporting this research under the National Priorities Research Program Grant Number NPRP11S-0117-180328.
