Vladeta STEVOVIC1- Rade STANISAVLJEVIC 2 - Dragan DJUKIC3- Dragan DJUROVIC1 1 University of Kragujevac, Faculty of Agronomy, 34 Cara Dusana, Cacak, e-mail: vladeta@tfc.kg.ac.yu 2 Forage Crop Research Institute, Trg Kosturnice 50, Krusevac 3 University of Novi Sad, Faculty of Agriculture, Trg Dositeja Obradovica 8, Novi Sad Abstract: The paper presents the plant density effect on the forage yield and quality and seed yield of red clover cultivars over 2002-2004. Four red clover cultivars (K-17, Kolubara, K-32, Viola) grown at inter-row spacings of 20 cm (18kg ha -1 seed), 50cm (9 kg ha -1 ) and 80cm (4.5 kgha -1 ) were examined. The forage yield and quality were analysed in the second year (the first and the third growths) and in the third year (the first growth). The seed yield determination was made in the first year from the first growth and in the second and third years from the second growth. The red clover cultivars exhibited significant differences in biomass yield. The highest yield was produced with the K-32 and K-17 cultivars in the second and third years, respectively, as a result of their higher yield potential and soil acidity tolerance. The significantly highest forage yield was achieved at the first plant density. The red clover cultivars exhibited significant differences in seed yield, with the highest yield having been produced with the K-17 cultivar. Significantly higher seed yields in the second and third years were attained at inter-row spacings of 20 and 50 cm. Keywords: red clover, cultivar, density, forage, yield, quality, seed yield. Introduction Owing to its biological traits, the red clover is capable of attaining high dry matter yields even on less productive acid soils (Cupic et al., 2007). As these soils cover over 60% of arable land in the Republic of Serbia, the said crop is a major perennial legume being used. This plant is generally cultivated for combined production (forage/seed), with the second growth in the second year of planting and sometimes the second growth in the third year of cultivation being used for seed production. As shown by the research results by Miladinovic (1978) and Vuckovic et al. (1997), the sowing method and crop density have a significant effect on the seed yield and quality of red clover. Additionally, according to the results obtained by Steiner et al. (1995), red clover seed yield is significantly affected by the first cutting date, the genetic basis of the cultivar, environmental conditions of the area, the presence of pollinating insects, and other factors as well as by the genotype x environment interaction. The objective of these studies was to examine the effect of plant density on the fodder and seed yield and quality of red clover, indirectly affecting the cultivation of the plant particularly in less favourable agroenvironmental conditions. Materials and methods The trial was set up at the Centre for Agricultural and Engineering Researches in Zajecar in 2002. N15P15K15 300 kg ha -1 was used for basic tillage and pre-sowing preparation as well as at the end of the first and second growing seasons. The trial was set up following a two-factoral randomised block design in four replications. An examination was made of four cultivars (the K-17 and K-32 of Krusevac, the Novi Sad Kolubara and the Polish Viola) at three inter-row spacings with different seed rates used (20 cm with 18 kg ha-1, 50 cm with 9 kg ha-1 and 80 cm with 4.5 kg ha-1 seed). The forage yield was established using the first and third growths in the second year and first</p><p id="Pg2">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1396 one in the third year. The dry matter (DM) yield was determined by cutting at the onset of blooming and following the sample drying. The chemical analysis results were used to determine the DM quality (crude protein – CP, crude fibre – CF, crude fats – CFs and crude ash – CA contents) and calculate the nitrogen-free extracts (NFE) percentage. The seed yield was determined using the first growth in the first year (the year of sowing) and the second one in the second and third years. The harvesting was conducted at the full pod maturity stage or when 80-90% of the pods had turned dark brown. The fodder and seed yield results obtained were processed by the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the significance of differences between the treatments was determined using the ttest. Soil and weather characheristics – The smonitza soil the trial was set up on was found to have the following chemical properties (pH nKCl-5.70; CaCO3- 0.70%; humus- 2.40%; N- 0.63%; P2O5 -9.80 mg 100 g -1 soil and K2O- 12.80 mg 100 g -1 soil). Compared to the multiannual average (April-September, 1967-2001), mean monthly air temperature was 0.90C and 1.80C higher in 2002 and 2003, respectively, and 0.30C lower in 2004. Furthermore, as compared to the multiannual precipitation average, the precipitations increased by 119.3 l m-2 in 2002 and decreased by 10.8 l m-2 and 25.6 l m2 in 2003 and 2004, respectively. Results and discussion Significant dry matter yield differences between the cultivars were determined in the second and third years of crop utilisation (Tab. 1). The highest dry matter yield in the second and third years was recorded with Krusevac K-32 and K-17, respectively, being a result of their drought tolerance, higher yield potential and low pH tolerance. Balogh et al. (2007) suggested that genetically determined yield could be modified by growing conditions. Analysing 11 red clover breeding populations, Primorac et al. (2007) made a record of populations with significantly higher forage yields obtained in drought conditions. Lower yields in the cultivar Viola, apart from its lower yield potential, also resulted from its adverse reaction to soil acidity (pH 5.70). The highest yield was achieved in the first cutting (Tab. 1), which is in accordance with the results of Haling et al. (2004) who stressed that the yield of the first cutting with respect to the total yield was mostly a cultivar trait. Significantly higher DM yields were attained with the smallest inter-row spacing used (Tab. 1). As underlined by Lugic et al. (1996), the interrow spacing of 12.5 cm in the K-17 red clover cultivar resulted in a significantly higher dry matter yield compared to the thinner spacing (25 cm). Eric et al. (2004), however, reported no significant differences in the average dry matter yield achieved at an interrow spacing of 15 cm and the one at 25 cm in the three-year period in the combined forage-seed production. The highest DM quality of the red clover cultivars examined was achieved at the lowest inter-row spacing used (Tab. 2). As opposed to the domestic cultivars, Viola was determined to have had the lowest CP, CFs, CA and higher CF contents. The inter-row spacing increase resulted in a DM quality change involving crude protein content decrease and crude fibre and NFE increases. Vasiljevic et al. (2005) pointed out significant differences in the first- and secondgrowth dry matter chemical composition of eight red clover cultivars. Apart from the weather conditions at the time of flowering and seed formation, pollinating insect activities and genotype x environment interaction, the red clover seed yield was also</p><p id="Pg3">VII.

There were significant differences in seed yield between the cultivars examined (Tab. 1). Table 1.

K-17 and the lowest one with the cv. Viola, being also induced by their different reactions to the relatively low pH of soil. Seed yield was significantly affected by the higher inter-row spacing in the first year, the highest yield having been achieved at a 80 cm spacing. Conversely, significantly lower seed yields were attained in the second and third years with these inter-row spacings used. The results of Lugic et al. (1996) showed that high red clover seed production could be achieved at inter-row spacings of 12.5 cm and 25 cm. Dόka and Pepó (2007)</p><p id="Pg4">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1398 reported a positive correlation between grain yield and crop density. However, the correlation can also be negative (Szabó and Pepó, 2007) under high stress conditions (drought, high t0). As emphasised by Eric et al. (2004), the inter-row spacing in red clover cultivation for combined production (forage/seed) should not exceed 25 cm since the cost-effectiveness of seed production was attained through increased forage production. Focusing on the optimisation of red clover cultivation for combined production, Bender (2005) pointed out that biologically younger crops could produce high quality seed yields. Conclusions A significanty higher dry matter yield was achieved in the second year with the K-32 and in the third year with the K-17 cultivars exhibiting both higher yield potential and higher stress (drought, low pH) tolerance. The inter-row spacing increase induced a dry matter quality increase, i. e. crude protein decrease and crude fibre increase. The highest yield was achieved with K-17, and the lowest one with Viola, suggesting Viola’s stronger reaction to soil acidity. As opposed to the first year when sparser spacings produced higher yields, significantly higher yields in the second and third years were attained at inter-row spacings of 20 cm and 50 cm. Cost-effectiveness in the combined production (forage/seed) can be secured by establishing crops at 20 cm inter-row spacings using somewhat lower seed rates.

E-mail: cpregun@gisserver1.date.hu Abstract: The authors developed the virtual hydrologic – hydraulic model of the River Berettyó and its environment, based on its conceptual model. They analyzed the relationship between the significant hydroecological and water-quality factors, and investigated the hydrological and morphological characters and conditions of the flow in the examined cross-sections, according to the recommendations of the Water Framework Directive of the EU. Keywords: environmental quality index, hydrologic modelling, hydraulic factors, multivariate analysis Introduction The climate change and water resources conservation require the rehabilitation, and natural, effective management of surface waters and wetlands (Ligetvári et al., 2006, Várallyay, 2007). Improvment and reconstruction of hydrologic conditions have projecting importance in the revitalisation of regulated surface streams, including the undrained runoff areas and drainage canal networks. For the reliable environmental estimation the environmental indicators have to have the following conditions: some natural, temporal and spatial variabilty, susceptibility to changes of environmental circumstances, clarity of interpretation, cost efficiency and simple applicability, effective ecological information content, reference-data about the characters of the environmental status, the factors represented by indicators must be comparable, lack of destructive elements, the partial results can be summarized and easily interpretated. (Kent et al., 1992; Cairns et al., 1993; Breckenridge et al., 1995; Turner et al., 1995). The surface streams are dynamically structured hydromorphologic systems. Flood bed is a mosaic system of naturally and/or artificially formed and bordered cells. The structural indicators (mosaicity, horizontal and vertical zonality, and its spatial and temporal changes) can be modelled and researched correctly by GIS and remote sensing methods, and databases are becoming accessible (Pregun et al. 2006). Materials and methods The researches are in progress on the River Berettyó, on the Bihar Plain, the North Plain Region of Hungary. The river is part of Duna-Tisza River System (Figure 1.). The river is a regulated inter-basin transfer and receiver of a drainage canal network.. The hydraulic time series were generated by the application of HEC-RAS. The HEC-RAS is an interactive, integrated software system that works in a multi-module environment. The software is a one-dimensional hydraulic analysis programme, which can produce pseudo-3-dimensional model of streams by arranging of digitalized cross-sections (Warner et al. 2002). The boundary conditions of the search terms were determined by the records of water gauges of the section defence office of Szeghalom, Berettyóújfalu and Pocsaj settlements. A.

Water quality classification was done according to the Hungarian standard (MSZ 12 749). The list of environmental indicators was supplemented with hydraulic factors that have significant effect on the formation and changes of the river ecosystem. The measured and calculated results of MMCP (Hungarian Makrozoobenthos Score System, macroinvertebratas quality test method) were included in the list (Németh, 1998, Pregun and Tamás, 2004, 2005).

The dynamical hydraulic factors at No. 145 (U-trapeze shaped), No. 136 (V-shaped) and No. 68 (U-shaped) cross-sections (=XS=RS) changed from first principal component to the second component in the high water periods. The dynamical hydraulic factors changed from first principal component to the second component in the low water periods in the trapeze-shaped cross-sections No. 14 and 86. In this case the derivative geometrical data (hydraulic radius and depth, distribution), and the top width and the perimeter moves to the second component with a negative sign. This indicates the inverse proportion between the average depth and the energy losses in low runoff. In the case of high-water stage the average depth does not influence the energy status. The stream was subcritical in the examined cross-sections, except for XS 68. The stream states were laminar or weekly turbulent in all the examined sections. From the point of view of the average velocity extreme hydraulic circumstances were formed at XS 68. This section of River Berettyó behaves like a mountain stream and makes an ecological barrier not just for the rheoxen species – typical in still waters and slow watercourses – but also for the rheofil species that can be found in middle river sections. The average slope of water surface is 0.0002 m/m on the Hungarian reach of River Berettyó, but between XS 67 and 68 (this section is 530m long) the slope is 33 times higher in low water period and 9 times in high water period. The stream is permanently supercritical or critical; the average velocity is independent of the bedgeometric data. XS 68 has special hydraulic sessions because of the hydraulic radius and because the depth is relatively small, so the top width and the wetted perimeter are large. This is the reason of the laminar and light turbulent characteristic of the watercourse in spite of the supercritical character (Figure 2.). Figure 2. The longitudinal profile of the Hungarian section of the Berettyó River B. The results of collective analysis: Summarizing the principal component analysis of examined water quality and hydraulic factors, it was established that the hydraulic parameters (runoff, energetic and geometric attributes) influence the water quality by effecting the physical and chemical parameters of the water. They affect the dilution process at high water situations and the temperature at low water cases. The obverse connection between the temperature and</p><p id="Pg8">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1402 the pH shows the dependence of biological degradation processes on temperature. The increase of the degradation is connected to acidification.The trophity (chlorophyllcontent) is connected to the conductivity in summer time (low water conditions) and to the Total Organic Carbon (TOC) in winter time (high water floods). This may refers to the pollution sources at the flood plain of the upper sector. C. Environmental indicator test: The water-quality of the stream fluctuates between poor and good status; the most hazardous factors are the high organic matter content (TOC and BOD5), the low oxygen content and the salt content (electric conductivity). The macroinvertebrata bioindicators show better environmental conditions than physical–chemical properties, because the river connects to the network of semi-natural channels, which function as a system of ecologic corridors. Conclusions The bed-geometrical and flow coefficients were in correlation in the case of the given run-off, but this relationship is weakened or breaks off under extreme low-water and high-water conditions. Both hydroecological and water-quality status give reason for the application of environmental stream regulation methods, or the bed regulation in the last resort. The common, multivariate analysis of the hydrologic, physical, chemical and biological factors provides site specific data to design water quality protection and stream rehabilitation.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1403 EFFECTS OF SOIL TILLAGE AND HERBICIDES ON WEEDS AND WINTER WHEAT YIELDS Mira KNEŽEVIĆ 1 – Ljubica RANOGAJEC 1 – Davor ŠAMOTA 1 1 Faculty of Agriculture, Josip Juraj Strossmayer University in Osijek Trg sv. Trojstva 3, 31000 Osijek, Croatia Corresponding author: Mira.Knezevic@pfos.hr Abstract: The effects of three tillage systems and the post-emergence chemical weed control of annual broadleaved weeds in winter wheat were studied on lessive pseudogley soil in north-eastern Croatia from 2001 to 2006. Total weed biomass on untreated plots was the lowest in continuous mouldboard ploughing (49.8 g m 2 ), medium in chisel ploughing (90.9 g m -2 ) and highest in continuous disk harrowing (187.3 g m -2 ) with statistically significant differences (P &lt; 0.01). The most abundant weeds were annual broad-leaved species of Matricaria inodora, Ambrosia artemisiifolia, Galium aparine, and Stellaria media, which constituted 57, 56 and 41% of total weed biomass in mouldboard-, chisel ploughing and disk harrowing, respectively. Three herbicide mixtures of 5% iodosulfuron - methyl sodium + 15% mefenpyr-diethyl; 12% fluoroglycofene-ethyl + 6% triasulfuron and 54% 2,4-D ethylhexyl ester + 0.5% metosulam in low doses provided a successful biomass control of dominant annual broad-leaved weeds (89-100% control). Herbicide treatments gave significantly higher yields than untreated controls with an average yield increase of 3, 11 and 7% in mouldboard-, chisel ploughing and disk harrowing, respectively. The yields did not differ among herbicide mixtures. Compared to the highest yield with mouldboard ploughing (6.1 t ha -1 ), average yield depressions with chisel ploughing and disk harrowing were 3 and 5%, respectively. Keywords: winter wheat, soil tillage, herbicides, weed density, weed biomass, crop yields Introduction A recent method of plant protection from weeds based upon integrated weed management includes a combination of all cultural, mechanical, chemical and other measures for an effective and economical weed control (Swanton and Weise, 1991). Crop production, its advantages and risks according to integrated plant management has not yet been sufficiently researched in Croatia, especially for main arable crops. Previous researches suggested a possibility of high herbicide doses substitution with reduced doses in winter wheat, spring barley and maize (Knežević et al., 2003a, 2003b, 1999). Yet, as such researches are long-term, they preclude final conclusions and need to be continued. Results of reduced tillage practices for cereal crops under different conditions in Croatia (Jug et al., 2006; Kisić et al., 2006; Žugec et al., 2000; Košutić et al.,1998) demonstrated advantage of less intensive tillage systems compared to conventional deep tillage systems. This paper reports the effects of three tillage systems and application of environmentally safe herbicides in post-emergence weed control in winter wheat and crop yields. Materials and methods Field experiments with winter wheat (cv. Demetra ) in crop rotation with soybean were conducted at Čačinci locality in the north-eastern Croatia from 2001 to 2006. Soil type was lessive pseudogley: 13-18% of clay, 1.03% of organic matter, pH in H2O - 5.1, pH in nKCl - 4.1, 9.7 mg P2O5 and 18.7 mg K2O 100g -1 (AL-method). The fertilisation was based on 231 kg N, 150 kg P2O5 and 100 kg K2O per ha. Winter wheat was sown in the third decade of October. The annual mean air temperature (October, July) was 9.9 oC and the annual mean precipitation was 666 mm. The experimental design was a split-plot with tillage</p><p id="Pg10">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1404 as the main factor (T) and weed control as the sub-factor (W). Weed control plots (3.5 x 9 m) were replicated four times within each tillage plot. Tillage had been performed continuously from 1996 in three treatments: 1. CT - conventional (ploughing with mouldboard plough at 30 - 35 cm depth with standard sowing), 2. CP- loosening with a chisel plough at 15 - 20 cm depth and 3. DH-disk harrowing at 8 - 10 cm depth. Weed control included four treatments: W0 - untreated control; W1 - 5% iodosulfuron - methyl sodium + 15% mefenpyr-diethyl at 0.02 kg ha-1 of commercial mixture "Hussar" (Bayer Crop Science); W2 - 12% fluoroglycofene-ethyl + 6% triasulfuron at 0.02 kg ha-1 of commercial mixture Satis 18 WP (Syngenta) and W3 - 54% 2,4-D ethylhexyl ester + 0.5% metosulam at 1.25 L ha-1 of commercial mixture Sansac (Bayer Crop Science). Each year in all tillage treatments the same post-emergence herbicide mixtures were applied at the tillering stage of winter wheat corresponding to Zadoks´ scale 25-31. Herbicides were applied by knapsack-sprayer “Solo" (Lurmark AN 1.0 nozzle type) in 300 L ha-1 of water volume at a pressure of 300 kPa. Weed infestation was evaluated twice a year. The first evaluation was two weeks after herbicide application, and the second one was after wheat heading. This paper presents the weed data based on a second assessment. Weed density and fresh weed biomass were estimated in each sub-plot in four quadrants, each measuring 50 cm x 50 cm (16 replications totally). Weeds found in each quadrant were cut at ground level, separated by species, counted and weighed. The efficacy of herbicide was measured as a relative reduction in weed biomass for each weed species compared to untreated plots within each tillage treatment. Before the statistical analyses a square root transformation for weed density and weed biomass of annual grasses, annual broad-leaved weeds and perennial weeds had been performed. Winter wheat was harvested each year in the middle of July. The crop yields were adjusted to 14% of the moisture content. The SAS V8.1 statistical package´s Proc Mixed was used for calculating ANOVA and means were compared at P &lt; 0.01 significant level. Results and discussion Thirty-eight weed species were recorded in winter wheat, 19 of which were species in conventional tillage with mouldboard-, (CT) and chisel ploughing (CP) and 24 species in disk harrowing (DH). Annual broad-leaved species were the dominated weeds with 22 species, compared to 14 perennials and 2 annual grass species. Neglecting the effects of tillage on untreated plots, nine species reached more than one plant per m2. They were: annual grass of Apera spica-venti (L.) PB., annual broad-leaved species of Matricaria inodora L., Galium aparine L., Stellaria media (L.) Vill., Ambrosia artemisiifolia L., and perennials of Convolvulus arvensis L., Equisetum arvense L., Calystegia sepium (L.) R. Br., Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop. In the time after wheat heading, when the weeds become strong competitors with wheat (Klem and Vánová, 1999), the fore mentioned species constituted 73% and 95% of total density and total weed biomass, across all tillage treatments, respectively. M. inodora thrived in wet seasons of 2002, 2004 with high precipitation in April and May (&gt; 100 mm). In extremely dry 2003 when the precipitation in April and May was only 9 mm and 14 mm, respectively, it showed a biomass depression of 62%, compared to an average of 61.9 g m-2 in wet spring months. With respect to tillage effects, a total weed biomass on untreated plots was the lowest in CT tillage (49.8 g m-2), medium in CP (90.9 g m-2) and</p><p id="Pg11">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1405 the highest in DH tillage (187.3 g m-2). Thereby the proportion in biomass of annual broad-leaved weed groups was 57, 56 and 41%, respectively (Table 1). Biomass of annual grasses with A. spica-venti populations did not vary significantly between tillage treatments. Table 1.

Perennial weeds of Cirsium arvense was associated only with DH tillage, especially in the last year when it produced 72% of the total perennial biomass of 92.9 g m-2. The tendency of biomass increase of some perennial weeds with time on continuous disk harrowed plots has been reported previously (Knežević et al., 2003b). Findings of Reisinger and Pálmai (2007) suggest that the sowing time of crop could be integrated in a strategy against some annual and perennial weeds in winter wheat. On average, applied herbicide mixtures in our trials provided a successful biomass control of main annual broad-leaved weeds such as: M. inodora (92-98% control), G. aparine (90100%), S. media (89-100%) and A. artemisiifolia (85- 90%). Herbicide mixtures did not sufficiently control perennial weeds. Compared to the best control efficacy of all species with CT (90% control), a less but still satisfactory control efficacy of 83 and 81% was achieved with CP and DH tillage treatments, respectively.

The highest yields were obtained in the first year of study with favourable weather conditions when yields in three tillage treatments did not significantly differ (7.1 t -7.4 t</p><p id="Pg12">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1406 ha-1). A drastic yield depression occurred in the dry season of 2003 at all tillage treatments, but the highest depression of 32% was found in DH tillage compared to 4.9 t ha-1 in CT. In comparison with the highest yields in CT with mouldboard ploughing (6.1 t ha-1), average yield depressions in reduced CP and DH tillage treatments were 3% and 5%, respectively (Table 2). Differences in yields are statistically significant between CT and DH. Compared to untreated controls, on average, herbicide mixtures provided significantly higher yields of 3, 11 and 7% in CT, CP and DH tillage treatments, respectively. The yields did not differ between three herbicide treatments. Conclusions Plant density and fresh biomass of weeds varied according to year and tillage system. Significant differences between three tillage systems were observed in biomass of annual broad-leaved and perennial weeds. The proportion in biomass of annual broadleaved weeds was 57, 56 and 41% in mouldboard-, chisel ploughing and disk harrowing, respectively, whereas the proportion of perennial weeds was 8, 24 and 50%, respectively. Applied herbicide mixtures provided a successful biomass control of dominant annual broad-leaved weeds (89-100%), and gave significantly higher yields than untreated controls with an average yield increase of 7%. Compared to the highest yield in conventional tillage with mouldboard ploughing (6.1 t ha-1), a significant average yield depression by 5% occurred after disk harrowing.

It also provided data about differences between hinds age categories. Blood samples were collected from 82 red deer hinds aged between 1 and 11 years, kept at 7.5 ha at the altitude of 87 m, 6 months after import from Hungary. While mean total protein was lower, glucose level was higher in our investigation in relation to other authors (Poljičak-Milas, 2004, Bouda et al, 2000). It is probably due to the insufficient grazing, stress condition and parasite infection. Keywords: insufficient grazing, red deer, biochemical parameters Introduction Red deer (Cervus elaphus) is species of wild animal suitable for modern agricultural husbandry. Farmed deer were mainly used for game meat (Mackay, 1998). Farmers from different parts of the world select specific species based on climate, personal preferences, availability of genetic materials. Red deer has been farmed for a few years in Croatia. It is very important to know quality of soil for the pasture and it depends on physical, chemical and microbiological properties (Olah Zsuposne, 2007). It is advisable to use rotation row crops and pastures every three or four years both fertility and pest control advantages (Pajor et al, 2007). Regarding to that knowledge of biochemical status is important for monitoring animals’ health and is an essential prerequisite for the recognition of illness or metabolic disorders, because their values depend mainly on nutrition, management and environmental conditions (Padilla et al, 2000). There are a few information concerning blood composition in red deer kept in similar habitats and the same altitude. Methods of capture is necessary to take into account when interpreting referent values of biochemical parameters (Marco et Lavin, 1999). The present work was undertaken in order to provide data of the biochemical parameters on imported hinds, settled in confined area on limited soil and restricted pasture. It also provided data about differences between hinds age categories. Materials and Methods Red deer hinds (n=82), aged between 1 and 11 years were kept at 7.5 ha at the altitude of 87 m, 6 months after import from Hungary. The animals were fed with the feed mixture containing 16% crude protein (Table 1). Available pasture was insufficient for such large number of animals. Five millilitre blood samples were obtained from the jugular vein using a Venoject® vacutainer for the biochemical tests. Level of metabolites (glucose, urea, creatinine, cholesterol, total proteins, triglycerides) and</p><p id="Pg14">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

The differences between age categories were statistically tested using repeated measurement model with Fischer’s post hoc test. Results were presented according to the age: young hinds (1 and 2 years old), adult hinds (4, 5 and 6 years old) and old hinds (10 and 11 years old). Results and Discussion Animals did not show clinical signs of disease, but body condition was rather poor. Serum glucose concentration varied from 2.7 to 11 mmol/l in young hinds (average 7.08mmol/l), which was higher than Padilla et al (2000), Vengušt et al (2002) in fallow deer and Kaneko (1997) in domestic ruminants. Major influence on blood glucose values has stress via activation of the sympathetic nervous system and increment of the adrenalin secretion. Older hinds had higher glucose level, similar as Poljičak-Milas et al (2004) in fallow deer. The mean concentration of total protein were higher than investigation of Poljičak-Milas et al (2004), Vengušt et al (2002) and Marco et Lavin (1999). However, they found higher total protein level in animals captured by physical means which was in relation to our investigation. It was described as a result of the haemoconcentration which occurred during capturing (English and Lepherd, 1981). Serum albumin level was lower compared to the results of the other authors (Vengušt et Bidovec, 2002, Marco et Lavin, 1999, Poljičak-Milas et al, 2004). Other protein fractions were probably higher (globulins), but we do not have data about it. According to age, statistically higher albumin level was determined in younger hinds. The</p><p id="Pg15">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1409 cholesterol and triglycerides concentrations are strictly regulated, varying due to diet and time of year. LDL cholesterol was lower in young hinds in relation to adults. It is also caused by effect of catecholamine and corticosteroids after capturing (Marco et al, 1997). Serum concentration of sodium is comparable with all previously reported authors, but potassium and chloride concentration are lower than that described in other studies, probably because of endogenous release of catecholamine. According to Kolb et al (1995b) serum iron levels from 20 to 35 μmol*l-1 are characteristic for fallow deer and in that ranges are values from our investigation. Differences between the ages were not found. Poor metabolic status is presumably result of deficient pasture during longer period, which is in relation with Poti et al (2007) and Laczo et al (2007). Poti (2007) suggested that the best grazing system for efficiently utilizing pasture is controlled grazing, or management intensive rotational grazing. Table 2.

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of environment on sweet corn quality traits potential. The trials with ten sugary hybrids were set up at two locations in 2006 and 2007. Significant effects of environment were obtained for kernel water, sucrose, glucose, fructose and total sugar content. Lowest environmental means for kernel water and sugars content were associated with stress conditions due to extreme drought and heat. Hybrids grown in suitable growing conditions and harvested at prime maturity had significantly higher kernel total sugar content. Keywords: sweet corn, endosperm sugars, environment, genotype Introduction Sweetness and good texture are two important characteristics of high quality sweet corn hybrids. Many maize mutants are known that alter the composition of endosperm sugars and one of the most frequently used commercial mutant is sugary (su). In su endosperm, after sugar concentration reaches a maximum sugar is converted to starch, resulting in decreasing sweetness over time (Marshall and Tracy, 2003). Harvesting sweet corn at the proper stage of maturity is essential to insure a high quality crop. An immature ear will not be completely filled and over- mature sweet corn is tough and doughy. The harvest date is usually estimated by noting the date of silk emergence. The number of days from silk emergence to harvest is approximately 18 to 23 days. The impact of genotype, environment and genotype x environment interaction can have outstanding importance on quality traits (Russo at al., 2004; Hegyi at al., 2007; Nagy, 2007; Sipos at al., 2007). This investigation was conducted with registered and new experimental sweet corn hybrids with objective to evaluate environmental impacts of two important agro-regions in Croatia on their quality traits potential. Materials and methods The plant material used in this study were ten early maturing su hybrids, created at the Agricultural institute Osijek. The trials were set up in 2006 and 2007 at two locations and soil types with characteristic conditions for particular growing area (Osijek, Eastern Croatia – eutric cambisol, pHKCl = 6.25, humus = 2.20 and Pula, Istria – terra rossa, pHKCl = 5.45, humus = 1.60). Each trial included three replicates of hybrids arranged in a randomized complete block design. Currently used cultural practices for sweet corn were applied in all field performance trials. Observations of silking dates were made and ears were hand harvested at prime maturity (20 days after pollination according to our earlier investigation, Brkić at al., 2003). Endosperm sugars analysis started within 30 min after harvest. Approximately 5 g of kernels from the middle of the ear were ground and than extracted with water in a hot water bath (50 0C) for 15 min. The extract were filtered and passed through 0,45μm syringe filter before analysis. The separation was carried out by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography system (Perkin Elmer</p><p id="Pg18">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1412 series 200), equipped with isocratic pump, thermostatic oven, MetaCharb Ca plus column and refractive index detector. 20 μl aqueous sample extract were injected on the column. The column was eluted with degassed water at 90 0C, with a flow rate of 0.5 ml min-1. Sugars were identified by comparison their retention time with known standards and quantified by peak area using internal standard procedure. Samples were run in triplicate. Percentage of water, sucrose, glucose, fructose and their combined total were determined. Initially, data from each environment was statistically analyzed separately. Entry means and error mean squares were used for further combined analyses of variance. The PLABSTAT program package (Utz 1995) was used for all statistical procedures in the study. Results and discussion There were notable differences in air temperatures and precipitation between the two locations in 2006 growing season (Table 1). At Pula it was extremely dry with high mean temperatures particularly during June and July. Weather conditions at Osijek did not deviate notably from the 30-year average except in July that was warm and dry. The 2007 growing season was warm and very dry at both locations but precipitation distribution was more favourable at Osijek. Table 1.

At location Osijek all hybrids had kernel water content within optimum range, while at location Pula most of hybrids had significantly lower kernel water content in both years (Figure 1). Many studies demonstrate that the generative phase of growing period is critical when environmental conditions are not favourable (Marton at al., 2005, Dobos and Szabo, 2005). The stress conditions at Pula during generative phases in July, resulted in rapid kernel moisture loss and hybrids reached prime maturity earlier then predetermined optimal harvest date. 40 70 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Hybrid W a te r ( % ) Osijek 2006 Pula 2006 Osijek 2007 Pula 2007 Figure 1. Water content (%) in kernels of ten sweetcorn hybrids at four emnvironments Environmental factors also strongly affected kernel sugars content. Generally, among the endosperm sugars, sucrose predominated (Table 3), and determined portions of glucose and fructose in total sugars are consistent with published data. Significant differences for average kernel total sugar content were obtained between locations in both years and between years at location Osijek. Low concentrations of total sugars at Pula (11.0 and 13.5 % of dry weight in 2006 an 2007, respectively) could be associated with low kernel water content. However, non-significant correlations confirmed hybrids differences in relation between dynamics of kernel moisture loss and conversion of sugar to starch. The highest average total sugar content was at Osijek in 2007 (19.8 % of dry weight) although growing season was extremely dry. There were no stress conditions explained by higher precipitation in March (83 mm), good water capacity of soil (eutric cambisol) and sufficient precipitation during generative phase in July. On contrast, in 2006 growing season, high temperatures and very low precipitation in July resulted in significantly lower average total sugars content (14.9 % of dry weight). total</p><p id="Pg20">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Total sugar content (% of dry weight) in kernels of ten sweet corn hybrids at four emnvironments Tested genotypes showed potential to reach kernel total sugar content above 15 % of dry weight that is acceptable level for commercial sweet corn (Marshall and Tracy, 2003). It is important to emphasize that suitable growing conditions and harvesting at prime maturity are necessary for high kernel sugar content of sweet corn hybrids. Conclusions The obtained results showed significant effect of environment on sweet corn quality. Hybrids grown in favourable growing conditions and harvested at prime maturity had significantly higher kernel total sugar content. Extreme dry and hot weather especially during generative phase of growing period resulted in particularly low kernel water and sugars content. The number of days from silk emergence to harvest, usually used as indicator of optimal harvest date and recommended to farmers, could be unreliable if stress conditions occur.

Budapest, Hungary Abstract: As a part of our research project according to nitrogen flow in soils and vegetable cultures, experiments were made in the nursery garden of our Institute (KF KFK), using large volume lysimeters, sunk in the ground. The macroelement content of tomato leaves and fruits, and acid, sugar and vitamin C levels of tomato fruits were examined. Four different nitrogen doses (0, 60, 120 and 180 kg ha-1 N) were used beside 600 kg ha-1 Cropcare slow release fertilizer in sandy, alluvial and chernozem soils. Total N levels and other parameters were determined in two harvest times. The lowest total N was shown in tomato leaves grown in sandy soil. Leaf analysis clearly confirmed N translocation from the young leaves to the old ones. These observations attract attention to the importance of sampling. The lower N fertilizer doses did not increase N content in leaves, and only the higher N doses increased total N levels in fruit as well. Phosphorus content did not differin young and old leaves considerably, though potassium levels were higher in young tomato leaves, 0.28% on average. Potassium levels in fruit decreased continuously by increasing N doses. Higher nitrogen fertilizer doses increased acid content in tomato berry on sandy and alluvial soils. The biggest decrease in acid level was shown on chernozem during the growing season. Sugar content increased in tomato grown on alluvial and chernozem soils. Nitrogen doses decreased sugar contents in chernozem. The increase in vitamin C levels in sandy soil was slight due to higher nitrogen doses. Vitamin C content decreased slightly in the fruit during the growing period. Keywords: tomato, nitrogen fertilization, soil types, acid, sugar, vitamin C content Introduction Vegetable growing may encumber mainly the soil and natural and ground water among the environmental factors as a result of intensive irrigation and inadequate organic and inorganic nutrient use (Kádár, 1992, 2007, Németh, 1996, 2006.). The central aim of our research, beyond achieving good quality crop, was to supply nutrients in accordance with nutritive uptake and irrigation and organic material uptake dynamics. For the examination of vegetable cultures a model imitating organic/inorganic carbon and nitrogen flow was used, and during our experiments microbiologic activity and organic material metabolism of soils were studied continuously in different textures and organic content (Végh et al., 2007). In our recent work the influence of several nitrogen doses on different plant organs of tomato indicator plant was studied so as to refine plant sampling methods. Materials and methods Our experiment series were carried out in the nursery garden of the Institute of Environmental Science of Faculty of Horticulture, Kecskemet College in 2006, as a part of the study project supported by the Hungarian Scientific Research Fund (OTKA) under Grant No. K62548. The experiments were carried out in lysimeters with 0.6 m height and diameter, a drip irrigation system was used to ensure sufficient soil water</p><p id="Pg22">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1416 supply to the tomato test plant, type K-549. The two variable treatments were as follow: three soil types (sandy, alluvial and chernozem) and four nitrogen fertilizer doses: 1. Control, 2. N60:P60:K120, 3. N120:P60:K120, and 4. N180:P60:K120 kg ha -1 N, P2O5 and K2O active agent, in six repitition. The most characteristic physical and chemical parameters of the examined soil types were described in our other paper (Végh et al., 2007). Basic fertilizer was applied before planting as a slow release fertilizer Cropcare (10:10:20) in 600 kg ha-1. Nitrogen was applied three and six weeks later as 34% NH4NO3. Total nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium contents in tomato leaves and fruits, acid, sugar and vitamin C levels in tomato fruit were analysed in two harvest times (1st examination: 15. 08. 2006. and 2nd examination: 28. 08. 2006.). We determined total nitrogen levels in young (apical) and old (basal) leaves as well. Total nitrogen was determined by Kjeldahl method (MSZ-08-1783-6:1983), total phosphorus and potassium contents were analysed by an ICP spectrometer (MSZ-081783-28:1985 and MSZ-08-1783-29:1985). Further analytical methods included: total free acid content by neutral analysis, total sugar by Schoorl method, and vitamin C by volumetric analysis (Borsné Pető et al., 2004.). Results and discussion In our first examination (at the first harvest time), higher nitrogen fertilizer doses increased N levels in tomato leaves (young shoot: leaf and peduncle) in sandy and chernozem soil (from 1.44 to 2.30 m/m% and from 1.74 to 2.44%), though this effect in alluvial soil was not shown. This may be the result of the diluting effect of the growing biomass (Buzás, 1983.). According to soil types, the lowest total nitrogen content was shown in plant leaves grown in sandy soil (1.69%), while this was 1.99% in chernozem and 2.54% in alluvial soil. At the end of peduncle (younger, apical leaves) the total N content was 3.65% and at the basal part of peduncle (basal, older leaves) it was 2.42%. In our second examination time we compared total N content of younger and older shoots (leaf and peduncle) in plants grown in sandy soil. Increasing nitrogen doses increased N content both in young and old leaves in sandy soil, which must have been the result of the poor nitrogen supply of this soil type (Figure. 1). 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 young leaves 2nd examination old leaves 2nd examination Figure 1 Total nitrogen content (m/m%) in tomato leaves grown in sandy soil after treatment with different N doses (control, 60, 120, 180 kg ha -1 N). The results of the second harvest time analysis showed total N levels of 2.41% in young leaves and 2.03% in old leaves grown in sandy soil. Leaf examination results confirmed nitrogen translocation process. This phenomenon calls attention to the</p><p id="Pg23">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1417 importance of the time and place of leaf sampling, the age of plant, the position of leaf and nutritive capacity of the soil, so as to get correct diagnostic data. As a result of the increasing N doses, total nitrogen content in tomato fruits increased by 0.02-0.30% in both harvest times as compared to control. On the contrary, total phosphorus levels decreased continuously by increasing N fertilizer doses: from 0.74 to 0.34% in young leaves and from 0.70 to 0.41% in the old ones in sandy soil. This effect in the fruit was negligible. In our experiments the potassium level in young leaves was 1.34% on average. Due to higher N fertilizer doses potassium content increased linearly in old leaves, from 0.78 to 1.42%, though K content decreased continuously in tomato fruit in the same time: from 3.79 to 2.92 % (Figure. 2).

Changes in potassium content (m/m%) of tomato leaves and fruit in sandy soil after different (control, 60, 120, 180 kg ha -1 N) N fertilizer doses (2nd examination). Former studies of the effect of nitrogen on potassium level in tomato leaves confirm these results (Cserni et al., 1984., Terbe et al., 2002.). According to the 1st examination, the acid content of tomato fruit was 0.38% in sandy soil, 0.43% in alluvial and 0.53% in chernozem soil, on average. The second examination, showed values between 0.35-0.40%. According to the 1st examination higher N doses increased acid level in sandy and alluvial soils, while the highest N180 kg ha-1 dose did not result in increasing acid levels in chernozem because of the balanced nutritive supply in this type. Due to increasing N fertilizer doses a tendency to increase in acid content was shown in sandy soil, but it equalized in alluvial and chernozem soils at the second examination time. During the growing season the acid content in fruits decreased in different manner: 0.02% in sand, 0.08 in alluvial and 0.16% in chernozem soils, on average. Mean sugar content in tomato berry increased to 2.84 in alluvial and to 3.14 in chernozem soil as compared to 2.09% level measured in fruit grown in sandy soil (1st examination). Sugar contents were almost the same at the second examination, irrespectively of soil types (2.22-2.25%). The sugar level enhancing effect of higher N fertilizer doses was shown only in sandy soil, at both examination times. Similar sugar content changing effect did not appear in alluvial soil, while there was a decrease in the sugar content in chernozem at the 2nd examination (from 3.90 to 2.14%). Exaggerated N doses depressed sugar content in chernozem with good potassium supply, in</p><p id="Pg24">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1418 agreement with our former results (Végh, 2007.). This phenomenon may be the result of the dilution process or the adsorption of ammonium ions into clay minerals. Vitamin C content in tomato fruit increased slightly after nitrogen treatment in sandy soil at the first examination time. In alluvial soil this increase was even less while a remarkable decline was shown in chernozem at 60 and 120 kg ha-1 nitrogen doses. Vitamin C content decreased in all examined soil types at the 2nd examination time: sandy soil: by 0.057, illuvial: 0.139, and chernozem: 0.057 mg kg-1. compared to the 1st time. This may lead to the conclusion that vitamin C content decreases slightly during tomato ripening stages. Conclusions Higher N fertilizer doses increased N content in tomato leaves in sandy soil, probably because of the poor nitrogen supply of this soil type. Leaf examination results confirmed nitrogen translocation process. This calls attention to the importance of the right sampling method to get correct diagnostic data. Total phosphorus levels decreased continuously by increasing N fertilizer doses. K content decreased continuously in tomato fruit in sandy soil with higher N doses. Acid and vitamin C content decreased slightly during ripening. Exaggerated N doses depressed sugar content in chernozem soils of good potassium supply.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1419 SORPTION CAPACITY OF DEAD ORGANIC MATTER Noémi KOVÁCS Kecskemet Collage of Horticulture Institute of Environmental Sciences Abstract The high organic matter content of compost predicts a good metal sorption capacity. In spite of this fact necessary to investigate the quantity of heavy metal content as well as the sorption capacity of heavy metals in compost materials. Recently the sorption of copper was measured in some “mature” and “fresh” German compost materials. 1 g of compost was equilibrated with 20 cm 3 solution containing seven different concentration of copper. The samples were centrifuged, filtered and determined with AAS. All the measurement were done in two replicates. The maximum amount of sorbed copper is very high both in the mature and fresh compost materials. The “mature” compost materials can adsorb somewhat more zinc than the “fresh” compost materials. Keywords: heavy metal, dead organic matter, copper accumulation Introduction Recently some papers (1) was dealt with the heavy metals in soil and plant, but very few one with the compost materials. The high dead organic matter content is important in the soil, because they have very high sorption capacity. The probability of heavy metal pollution in compost materials is not too big because of the more and more close quality control in production and the frequent chemical analysis of the product. The compost materials contain beside the humic substances and nutrient elements polluting materials like heavy metals (4). There are strict regulations for compost production and also for compost quality. The accepted limit value is 70-100 mgkg-1 Cu (2). The purpose of this work is to determine the copper sorption ability of compost materials and measure the rate of release with hot water percolation (3) in “mature” and “fresh” compost samples. Materials and methods 12 compost materials, prepared and analysed in Germany, were used in the experiment. The five compost samples with No5. were considered as “fresh” and the seven samples with No7. were considered as “mature” ones according to the German qualification system. 1g of compost was equilibrated with 20 cm3 solution containing 0, 500, 1 000, 2 000, 3 000, 5 000, 7 500, gCu for “fresh” compost materials and 0, 500, 1 000, 2 000, 3 000, 5 000, 7 500, 10 000, 15 000 and 20 000 gCu) for “mature” compost materials respectively and shaked for 19 hours. The samples were centrifuged and filtered. The determinations of Cu was done with AAS. Langmuir isotherm was fitted to the copper sorption datas: q = (A k c)/ (1+k c) Where: q is the amount of the adsorbed heavy metal, mgkg-1 A is the maximum amount of the sorbed heavy metal, mgkg-1 k is the adsorption equlibrium constant c is the equlibrium concentration, mgl-1</p><p id="Pg26">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1421 Organic matter % is mean 47% of “fresh” compost matter and 37% of “matured” compost materials. The composition of basic material were different so the maturity processes and the quality of final products were determined by that. The concentrations of copper was less that the accepted limit value, exception sample No.7/1, because the basic material was sewage sludge polluting with heavy matels. Table 2. contains the results of the adsorption experiment, both the measured and calculated Cu sorption capacity of compost materials. Our result was supported with high dead organic matter content of samples (Table 1.). The measured adsorbed amount of Cu generally near 7 000 mgkg-1 in the “fresh” compost materials (it means that near 95% of added Cu solution), and in most of the cases more in the “mature” compost materials (19 000 mgkg-1). The tendency of calculated Cu adsorption maximum is similar, only the values are bigger, because the calculation of adsorption maximum is an extrapolation with the applied function out of the measuring interval. The maximum adsorbed amount of Cu generally near 11 000 mgkg-1 in the “fresh” dry compost materials, and near 28 000 mgkg-1 in the “mature” dry compost materials. The different of sorpted amount of copper in “fresh” and “mature” compost materials come from different quality of humic materials. The adsorbed amount of added copper ions approach the 95 % both tipes of samples. Conclusions The probability of heavy metal pollution in compost materials is not too big because of the more and more close quality control in production and the frequent chemical analysis of the product. The basic heavy metal content in compost material was determined by the pollution of primary materials. Organic matters have high sorption ability and forms stable complexes with Cu+2. Organic matter reactions with copper form highly immobile compounds with lignin. In our trials we analized Cu adsortion capacity of 12 compost material samples. We added seven different contentrations of copper in solution, and measured quantity of copper in equilibrium solution. The stronger bounding of “mature” compost could be explained with the higher rate of humification. In the case of “fresh” compost materials more simple organic compounds could be find which are not able to adsorb so strongly the heavy metal ion then the more complex humic substances. The high organic matter content of compost predicts a good metal sorption capacity. The compost materials able to adsorption more heavy metal ions like the accepted limit value (more than hundredfold of them). And the quantity of desorption is only some %. Considering the adsorption results, could be concluded that the Cu sorption capacity of compost materials is rather big as the consequence of high organic matter content. In the “mature” compost materials the humification more proceeded and this fact causes the stronger sorption of Cu during the adsorption processes.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1423 A CONTRIBUTION TO THE HOST-RANGE OF MACROPHOMINA PHASEOLINA Izabella CSÖNDES – Sándor KADLICSKÓ – Richard GÁBORJÁNYI University of Pannonia, Georgikon Faculty of Agriculture, Plant Protection Institute, Deák Ferenc 16, H-8360 Keszthely, Hungary Abstract: Influence of Macrophomina (M.) phaseolina on the germination of different plant species was studied. Fifteen seedlings of 39 species have been inoculated with three Hungarian isolates of M. phaseolina in four replications. Symptoms of infected plants, germination rates, and the differences in the pathogenicity of three isolates were estimated after five weeks to determine the damage caused by M. phaseolina. On the basis of our study Aegilops cylindrica and Phytolacca americana seemed to be resistant to M. phaseolina infection. Twenty six species were less sensitive other six medium sensitive to the infection. Amaranthus caudatus, Apera spica-venti, Spergula arvensis and Trifolium hybridum proved to be very susceptible, the rate of germination of seedlings varied between 5 and 20 %. Furthermore in the case of Lepidium sativum total destruction caused by M. phaseolina was observed. Key words: Macrophomina phaseolina, seed germination, host range Introduction Macrophomina phaseolina (Tassi) Goidanich causes charcoal rot in more than 300 plant species. The damage caused by the fungus was noticed in Hungary from sunflower (Békési 1971), maize Vörös and Manninger (1973), soybean Érsek (1979), potato, bean garlic (Simay 1987, 1990), sugarbeet (Koppányi et al. 1993) and pepper (Fischl et al. 1995). The ability to survive in the sclerotia of plant residues in the soil was relatively high. Sclerotia serve the primer inoculum source (Short et al. 1980). In humid vegetation periods the symptoms are not perceptible and the pathogen cannot be isolate from the lower parts of the stem. The control of this pathogen is difficult. Seed treatments with different chemicals gave no satisfying results. Only the crop rotation may be helpful, but not enough, since wide host range of this pathogen. Disease severity can be decreased by irrigation. Production of resistant varieties seems to be the best method for control (Csöndes et al. 2007). Several experiments were performed for determination of infection of M. phaseolina in seedling period (Garcia et al. 1983, Kunwar et al. 1986, Simay 1990, Varga et al. 1997). The increasing appearance of weeds and the wide host range of M. phaseolina motivated us to test the sensitivity or resistance of different plants which have been not reported. The aim of our study was to investigate the susceptibility of different plant species in pot experiments and compare the damage of some Hungarian isolates with different levels of pathogenicity (Csöndes and Kadlicskó, 2007). Materials and methods In the pathogenicity experiments altogether 39 plant species: Aegilops cylindrica Host (AEGCY), Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn. (AGRCR), Agrostis stolonifera L. (AGRST), Alopecurus pratensis L. (ALOPR), Amaranthus caudatus L. (AMACA), Apera spica-venti (L.) Beauv. (APESV), Asclepias syriaca L. (ASCSY), Brachypodium sylvaticum (Huds.) Beauv.

Artificial inoculations have been made with three M. phaseolina isolates, collected from three areas of Hungary (Csöndes and Kadlicskó 2007). Two isolates, one with strong (SFS) and one with moderate (SFM) pathogenicity originated from the stems of sunflower, and the third (SB) from soybean roots. One week old pure cultures of these three isolates in PDA were used. Agar blocks (five mm diameter) from the side of culture with microsclerotia were cut for inoculation and transferred to sterile PDA media into sterilized Petri-dishes (9 cm in diameter). Inoculations were performed with three-day-old fungal colonies in darkness at 20 ºC in four replications. After a week incubation period seedlings were transmitted into pots into an ordinary glasshouse. Germination rate and symptoms were estimated after five weeks. The percentage of germination was estimated. Evaluation of variance and significance was calculated by Microsoft Excel program. The sensitivity of the plant species tested was expressed on the basis of the germination rates of healthy controls. Results and discussion Inoculation of M. phaseolina generally decreased the germination of seeds. Considerable differences among the isolates are summarized in Table 1. Isolate SFS, collected from sunflower, caused the most severe damage and the soybean isolate (SB) the least. Mortality of plants was not observed after germination. No symptoms have been found in control plants, their germination was near to 100 %. When more than 60 % of the inoculated plants has been died, the remaining ones generally showed yellowing and stunting in a growing period of 5 weeks. AEGCY and PHYAM seemed to be resistant to M. phaseolina infection. In contrast the fungus caused the highest damage on the seeds of LEPSA. In this case infection of all the three isolates destroyed all seeds, while the rate of germination rate of control seeds was 100 %. The germination of infected AMACA was the lowest, their rate was only 5,45 % in the average of three isolates. The next one in the row was the TRIHY, its rate reached 6,66 %.

Cereal Research Communications 1426 Conclusions In Hungary several authors described the occurrence of M. phaseolina and its injury. Fluctuations of M. phaseolina population may be affected year by year depends on the ability to the survive in the soil, in the plant residues, and the release of sclerotia and soil conditions (Birkás et al. 2006, Hunyadi et al. 2007). The influence of M. phaseolina on the germination was studied on different plant species. Our results stated that two species, AEGCY and PHYAM were resistant. In the case of LEPSA the destruction was total. Furthermore, AMACA showed a low germination rates. Differences among inoculated and non-inoculated control plants was statistically significant. No symptoms have been found on the control plants, their germination was near to complete. In our opinion it is necessary to study the influence of M. phaseolina on the germination on even more plant species, to get new informations for further potential hosts. These results supply new evidences for recognition of natural infection sources and the survive of the pathogen. This is a first report on the phytotoxic effect of M. phaseolina on different plant seedlings. References Békési, P.: 1970. A Macrophomina phaseoli (Maubl.)

Bioethanol can be utilized as fuel alone or mixed with petrol. Its by-products are also can be utilized (Sipos et al., 2007). For its production, plants with high sugar or starch content can be used, e. g. sugar cane, corn kernel (Voca et al., 2007) or sorghum. Juice pressed from the stalk of sugar sorghum has high sugar content (14-17%) that makes it suitable for bioethanol production. During our experiment, we examined 53 restorer male lines; among them 22 were silo type sugar sorghum. We studied the following traits stalk of juice, stalk of content. According top character available from stalk by pressing, we selected six restorer male lines for studies in the forthcoming years: RL 12, RL 4, RL 5, RL 18, RL 15, RL 9. Their stalk medullas were wet, stalk diameters were mediumthick, sugar contents of juices varied between 17 and 24% at the end of milk mature. Harvest was made in September, they can be classified into early maturation group. Male sterile female lines were the following: SL 1, SL 2, SL 3, SL 4, SL 5. The concern male lines were: CL 1, CL 2, CL 3, CL 4, CL 5. Sugar contents of these lines were close to average, SL 1 was the earliest crossing partner. In Hungary, there are only a few restorer female lines, so we will use these lines for hybrid production during the next years.

Areas of silage and forage crops have been declined too. In the European Union one tool of mitigating agricultural overproduction is the utilization of certain arable lands for energy production. Bioenergy production can be a perspective in the future since the shortage of fossil energy sources; in addition, the energy demand of Hungary and other, economically dynamically developing countries is increasing (Uppal, 2007, Gnansonou et al., 2005). The lack of fossil energy caused a price explosion and the increasing demand led to environmental contamination, global warming and extreme climatic conditions. Because of these, it is necessary to produce plants with good adaptability and drought resistance altogether with the commonly used cereals. In satisfying the demand for extra energy, Sudan grass, grain and silo sorghum would play a major role as renewable energy sources, especially the sweet variant (Martini et al., 2006; Vaughan-Martini et al., 2006). Bioethanol and biogas productions would be alternative opportunities for energetic utilization of sorghum biomass. Silo sorghum and Sudan grass give high amounts of biomass; this organic material is an excellent base material for biogas production. Bioethanol can be fermented from the juice of sweet sorghum pressed from its stalk (Bulawayo et al., 1996, Laopaiboon et al., 2007) and could partially replace conventional fuels in motorcars. Materials and methods In 2006, as a part of a sorghum breeding programme, the Department of Horticulture and Plant Biotechnology ordered 53 restorer male breeding lines suitable for production of bioethanol and biogas from the Gene Bank of Agrobotanical Institute in Tápiószele, Hungary and from the Gene Bank of Gatersleben, Quedlinburg. 5 cytoplasmic male sterile mother lines and maintainer male lines were obtained from Karcag Research</p><p id="Pg34">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1428 Institute and from Serbia. Male sterile mother lines and maintainer male lines were the following: SL 5, CL 1, CL 2, CL 3, CL 4, CL 5. The experiment was set in the garden of the Department of Horticulture and Plant Biotechnology. The experiment was planted on 18th April 2007, when soil temperature reached 16 °C. The soil of the experimental area was lime-coated chernozem. Ploughing was the most important soil tillage task during fall, in spring combinatoring took place, the forecrop was maize. 5 plots were set per each (7.5 m2), distance between rows was 75 cm. Each lines were planted in two rows. To ease the accomplishment of crossings, one female line was placed between two restorer male lines. 30 kernels were planted for each metre by hand. Weed control was implemented by hand and herbicides. Weed control comprised of a pre-emergence spraying with RAMROD FLOW (5.5 l ha1) against monocotyledonous weeds and a post-emergence BASAGRAN FORTE (1.5 l ha-1) against dicotyledonous weeds. The aim of the experiment was to determine the sugar contents and amounts of stem juices of silo type sorghum lines. Female lines were maintained and crossing complexes of male sterile female lines and restorer male lines were produced. According to the juice content, sugar content, stalk medulla characteristics and stalk thickness, six restorer male lines were selected for crossings and mixed planting with maize during the forthcoming years. Method for juice pressing from sweet sorghum In 2007, the Genetics Group of the Department of Horticulture and Plant Biotechnology determined the juice contents of sweet sorghum samples with a cylindrical stalk press also used for sugar cane. Sugar contents were determined by a manual refractometer. The press is a unique equipment in Hungary since even in Europe there is no large scale method for pressing the juice from sorghum stalks. Earlier grape presses were tried for this task without significant results. In Karcag, a smaller laboratory press was experimented for obtaining juice. Results and discussion Measurement of juice and sugar contents Highest amounts of juice were given by RL 9 and RL 15 (306 ml and 182 ml, respectively), their sugar contents were also good (15% and 18.4%), while the control hybrid’s results were 160 ml and 12.7%. RL 4 and RL 5 had high sugar contents (20%) but thin stalks. Increasing stalk diameter is a further breeding aim. Data showed that in the case of restores lines, sugar contents were the highest in the fourth and fifth nodes. Male lines with sugar contents above 20% were the following: RL 3, RL 5, RL 12, RL 13. Their sugar contents were about 15% during ‘milk’ mature - in this stage sugar is converted to starch. RL 9, RL 15, RL 18, RL 4, RL 5 and RL 12 showed sugar contents above the average. Sugar contents of restorer lines are listed in Table 1.</p><p id="Pg35">VII.

In 2007, sugar contents of pressed stalk juices were measured. Measurements were made at different developmental stages. The highest value was regularly achieved at the end of ‘milk’ or at the beginning of ‘waxy’ mature stage of kernel development. RL 4 and RL 5 silo sorghums reached full ‘milk’ mature by July 20th, while others were only flowering. Highest sugar contents were measured at the beginning of August, even values above 20% were observed. Highest sugar contents vary between 17 and 24 %. At 1st August, RL 12 restorer male line showed the highest sugar content with 24.26%. Stalk diameter, stalk medulla characteristics, stalk juice content and sugar content of juice show perspective restorer male lines. Juice amount values vary between 26.6 and 183.3 ml, while sugar contents between 15.33 and 18.42% at the stage of ‘milk’ mature.</p><p id="Pg36">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1430 Conclusions Several solutions are available for the replacement of fossil fuels; one is bioalcohol. Bioethanol can be utilized as fuel alone or mixed with petrol. For its production, plants with high sugar or starch content can be used. Juice pressed from the stalk of sweet sorghum has high sugar content (14-17%) that makes it suitable for bioethanol production. During our experiment, we examined 53 restorer male lines; among them 22 were silo type sweet sorghum. The following were determined: their stalk juice amounts and sugar contents of juices. According to these traits, we selected six restorer male lines for studies in the forthcoming years: RL 12, RL 4, RL 5, RL 18, RL 15, RL 19. Their stalk medullas were wet, stalk diameters were medium-thick, sugar contents of juices varied between 17 and 24% at the end of ‘milk’ mature. Harvest was made in September, they can be classified into early maturation group. Male sterile female lines were the following: SL 1, SL 2, SL 3, SL 4, SL 5. The maintainer male lines were: CL 1, CL 2, CL 3, CL 4, CL 5. Sugar contents of these lines were close to average, SL 1 was the earliest crossing partner. In Hungary there are only a few restorer lines in hybridization programs so for the next years’ crosses we will apply these inbred lines. References Uppal J.: 2007.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1431 EFFICIENCY OF USE OF CHLOROPHYLL METER AND CARDY-ION METER IN POTATO NITROGEN NUTRITION SUPPLY Adrijana MAJIĆ1 - Milan POLJAK2 - Ana SABLJO1 - Zrinka KNEZOVIĆ1 - Tea HORVAT2 1 Faculty of Agriculture University of Mostar, Biskupa Čule 10, 88000 Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, email: adrijana.majic@sve-mo.ba 2 Faculty of Agriculture University of Zagreb Abstract: Chlorophyll contents and NO3-N concentration in vegetation depend on soil nitrogen availability and crop nitrogen uptake. Crop nitrogen uptake is important as nitrogen is needed for chlorophyll formation. Sap nitrate is more sensitive to changes in N application compared to total N and the leaf petiole sap accumulate nitrates more then other parts of plants. We use this method to reduce sampling time required for precisely determining fertilization and for prevention over fertilization. The objective of this study was to estimate leaf nitrogen and nitrates contents by SPAD meter and Cardy-ion meter and to link observations by comparing optical recording techniques at leaf with laboratory results of total nitrogen and fresh tuber yield. Thus, collected results will directly reflect the nutrient soil supply. Field data are from potato experiment in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2005, comprising three potato varieties: Liseta, Cleopatra and Adora, receiving similar nitrogen treatments (0, 100, 200 and 300 kg N ha −1 ). In four field sampling periods (65, 75, 85 and 95 days after sowing) the SPAD readings were performed and correlated with total nitrogen contents and obtained fresh tuber yield at the end of season. Measurement by Cardy-ion meter are performed on leaf petiole sap and tuber sap of potato and compared with percentage of nitrogen in leaf and tuber. In experiment we found highly significant relationship between SPAD indexes as well and concentration of NO3-N mg -1 with laboratory results of total nitrogen and at the end of the season with tuber yield. Meter readings indicate a significant potato yield responses to N fertilization doses. This result clearly shows more accurate quantification of the nitrogen status of a potato crop by SPAD and Cardy-ion meter, which is important information in potato crop management. Keywords: Cardy-ion meter, SPAD Chlorophyll meter, total nitrogen, yield, early potato Introduction The maintenance of soil fertility was based mainly on the application of mineral fertilizers (Németh and Kádár, 1991). During the last few decades, therefore, farmers applied more nitrogen than the crop demanded, and the overall nitrogen balance became positive (Csathó, 1994). Restoring the nutrient supply improves the quality and quantity of yield for all agricultural plants as well (Nagy, 2006). The yield quality, macro element content and their ratios correlate with the amount of fertilizer (Poljak et al., 2007). The N concentration of plant tissues is closely correlated with the N supplying capacity of the soil. A determination of the chlorophyll content thus allows the N nutrition level of the plant, and indirectly the N supplying capacity of the soil, to be estimated (Izsáki and Németh, 2007). Nitrogen deficiency can be indicated by the SPAD value with great security. It can provide a possibility for the development of an environmentally friendly nutritive management (Széles, 2007) by predicting the N status of various crops and determining their fertilization requirements (Bonneville and Fyles, 2006). Portable Cardy-ion meter is used for quick nitrate sap analysis to improve N management in crop growing and utilization of N. Nitrate levels in plant sap varied with soil mineral nitrogen supply and with time throughout the growing season (Rodrigo and Ramos, 2007). Meter is provided with a specific ion electrode, allowing rapid determinations of ion concentrations in the field of soil solution and plant sap. The</p><p id="Pg38">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1432 main advantage is the short time required for sap tissue analyses which are directly measured by dripping a sap sample on the electrode. The research has been made on potato crop measuring the level N fertilization by using field diagnostic methods for evaluation of nitrates and chlorophyll content. Study has two main goals: to improve knowledge of the N crops status and to improve soil mineral N utilization. Materials and methods Field trial was conducted in Jasenica (Bosnia and Herzegovina) in year 2005 with three early potato varieties (cv. Adora, Cleopatra and Liseta). The seed tubers were sown in March in experimental plots with space 0.70 m between rows and 0.20 m in a row. Three different doses of nitrogen nutrition (N 100, N 200, N 300 kg N ha-1) including unfertilized-control plots (N 0 kg N ha-1) were distributed in randomized block design with three replications. Size of the experimental plots was 270 m2 and data considered for evaluation were taken from central plot of 30 m2. Soil fertilization with phosphorus and potassium was determined on the basis of soil analyses. We have performed measuring with Chlorophyll meter and Cardy-ion meter from the uppermost, fully expanded mature leaf, which generally fell in the fourth or fifth node of canopy below the top of the crop. Measurement for named methods was conducted during 65, 75, 85 and 95 DAS (days after sowing) on five plants per treatment. Total nitrogen concentration of potato tuber was analyzed by Kjeldahl method (AOAC, 1970). Analyses of variance (ANOVA) were used for testing differences in SPAD values, concentration of NO3-N mg kg -1 and percentage of total nitrogen in potato leaves and crop yield. Pearson’s correlation coefficient (*, **, p &lt;0.05 and p &lt;0.01) model was used for identifying correlations between: the total nitrogen (determinate on dry matter basis) and values collected with meters, as well as with potato yield. Data were analyzed by using SPSS for Windows v 13.0 (SPSS, 2004). Results and discussion During this study we have used SPAD meter and Cardy-ion meter as indicators of N status in potato crop. Research has showed that chlorophyll content in potato leaves reaches the maximum values in earlier stages of growth after that it gets lower. The same happened with concentration of NO3-N in petioles of potato leaves. As we mentioned before data were collected during four growth stages. The important thing is that the highest yield has been obtained with application of 300 kg N ha-1 and the average yield was 3.16 kg plant-1. N doses increased plant nitrogen content generally (Németh et al., 2007). Results presented by Majić et al., (2007) shows that the nitrogen fertilizer results in increments of potato yield as well as on few quantitative traits as dry matter weight, percentage of raw ashes and plant biomass. From results collected during a vegetation season in 2005 we have found a very significant correlation between SPAD readings and fresh tuber yield with coefficient of r=0.19ns, r=0.48**, r=0.46**, r=0.30ns. SPAD index reaches the maximum values from 53 to 63 at 75 DAS and at the end of the season it’s getting lower from 30 to 47 units. Chlorophyll meter (SPAD) values and the leaf N concentration (Figure 1) show a highly significant correlation at various days after sowing 65, 75, 85 and 95 (r values ranged from 0.51** to 0.81**) which presents major physiological growth stages. A similar result for winter barley (r=0.84) was reported by Izsáki and Németh, (2007) in</p><p id="Pg39">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1433 relationship between SPAD index and total leaf N. According to Booij et al. (2000) average values collected by SPAD chlorophyll were between 40 and 41 units in 7 to 8 weeks after the emergency of potato crop. According to Széles (2007) not only nitrogen supply, but also water supply is reflected in the amount of SPAD value and the higher amount of nitrogen increases the chlorophyll content to the maximum. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 65 75 85 95 Days after planting P e rc e n ta g e o f N i n p o ta to le a f Control N100 kg ha-1 N200 kg ha-1 N300 kg ha-1 Figure1. Percentage of total leaf nitrogen during 4 growth stages and different fertilizations Very significant correlations between nitrate readings in leaf petioles sap and fresh tuber yields with correlation of r=0.53**, r=0.51**, r=0.61**, r=0.34* were found. Thus, correlation between concentration of NO3-N mg kg-1 in leaf petiole sap and percentage of total leaf nitrogen show coefficients of r=0.80**, r= 0.41*, r=0.72** and r=0.73**. The meter readings showed the average values from 1220 to 6833 at the beginning of season and at the end of season they varied from 932 to 5388 NO3-N mg kg -1 (Table 1). Measurements performed on potato tuber revealed very significant relations between percentages of nitrogen and concentration of NO3-N in fresh tuber sap at level 0.46** (Table 1). The values of NO3-N mg kg -1 in tuber sap varied from 43 to 69 mg kg-1 in the season. Buturac (2003) implies that average concentrations of nitrates in potato tuber are between 30 to 80 mg kg-1 while appreciations are about 140 to 233 mg kg-1. Table1.

Cardy-ion meter for</p><p id="Pg40">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1434 potato crop plant sap-testing have been calibrated to find a system that growers can use in the field for managing nitrogen (N) and which will stop them from applying excessive amounts of fertilizer what contributes to groundwater pollution by nitrate. N fertilization is one of the most effective agro-technical devices for increasing yield and N concentration (Berecz and Németh, 2002). To achieve healthy growth and optimal yield levels of the crop, nutrients must be available not only in the correct quantity and proportion, but also in the right time. Conclusions The SPAD chlorophyll and Cardy-ion meter can be used for monitoring the N status of potato crop. From these results we concluded that variation in values derived from state of soil nitrogen supply and for that reason we can notice decadency of nutrition with the ageing of plant crop. Thus, measured nutrient level in plant tissues are in great deal affected by soil status of the nutrients. The tests could be practiced in situ by the farmer, and the necessity of nitrogen fertilizer application could be decided immediately. References Association of Official Analytical Chemists. 1995.

Böszörményi street Debrecen Hungary, 4032 e-mail: czipa@agr.unideb.hu Abstract: Beside some quality parameters, fourty four elements were determined by ICP-OES in 19 honey samples from different places of Hungary, in this study. These samples have different botanical origin. Acacia (Robinia pseudo-acacia), linden (Tilia sp.), rape (Brassica sp.), coriander (Coriandrum sativum), cherry (Prunus cerasus), lavender (Lavendula angustifoia) and multifloral honey. Ca, K, S, P, Mg and Na were the most abundant minerals (896; 556; 60,5, 48,2; 31,5; 31,1 mg/kg, respectively). The B, Fe and Se content generally ranged from 2 to 8 mg/kg. In addition, we determined the electrical conductivity, - which is closely connected with mineral-, sugar- and moisture content. Keywords: Honey, Sugar and moisture content, Element composition, Mineral content, EC Introduction Honey is definied by the EU (EC Council Directive 2001/110/EC) as „The natural, sweet product produced by Apis Mellifera bees from the nectar of plants or from secretions of living plants, which bees collect, transform by combining with specific substances of their own, deposit, dehydrate, store and leave in honeycombs to ripen and mature.” Quality of honey depends on several parameters, such as sugar- moisture-, sucrose-, hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF)-, Potassium-, vitamins-, prolin- and mineral content, rate of fructose/glucose, organic acids, diastase activity, electrical conductivity, enzymes, solid corpuscles,etc. (Table 1.). Some quality parameters of honey are affected by geological and botanical origin. Table 1. Quality requirement of honey by the Codex Alimentarius Hungaricus (2002) 1. Sugar content 1.1.

Cereal Research Communications 1436 Honey contains many important elements that get into the product with the vegetable sap. Each honey has different mineral composition. One kg of flower honey contains about 100 mg minerals, but can be 1000 mg in the honeydaw honey. The main elements in honey: Potassium, followed by Chlorine, Sulphur, Sodium, Phosphours, Magnesium, Silicon, Iron and Cooper (Frank, 2006; La Serna Ramos et al., 1999). Composition and amount of ash are largely depending on the soil of the collecting area (Örösi, 1989). Iron and Cooper are the most important among the microelements (Frank, 2006). Mineral content of honey depends on botanical origin, pedoclimatic condition (Birkás et al., 2006), or extraction techniques (La Serna Ramos et al., 1999). Honey is an environmental indicator, because it may contain contaminating elements and various pesticides (Varró et al., 2007). Honey can provide environmental data from the area where bees are feed. This area is about 7 km2 (Pisani et al., 2007). There is a risk of the presence of toxic heavy metals (As, Cd, Pb). High heavy metal content have been found in honey coming from areas with heavy industrial activity or highway traffic (Gajek et al., 1987). These contaminants may also originated from the incorrect treatment of honey (Pisani et al., 2007). Electrical conductivity (EC) is associated with the mineral content of honey, but its value is affected by organic acids, proteins and sugar alcohols. The value of electrical conductivity must be maximum 0,8 mS/cm in case of pure honey, while this value must be minimum 0,8 mS/cm of honeydew honey and sweet chestnut honey. Close correlation was found between the electrical conductivity and potassium content (r=0,754). The electrical conductivity increases with the increasing Potassium content (Guler et al., 2007). Element composition of honey can also be used to detect adulteration, such as addition of sugars and syrups, mixing of honey of different botanical and geological origins, or feeding bees with artificial syrups (Rashed and Soltan, 2004). Materials and methods We examined 18 honey samples from different regions of Hungary: Heves county (rape, cherry and multifloral honey), Pest county (acacia, linden, rape, lavender and multifloral honey), Zala county (acacia, linden, rape and multifloral honey), HajdúBihar county (acacia, rape, coriander and multifloral honey), Baranya county (linden honey) and Bács-Kiskun county (acacia honey). These counties have different environmental and geological properties (Prokisch, 2007). All samples came from beekeepers. Sugar and water content were determined by DIGIT-5890 Honey pocket refractometer. Electrical conductivity was determined in 20 g/100ml solution of honey with conductometer (Radelkis). Samples were digested for element content determination according to Kovacs (1996). The element content was determined Inductively Coupled Plasma with Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The number of examined elements were 46.</p><p id="Pg43">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1437 Results and discussion Moisture content changed between 16,3 and 21,1 %. The lowest value was detected in the cherry honey and the highest in the multifloral honey (from Hajdú-Bihar county).Sugar and water contents were within the range given in the Codex Alimentarius Hungaricus (2002). Sugar contents were between 77,5 and 82,4 % (Fig. 1.) The highest sugar concentration was measured in the lavender honey, followed by linden, acacia, cherry and the lowest was in the rape honey. Figure 1. Sugar content of different honey types The results of the mineral content determination are shown in Figure2. B, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na, P and S were the most abundant elements, with average content exceeding 2 mg/kg. Figure 2. Element content of different honey types Among the elements Calcium was present at the highest concentration (mean 894 mg/kg), followed by Potassium (554 mg/kg), Sulphur (61,1 mg/kg), Phosphorus (49,3 mg/kg), Magnesium (30,18 mg/kg), Sodium (28,16 mg/kg). The amount of the Boron, Iron and Selenium was in the range of 2-9 mg/kg. The concentration of Al, Sr, As, Si, Mn and Zn was usually between 500-2000 μg/kg. The concentration of other measured elements was lower than 500 μg/kg. We note, that linden honey was an exception, as Potassium content was higher, than the Calcium. This difference might be consequence of geological and botanical origins. As samples are from different areas with various soil and base rock, the cause of the high Potassium concenration of linden honey can not be geographical. To prove this theory further analisys is needed. Since, the electrical conductivity is in close relation with potassium content (r2=0,8963, in this study), the highest electrical conductivity was measured in linden honey and the lowest value in the acacia honey. This study shows that the electrical conductivity is low in the Hungarian honey because the potassium content was low also in these honey samples. 0 400 800 1200 1600 A ca ci a C he rr y L in de n C or ia nd er L av en de r R ap e M ul tif lo ra l m g /k g Calcium Potassium 0 30 60 90 120 A ca ci a C he rr y L in de n C or ia nd er L av en de r R ap e M ul ti fl or al m g /k g P S Mg Na B Fe 80,6 80,5 80,3 79,3 80,9 78,7 80,1 77 78 79 80 81 82 A ca ci a C he rr y L in de n C or ia nd er L av en de r R ap e M ul tif lo ra l %</p><p id="Pg44">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Relation of EC and Potassium content Conclusions In the presented study, mineral composition of honey produced in different counties of Hungary was determined. Contrary to data from literature, the amount of Potassium in Hungarian honey is lower than the Calcium. Potassium content in the linden honey is lower, than in the others samples. In the cherry honey the Manganese content is very high.It is worth mention that Zinc content of the coriander honey is two times higher than in the others. As this type of honey is rather rare, we could not compare its element content with similar honey with different geographical origin. Several honey samples came from zone of Gyöngyös where there is quite big industrial activity (mines, power station). All the same, these samples were free of any contaminants or heavy metals.

At the end of tillering (DC 28-30) N-fertilization in doses calculated on the basis of inorganic nitrogen content in soil was performed. Increasing nitrogen supply in soil increased grain yield as well as crude protein content at both varieties and in contrary decreased content of starch in grain. Germination of grain was not affected by N level in soil significantly. Variety Barcelona showed higher resistance to N-nutrition and up to the soil level of 70 kg N ha -1 , grain of this variety proved acceptable malt parameters, particularly crude protein (10.8-11.5%), fermentable extract (78.5-79.1%) and Kolbach index (38.6-40.6%). Keywords: winter barley, nitrogen fertilizing, crude protein, fermentable extract, soluble nitrogen, β-glucans Introduction Great advantage of winter barley is its ability to utilize winter moisture and reach maturity earlier than high temperatures occur (Molnárová, Kolinová, 1998), and so diversify yield risk resulting from inappropriate weather and soil conditions for spring barley (Piešťanská, 2004). It is possible to achieve high grain yields and adequate special purpose quality of malting barley by usage of appropriate barley assortment, growing conditions and technology (Kovacevic et al., 2006, 2006a). Application of N increases mass of grain significantly by 13 to 18% (Paunovic et al., 2007). Thousand kernel weight (TKW) is in relation with crude protein (CP) content and its relation to malt extract is strongly influenced by variety. Activity of amylase and content of CP in grain depend on wide range of environmental factors which are actually controlled by genetic factors (Bathgate, 1987; Smith, 1990). Malt extract value is in close positive correlation with TKW, but in negative relation to CP content in grain (Molnárová, Kubištová, 2004). Chen et al. (2006) reported that timing of N-fertilization considerably influences all malt quality parameters. Adequate sowing density and N-application by top dressing are important factors of barley growing (Lalic et al., 2006; Kovacevic et al., 2006). Fertilizer impacts are time-dependent due to changes in the composition and nutrition reserves of soil (Nagy, 2006). Development of environmentally sound agricultural production systems of cereals is an important aim of agricultural research (Hoffmann et al., 2007; Hornok et al., 2007). The aim of this study was to assess the effect of various levels of nitrogen in soil on malt/feed quality of grain of two varieties of winter barley and their suitability for malting or feeding purposes. Materials and methods Small-plot field experiment with winter barley was established within the area of experimental station in Veľké Ripňany (longitude of 48° 29´, latitude of 17° 58´, altitude 170 m) on medium-heavy brownsoil in years 2003, 2004 and 2005,</p><p id="Pg46">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1440 respectively. Climatically this region is warm, moderately dry with an average growing season temperature of 15.5 °C and sum of precipitation of 500 mm. Two varieties of winter barley (Barcelona and Babylone) were tested in two experimental blocks. In each block 4 treatments of fertilization with 4 replications were arranged as follows: 1st treatment: no N-fertilization (control), 2nd, 3rd and 4th treatments were fertilized to reach the level of 50, 70 and 100 kg N ha-1 in soil, respectively. The rates of nitrogen required for reaching those levels were calculated on the basis of actual Nmin content in soil analysed closely before its application (in the form of ammonium nitrate + dolomite) at the end of tillering (DC 28-30). All treatments were fertlilized with the same dose of 30 kg N ha-1 before sowing in autumn. After harvest the following parameters were determined in grain: germination by hydrogen peroxide method (%), thousand kernel weight (TKW) by DIPOS meter (g), grading fraction &gt; 2.5 mm by Steinecker sieve (%), volume weight (kg m-3), content of CP as %N (Kjeldahl) x 6.25 (%), content of starch by Ewers (%). Samples of grain with favourable CP content (10.5-11.5%) were subjected to malting process in micromalting equipment (EBC standards) and subsequently the following characteristics in malt were determined: relative extract content at 45°C by Hartong (%), fermentable extract content (%), protein content by EA Flash (%), soluble N by EA Flash (mg l-1), Kolbach index (%), friability by friabilimeter Chapon (%), content of β-glucans in wort by FIA method (mg l-1) and activity of β-glucanase by PSA (U kg-1). Results and discussion Graduated N-supply in soil increased proportionally grain yield in both varieties. In comparison to control treatment significant increase of yield was caused by fertilization on the level of 70 and 100 kg N ha-1 in soil, respectively. Similarly Lauer and Partridge (1990) reported that increasing nitrogen rate increased grain yield. Variety Barcelona was significantly more fertile in comparison with Babylone. High values of grain germination (94.5–97.8%) were achieved in both varieties. Different N-soil supply did not significantly influence the values of this parameter (Table 1). Significant differences in grading &gt; 2.5 mm, TKW and volume weight, respectively were not found between varieties. Statistically significant N-soil supply effect on grading&gt; 2.5 mm and TKW in variety Babylone was found out (Table 1). Both varieties showed favourable homogenity of grain (Table 1). This parameter is extraordinarily important for malt production (De Ruiter, Haslemore, 1996). Content of CP in grain of both varieties was increasing as a consequence of graduated N-soil supply, ranging from 12.1 to 16.8% (Babylone) and from 10.8 to 15.9% (Barcelona). Similar results were achieved by Lauer, Partridge (1990). Grain of variety Babylone showed higher content of CP than Barcelona. The differences between genotypes and levels of N-nutrition were significant (Table 1). Babylone showed higher response to N nutrition and its grain was not suitable for malt production for high CP content in all examined treatments. For this reason, malt quality parameters were only determined in treatments 1, 2 and 3 in Barcelona variety with favourable CP content of 10.8%, 11.0% and 11.5%, respectively. Content of starch responded to increasing N-soil supply in opposite way like CP content and was decreasing with increasing level of nitrogen in soil (Table 1). However, the required standard value (60 – 63%) of this parameter was not achieved in any treatment. Values of β-glucans are relatively consistent in terms of 3-years average (Table 2), but</p><p id="Pg47">VII.

However, the values did not meet desired standard (150-200 mg l-1). Our results are in concordance to Lalic et al. (2007) who stated that β-glucans ranged within years and stands from 250 to 1196 mg l-1. Also, activity of β-glucanase in grain was low and was even decreasing with graduated N-nutrition (Table 2).

On the basis of 3 years average ascending N-soil supply slightly increased fermentable extract content from 78.43% (control) to 79.10% (treat. 3), but witout statistical significance. This is in contrary to Chen et al. (2006) who reported that with increasing rate of applied nitrogen malt extract decreases. Lalic et al. (2007) stated that extract content in winter barley fluctuated within the range of 78.07 to 79.73%. Protein content in malt fulfilled required parameters at 0 and 50 kg N ha-1 in soil, but 70 kg N ha-1 was too high (10.77; 11.03; 11.47%, respectively). Friability and content of soluble N were slightly increasing under graduated soil N-nutrition, but they did not fulfil required values by far (Table 2).</p><p id="Pg48">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1442 Conclusions Increasing N supply in soil significantly increased grain yield and CP in both varieties, grading&gt; 2.5 mm (Babylone), and decreased TKW (Babylone) and content of starch in both varieties. No significant effect was found on germination and volume weight (both varieties), grading&gt; 2.5 mm and TKW (Barcelona). Due to high content of crude protein in grain, variety Babylone is not suitable for malt production, it is favourable for foraging. Barcelona showed higher resistance to graduated N-nutrition and up to the level of 70 kg N ha-1, its grain proved acceptable malt characteristics, particularly CP (10.8-11.5%), fermentable extract content (78.5-79.1%) and Kolbach index (38.640.6%). Friability, soluble N and content of β-glucans did not meet required standards. Both varieties showed favourable values of germination, grading &gt;2.5 mm and TKW.

Strossmayer in Osijek Abstract: Changes of botanical composition and concentration of P, Ca, Fe, Zn and Cu in the plants were monitored on the two rotation lowlands pastures during the pasture season. It was determined that all investigated pasture traits varied. Analysis of botanical composition of pastures showed the decrease legumes portion and the increase grasses portion. Analysis of the sheep blood serum shows significant variations in P and Zn concentrations which can be related to diverse pasture botanical and mineral composition. Keywords: pasture, botanical composition, minerals, sheep, blood Introduction Quantity and quality of grazable material to pasturelands are affected by biotic and abiotic environmental factors including soil type, climatic regime, botanical composition and management (Antal and Huzsvai, 2007, Centeri et al., 2007, Knežević et al., 2007, Szabo et al., 2007, Szemán, 2007, Szentes et al., 2007, Szerdahely and Nagy, 2007). Of the climatic factors, soil moisture varying during the growing season is of great importance and limiting factor of the grassland yield (DeRose et al., 1995). Moisture and temperature changes in the course of the growing season affect changes of the grassland botanical composition and nutrients uptake (Karalić et al., 2007) i.e. forage quality that will be reflected in animals health and productivity (Antunović et al., 2001). High air temperature and low soil moisture reduce photosynthesis intensity (Balla et al., 2006). Soil nutrients uptake is both a specific species trait and genotype trait within the species (Baric et al., 2007). According to Minson (1990), a natural grassland pasture is characterized by concentration of Ca 0.2-0.53%, P 0.13-0.25%, Fe 200-500 mg kg-1, Cu 7-12 mg kg-1 and Zn 36 mg kg-1 DM. The investigation aimed to determine changes of botanical composition and concentration of Ca, P, Fe, Zn and Cu in the above ground biomass of the two rotation pastures in the pasturing period as well as their impact on the aforementioned concentration in the sheep blood. Materials and methods The trial was conducted on the lowlands pasture (97 m of the height above sea level ) with 2 rotations (Table 1) located at 45º43' NL and 17º51' EL with mean annual temperature of 11ºC and precipitation amount of 829 mm. Mass plant material (1 kg from both rotations ) was sampled prior each pasturing i.e. in 5 terms and 4 repetitions with 20 day interval (Table 2). The sample plants were divided into legumes, grasses and herbaceous plants (there were no grass-like species). Having been weighed, their portion in the total sample mass was determined (Šoštarić-Pisačić, 1962). The samples were dried at 105°C for 24 hours. P concentration in the plant material was determined</p><p id="Pg50">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Serum minerals (Ca, P, Fe, Zn, Cu) measurements were carried out with automatic analyzer Olympus AU 640. The values were processed by using the general linear model procedure of the STATISTICA (2005). Differences between the times of measures were statistically determined by using ANOVA test. Results and discussion All investigated traits of the grass cover considerable varied (P&lt;0.01) during the pasturing season on both rotation pastures, depending on the sampling time (Table 3). The highest legumes portion was determined on the pasture 1 at the beginning of the pasturing season whereas the pasture 2 was known for the highest grass portion. End of the season was characterized by the reduced legumes portion on both rotation pastures. Legumes portion was in a negative correlation with grasses portion on the pasture 2 (r=-0.866), especially on the pasture 1 (r=-0.961*). Reduction of the legumes portion due to increased grasses portion was, as a weather conditions consequence, also reported by other researchers (Sanderson et al., 2005). Significant positive correlations were obtained in the above ground bio-mass between legumes and Ca concentration portions on both rotation pastures (1: r=0.997**, 2: r=0.926*). This is in line with the fact that more Ca is up-taken by legumes than by grasses (Vukadinović and Lončarić, 1998). In the course of the whole season, regardless reducing trend, legumes portion on the pasture 1 was higher (likely due to better chemical soil characteristics, primarily pH value). Higher Ca and P concentrations on this pasture are results of the greater legumes portion. Also, more favourable pH soil respond brought about higher content of soil available P on the pasture 1. At the same time, considerable negative correlation between grasses portion and Ca concentration was noted only on the pasture 1 (r=-</p><p id="Pg51">VII.

Pasture 2 was known for positive correlations between plant material P concentration and legumes portion (0.926*) as well as between P concentration and Ca (r=0.956*). Fe concentration in the pasture 1 biomass was in significant correlation with Zn (r=0.981**) and Cu (r=0.994**) concentration.

Statistically significant changes were reported for P and Zn concentrations. This can be explained by differences in botanical composition and pasture mineral concentrations. Namely, it is known that P and Zn concentrations in animals’ blood depend on their concentration in feed (Antunović et al., 2002). Reasons for lower blood Ca concentrations can be the form the mineral was dominant in a plant, plant species and plant age while consumed.

SCHAAP 2 – Zsolt MOLNÁR 3 1 Research Institute for Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest, Hermann O. 15, tibor@rissac.hu 2 Department of Soil, Water and Environmental Science, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA 3 Ecological and Botanical Research Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Vácrátót, Botanical Garden Abstract: Soil and plant interrelations are strong enough in semi-natural solonetzic grasslands to permit the use of plant cover as predictor variable for soil salinity, sodicity and alkalinity. Four data sets were analysed which covered 4-7 plant association types, with sample sizes ranging from 20 to 120 and quadrat sizes 0.16 to 20 m 2 ; and correlation coefficients (R) of the multiple regression equations established between plant cover (independent or predictor variables) and soil (dependent or predicted variables) usually ranged from 0.65 to 0.80. Utilization of neural networks improved the prediction further and provided typically R values of 0.8. Plant cover observations consequently can be used to improve the precision of numerical maps of soil properties on solonetz soils and to delineate risk areas more precisely faster at a lower cost. Keywords: plant cover, solonetz soil, salinity, alkalinity, pH, sodicity, salt-affected soil Introduction The semi-natural vegetation of solonetz soils shows close correlation with the soil properties (Rajkai et al., 1988, Zalatnai and Körmöczi, 2004, Ristolainen et al., 2006, Tóth et al., 2006). Since it is much easier to recognize the vegetation type in situ than to determine chemical properties of soil in the laboratory, use of that correlation for predicting soil properties is desired. Such use of the plant - soil interrelationship can be applied effectively in soil survey, as suggested early by Ballenegger, 1929. Isoline maps compiled on the basis of numerical values are nowadays considered to be more informative than the polygon-maps, especially in the case of soils whose fertility is limited by a few, known factors. The empirical-stochastic relation between soil properties (dependent or predicted variable) and plant cover percents (independent or predictor variables) in a location can be established and utilized for the quantitative estimation of the soil property by regression analysis (Webster, 1989). The initiatives of European Union for protecting the soils by the Soil Thematic Strategy emphasizes the prevention of soil salinization as one of six soil threats. For efficient numerical mapping ideal tools are salinity maps with equal intervals. Our previous research showed that plant categories are suitable for distinguishing not very high levels of soil salinity both in the deepest and highest elevation zones. Our hypothesis was that plant species cover is suitable predictor of salinity in the most saline, intermediate elevation zones. Therefore, our objective was to establish multiple regression equations between soil properties and plant cover percents and to interpret the precision provided by the equations.</p><p id="Pg54">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1448 Materials and methods We evaluated published data of Bodrogközy (1965) and Magyar (1928) and two data sets of ours. All the observations have been made in the north-eastern part of the Great Hungarian Plain, in the regions of Hortobágy and Nagykunság In the calculation of regression equations, those plant species were selected as independent variables which were dominant in the coenological quadrats. As dependent variable of the regression equation, ecologically important variables, which are related to salinization, sodification and alkalization, were selected. All plant cover data, that is all independent variables have been transformed with logit (ln x/(100-x)), but the transformation is not indicated in the equations. The method of variable selection in the multiple regression analysis was stepwise selection. Results and discussion In our study site at Kisszeg, Hortobágy the capacity of the vegetation (associations as described by Molnár and Borhidi, 2003) to predict distinct ranges of was very much limited compared to the results of Tóth and Kertész, 1996, who worked in a more saltaffected area. Our special focus now is on the information provided by the cover of indivial plant species. Table 1 summarizes the result of the regression equations and neural networks. In this table only those plants are indicated which were selected to be included in the multiple regression equations by the stepwise selection method. The studied cases covered 4-7 solonetzic grassland associations. The number of quadrats fell between 20 and 120, the size of quadrat changed between 0.16 and 20 m2. The depth of sampling ranged from 0-3 to 30-40 cm. The plant cover was expressed as rating from 1 to 5 (Bodrogközy, 1965) and with percents in the case of other data sets. All four cases covered the plant associations of the microerosional complex "padkásszik", (Tóth and Rajkai, 1994), that is the plant associations Puccinellietum limosae - Camphorosmetum annuae - Artemisio-Festucetum pseudovinae, therefore the most efficient predictor plant covers were the same in each case. These were the plants, which tolerate the highest surface soil salt concentration and pH, the Camphorosma annua (CAM). and Puccinellia limosa (PUC). The total number of plants occurring in the quadrats (SNO) and the total plant cover (TOCO) were also often included in the regression equations. The value of the multiple correlation coefficients fell mostly in the range of 0.65-0.80, and this indicated that the equations can be used for the estimation of soil properties, contrary to that the distribution of the variables is often non-normal. For the study in which the largest number of observations was available, the “Padkásszik” case study, there was a further analysis with combined artificial neural network and bootstrap as described by Efron and Tibshirani (1993), since neural networks can find complex relations between the input data and output parameters. Conclusions When isoline map of properties of solonetz soils is prepared, the number of soil sampling points required to meet a prefixed precision can be reduced if the information provided by plant cover data is utilized.

Cereal Research Communications 1450 coupled with plant coenological survey. If the soil properties determined in the sampling points and the cover percents of the plant species show strongly significant multiple regression equations, then the values of soil properties can be estimated in the remaining points with multiple regression equations. The calculated multiple regression equations and neural network algorithms proved to be not comprehensive. It means that the values of regression coefficients probably depend on the range of plant associations covered, season of year, location, etc., therefore the equations intended for mapping of soil properties should be calculated for every mapping situation separately (Tóth and Rajkai, 1994). Two favourable conditions were noted that improved the correlation coefficient of the multiple regression equations, such as the utilization of comprehensive survey (this way covering wide range of soil salinity as shown in Table 1) as in the case of Bodrogközy, (1965) and the previous averaging of the plant cover percents (“Nagykunság” data set). Since the three basic chemical characteristics of solonetz soils, that is salinity, sodicity and alkalinity are very closely correlated, there was very similar precision obtained during their prediction. Based on the proven precision of the algorithms, the soil-plant interrelations can be made operative and the techniques shown can be incorporated in the routine soil mapping and risk area identification of solonetzic areas.

Climate parameters for time horizon 2010, which were used as one of the input data sets to modelling, were adapted by climate scenarios CCCM2000 (Canadian Centre for climate modelling and analysis) and GISS98 (Goddard Institute for Space Studies). The selected hydrological balance members were assessed for the homogenous soil profile and hydrophysical characteristics were determined as averages from measured hydrophysical properties of the soil profile. Keywords: soil water regime, climate scenarios, soil water storage, hydrological balance Introduction In the last decade, the global climate change has been observed influencing the water regime of various kinds of soils. The main problem is warming of the ground atmospheric layer as a result of accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols (primarily carbon dioxide CO2) in the atmosphere produced by anthropogenic activity. Increasing of these gasses in the atmosphere causes some change of climatic parameters and components which influence the hydrological balance. At present many scientists are researching the impact of this change to various areas of social-economical spheres and natural environment and create models and procedures for prognosis or assumptions of these changes (Farkas, et al., 2005, Várallyay, 2006, Jolánkai et al., 2007, Tóth et al., 2006, Šútor, 2006, Šútor and Gomboš, 2006, Tesař et al., 2007, Mészároš and Miklánek, 2006). The aim of this paper was to determine the possible members of hydrological balance in time horizons 2010 at the lowlands locality by simulation in the model GLOBAL using climatic scenarios GISS98 and CCCM2000 as selected meteorological parameters. Materials and methods Selected locality, Bodiky, lies at south Slovakia in a region named Zitny ostrov. It is situated on the inundating locality of the Danube River. In this locality is a forest ecosystem with poplar vegetation. The soil is clay – sand and at a depth of 120 centimetres it is replaced by only sand. In the depth of 150 cm it is gravel subsoil. Hydro-physical parameters for this locality have been determined in the soil samples (their capacity was 100 centimetres cubic), which have been taken away to a place of monitoring. Monograph (Šútor and Štekauerová, 2000) generalised these parameters. The long-term monitoring of some hydrological balance members is not proceeding in Slovakia. The short-term observed periods are not representative for assessment of meteorological phenomena impact to the soil water regime. Based on this reason the results using mathematical modelling are using assessment of water storage in the soil and other hydrological balance members. The mathematical model GLOBAL created by workers from the Institute of Hydrology, Bratislava (Majerčák and Novák, 1994) is using a numerical simulation of climate change on the impact to the soil water storage.</p><p id="Pg58">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Newly developed scenarios of climatic change were used for creation of daily data sets of selected meteorological parameters. These data sets were used as the inputs to the model, GLOBAL, for simulation of hydrological balance members in the time horizon 2010. The meteorological inputs consisted of the daily precipitation amount, the daily temperature averages, the daily amount of sunshine duration, the daily values of vapour pressure, and the daily mean wind velocity. Results and discussion The values of soil water storage were calculated for four soil profiles (0-30 cm, 31-60 cm, 61-90 cm and 91-150 cm) and for the whole soil profile 0-150 cm for a reference period and for the year 2010 in vegetation period (April to October). Furthermore, the values of reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0), crop evapotranspiration under standard conditions (ETp), transpiration (T0, Tp), evaporation (E0, Ep) and interception (Iin) were calculated. The percentage differences of long-term averages of these characteristics calculated between values adapted by scenario GISS98 and CCCM2000 for time horizon 2010 and values calculated for reference period 1955-84 are shown in tables 1 and 2.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1455 EVALUATION OF WATER USE EFFICIENCY IN INTENSIVE SWEET PEPPER FIELD CULTIVATION Attila OMBÓDI 1 – Judit HOREL 1 – Tamás KASSAI 1 1 Institute of Horticultural Technology, Faculty of Environmental and Agricultural Sciences, Szent István University, H-2103 Páter K. str. 1. Gödöllő Hungary, ombodi.attila@mkk.szie.hu Abstract: Intensive field cultivation of sweet pepper applying drip irrigation, fertigation and plastic mulch can be an effective tool for optimizing irrigation water use for this very water demanding crop. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of mulched raised bed cultivation method on water use efficiency (WUE) and to evaluate the WUE of intensive sweet pepper field cultivation among semiarid conditions. It was found that cultivation on mulched raised bed increased WUE by 23-59% compared to unmulched level ground growing method. Based on the data of five years of experiments with intensive field cultivation, in an average year WUE for a sweet Hungarian yellow wax type cultivar was found to be 16-19 kg m -3 , a 60 to 90% increase compared to the usual value for conventional cultivation method. Keywords: WUE, sweet pepper, plastic mulch, raised bed, drip irrigation Introduction Forced by the harsh competition on the European vegetable market intensive field cultivation of sweet pepper is applied at an increasing rate in Hungary. Furthermore, this growing method also enables growers to cope at least partly with the challenges of global warming, which will turn the climate more changeable and unpredictable (Mikulec and Stehlová, 2006; Várallyay, 2006). Application of drip irrigation, fertigation and plastic mulch covered raised beds and use of hybrids are the most characteristic elements of this technology. It was reported that drip irrigation increased the water use efficiency (WUE) of field grown bell pepper by an average of 38% in a three-year study (High Rise Farms Report, 1996). By decreasing soil evaporation, application of plastic mulch also results in more efficient use of water (Lamont, 1993). Thus the intensive cultivation method can increase WUE considerably. This effect is especially important for the production of sweet pepper under the semiarid climate of Hungary, because this crop is one of the most water demanding vegetables. According to Hungarian experience WUE of conventional field cultivation of Hungarian yellow wax type pepper is around 10 kg m-3 (Zatykó and Terbe, 2006). Under arid conditions WUE of sweet pepper types harvested in biologically ripen stage could be as low as 3-7 kg m-3 (Dagdalen et al., 2004; Sezen et al., 2006), while under near optimal greenhouse conditions it can rise to 17-26 kg m-3 (Fernandez et al., 2005). The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of mulched raised bed on WUE of sweet pepper and to evaluate the WUE of intensive field sweet pepper cultivation among semiarid conditions based on the data of five year of experiments. Materials and methods Between 2001 and 2005 small-plot sweet pepper field experiments were conducted in northern Hungary at Gödöllő (47°61’N, 19°32’ E), with soil classified as Cambisol (pH = 7.5, organic matter content = 1.65%, loamy sand soil). Climatic conditions during the growing seasons are shown in Table 1. Precipitation was measured daily with an obrometer. Each year transplants were planted in the middle of May at a density of 5.7</p><p id="Pg62">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1456 plants m-2, the experiments were finished in early October. Irrigation was carried out through drip irrigation lines with 0.1 m emitter spacing. Time of irrigations and fertigations was determined by soil matrix potential monitored by tensiometers. The average amount of an irrigation was 3 mm. Amounts of irrigation water used during the experiments are shown in Table 1. Compound fertilizers were applied with drip fertigation at a rate corresponding to 30 g m-2 N in 2001-2002, and 20 g m-2 in 20032005. Unmulched level ground growing method was compared to cultivation on black plastic mulch (0.12 mm thick, from Helioplast, Tiszaújváros, Hungary) covered raised bed in 2001-2003. For this experiment a tomato shaped sweet pepper hybrid called Pritavit was used, which is harvested in biologically mature stage. Raised beds were 0.9 m wide at the base and 0.2 m high. Experimental design was a complete block, treatments were replicated four times, one replication comprised 40 plants. Table 1.

Parameters of drip lines, plastic mulch, raised bed and experimental design was in correspondence with the experiments described before, except that one plot comprised 20 plants. A sweet Hungarian yellow wax type hybrid called Cecil, which is harvested at a full-size unripe stage, was used in these experiments. WUE (kg m-3) was calculated as marketable yield (kg m-2) divided by an amount of water (m3 m-2). In this study three kinds of WUE are used. WUEtotal is based on the sum of seasonal precipitation and irrigation, WUEeff is based on the sum of effective precipitation and irrigation, while IWUE is based solely on the irrigation water use. Based on decades of experience with this experimental site (Helyes and Varga, 1993) and considering the crop and the cultivation method daily amount between 3 and 30 mm was considered as effective precipitaion. MS Excel software was used for statistical analysis. Data on mulch experiments were analysed by paired t-test, while one-way ANOVA was used for comparing the results of the different years of the experiments using cultivar Cecil.</p><p id="Pg63">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1457 Results and discussion Results of the mulched, raised bed experiments (Table 2.) proved that this technological element improves WUE significantly. In case of all three years WUEs were higher for the mulched raised bed treatment than that for the traditional unmulched level-ground cultivation method. This result can be explained by two factors. One of them is the 2229% less irrigation water use (Table 1.) caused by the evaporation decreasing effect of plastic mulch. The higher was the average air temperature, the bigger was the relative difference in the water use between the two treatments (Table 1.). The other cause is the higher yield for the mulched treatments (Table 2.) caused mainly by the more favourable soil temperature conditions (Locher et al., 2005). Rate of increase in WUEs ranged between 23 and 59%. The biggest differences were evolved for the year 2002, and for IWUE. Comparing the three years it was concluded that the lower was the precipitation (Table 1.) the higher were the WUEtotal and the WUEeff values (Table 2.), while less precipitation resulted more irrigation water use, and thus lower IWUE. WUEtotal values for the unmulched, level-ground treatments were similar to those reported by Dagdalen et al. (2004) and Sezen et al. (2006). Table 2. Yield and water use efficiency for cv.

WUE total and WUEeff values were significantly the lowest for the year 2001. This result can be explained by the relatively low yield in that year caused by a virus damage and a hail. As the much higher WUEeff value shows, the low WUEtotal for the year 2005 was evolved becuase of four summer downpours each producing more than 60 mm rain. For the middle three years (2002-2004) WUEtotal were between 16 and 19 kg m -3 (Table 3.), which is a 60-90% increase compared to the conventional cultivation. Comparing the three different WUEs it is well shown in Table 3., that if the data of 2001 are disregarded WUEeff values are the most uniform for the remaining four years. This verifies the concept of effective precipitation and WUEeff.</p><p id="Pg64">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1458 Table 3. Yield and water use efficiency for cv.

This increase was comprised from higher yield, more efficient irrigation water use of the drip irrigation method and soil evaporation decreasing effect of plastic mulching.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1459 INFLUENCE OF SOIL PH ON ALFALFA DRY MATTER AND PROTEIN YIELD Svetislav POPOVIC 1 – Marijana TUCAK 1 – Tihomir CUPIC 1 – Branimir SIMIC 2 1 Department of Forage Crops Breeding and Genetics , 2 Department for Seed Production and Processing, Agricultural Institute Osijek, Juzno predgradje 17, 31000 Osijek, Croatia, e-mail: svetislav.popovic@poljinos.hr Abstract: Alfalfa is the most important forage legume at cultivated fields. In the Republic of Croatia sown areas by alfalfa are limited primarily with soil conditions i.e. by low soil pH reactions. The aim of this study was testing of deegres of soil and germplasm influences on dry matter yield (DMY) and protein yield (PY) of alfalfa under conditions of the Eastern Croatia. The experiment was conducted on Osijek eutric cambisol (pH in KCl = 6.41) and Petrijevci loessive-pseudogley (pH in KCl = 3.88), respectively. Twelve alfalfa germplasm (eight domestic and two foreign origin; two domestic newly bred populations) were tested for two growing seasons (2002 and 2003, total 9 cuts). In the study we found for 31% lower DMY and for 43% lower PY at acid soil. Germplasm Os-88, Elena, Du Puits and newly bred population PCP had the highest DMY and PY at both soil types. We assume that these materials have certain level of tolerance to grow at soils with low pH values. Keywords: alfalfa, pH, dry matter, protein, yield Introduction Alfalfa is one of the most important protein sources for nutrition of livestock (Macesic et al., 2007). Full capacity of production (yield, quality) is generally obtained at deep, qualitative soils with neutral soil pH reaction. Low soil pH and deficiency of soil nutrients decrease yield, increase unfavourable competitive relationships with weeds and shorten lifetime. Soil acidity directly correlated to reduction of aboveground and root development and nodulation, which drop in occurrence when the soil pH is decreases below 5.1 as are result is hardly inhibited living condition of several microorganisms (Olah Zsuposne, 2007). Problem of production at acid soils is successfully solved for corn, sorghum, Festuca arrundinaceae, Triticum aestivum and white clover (Hopkins et al., 2004). A possibility to establish alfalfa at acid soils is frequently studied problem in the world. Two different options to overcome the problem are usually proposed: breeding, i.e. creating of germplasm tolerant to lower soil pH (Voigt and Stoley, 2004) and application of liming (Popovic et al., 2007). Considerable role of genotype on abiotic stress including also low pH has been found by testing of other field crops, especially maize (Brkic et al., 2004; Kovacevic et al., 2004; Vragolovic et al., 2007). The aim of this study was testing of degrees of soil and germplasm influences on dry matter yield (DMY) and protein yield (PY) of alfalfa under conditions of the Eastern Croatia. Materials and methods The field experiment, soil and weather characteristics Twelve alfalfa germplasm (eight domestic and two foreign origin; two domestic newly bred populations) were grown on two soils differing in chemical properties for two growing seasons (2002 and 2003) under environmental conditions of the eastern Croatia (Table 1). Two newly bred populations (Agricultural Institute Osijek): PCP was created after several cycles of recurrent selection at acid soil type, and PCO population after</p><p id="Pg66">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1460 several cycles of recurrent selection at neutral soil type. The experiment was conducted on Osijek eutric cambisol (pH in KCl = 6.41) and Petrijevci loessive-pseudogley (pH in KCl = 3.88), respectively. The experiments have been mutually air-distanced 20 km. The field trials were established as randomised block design with 4 replicates (exp. Plot 10 m2). Hand sowing was done at row distance of 20 cm and with 15 kg ha-1 of seeding rate. Total 9 cuts (4 for 2002 and 5 for 2003) were done by Hege 212 fodder harvest machine. During two tested growing seasons weather conditions (precipitation and mean air-temp. for April-Sept. period) were not in accordance with long-term (LTM: Osijek 1961-1990) values: 461 mm and 18.2 oC, 227 mm and 19.6 oC, 370 mm and 17.6 oC, for 2002, 2003 and LTM, respectively. For this reason, the data of dry matter and protein yields were calculated as 2-year means in level of soil and cultivar influences. Chemical and statistical analysis Prior to each cutting, samples for dry matter content were taken and dried at 105 oC for 24 hours. In addition, samples for protein content were taken and dried at the air temperature. Dry matter yield (DMY) was calculated from green mass yield and dry matter content data. Protein yield (PY) was calculated from DMY and protein content data (determination according to Wendee - Kjeltec autosampler 1035 Tecator). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on data collected, using SAS 8. software (SAS Institute, 2003). Significance of differences was tested by LSD as two-factorial experiment (soil and genotype as the factor A and the factor B, respectively). To identify cultivars stabile in yield under different conditions of production, Francis and Kannenberg (1978) method of genotype grouping was performed. Results and discussion DMY is a complex trait on which expression besides genetic potential of cultivar, influence non-genetic parameters as: phenological growth phase in the cutting time and agro-ecological growth conditions (weather and soil). In our investigation, time of alfalfa cutting corresponded to phenological phase of blooming to beginning of flowering, which is most favourable growth phase for obtaining the optimum ratio between amount of yield and quality and protein content above 20% in dry matter. In general, high DMY of investigated germplasm were found (Table 1). Results, especially those from neutral soil, are similar to those reported by Ates and Tekeli (2004). Average yields of investigated materials were significantly different across locations due to soil acidity. Differences in DMY of alfalfa at acid and neutral soils were recorded by Caddel et al. (2004). They have demonstrated that the DMY of alfalfa is almost double higher in neutral compared to acid soil (10.0 and 5.4 t ha-1 respectively). Significant differences among tested germplasm in DMY and stability at two soils were found (Figure 1). High and stabile yield in different environments obtained newly bred PCP population, Os-88, Elena, Du Puits and Posavina cultivars (group I). Stela cultivar (group II) had high DMY and high variability. Group III contained newly bred PCO population, which had low DMY and low variability. Group IV included germplasm with low DMY and high variability of trait. From the farmer’s point of view, PY per area unit is the final goal of alfalfa production.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1463 RELATIONS OF PH AND MINERAL COMPOSITION IN SALTAFFECTED LACUSTRINE PROFILES Gábor BOZSÓ 1 – Elemér PÁL-MOLNÁR 1 – Magdolna HETÉNYI 1 1 Department of Mineralogy, Geochemistry and Petrology, Faculty of Science and Informatics, University of Szeged; H-6722, Szeged, Egyetem u. 2-6.; e-mail:bozso.gabor@geo.u-szeged.hu Abstract: Our research aims at the complex geochemical study of the solid phase of salt-affected profiles, originating from natural lakes and lakes under anthropogenic use. This paper presents the results of pH and clay mineral XRD analyses performed on sediment profiles taken from four sites, two of which operate as a hatchery. It has been proved that pH in saline areas is primarily determined by post-sedimentation processes, such as the water household, the salt content and the mineral composition of sediment. Keywords: pH, heavy metal, salt-effected lake sediments, Fehér-Lake at Szeged, Hungary Introduction In accordance with the intensification of arid processes and weather extremities related to climate change, the area of saline territories is increasing, since one of the main prerequisite of salinization processes is the highly fluctuating but annually low precipitation (Ligetváry et al., 2006). The extent of saline territories in the World is 397.1 Mha (FAO, 2003), which is 3.1% of the total area of cultivated lands. The area of lands affected by secondary salinization, arising from agricultural irrigation is 76.3 Mha (Bridges and Oldeman, 1999). In Hungary the proportion of potentially saline territories within agricultural lands is 36.6 % (~17000 km2), being significantly higher than the World average. (Várallyay et al., 2007). Although in Hungary an extensive scientific research work has been made on salinization (Szendrei and Tóth, 2006), there is fairly little information on the behaviour of trace elements in a saline environment (PálMolnár and Bozsó, 2006). Nevertheless, from an agricultural, food safety or environmental aspect it is a worldwide and immensely important question how different trace elements, being contaminants at the same time, act within the soil-plant-animalhuman system (Prasad, 2004; Stehlová, 2007; Farooq and Azam, 2007). As a matter of salinization processes the adsorptive-desorptive character of trace elements on arable lands can alter along with their quantity entering the food chain. Therefore, it seems highly desirable to get the necessary information on geochemical processes determining the adsorption and mobility of trace elements in a saline environment. The major aim of the research is to investigate the amount and distribution of trace elements in the solid phase of sediment profiles with significant annual water exchange, representing areas affected primarily either by natural or anthropogenic processes. A further goal is to study environmental geochemical parameters which determine the distribution of trace elements and adsorption-desorption mechanisms. This study presents the results of pH and clay mineral analyses, which are highly necessary for the understanding of trace element distribution. Materials and methods The Fehér Lake, located north of Szeged (Hungary) proved to be an ideal site to achieve the goals determined above. The 14 km2 lake system is located in the Kiskunság National Park and drains the water of a 200 km2 territory. It is mostly used for intensive fish breeding, though it also incorporates some relatively untouched close to natural</p><p id="Pg70">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1464 areas. In order to interpret correctly the results of the investigation it is important to note that the water loss of the lakes is recharged through a canal from the Tisza, located 1.5 km off the territory (Tasnádi, 1997). Samplings were made in the spring of 2007 at four locations with different hydrological character and type of water management (Fig. 1). Description of the sampling points: 1. Located at the most natural part of the lake system, maintained by the Kiskunság National Park. It is inundated biennially. In the first year the operational water level is 50 cm, in the second year it is desiccated and a 1-2 m high reed, reed mace vegetation is let to develop. 2. The closest lake to human activities. It is filled up every year in April to a 11.5 m water level, and drained off in October. During the March-April period a 10-20 cm high vegetation can grow. 3. The closest lake to the Tisza, which is the source of recharge. The lake is inundated almost for the whole year, it is drained off only for a month in April, during which no vegetation can develop. 4. The control area, a saline tussocky meadow. It is the farthest from human activities. It is waterlogged during the whole year. At spring for 1-2 months the territory is entirely covered by water. At each locations a sediment core 10 cm in diameter, 4 m in depth was taken. The 4 m cores were dissected into 5 cm units, which were dried for 3 weeks under room temperature. Subsequently, the samples were ground to a 100 μm grain size. The pH of the samples was measured following the MSZ 21470-2:1981 Hungarian patent, from a 1:2.5 ratio soil-1N KCl suspension. The identification of clay minerals was made with the X-ray diffractional (XRD) method, the fraction below 2 μm was applied. Images were made with a DRON-UM type diffractometer from a 3° to 63° 2θ angle range. The Cu radiation source was operated with a LiF monochromator, using a 35 kV exciting potential and a 20 mA anode current. Results and discussion The variation of pH with depth in the four studied profiles is shown in Fig. 3. Although values fell to the characteristic range of saline soils, significant differences were observed in relation with land use and depth. The least alkaline samples originate from Lake 2 (Profile 2) and the intact control area (Profile 4), covered by permanent vegetation. The average pH of these two profiles was 7.8. The average pH of Profiles 1 and 3, located at the two hatcheries, was 0.5 higher, assumable due to the great volume of recharge and the intensive summer period evaporation. The vertical variation of pH was significant in case of each site. Neutral or lower pH was measured only in case of the upper 50 cm section of Profile 4, possibly due to leaching processes, which concentrate salts below this level. Leaching can occur since vegetation cover inhibits intensive evaporation, which could anyway transport salts upward.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1465 cm in Profile 4 pH had an almost constant, 7.8 value. In terms of Profile 2 pH was remarkably even (σ = 0.12), and increased insignificantly with depth. One reason for the above is that during the annual drought period 10-20 cm deep cracks develop in the top layer of the sediment and as a result salts can mix, thus no accumulation zone can develop below. Another factor is the alternation of evaporation and inundation periods, due to which mobile minerals and elements are in a continuous move, thus the upper part of the profile is homogenized constantly. In case of Profile 1 and 3 the change of pH with depth was very similar. The maximum was measured at 60 cm (pH=8.5-9), and it decreased to the average value (pH=8) only in strata below 300 cm. Thus, it seems that salts resulting alkalinity accumulate at a 60 cm depth. The reason for accumulation is the low degree of evaporation. This can be explained by a shortened dry period in case of Lake 3, and a significant vegetation cover in case of Lake 1. Figure 2. pH values of the profiles The results of clay mineral analyses made in Profile 2 and 4 can be seen in Fig. 3. At a 50 cm depth in Profile 4 an accumulation can be identified, which refer to fine grained aleurolite deposition. Reaching down to a depth of 100 cm the amount of clay minerals decreases to its minimum, indicating the dominance of the arenaceous fraction. Albeit, further grain size analyses are necessary to assess this phenomenon. In Profile 2 the distribution of clay minerals is rather chaotic. This is in relation with dry period upper zone mixing processes affecting pH distribution as well. Consequently, no significant correlation was observed between clay mineral content and pH, thus the development of mineral composition is not largely affected by pH. Conclusions Based on our measurements, the pH of saline areas is determined by post-sedimentation processes, and primarily influenced by the water household, the salt content and the mineral composition of the sediment.

J. Strossmayer in Osijek, Faculty of Agriculture, Trg Sv. Trojstva 3, HR-31000 Osijek, Croatia Abstract: Four domestic winter wheat varieties (Superzitarka, Zitarka, Monika and Srpanjka) were grown under field conditions (Osijek hydromeliorated hypoglay) in the period 2001-2004. Presowing N (PS-N) was applied in four rates (40, 70, 100 and 130 kg N ha -1 ). Top-dressing N (TD-N) was applied in the amounts (kg N ha -1 ) 0 (without TD), 40 (TD in tillering), 95 (tillering + stem elongation) and 120 (tillering + stem elongation + before shutting). Differences of yields among the years were in the ranges from 7.50 to 8.40 t ha 1 and proteins from 13.4% to 14.2%. Yield differences among the varieties (4-year means) were in the range from 5.57 t ha -1 to 9.40 t ha -1 . Srpanjka had significantly the highest yield for all four tested years (mean 9.40 t ha -1 ), while yield of the last-ranged Monika was for 41% lower (mean 5.57 t ha-1). However, the highest yield of Srpanjka had significant lowest grain protein (means 13.4% and 13.8%, for Srpanjka and remaining three varieties). PS-N resulted by non-significant yield differences among the treatments (4-year means in range from 7.91 to 7.99 t ha -1 ). Also, wheat yields were independent on TD-N fertilization (4-year means 7.97 and 8.00 t ha -1 ). We presume that high fertility of the soil could be responsible for low response of wheat to N. However, for two growing seasons (2001 and 2002) application of the highest PS-N rate influenced significantly on increase of grain protein compared to the lowest N rate. Especially high influences were found for 2001 (13.1 % and 13.9% protein, for 40 and 130 kg N ha -1 , respectively). TD-N influenced also on protein contents (13.5 and 14.0%, for 0 and 120 kg N ha -1 , respectively). Keywords: grain yield, nitrogen fertilization, protein content, wheat varieties Introduction Nitrogen (N) is an element with considerably influences on grain yield and protein contents in wheat (Zugec et al. 1987; Hornok et al., 2006; Horvat et al. 2006; Jolankai et al. 2006). Also, heredity factors have important role in yield formation and N management (Baric et al. 2007). Abiotic stress (especially temperature and water regime) also has influences on protein content and yield (Alcoz et al. 1993; Rengel 2005; Hornok et al. 2006; Balogh et al. 2006 Hnilicka et al. 2007; Bertic et al. 2007). The objective of this study was testing response of four wheat cultivars to presowing and top-dressing N fertilization under conditions of relative fertile soil of eastern Croatia. Material and methods Four domestic winter wheat varieties (Superzitarka, Zitarka, Monika and Srpanjka - developed in Agricultural Institute in Osijek) were grown under field conditions (Osijek hydromeliorated hypoglay, with good fertility status: pH in 1nKCl = 6.61-7.29; pH in H2O = 7.31.-7,88; organic matter = 1.47-2.11%; AL-soluble P2O5 and K2O = from 202 to 309 and from 278 to 366 mg kg-1, respectively, Table 1) in four growing seasons (year of harvesting: 2000-2004). The trials were set up according to split-split plot randomized block design in 4 replicates (the factor A = variety; the sub-factor B = presowing N fertilization; the sub-sub-factor C = top-dressing N fertilization: size of basic plot 45 m2). Presowing N (PS-N) was applied in four rates (40, 70, 100 and 130 kg</p><p id="Pg74">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1468 N ha-1). Top-dressing N (TD-N) was added as calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN: 27% N) in the amounts (kg N ha-1) 0 (without TD), 40 (TD in tillering), 40+55 (tillering + stem elongation), 40+55+25 (tillering + stem elongation + before shutting). Phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) were added by presowing fertilization in constant amounts (kg ha-1) 105 P2O5 + 105 K2O, respectively. Grain yield were calculating on the basis of 87% of dry matter. Protein content was measured by NIT procedure (Infratec 1241, Foss Tecator). Basic meteorological data for investigated years and long term period were done in Table 2 (Osijek Weather Bureau). The statistic analyses for each year separate were done by analysis of variance using PC applications Microsoft Excel and Stat Soft Statistic. Table 1.

For example, differences among years were in the ranges from 7.50 to 8.40 t ha-1 and from 13.4% to 14.2%, for yield and protein content, respectively. The highest yields were found under drought conditions of 2003 (12% higher than in 2002), probably because of diseases absences. Based on our experiences, the higher yields of wheat under conditions of the eastern Croatia are in some connection with the lower precipitation and the higher temperatures, especially in the spring period (Josipovic et al., 2005). However, protein contents in wheat grain were similar to previous two years (13.4%, 13.7 and 13.7%, for 2001, 2002 and 2003,</p><p id="Pg75">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1469 respectively). In 2004 protein contents was for 0.6% higher than mean of previous years (14.2% and 13.6%, respectively). The higher protein contents in 2004 could be in connection with high water supply (150 mm precipitation oversupply). Similar observation reported Drezner et al. (2006). Yield differences among the varieties (4year means) were in the range from 5.57 t ha-1 to 9.40 t ha-1. With that regard, Srpanjka had significantly the highest yields for all four tested years and they were higher for 53% (2001), 40% (2002), 34% (2003) and 44% (2004) compared to the lowest-yielding Monika. However, the highest yield of Srpanjka was in connection with the significant lowest grain protein content (4-year mean 13.4%) and it was for 0.6% lower than in Žitarka. PS-N resulted by non-significant yield differences among the treatments (4year means in range from 7.91 to 7.99 t ha-1, for 130 and 70 kg N ha-1, respectively). However, for two growing seasons (2001 and 2002) application of the highest PN-N rate influenced significantly on increase of grain protein contents compared to the lowest N rate. Especially high influences were found for 2001 (13.1% and 13.9% protein, for 40 and 130 kg N ha-1, respectively). Wheat yields were independent on TDN in all four tested years (4-year means 7.97 and 8.00 t ha-1, 13.5% and 14.0% for the treatment 0 and 120 kg N ha-1, respectively). However, protein contents were significantly increased by using the higher rates of TD-N (13.5 and 14.0%, for 0 and 120 kg N ha-1, respectively, Table 3). Our findings are in agreement with results of Jolankai et al. (2006) and Horvat et al. (2006) which concluded with the rise of N fertilizer rates protein content of wheat increased significantly even at the highest level of application. Table 3.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1471 ALTERNATIVE METHOD TO SOIL WATER INFILTRATION EXPERIMENT Vlasta ŠTEKAUEROVÁ – Július ŠÚTOR Institute of Hydrology, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia Abstract: The method of base characteristics quantification of water infiltration into soil profile through soil surface was developed. The water infiltration base characteristics are rate of infiltration v = v(t) and cumulative infiltration i = i(t). The method is based on numerical simulation of water infiltration to soil by mathematical model. The mathematical model was modified to calculate water infiltration into soil of different kind of soil. This method substitute experimental methods used in the field. Direct methods of their estimation are infiltration experiment, two-cylinders method, and etc.. Experimental methods are very time consuming and demanding. Analytical functions v = v(t) and i = i(t) can be used to calculate the time of pool production. It is very important characteristic using in agricultural for example at the design of irrigation or at the local flooding. The method was verified in natural conditions. In following paper is presented method of numerical simulation of water infiltration into soil by mathematical model as alternative method. Keywords: cumulative infiltration, two-cylinders method, infiltration experiment, mathematical model Introduction The term infiltration in hydrology denotes the entry of water into the soil common through its soil surface. In hydrology, the infiltration of water into different kind of soil from rain is the most interesting (Gomboš, 2007; Šútor and Gomboš, 2006). The infiltration process separates rain into two parts. One part flows within the soil, supplies the roots of vegetation and may recharge ground water or evapotranspirate (Tesař et al., 2007; Mészároš and Miklánek, 2006). The other part that does not penetrate through the soil surface is responsible for surface runoff (Holko et al., 2006; Sebín et al., 2007). Infiltration is therefore a pivotal point within the hydrological cycle. Unsteady infiltration is the dominant process in natural. There are two types unsteady infiltrations: when infiltration occurs under natural rainfall (Neuman’s boundary condition) and when the soil surface is instantaneously and excessive flooded by water (Dirichlet’s boundary condition). The last infiltration does not occur in natural conditions very often but it can be seeing during infiltration test performed with a twocylinders method. Two very important characteristics - cumulative infiltration i = f(t) and velocity of infiltration v = f(t) where t is time - can be obtained by experimental method using two-cylinders method or mathematical model. The last method is simpler then experimental methods. These characteristics can be used to calculate the time of flood production. It is very important characteristic using in agricultural for example at the design of irrigation or at the local flooding (Velísková, 2006) and in relation with global changes (Farkas et al., 2005; Stehlová, 2007; Mikulec and Stehlová, 2006; Várallyay, 2006, Jolánkai et al., 2007, Tóth et al., 2006). Materials and methods During the infiltration test in the field with two-cylinders method soil surface is continuously flooded with a negligibly small depth of water at time t  0 and the surface soil will be water-saturated. Before the soil surface is flooded, the value of soil water content of soil surface equals value of initial soil water content. It is assumed that soil profile is homogeneous.</p><p id="Pg78">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1472 The infiltration rate is measured by observing the decreasing water level within the inner cylinder. The outer cylinder serves as hydraulic buffer zone to minimize lateral flow below the inner cylinder. The primary data are measured values of cumulative infiltration i expressed usually in (cm) as a function of time i = f(t). The values represent the total amount of water infiltrated through the soil surface during infiltration test. The other infiltration characteristic is infiltration rate v = di/dt. A typical i = i(t) and v = v(t) relationships are on Fig. 1. Figure 1. Time dependence of the cumulative infiltration i and of the infiltration rate v, KS is saturated hydraulic conductivity When the base infiltration characteristic are obtained by mathematical model the one dimensional vertical water flow during infiltration in soil can be described by Richard’s equation (1) for homogeneous and isothermal conditions:     z hk z h hk zt h hC www w w                )( (1) where C(hw) – water capacity function (m -1), k(hw) – unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (m s-1), hw – soil moisture potential (m), z – vertical (positive upward) coordinate with z = 0 at the soil surface (m), and t – time (s). The one dimensional finite differences (adapted Crank – Nicholson method) numerical model based on Richard‘s equation was developed for homogeneous soil (Štekauerová, 1995) and later was modified for layered soil profile. The last mathematical model can also be used to simulate of water infiltration into soil for conditions of infiltration test using two-cylinders method. The hydrophysical characteristics of soil as input data to model were measured by experimental methods. The main drying soil water retention curves were measured by overpressure soil moisture equipment in soil every 20 cm under soil surface, and the values of saturated soil hydraulic conductivity were measured by method of falling head. The points of retention curve were approximated by method of van Genuchten (1980). The boundary and initial conditions were used in accordance with the process running in the field conditions. t = 0 z &gt; 0 hw (z) = hwo (z) (2a) t &gt; 0 z = 0 v = vin = k(hw) [δhw/δz + 1] (2b) t &gt; 0 z = L hwL = hw (L) (2c) where L is consider depth of soil profile and v is infiltration rate.</p><p id="Pg79">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1473 Distribution of the soil moisture potential hw(z) at time t = 0 was measured at the beginning of the experiment. Input of water into soil is controlled by condition (2b). The value of soil moisture potential on soil surface will be described by equation (3) in every time. hwo =(hw1) + Δz [1 – vin / k(hwo)] (3) Values of relation vin /k(hwo) are critical. If soil surface is very dry, the value of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k(hwo) of soil surface is very small. If soil surface is saturated by water (saturated state, hwo=0), the value of k(hwo) is equal the value of saturated hydraulic conductivity KS as in the case of infiltration test. The soil moisture potential and the soil water content profiles were calculated by means of mathematical modeling, and time course of infiltration in conditions (2abc). There can be calculated the time course of cumulative infiltration i = i(t) and consequentially the time course of infiltration rate v = v(t). Results and discussion The points of soil water retention curves are in the table 1. For mathematical modeling was calculated one average soil water retention curve from these four soil water retention curves. Genuchten’s input data were: saturated moisture content θs = 47,2 (%), residual water content θr = 3,16 (%), parameters α = 0,00916 and n = 1,54. The value of saturated soil hydraulic conductivity was Ks = 0,00013 cms -1. The soil water content profile on beginning of infiltration tests was measured by gravimetric method. Table 1.

Based on this data different levels of sufficient water can be described (field capacity, availability, and wilting point). In order to compare data of various soil moisture measurement instruments it is mandatory to evaluate the accuracy of each method. In practice neutron probe is applied as the most accurate instrument, however due to its radiation work safety rules question the long-term applicability of such instruments. This article reports the comparison of three methods: neutron probe, capacity method and a so-called I-sensor. Since soil moisture measurement methods differ on the Hungarian and Slovakian side of the Danube, data comparison can lead to disagreements on soil moisture level. For the above-mentioned reason introduction of a new measurement method could be justified. Keywords: soil moisture measurement methods, capacity method, neutron probe, I-sensor Introduction In order to understand soil-plant interactions it is mandatory to investigate soil moisture as one of the most important factors for plant survival in dry conditions (Balkovič et al., 2004). Soils – as the most complex geo-sphere – has been investigated from different points of view: Várallyay (2007) stated that soils are conditionally renewable natural resources. As a (conditionally) renewable source soil conditions influence – through plant production – the food chain, therefore soils influence the quality of life (Várallyay, 2006). Minor changes in the climatic system can badly influence quality of life through influence of plant production conditions what is depending on soil conditions. The impact of possible climate change on both soil and soil moisture conditions was studied by various researchers (Farkas et al., 2005; Štekauerová, Nagy, 2007; Neményi et al., 2006; Stehlová, 2007). Soil moisture plays important role in energetic questions of plant production as well. Role of soil moisture on work quality and energy was investigated among others by Sinóros-Szabó (1975). Energy balance of plant production was investigated e.g. by Neményi (1983). In soil-plant interaction soil can be treated as one of the larges natural water storage. Tall (2007) investigated water storage dynamics depending on canopy. The liquid water in the pore spaces can be handled as stored water, and the unused pore spaces could be also used as water storage space (Rajkai, 2004). According to the above-mentioned facts, the basic question for agriculture (especially for irrigation) is the amount of soil moisture. Soil moisture measurement methods differ in Slovakia and Hungary (Nagy et al., 2007; Sútor, Gombos, 2006). In case, one needs to compare the different available data, due to measurement method differences, it becomes difficult. For the reason of</p><p id="Pg82">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1476 reliability, various measurement methods were compared together with a new instrument to estimate the accuracy of the instruments used by different Research institutes. Materials and methods On Slovakian side of the Danube measurements are carried out by neutron probe (Soil Moisture Probe Type I.H. III., Didcont Instrument Co. Ltd.). Due to its accuracy (less than ±1%) the output data of this instrument (completed with calculations) can be used as an etalon for soil moisture determination. However neutron probe method uses radioactive materials, therefore work safety rules should not allow its application in the foreseeable future. On Hungarian side of the Danube capacity method (Instrument: BR-150) is applied. The accuracy and the compatibility of this method with neutron probe were studied in one measurement and calibration point belonging to the University of West Hungary, Mosonmagyaróvár. In order to evaluate a new invention (I-sensor or intelligent sensor) a third instrument was used to determine soil moisture measurement method accuracy. In spite of the fact that I-sensor measures directly field capacity, which has to be converted to volumetric water content in order to be able to compare the data with the other devices this tool has some promising feature to fulfil the requirements of a modern measuring instrument. Results and discussion Measurement in different depth below surface with the different instruments showed strong correlation compared to the neutron probe. All measurements were carried out at the same date (19 July, 2002). There was strong correlation (R2= 0.9095) between the data collected with neutron probe and capacity method, however capacity measurement method overestimated saturation values between 80-100 cm depth and underestimated saturation values between 110-160 cm (Figure 1a). High correlation (R2= 0.8973) was also detected between neutron probe and I-sensor (Figure 1b). 0 20 40 60 80 100 saturation, % 0 50 100 150 200 d e p th u n d e r so il su rf a ce , cm 19.7.2002 neutron probe capacity methode 0 20 40 60 80 100 saturation, % 0 50 100 150 200 d e p th u n d e r so il su rf ac e, c m 19.7.2002 neutron probe senzor i Figure 1a and b.

Due to its unhealthy side effects, neutron probe method should not be applied in spite of its accuracy. In order to collect comparable database, accuracy of a new measurement device was investigated. Measurements showed that accuracy of the new instrument is satisfactory compared to the earlier used measurement methods. The advantages of the new instrument (I-sensor) are: 1. Continual measurement 2. One-year data storage 3. Any data can be accessed at any time of operation 4. Data are expressed in % of field water capacity 5. No personal service at measurement is needed 6. It can manage the irrigation needs in any conditions With some minor changes the I-sensor could be a new soil moisture measurement instrument applied in both side of the Danube, therefore unhealthy neutron probe measurement could be discontinued and data measurement harmonization would be solved.

In a nature conservation area it can reduce and increase biodiversity, however in the Tihany Peninsula nature conservationists try to protect the present natural environment. Human induced landscape changes gained the peninsula the first landscape protection district status of the country. Geological background, microclimatic conditions, given soil heritage, plant cover and land use plays an important role in the life of the peninsula. We wish to give an example how human induced activities might affect the valuable natural environment in a way that threatens the aim of the protection. Keywords: soil, nutrients, grazing, land use change Introduction Taking into account the most influencing soil formation factor, the human activity, we can state that soil is a non-renewable natural resource (Várallyay, 2007). Human activities (e.g. deforestation, over-intensified arable farming, animal husbandry and grazing, introduction of invasive plant species) can cause soil compaction, soil erosion (Jakab, 2006; Centeri and Császár, 2003), nutrient loss and damage to local plant and animal populations (Csontos and Tamás, 2006; Deák and Keveiné, 2006). Geologypedology relation is examined in very specific cases, mostly during soil ecology researches and connected with the weathering of the rocks. Researches on relation between plant and soil are more often and less specific (Halbritter et al., 2003; Penksza et al. 2005; Nagy and Penksza, 2006). Soil tillage changes soil properties rapidly (Birkás et al., 2005) however on the examined area soil has not been tilled recently. Land use changes (Máté, 2007; Szabó et al., 2007; Malatinszky, 2004; Malatinszky and Penksza, 2004) are the most common agents of land degradation. The most dangerous case is when forests are removed and replaced by arable land. It is not as damaging but includes potential problems when forests are changed into grassland. In this case overgrazing is a serious problem. Materials and methods The Tihany Peninsula was the first Landscape Protection District in Hungary. From 1997 it has been a part of the Balaton Upland National Park and does not exist separately as landscape protection district. There were three lakes situated on the peninsula. Now we can find two lakes with water surface all year round. The Outer Lake is a strictly protected nature conservation area. Both lakes has its own watershed inside the peninsula, no water flows in from outside and neither they have connection with the water level of Lake Balaton, in what the</p><p id="Pg86">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1480 peninsula is situated. The Inner Lake a fishing lake, situated close to Tihany village. There is a parking lot and a restaurant on the shore of the lake. The area of the Inner Lake is 28.2 ha, its average depth is 1.5 m. The bottom of the lake is silty on the southern and covered with marl on the northern part. The lake is a natural crater lake. The climate is Sub-Mediterranean. The Inner Lake was originally framed by a reed zone, almost all around its shores. The lake suffered serious damage when plant eating species were introduced to the lake. Nearly all the reed was gone. The rehabilitation of the lake started about a decade ago, now we can see some reed zone between the lake and the village. For soil analyses we used the Pürckhauer type soil core sampler (Finnern, 1994). Six sampling point and a sample slope were chosen (Figure 1.) for pedological examination. A soil profile was opened and described on the western side of the lake.

Overview map of the examined area, Tihany Peninsula, Hungary Soil laboratory analyses were done by the description of Buzás (1993). Comparison of soil type distribution was done by the soil map of Góczán (1970) and Barczi (1995) Results and discussion The peat accumulation around the lake is not very strong since it as handled as a fishing lake and there are a lot of human activity on the shores, especially trampling has a serious effect on the soils. However, in the northern part of the lake, where there is more reed cover, we can find some peaty meadow soil. Following the shores of the lake, there is a very narrow stripe of raw Fluvisol with some spots where we could find some young peaty layers (peaty meadow spots). After the Fluvisol there is a gravel road creates a ring around the lake. The road is surrounded by and was created on Vertisol. Coenological examinations found extreme plant associations indicating salt in the soil, especially on the shores. Further away from the lake there are Vertisols with some Chernozem effects on higher ground. On the southern side, this changes into Chernozem soils that bear some vertic properties, too. These soils carry vertic properties</p><p id="Pg87">VII.

The parent material towards the lake is swampy clay and powder like Pleistocene slope material. We compared two analyses of soil maps (prepared by Góczán, 1970 and Barczi, 1995). The comparison was done for soil types that occur around the Inner Lake (Table 1). Table 1.

Soil profile laboratory examination proved that grazing is not a principle form of land use around the soil profile (Table 2.) since the phosphorus content was very low. Table 2.

It was unexpected that K2O content was normal since phosphorus was very low in the profile. The soil texture of the examined soil profile was clayey loam. Slope angle was 5%. The amount of total salt content was zero. Compared to the 1995 examinations, results of laboratory examinations of soil samples from 2007 (Table 3.) show big differences. We chose a sample slope on the southern part of the lake (Figure 1). Table 3.

It result a much higher nutrient content compared to the 1995 examinations. We compared the upper and lower parts of the slopes. It is obvious that grazing causes trampling, that – as can be seen in the present example – can increase compaction, surface runoff and nutrient loss. In the lower third of the slope P2O5 content is 4.2 and K2O content is 1.7 times higher than on the upper third of the slope. CaCO3 content shows that erosion reached the parent material, causing mix up of the lime content.</p><p id="Pg88">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1482 Conclusions Soils have undergone several changes on the peninsula. The introduced Hungarian Grey cattle herd caused trampling, increasing soil compaction, soil structure degradation and nutrient loss that can be further threat to the ecosystem of the lake. Water pollution can reach a level that must be handled thus influence the fishing and recreation activity of the tourists. References Birkás M. - Bencsik K. - Stingli A. - Percze A.: 2005.

Sustainable soybean production strongly rely on biologically fixed nitrogen that can be ensured by application of high quality rhizobial inoculants. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the symbiotic properties of selected indigenous and reference Bradyrhizobium japonicum strains in agroecological area of north-west Croatia. During two-year period of investigation, nodulation and symbiotic efficiency of different B. japonicum strains was tested as well as their compatibility with different soybean cultivars. The application of different B. japonicum strains caused significant differences in nodule number and nodule dry weight. Significant influence of cultivar x strain interaction was determined as well. At both locations, inoculation with different indigenous B. japonicum strains caused significant increase of total nitrogen content in plants. Inoculation with selected indigenous and reference strains resulted also in seed yield differences. Interaction soybean cultivar x B. japonicum strain was also statisitcally significant. Positive effect of inoculation was determined regarding the soybena seed protein content. The results obtained in this study, highlight the importance of rhizobial strain selection. Some indigenous B. japonicum strains can be characterized by high symbiotic efficiency and could be recommended for inoculant production. All the results, clearly confirmed the significance of detection the most effective symbiotic associations between soybean cultivar and B. japonicum strain for successfull and sustainable soybean production.. Keywords: symbiotic nitrogen fixation, soybean, Bradyrhizobium japonicum, indigenous strains Introduction An important feature of sustainable agriculture is the effective management of nitrogen in the environment (Kádár 2007). Consequently, the natural process of symbiotic nitrogen fixation has a special role in sustainable soybean production. Soil bacteria, collectively named rhizobia, are characterized by their unique ability to nodulate and fix nitrogen in symbiosis with leguminous host plants. These nitrogen-fixing bacteria are very important components of the various soil–plant ecosystems and for the arable lands (Biró 2005). Interrelations between the macro-symbiont hosts and the micro-symbiont rhizobia are highly influenced with the biotic and abiotic environmental stress-factors (Ködöböcz et al. 2007). Nitrogen fixing capacity in agricultural systems depends on rhizobial strain, host plant and environmental conditions as well as on soil and crop management practices (Andric et al. 2007, Jug et al. 2006, Sabo et al. 2007, Sudarić et al. 2006). The application of rhizobial inoculants enables considerable reduction of mineral nitrogen fertilizers which is of great ecological and economical importance (Redžepović et al. 2007, Maćešić et al. 2007). It is well known that rhizobial strains strongly differ in their properties like symbiotic efficiency, competitiveness with other rhizobia in the soil, compatibility with host plant, and adaptive ability to stress conditions in the environment. Therefore, the selection of high quality rhizobial strains is one of the main presumptions for successful inoculation. Furthermore, in order to maximize the contribution of biologically fixed nitrogen in soybean production, it is also very important to select the most effective symbiotic associations between soybean cultivar and Bradyrhizobium japonicum strain. However, indigenous rhizobial strains</p><p id="Pg90">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1484 can be present in some soils as natural field population. In specific agroecological conditions, these strains usually show higher competitiveness and adaptive ability in comparison with commercial strains while their symbiotic efficiency is usually unkonwn (Sikora et al. 2002). The main aim of this study was to evaluate the symbiotic properties of indigenous and reference B. japonicum strains in agroecological area of north-west Croatia. Compatibility with different soybean cultivars was also tested in order to select the most suitable symbiotic asssociations for particular soybean production area. Materials and methods During two-year period (2004 and 2005), field trials were set up at two locations (Gola and Subotica Podravska) in north-west Croatia. The field experiments were conducted in a randomized complete block design in four replicates with a two factorial arrangement of treatments. The factors of field trials were as follows: soybean cultivars - cv. Kuna and cv. Hrvatica; B. japonicum strains – reference strain (344); indigenous strains (S9, S15, S28, S32) and uninoculated control (B0). Indigenous B. japonicum strains were isolated from eastern (S28, S32) and western (S9, S15) Slavonia and were genetically characterized as previously described (Sikora et al. 1997, 2002). During the vegetation period, the following parameters were determined: nodule number per plant, nodule dry weight per plant (g), total nitrogen content in aerial parts of soybean plants (%), seed yield (kg ha-1) and seed protein content (%). The obtained data were statistically processed by SAS 9.1. Results and discussion During the both years of investigation, highly significant influence of inoculation on nodule number was determined. At location Gola, significant differences between strains were not determined while at the other location, these differences were highly expressed. In 2004, at location Subotica Podravska, inoculation with strans S9, 344 and S15 resulted in very abundant nodulation (&gt;100 nodules per plant). Table 1.

In 2004, interaction cultivar x strain was also statistically approved at both locations. The highest nodule dry weight was determined on cv. Kuna inoculated with indigenous strain S15. The application of reference strain 344 always resulted in the lowest nodule dry weight At both locations, inoculation with different indigenous rhizobial strains caused significant differences of total nitrogen content in aerial parts of soybean plants. Significantly lowest nitrogen content was determined in uninoculated plants. The application of indigenous strains resulted in higher nitrogen content in comparison to reference strain. During 2004, the influence of soybean cultivar on total nitrogen content was also determined. Interaction cultivar x strain was statistically significant in all cases. Table 2.

Significant differences between particular strains were also determined in the first year of investigation.

Significant influence of cultivar as well as interaction cultivar x strain was determined only in the first year of</p><p id="Pg92">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1486 investigation. Predominantly, cv. Kuna inoculated with indigenous rhizobia was recognized as the most efficient symbiotic association. Positive effect of inoculation with different rhizobial strains on protein seed content was also determined, particularly at location Subotica Podravska where the differences were statistically approved in both years. Conclusions Our results clearly confirmed the importance of B. japonicum strain selection since significant differences in all tested parameters were determined depending upon rhizobial strain used for seed inoculation. The data collected so far, suggest that in most cases, the indigenous strains reveal higher symbiotic efficiency and some of them could be recommended for inoculant production. However, the final strain selection can be made after multiannual experiments under certain agroecological conditions. Therefore, further studies are needed for a better understanding of complex relations in the soil among rhizobial strains and soybean plants influenced by diverse agroecological conditions of certain area.

J. Strossmayer in Osijek, Faculty of Agriculture, Trg Sv. Trojstva 3, 31000 Osijek, Croatia Abstract: In field trials with four spring barley cultivars (Astor, Fran, Matej and Scarlett) during four years (2004-2007) at two localities (Osijek and Nova Gradiska) researches of grain yield, hectoliter weight, protein and starch content, extract content, friability of malt, Kolbach index and malt viscosity were carried out. Cultivar Matej (5.535 t ha -1 ) had significantly higher (P&gt;0.05) grain yield in comparison with cultivars Astor (4.968 t ha -1 ), Fran (5.113 t ha -1 ) and Scarlett (5.150 t ha -1 ). The year of production had significant influence on grain yield as well as on all indicators of malt quality, and differences in grain yield between localities Osijek and Nova Gradiska were not statistically justified. Significant differences between localities Osijek and Nova Gradiska in extract content and friability were estimated. Based on extract content and parameters of malt modification the best scores had cultivar Scarlett which was followed by cultivar Fran. Cultivar Scarlett had grain yield at average level of the trial, but high interaction scores (IPCA1) indicated the high adaptability of this genotype to conditions of production. Keywords: spring barley, cultivar, grain yield, malt quality, GEI Introduction Field crop yield and quality are influenced by genetic potential of cultivar, but also by ability of genotype to achieve these potentials in different environmental conditions which are often stressful, depending on soil, climate and management practice (Kovacevic et al., 2006; Pepó, 2006; Bhutta, 2007; Kádár, 2007). Significant part of barley production in Republic of Croatia (15-20%) is used for needs of beer production and malting industry, especially for needs of malting plant located in Nova Gradiska. There are attempts to increase the level of existing production by organization of malting barley production, application of scientific researches related to barley production, application of barley breeding results and increasing of areas for malting barley production. Materials and methods Three domestic (Astor, Fran and Matej: developed at Agricultural Institute Osijek) and foreign (Scarlett: from Germany) 2-rowed spring barley cultivars were grown under field conditions (a = Osijek eutric cambisol, ph in KCl = 7.10; b = Nova Gradiska alluvial soil, pH in KCl = 5.90) for four growing seasons (2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007). The experiment was conducted in RCBD design in six replications (area of the basic plot 7.56 m2). Grain yield, hectoliter weight, protein content, starch content and malt quality were analyzed by parameters of fine-grind extract content, malt viscosity, friability, Kolbach index and diastatic power. Micromalting and malt analysis were made at Res. Inst. of brewing and malting, PLC, Malting Inst. Brno, Czech Republic. Values of the main effects and the first interaction axis for interpretation of genotype*environment interaction were represented in graphic presentation–biplot analysis of AMMI1 model, and biplot for 6 environments and 4 spring barley cultivars was constructed (Gauch, 1992). Variance analysis was carried out according to GLM</p><p id="Pg94">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1488 procedure for RCBD plot design (SAS 8e). Differences among cultivars and environments were tested by LSD-test and Duncan’s Multiple Test Range. The software IRRISTAT, released by IRRI of Manila, was used for AMMI1 biplot analysis. Results and discussions Results of grain yield, hectoliter weight of grain, content of protein and starch, content of extract, friability of malt, Kolbach index and malt viscosity are represented in Table 1 and 2. In field trials during four years and at two localities, cultivar Matej (5.535 t ha-1) had significantly higher grain yield in comparison with cultivars Astor (4.968 t ha-1), Fran (5.113 t ha-1) and Scarlett (5.150 t ha-1). Cultivars Astor, Fran and Scarlett had statistically similar level of grain yield. The year of production had significant (P&gt;0.05) influence on grain yield and tested indicators of barley and malt quality. Differences in grain yield between localities Osijek (5.182 t ha-1) and Nova Gradiska (5.201 t ha-1) were not statistically significant. Significant differences (P&gt;0.05) between localities Osijek and Nova Gradiska were found only in extract content and friability. Table 1.

Cultivar Scarlett had grain yield at average level of the trial, but high interaction scores (IPCA1) indicated favorable adaptability of that genotype to growing conditions. Low interaction score (IPCA1), grain yield under average level of the trial indicated the low adaptability of cultivar Astor. Based on AMMI1 biplot analysis (Graph 1 and 2) grouping of localities and cultivars is notable. Based on grain yield level and high interaction score, locality OS-2006 is distinctive. Localities NG-2004, NG-2006 and NG-2005 represent the group of localities with grain yield above average and with lower to medium interaction scores. Cultivar Matej, which had the highest grain yield, demonstrated higher interaction scores and grouping with localities NG-2005, NG-2006 and OS-2007. High interaction scores (positive or negative) at localities NG-2007, OS-2007 and OS2004 for grain yield, and at localities NG-2005, NG-2004 and OS-2004 for extract content indicated that specific reaction of cultivars in these environments could be expected as well as notable adaptability of cultivars to production conditions. Cultivars Astor and Matej demonstrated high, opposite, interaction scores for extract content, but also lower values of extract content. Cultivar Scarlett had significantly lower grain yield and hectoliter weight in the year 2007, compared with other tested cultivars and years of testing. That reaction of cultivar Scarlett resulted from date of earing and period of grain filling interaction, and also by drought (stress) conditions of production in the year 2007. Under growing conditions in Croatia, cultivar Scarlett ears later than cultivars Fran, Astor and Matej. Shakhatreh et al. (2001) pointed out that lasting of the grain filling period in terms of favorable humidity has positive effect on grain yield and grain</p><p id="Pg96">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1490 quality, but in drought conditions genotypes with longer period of vegetation gave much lower grain yields. Dofing (1999) also indicated that date of earing and lasting of grain filling period had significant influence on grain yield in case of barley grown in northern latitudes. Conclusions Results indicate significant differences among cultivars in grain yield, quality parameters and reactions of cultivars to environments and technology of production. By application of barley breeding and comparative researches it is possible to distinct superior genotypes for spring barley production under conditions in Republic of Croatia and southeastern Europe, that will maximize the production of spring barley in region, increase stability of production and provide adequate quality of malt.

Strossmayer University in Osijek, Franje Kuhača 6, HR-31000 Osijek, Croatia E-mail: gordana.simic@poljinos.hr Abstract: The genetic and environmental effects on total grain protein, malt extract and hordein fractions have been studied in four spring barley cultivars grown in field trials at Croatia. Barley grain hordeins were analyzed by RP-HPLC. A significant difference was observed among the cultivars in B, C and D hordein relative proportions, but there was no statistically significant difference between locations and years. Regarding protein content, malt extract and total hordein content, there were significant differences among years, but not among locations. There were also differences in malt extract content and total hordein content between cultivars. Grain protein content was highly significantly correlated with total hordein content, but there wasn’t noticed grain protein influence on particular hordein fractions proportions. Keywords: spring barley, genotype, environment, hordeins, RP-HPLC Introduction It has been known that cereal protein content is genetically controlled, but significantly affected by the environmental conditions (Drezner et al., 2007; Lalić et al., 2007; Varga et al., 2007). Malt quality highly depends on barley grain protein content and it is the hordeins, the major fraction of the endosperm storage proteins, which are mainly responsible for the negative correlation between malt extract yield and barley protein content, first reported by Bishop in the 1930s and reviewed by Molina-Cano et al. (2001). The hordeins are alcohol-extractable protein fraction of barley grain and, on average, account for up to 60% of the total grain nitrogen (Brennan et al., 1998). They are classified into four groups of polypeptides, called B, C, D and γ hordeins, and are encoded by the genes: Hor 2 (B fraction), Hor 1 (C fraction), Hor 3 (D fraction) and Hor 5 (γ fraction), located on barley chromosome 5(1H). The B hordein (sulphur-rich) and C hordein (sulphur-poor) are two main fractions, while D hordein (high molecular weight) and γ hordein (sulphur-rich) are quantitatively minor components. When studying the effect of grain protein on the malting quality, Howard et al. (1996) found that variation in growth conditions resulted in a wide range of grain protein contents and malt extract values, as well as contents of the individual B, C and D hordeins in grains. Materials and methods Four spring barley cultivars (three domestic cultivars developed at Agricultural Institute Osijek – Astor, Fran and Matej, and foreign Scarlett from Germany) were grown under field conditions on two localities – Osijek (eutric cambisol, pHKCl=7.10) and Nova Gradiska (alluvial soil, pHKCl=5.90) during three growing seassons (2004-2006). The experiment was conducted in RCBD design in six replicates (area of basic plot was 7.56 m2). Prior to micromalting the barley samples were screened over a 2.5 mm sieve and analyzed for total barley protein content by non-destructive near infrared transmission method (Infratec 1241 Grain Analyzer). Malt extract content was determined according</p><p id="Pg98">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1492 to the EBC official methods. Barley grain hordeins were analyzed by the reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) following the procedure of Celus et al. (2006). Statistical analyses were carried out using the SAS 8e package. Results and discussion Results of grain protein content and malt extract content are presented in Table 1. In experiments carried out during three years and at two locations, there wasn’t detected statistically significant difference in grain protein content among cultivars and locations. Similar values, however, for grain protein content were found in 2004 and 2005, but significantly higher than in 2006. Statistically justified differences in malt extract content were observed among cultivars and years, what accords with the finding of Lalić et al. (2007). Cultivar Scarlett had significantly higher content of extract (81.32%), but similar to cultivars Fran (80.62%) and Matej (80.42%). Cultivar Astor resulted in significantly lower malt extract (79.77%). There was no statistically significant difference in extract content among locations. Table 1.

In this study, level of the total hordein was expressed in arbitrary units (AU, based on chromatogram peak areas), and proportions of the various hordein fractions were quantified as percent of total peak area (Molina-Cano et al., 2001). The higher and statistically similar total hordein content was found in cultivars Matej (8386 AU) and Astor (8250 AU) in comparison to cultivars Fran (7358 AU) and Scarlett (7095 AU). Years 2004 and 2005 resulted in significant higher total hordein content when comparing to 2006, while location didn’t have influence on total hordein content. However, cultivars showed significant differences regarding proportions of the B, C and D hordein, which confirms the results reported by Molina-Cano et al. (2001) and Qi at al. (2005). The highest proportion of B hordein had cultivar Fran (70.47%) and cultivar Matej had the smallest (53.88%). Regarding the proportion of C hordein, in contrast, cultivar Matej had the highest value (39.76%), and cultivar Fran had the smallest proportion of C hordein (24.27%).

The coefficients of correlation between grain protein content, malt extract content, total hordein content i hordein fraction proportions are given in Table 4. The positive and significant correlation was found between grain protein content and total hordein content, but we did not find significant relation between grain protein and proportions of hordein fractions. Total hordein content significantly negatively correlated with malt extract content, what is in accordance with our previous finding (Šimić et al., 2007). Significant negative relationship was found between proportions of B hordein and C hordein fraction, whereas D hordein was positively correlated with C hordein and negatively with B hordein fraction.

The objective of present work was to determine the influence of N fertilization on the growth parameters of young canola in the autumn period, grown on two different (calcareous chernozem and calcareous sandy) soils. Growth parameters of young canola, such as leaf area index, fresh and dry mass of shoot and root differed with N fertilizer application and soil type. N fertilization increased values of all studied parameters at both experimental sites. The differences between the two soils brought about changes in the rate of increase, and effectiveness of N doses. Responses to N treatment were greater on the studied parameters of plants grown on sandy soil, and significant differences were only established at this site as an effect of higher N doses. The dry mass of canola increased up to the 75 kg N·ha -1 treatment on chernozem soil and 150 N·ha -1 dose on sandy soil. The highest N rate (225 kg N·ha -1 ) had no stimulating effect on plant growth on either sites. Different maximum shoot mass, but identical root mass characterized the canola plants grown on the two soils, therefore, characteristically there was a difference in the shoot per root ratio. On sandy soil the water content of plant shoots was lower, while the response to N treatment was greater than in canola samples grown on chernozem soil. A significant, positive correlation was established between the dry mass of roots and shoots, as well as between the dry mass of roots and water content of shoots. The gained results verify the necessity of autumn N fertilizer application on both soil types, and at the same time, on the basis of its effect on plant growth, indicated the different N-requirement of canola on the two sites. Key words: N fertilization, canola, autumn growth, soil type Introduction Fertilization plays a substantial role in plant growth. The effect of N fertilization on the growth of numerous plants has been reported in earlier studies (Balogh et al. 2007, Csathó et al. 2007, Izsáki 2007, Németh 2006, R. Végh and Rajkai 2006, R. Végh et al. 2007). The nutrient demand of a given crop determines the degree of its response to different N supplies. Therefore, canola, which has high nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur requirement (Németh 1987-1988, Kádár 2001 and 2002, Németh et al. 2007, MáthéGáspár et al. 2007), strongly indicates nutrient supply. The determination of the N demand of canola in the autumn period becomes more important because of the NO3 leaching in the winter period (Németh 2006). In our previous experiment (2003–2004) carried out on chernozem soil, as a consequence of dry weather in early autumn, the highest N fertilizer dose inhibited emergence and early leaf development, and resulted similar dry mass in the control and N treatments (Máthé-Gáspár et al. 2007).</p><p id="Pg102">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1496 The objective of the present investigation was to determine the influence of N fertilizer on the autumnal growth parameters of young canola grown on two different (calcareous chernozem and calcareous sandy) soils in 2007. Material and methods Canola was grown in 2007 on two Hungarian sites: in Őrbottyán on a calcareous sandy soil (sowing: 10 September 2007) and in Nagyhörcsök on a calcareous chernozem soil (sowing: 13 September 2007). The experiment was set up with 4 replications, with the following N fertilizer doses: 0 (control), 75, 150 and 225 kg N·ha-1 applied in autumn. Uniformly all treatments received 100 kg·ha-1 P2O5 and K2O fertilizers. The basic soil properties of the upper (0–25 cm) layer of the control plots on calcareous sandy soil (Őrbottyán) and on calcareous chernozem soil (Nagyhörcsök) were: humus content: 1.2% and 2.95%, pHKCl: 7.2 and 7.41, CaCO3: 4.46% and 9.46%, plasticity index (AK) 25 and 40. Although the weather in 2007 summer was droughty, as a consequence of precipitation in September (36.4 and 31 mm in Nagyhörcsök and Őrbottyán, respectively) the soil moisture content was suitable for emergence at the sowing time on both sites. The development and growth of canola (Brassica napus L. subsp. napus) plants cv. GKGabriella were observed on each plot. 20 plants were collected per plot on 22 November 2007 (Őrbottyán) and 26 November 2007 (Nagyhörcsök). The leaf area index (LAI, m2 m-2), fresh and dry mass of shoots and roots were the determined plant parameters. Statistical evaluation was carried out by variance analysis and regression analysis. Results and discussion The soil moisture content was adequate for plant development and growth in the observed period, so the leaf appearance rate was significantly lower only in case of the control treatment on sandy soil. Significant differences occurred in LAI, corresponding to the differences in the two sites and response to N fertilization (Table 1). Table 1.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1497 There was a fivefold increase in the dry mass of aboveground parts in the case of sandy soil, while this increase was less than twofold (1.75) for chernozem soil. Changes in root dry mass showed similar differences: for plants grown on sandy soil and chernozem soil the increase was 3.4-fold and 1.4-fold, respectively. The mean and maximum values of dry shoot mass in the N treatments were higher on chernozem soil. The dry root mass, however, was similar for canola plants grown on both soils. Further differences were found in the effectiveness of N doses. The dry mass of canola increased up to the 75 kg N·ha-1 treatment on chernozem soil, and 150 kg N·ha-1 dose on sandy soil. The highest N rate (225 kg N·ha-1) had no stimulating effect on plant growth on either sites. These results are in agreement with previous studies, in which the effect of N was investigated on the yield of tomato (R. Végh et al. 2007) or of winter wheat (Balogh et al. 2007). They are conform to the tendency of changes in tomato LAI by different soils (R. Végh et al. 2007), or early growth of root by barley in the case of different nutrient supply (R. Végh and Rajkai 2006). The higher N dose increased the shoot per root ratio (Figure 1) on both soils, the rate of increase however, was greater for plants grown on sandy soil than for those on chernozem soil. Figure 1. Effect of N treatment on the shoot per root ratio (A) and the shoot water content (B) at two experimental sites There was a 60 % increase in the shoot per root ratio (from 2.8 to 4.5) as compared to the control at Őrbottyán, while at Nagyhörcsök this increase was only 30 % (from 4.4 to 5.8).

Cereal Research Communications 1498 N fertilization resulted in differences in the water content of shoots, too. This result is similar to our previous findings, as P treatment increased the water content of young rye (Máthéné 1980). The water content of shoots grown on sandy soil was lower in all treatments than of those from chernozem soil (Figure 1, Figure 2). A significant positive linear correlation was established between root dry mass and shoot water content on both soil types, but the relationship was much stronger for sandy soil plants. Conclusion The gained results demonstrated the influence of N fertilizer on young canola growth. Differences occurred in the rate of changes in the observed parameters between two experimental sites. The higher rate of changes was characteristic of the sandy soil site. This indicates discrepancy in nutrient and water supply of studied soil. The results verify the necessity of N fertilizer application for the autumn growth of canola on both soil types, and at the same time, indicated the importance of adapting N doses to crop demand.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1499 INFLUENCE OF SUBSTRATE IN BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF TOMATO SEEDLINGS AGAINST RHIZOCTONIA SOLANI AND PYTHIUM DEBARYANUM Renata BALICEVIC – Nada PARADIKOVIC – Jasenka COSIC – Drazenka JURKOVIC - Davor SAMOTA University J. J. Strossmayer in Osijek, Faculty of Agriculture, Trg Svetog Trojstva 3, HR-31000, Osijek, Croatia; e-mail: renatab@pfos.hr Abstract: In this paper we studied influence of substrate to efficiency of biological product based on Trichoderma harzianum to control soil-borne parasites Pythium debaryanum and Rhizoctonia solani on tomato seedlings in protected area (greenhouse). Two substrates were used: specialized substrate for production of seedlings by German manufacturer Gebr. Brill Substrate GmbH˛&amp; Co (substrate I), and randomly taken mixture of garden mould (substrate II). T.harzianum was homogenized by hand, and artificial inoculation of the substrate was done by suspension of the fungi Pythium debaryanum and Rhizoctonia solani. Application of biological protection on the base of T.harzianum spores, preparation TRI 003, showed very high significant influence (P&lt;0.001) to tomato seedlings plant number. Tomato plants planted in substrate I had better state of health and higher plant number if compared to the seedlings planted in substrate II (P=0.002). Keywords: biological protection, tomato, substrate, Rhizoctonia solani, Pythium debaryanum Introduction In Croatia in 2006 tomato was grown on 1014 ha with average yield of 28.63 t/ha (Statistical Yearbook, 2007). Enlargement of arable areas to make increase in production is not necessity, it is, primarily, use of modern production technology and measures for plant protection against soil parasites. Due to the numerous toxicological and eco-toxicological drawbacks of chemical products for plant protection, serious attention has been turned to application of biological products for plant protection. Application of bioproducts could be given priority relative to the application of chemical products in plant protection in protected areas, in ecological production, in substitution for chemicals that have become ineffective due to the development of resistance, as well as, due to the residues of pesticides present (Cook and Baker, 1983; Jolankai 2006). In current vegetable production, soil parasites (Pythium debaryianum, Rhizoctonia solani) have become a serious issue particularly in production of seedlings. The disease shows up frequently, depending on agroecological conditions for occurrence of infection, sensitivity of the hybrids, aggression and pathogenicity of parasites, and method and technology of crop cultivation. Imperative of successful production of seedlings is application of sterilized substrate having adequate nutrient supply and favourable mechanical content. Mentioned pathogens (Pythium debaryianum, Rhizoctonia solani) have in common to occur in conditions of too high saturation of substrate with water and in increased relative humidity. Therefore, it is necessary to secure preventive hygienic measures in breeding area. Trichoderma genus abounds with species that could be used in biological combat in order to control phytopathogenic fungi (Elad and Freeman, 2002).The largest number of listed products worldwide is based on Trichoderma harzianum species (Harman, 2000). Trichoderma harzianum fungi control wide range of soil-borne pathogens having ability to stimulate plant growth (Parađiković, 2004).In numerous investigations (Chet, 1990;</p><p id="Pg106">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1500 McGovern et al.,1992; Datnoff and Pernezny, 1998; Balicevic, 2007) T. harzianum was reported to stimulate growth of tomato seedlings. Materials and methods Investigations were carried out in protected area (greenhouse), and the trial was set up according to randomized complete block design with four replications. In each replication 30 tomato seeds were sown. Torquay F1 tomato hybrid was sown in latespring (18. May 2006) and autumn (03.October 2006) in pots filled with substrate. Two substrates were used in sowing: 1. Substrate I, produced by Gebr. Brill Substrate GmbH˛&amp; Co., basically containing bog peat mixture with clay and perlite added, with acidity of (pH) 5.8, sterilized, and meant for production of vegetable and plant seedlings. 2. Substrate II, mixture of randomly taken garden mould. After soil analysis that was carried out at the Department of Agroecology, Faculty of Agriculture in Osijek, substrate II was determined to have, neutral reaction, extremely high supply of physiologically active P2O5 and K2O, rich supply of organic matter (4.99%), poor supply of carbonates (4.67%)(Vukadinović,1989), and recorded higher content of clay particles. Substrate inoculation was done by the isolates of the phytopathogenic fungi Pythium debaryanum (62946 isolate) and Rhizoctonia solani (63002 isolate). P. debaryanum was grown on modified V-8 juice agar, and R. solani on Potato dextrose agar. Ten days old isolates was homogenized in distilled water. Before sowing the substrate was inoculated with 4 ml inoculate per the container opening. In disease control we applied TRI 003 biological product produced by Bio Works Inc. Geneve, NY, USA containing spores of Trichoderma harzianum (Strain-22) 1 x 108 per gram of dry matter. This biological preparation was mixed with substrate in a dose of 17g per plant, immediately before sowing. Daily temperatures in greenhouse ranged from 18-36°C, with the range of 14-23°C at night. Temperature of the substrate was maintained in the range of 16-32°C. Relative humidity was 25 to 75%. In data processing obtained results were calculated by MANOVA and described by Pvalues. The data were shown as mean values (x) and standard error (sx). Differences between influence of biological protection and substrate, and between biological protection and vegetation period were determined by t-test, and marked in different letters (a, b P&lt;0.05). Statistical analysis was conducted by Statistica v.7.1 (StatSoft, Inc. 2005.). Results and discussion Symptoms of seedling damping-off most frequently occur in developmental stage of cotyledon, in the stage when the root crown zone becomes thinner, watery and breakable. After phytopathological examination of the plant material presence of pathogenic damping-off agents Pythium debaryianum and Rhizoctonia solani was detected. Plant examination showed that treatments with biological product TRI 003 had the highest plant number. All these plants were healthy, with well developed stem and first pair of leaves.

Moreover, higher tomato plant number was determined if being grown in substrate I relative to the substrate II for pronouncedly more favourable water and air regime in substrate I. Table 1.

October 2006) to tomato seedlings plant number. Application of biological protection based on the spores of T. harzianum, preparation TRI 003, had statistically very high significant (P&lt;0.001) influence to tomato seedlings plant number. Plants treated with biological product TRI 003 had higher plant number and better state of health relative to the non-treated control. Number of tomato plants planted in substrate I was higher relative to the seedlings planted in substrate II (P=0.002). Substrate I showed better results for seedling production due to the favourable water and air regime that directly influenced growth of the fungi. Some studies (Howell,1987) proved considerable influence of substrates to the growth of T.harzianum, particularly in conditions of higher humidity. Mechanical content of substrate II and higher content of clay particles induced poorer water filtration and higher soil moisture relative to the substrate I. No statistically significant (P=0.353) influence of application of different vegetation periods to tomato seedlings plant number was determined. Table 2. Influence of substrate and biological protection to tomato seedlings plant number.

The highest number of tomato seedlings with good state of health was determined with the substrate I and in the treatment of biological protection (26.00). The lowest number was determined in non-treated control with the substrate II (9.37).In both applied substrates significantly higher (P&lt;0.05) number of tomato seedlings treated by biological preparation was determined when compared to the control. Thus, biological protection has proved its application as a basic component of sustainable development of plant production with no damage to natural processes. Also, higher tomato seedlings plant number was observed with substrate I in treatments of biological protection, and in the control relative to the substrate II.</p><p id="Pg108">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Conclusions According to our study and obtained results Trichoderma harzianum species can be considered as a good antagonist and genuine mycoparasite, and could be used as plant growth promoter as well. Biocontrol mechanisms of T. harzianum to control plant diseases are very complicated and depend on the pathogen, host plant, soil type, moisture and humidity, pH values, and other factors of microflora. To understand all complexity of the system it is required to continue examining to widen biological application with no damage to natural processes and instability in eco-system.

Locations, genotypes and interaction between them had highly significant effect on grain yield. Rainfall from February to May and rainfall during the pea vegetation were in very high positive correlation with average yield of pea, whilst temperatures in May and Jun were in negative correlation. Semigley soil type provided higher average yield than eutric cambisol in 2005. Keywords: field pea, grain yield, precipitation, temperature Introduction Temperature and precipitation are among main factors that influence crop yields. Knowing the effect of a.m. factors on specific crop and cultivar helps in bringing decisions during the production process. Investigations of Borbély et al. (2007), Nagy (2007) and Hoffmann et al. (2007) showed that different crops have different needs upon precipitation and its distribution over the crop year while Borbély et al., (2007) and Hoffmann et al. (2007) emphasize the importance of soil water reserve as well. According to Lesznyák et al. (2007) in environment with 185 mm of natural rainfall during the pea vegetation, irrigation of 60 mm can increase grain yield of some cultivars for 89 to 751 kg ha-1. Payne et al. (2000) reported that both winter precipitation and precipitation during the vegetation had highly significant positive effect on dry pea yield, while the effect of precipitation during the vegetation was stronger than of winter precipitation. The same authors point out that the sum of maximum daily temperatures above 25.6 °C during the reproductive phases of crop had negative effect on yield. The aim of this research was to investigate the influences of precipitation and temperature on field pea grain yield in conditions of east Croatia. Materials and methods Seven new field pea genotypes and variety Baccara as a standard were included in investigation. The trial was seeded as a random block design in 3 repetitions, in Osijek (eutric cambisol, pH 6.22 in water) in 2005, 2006 and 2007 year and in Nova Gradiška (semigley, pH 6.4 in water) in 2005 year. Dimensions of basic plot were 1 m × 5 m. Seeding stand was 120 seeds per square meter. Seeding dates in Osijek were 2nd April 2005, 30th March 2006, and 12th March 2007, and in Nova Gradiška 2nd April 2005. Harvest dates in Osijek were 30th Jun 2005, 5th July 2006, and 18th Jun 2007, and in Nova Gradiška 12th July 2005. Analysis of variance for grain yield as a split-plot design with location as a main factor and genotype as a subfactor, and correlation analysis between precipitation, temperatures and average location yields were performed using SAS/STAT software, version 8.</p><p id="Pg110">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Table 5. Correlation coefficients between precipitation and average yield of locations Period November-seeding Seeding-harvest November-harvest February-May Correlation coefficient 0.53721 0.98356 0.85213 0.99506 Level of significance 0.4628 0.0164 0.1479 0.0049 Observed precipitation was in positive correlation with average yields of locations. Precipitation during the period February to May was in very high correlation with average yield and had the highest positive correlation coefficient r = 0.99506. Precipitation during the period from seeding to harvest was in very high correlation with average yield too, with r = 0.98356 . The total winter and vegetation precipitation, from November to harvest was in high correlation (r = 0.85213) with yield but winter precipitation alone was in weak correlation (r = 0.53721) with average yields of locations (Table 5). These precipitation influences partly differed from Payne et al., (2000) because they found winter and during vegetation precipitation both had highly significant effect on pea yield, with winter precipitation having slightly less effect than precipitation during vegetation. In 2005 year the higher average yield was achieved in Nova Gradiška on semigley soil type than in Osijek on eutric cambisol, despite the higher total November to harvest (Table 1) precipitation in Osijek than in Nova Gradiška 2005, probably because of the soil type influence. Observed temperatures were in negative correlation with average pea yields of locations. Average month temperature of May and average of maximum daily temperatures of May were in very high negative correlation with yield, with correlation coefficients r = -0.98241 and r = -</p><p id="Pg112">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1506 0.96282, respectively. Since the seed setting occurs during May, this agrees with Jeuffroy et al. (1990) findings that elevated temperatures during the seed setting reduce the number of seeds per pod and consequently the yield. Sum of maximum daily temperatures above 25.6 °C from 10th May to harvest was in weak positive correlation, statistically insignificant, with yield (r = 0.39834) what disagrees with Payne et al. (2000) because of influence of extremely early harvest in Osijek 2007 and consequently low sum of temperatures connected with low yield. The sum of maximum daily temperatures above 25.6 °C from 1st May to 15th Jun was in very high negative correlation with yield (r = -0.92848). Correlation coefficients between yield and average month temperatures and average of maximum daily temperatures of Jun (r = -0.75067 and r = -0.83940, respectively) and April (r = -0.51488 and r = -0.70510, respectively) were relatively lower in comparison to correlations of May temperatures (Table 6).

Precipitation during the pea vegetation was in very high correlation with average yield of location (r = 0.98356), whilst winter precipitation from November to seeding, which is being utilized by pea crop as reserve in soil, was in weaker positive correlation (r = 0.53721) with average yields. Semigley soil type provided higher average yield than eutric cambisol in 2005 year. Investigation of influence of temperatures showed that average May temperature and average of maximum daily temperatures of May were in very high negative correlation with average yields of locations (r = -0.98241 and r = -0.96282, respectively). The sum of maximum daily temperatures above 25.6 °C from 1st May to 15th Jun was also in very high negative correlation with yield (r = -0.92848).

Strossmayer in Osijek Abstract: Laboratory and field tests were conducted to evaluate differences among red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) genotypes in order to identify genotypes that would be used for creation of new cultivars with acid-soil tolerance. Significant differences (p=0.01) were found for all seedling traits with exception of root length. The field test revealed differences (p=0.01) among genotypes in number of plants per area unit, plant height, green mass yield and dry matter yield. Concentration of proline in seedlings was in significant correlations with green mass yield per plant (r=0.946**) and dry matter yield per plant (r=0.932**). Keywords: red clover, genotype, germination, yield, proline Introduction Yield and quality of crops depend on both, agro-ecological conditions during growth and genotype (Baric et al., 2007; Pepo, 2007). Red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) is a perennial legume, productive for 2 to 3 years and with highest yields and quality in the second year of its life (Cupic et al., 2007). It is well adapted to humid areas with shallow, acid and wet soils (Leto et al., 1998) where commonly produce 2 to 3 cuts per year. Crop productivity depends on soil moisture changes during vegetation (Nagy, 2007; Gombos, 2007). Plant regeneration of the summer clover cuts is often under conditions of drought stress. Stewart and Larher (1980) found increase of proline concentration in plants under drought stress conditions and concentration differences among genotypes. In the research of Vinkovic et al. (2007), maize and soybean seed treatment with proline did not stimulate germination, but the maize seed treated with proline developed seedlings with higher fresh weight (FW) and, in case of soybean, higher cotyledon FW was observed in comparison with untreated seed. A limiting factor in a yield production is also pH value of soil. The optimum pH values for legumes growth is from 6.6 to 7.5 (Caddel et al., 2004). However, red clover genotypes are well adapted to varying climatic conditions and lower soil pH (Voigt and Mosjidis, 2002). The aim of this study was to evaluate differences among cultivars and newly created red clover populations under acid conditions in laboratory and field tests in order to identify genotypes that would be used for creation of new improved cultivars with acid-soil tolerance. Materials and methods Laboratory test. Seed of 6 red clover genotypes with different origin was tested: three newly created populations originated from Agricultural Institute Osijek (PIO-CD-74, PIO-CD-158, PIO-CD-240) and cultivars Croatia, Rajah and Diana originated from Croatia, Denmark and Hungary respectively. Germination energy and germination were</p><p id="Pg114">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1508 determined by standard method proposed by ISTA (2003). After removal of cotyledons, seedlings root and hypocotyls lengths were measured. Proline concentration in seedlings of tested genotypes was determined by the method of Bates et al. (1973). Field test. Evaluation was conducted at acid soil of eastern Croatia (altitude 133 m, lat 45o N, long 17o E). Chemical characteristics of soil are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Chemical characteristics of soil pH Humus AL (mg 100g -1 of soil) H2O KCl % P2O5 K2O 5.61 4.14 2.23 3.9 16.82 Seeds of investigated genotypes were sown in peat pots fulfilled by commercial soil substrate (2 April 2007). Plants with 2-3 fully developed leaves were transplanted (21 May 2007) to the field. The trial was set up as an alpha design with four replications. Each experimental plot contained 42 spaced plants (0.40 x 0.40 m). Due to unfavourable weather conditions (Table 2) only one cut was done (30 August 2007) at the beginning of the flowering growth stage. Prior to cutting, number of plants per plot and plant height of each survived plant was determined. Green mass yield per plot was also recorded. Data were transformed to green mass yield per plant and in tha-1. Dry matter yield was determined by drying of fresh samples on 105oC. Data were also transformed into dry matter yield per plant and dry matter yield in tha-1. SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute 2002-2003) software was used to analyse obtained data. Table 2.

The highest germination energy and germination had the PIO-CD-158 population. The lowest germination energy and germination were found for cultivar Croatia. Low germination energy and germination values of Croatia were probably caused by mistakes in seed processing and/or inadequate seed storage. However, germinated seed of cultivar Croatia developed large root and hypocotyls in laboratory conditions and revealed highest green mass and dry matter yield per plant and per area unit in field conditions (Table 4). In addition, Croatia seedlings had the highest proline concentration. Proline concentration in seedlings across genotypes was in significant correlations with green mass yield per plant (r=0.946**) and dry matter yield per plant (r=0.932**).

A number of survivors per area unit was acceptable for further investigation. However, during June and July and in conditions of drought and high air temperatures plants grew slow and probably, as Balla et al. (2006) pointed out, in conditions of decreased photosynthetic activity. Consequently, realised yields were much lower than yields that would be expected in more favourable conditions. After fist cut, plant regeneration was undergone again in stressful conditions and due to insufficient plant regeneration second cut was not done. However, data obtained by field test revealed significant differences (p=0.01) among genotypes for percentage of plants per area unit, plant height, and green mass and dry matter yield per plant (Table 4). Percentage of plants per area unit was positive correlated to green mass yield per plant (r=0.811*) and to green mass yield in tha-1 (r=0.855*). Plant height values were, with exception of cultivar Rajah, congruent with results reported by Leto et al. (1998). Out of</p><p id="Pg116">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1510 newly created populations, PIO-CD-74 had the highest proline concentration and the values of traits measured in the field test. The same population in comparison with other newly created populations had the lowest values of traits in laboratory test. Conclusions Red clover genotypes were significantly different (p=0.01) in seedling traits, with exception of root length. In field test, differences (p=0.01) were found for percentage of plants per area unit, plant height and green mass and dry matter yields per plant. PIOCD-74 newly created population was identified as a genotype that might be used for creation of new improved cultivar with acid-soil tolerance. Obtained correlation of proline concentration in seedlings and yields at the field indicated that proline has a physiological role in drought stress plant protection.

Trojstva 3, 31000 Osijek, Croatia, e-mail: iplascak@pfos.hr Abstract: Oil rape is a valuable fodder because in early spring and late autumn it produces green forage used for the nutrition of domestic animals. It has been replacing sunflower and soy in colder and wetter regions. It is additionally advantageous because it leaves behind more nitrogen in soil, which is beneficial to other plants in plant rotation. There are some possible ways for the fixation of nitrogen in soil and they are as follows: by the means of oil rape straw; by relatively long roots; by the action of nitrogen bacteria, which perform the nitrogen synthesis within their root system, which is the case in some leguminous plants. Oil seed rape is expected to be wider used in crop rotation of West and Middle Europe, Croatia included. Due to this various sorts have been introduced and potential positive impacts have been studied in order to boost the process. This paper presents information on barley and wheat yield in case when they were sown after oil seed rape and corn. The aim of the research is to determine the presence of positive impacts upon the soil with special attention paid to a potential increase of nitrogen content after oil seed rape was grown. The preceding crops had statistically significant effect. Rape yield was significantly higher compared to the one with corn as preceding crops. Very similar results were obtained in 2007. Keywords: oilseed rape, nitrogen, crop rotation, wheat, barley, corn Introduction Production of alternative fuels from renewable sources is rising as a consequence of galloping prices of raw oil. The production from biomass, such as ethanol, biogas, biodiesel, etc. is of special importance. The intention is to fulfil the growing energy demand, and at the same time to reduce pollution which has a negative impact on global climatic disturbances (Várallyay et al., 2007). Biodiesel production from seeds of oleiferous plants is important. The importance of oleiferous plants and their by-products on the global market is rising. This was especially emphasized in the last year, when most countries had significantly lower yields than usual. The price of crude plant oils has risen and seed rape oil takes a prominent position among oils. Oil seed rape is one of the most important plants and it takes the fifth place. In about 30 countries it is the most important agricultural plant. It is grown for seeds which contain about 40-49% of oil and 18-25%. of protein. Refined oil is used in human diet. It can be used for technical purposes in production of soap, dyestuff, textile and leather, in printing business, and as</p><p id="Pg118">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1512 an additive to lubricants. Oil cakes and grits, which are left after oil production, are very valuable concentrated fodders. Materials and methods Oil seed rape has both a winter and spring form. In Europe the winter form is dominant, and this goes as far as 90% of the total sown area. Winter forms of oil seed rape result in higher yields than the spring forms. Most European regions have favourable cropping system conditions for winter rape seed growth. This is the case for Croatia, too. We only grow winter forms and it is also a good preceding crop for every kind of cereals since it leaves the soil early and therefore it leaves enough time for a good soil preparation and timely sowing. Two trial sowings were performed in two-year cycles from 2005 to 2006 (2005/2006 and 2006/2007) on brown soil of the farm „Vupik.d.o.o.“ in Vukovar. Oil seed rape of Triangle sort produced by Syngenta was the preceding crop. This is a sort produced by CPB, England. This oilseed rape sort has been in the broadest use in Slavonia in the last few years. During the basic tillage no mineral fertilizers were used. Winter wheat and barley were sown after the harvest of oil seed rape. At the same time the same plants were sown on another field, where corn had been harvested before. The corn was an early sort belonging to the FAO 300 group. It was sown and treated by standard cropping system measures (Nagy, 2007). After that winter wheat called “Srpanjka” was sown on both fields. This is semi dwarf sort produced by the Agricultural Institute in Osijek and it is one of the most often sown sorts in Croatia. It responds very well to fertilization rich in N-nutrients. Another cultivar was the winter four-row barley „Favorit“ by BC-Institute in Zagreb. Wheat was sown in 20.10.2005 and harvested in 16.07.2006. Barley was sown in 25.10.2005 and harvested in 01.07.2006. During the basic tillage no mineral fertilizers were used in relation with the oil seed rape sowing (Bertic et al., 2007). A reduced nutrition was applied and only 2 x 200 kg KAN ha-1 was subject to fertilization in order to get as low level of nitrogen in soil as possible. The seed yield (t ha-1) was subject. The samples were dried in a natural way. Results and discussion Table 1.

The preceding crops has a statistically significant effect. Rape yield was significantly higher compared to the one with corn as preceding crops. Very similar results were obtained in 2007. As for the barley, values are same what laver. The difference is only 0,273 (table 2). Conclusions The aim of the research was to show whether the soil quality is improved after the vegetation cycle of oilseed rape, which can be very favourable for a production increase. We also want to support this hypothesis by the comparison of the yield of wheat and barley sown oilseed rape and corn. The results show that less nitrogen fertilization is needed after oilseed rape was grown as a preceding crop, which decreases the production al cost of the following crop. The aim of the experiment was to emphasize that after the vegetation cyle of oil seed rape the soil quality has improved especially as a result of the increased nitrogen contents. Up to now we have had experience with the situation after growing of legumes. Which can also stimulate an increase of production. The difference between wheat and barley yield in case of soil treating with the same amount of nitrogen are bigger when oil seed rape was a preceding crop compared to the experiment when corn was a preceding crop. Present researches point out the 100 kg of oil rape seeds assimilates 7 kg of nitrogen and half of that amount, ie. 3.5 kg is turned back into soil in case when straw is ploughed back. the mineralization of soil surface is determined by the depth of root system and water contents. A possible synthesis performed by nitrogen bacteria will be further explored.</p><p id="Pg120">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1514 We have to conclude that somewhat larger yields are probably a consequence of a partial intake of nitrogen after oil seed rape had been grown. The conducted researches show a positive effect of oil seed rape as a preceding crop, which can result in a significant nitrogen saving. This can be supported by the latest comparison between sugar beet yields in case when oil seed rape was a preceding crop. It is higher by 1015% on the same field. These results can stimulate oil seed rape production and this is supported by EU directives which especially refer to biofuel production. This statement can also be supported by the latest increase of the price of edible oils at the world market, and reduction of oil reserves due to the last years' bad vegetation. It is expected to intensify the production of oleiferous plants, especially of oil seed rape. References György Várallyay: 2007.

POPULATIONS IN CROATIA Ksenija KARLOVIĆ1 – Zoran ŠINDRAK2 – Dario KREMER3 – Vesna ŽIDOVEC1 1 Department of Ornamental Plants, Landscape Archtitecture and History of Garden Art, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zagreb, Svetošimunska 25, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia, karlovic@agr.hr 2 Department of Pomology, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zagreb 3 Department of Pharmaceutical Botany, Pharmaceutical Botanical Garden “Fran Kušan”, Faculty of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Zagreb Abstract: Ruscus hypoglossum L. is an attractive ornamental plant which is being over-harvested from the nature. In order to obtain information on phenotypic variability of natural populations growing in Croatia, initial screening of morphological characters interesting from the ornamental point of view was performed. Twelve natural populations were included in the investigation and following traits were analyzed: stem and internode length, length and width of the cladodes and bracts, total number of cladodes and bracts per stem as well as the ratio between length and width of the cladodes and bracts. Analyzed populations and morphological traits showed variability. The longest average stem length (56.13 cm), internode length (5.67 cm), total number of cladodes (17.87) and bracts per stem (16.00) was recorded in the Vrbovsko Japlenica population. Total number of bracts per stem was the trait that varied the most with a coefficient of variability up to 73.64%. Cluster analysis showed that the Nerezine and Vrbovsko Japlenica populations differed the most form the other investigated populations. These two populations, together with the Skupica population, are the most interesting for further investigation and future selection. Keywords: ornamental plant, wild-harvest, germplasm, variability. Introduction Ruscus hypoglossum L. is an evergreen subshrub belonging to the Liliaceae family. Yeo (1980) reports occurrence of this species in Italy, Austria, former Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Rumania, Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey, Crimea (Ukraine) and former Yugoslavia. In Croatia this species occurs in several localities in the continental parts of the country and there are also reports of a few locations in the Mediterranean area of Croatia. R. hypoglossum is highly ornamental and since there is no production of this species in Croatia, it is subjected to illegal wild collecting. Problem of irrational use of natural resources and the need to reduce environmental degradation has been emphasized by many scientists (Várallyay, 2007; Vásáry et al. 2007) which has helped in promoting the need to impose legislation measures. In Croatia, as well as in many other European countries where it is distributed, R. hypoglossum is either legally protected and/or included in the national Red Data Books. The Council of Europe (COE; 1996) lists Ruscus hypoglossum as one of the wild plant species which is subjected to exploitation and commerce and in its Recommendation no. 49, favours the idea that such commerce should rely principally on specimens produced by artificial propagation. Commercial production of endangered species can prevent collection from the wild and reduce the danger of a species becoming extinct (Noordegraf, 2000). Introduction of new crops into cultivation includes many research stages that begin with initial search and screening of germplasm and conclude when the crop is commercially available (Halevy, 2005). Initial screening of wild plants should include populations from climatologically different habitats. When studying different populations of a single species within its natural distribution areas, one may well come across populations that have genetically adapted to survival in colder environments, to drought or to other</p><p id="Pg122">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1516 environmental constraints (Hennipman, 2000). This kind of diversification, variability of genotypes gives the possibility to choose the best variety into different ecological and management conditions (Pepó, 2007). The goal of this research was to perform initial morphological characterization and investigate phenotypic diversity of twelve populations of R. hypoglossum from continental and Mediterranean parts of Croatia and to determine potentially interesting populations for further selection and cultivation for the ornamental market. Materials and methods Morphological traits of eleven populations of R. hypoglossum from the continental parts of Croatia and one population from Mediterranean Croatia were investigated (Table 1). Each population was represented with 15 randomly selected plants. From every plant one completely developed, healthy, fertile shoot was selected for measurements. The following traits were measured: stem and internode length, length and width of the cladodes and bracts, total number of cladodes and bracts per stem. In order to get an insight to cladodes and bract shape, two new traits were calculated from the four previously mentioned: ratio between length and width of the cladodes and ratio between length and width of the bracts. A larger ratio indicated more elongated, narrower cladodes and bracts while a smaller ratio indicated wider and more rotund cladodes and bracts. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics and cluster analysis. Cluster analysis of the twelve populations based on Euclidean distance matrix was performed using the Unweighted Pair-Group Average Method (UPGMA) with NTSYSpc (Rohlf, 1990). Results and discussion The biggest average stem length (56.13 cm), internode length (5.67 cm), total number of cladodes (17.87) as well as total number of bracts per shoot (16.00) was recorded in the VJ population (Fig 1 and 2). The N population had the narrowest cladodes and bracts with the width/length ratio for cladodes and bracts of 4.3 and 3.6, respectively. Conversely, in the S population the widest cladodes and also the shortest stems (23.5 cm) and internode length (2.47 cm) were recorded. Variability coefficients for stem length ranged from 11.26% (N population) to 24.90% (S population). Total number of bracts per stem was the trait exhibiting the most variation; the variability coefficient for this trait was as high as 73.64% in the VGD population (data not shown). Cluster analysis showed that the N and VJ populations differed the most from the other investigated populations (Fig. 3). Unexpectedly, VJ and VGD did not cluster together even though they are geographically very close and are growing in similar conditions. It could be that specific micro-climate or even mutation is responsible for this divergence. The populations VJ and N exhibited the longest stems while demonstrating at the same time stability in this trait (cv = 15%; cv=11%, respectively) and are therefore interesting as a source for further selection and cultivation for cut foliage while S population, with its short stems and wider cladodes could be interesting as a pot plant. Population N is interesting not only because of distinctive morphological traits but because it is the only population from the Mediterranean part of the country: it grows in conditions of extreme summer drought, high summer temperatures and high sun exposure. For these</p><p id="Pg123">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1517 reasons it falls ideally into the category of “peripheral population”. Plants from these populations may be more tolerant of extreme ecological conditions (drought, heat, etc), may exhibit resistance to diseases or pests, or may be adaptable to a different soil type or condition (O’Brien, 1996).

The N and VJ populations, together with S population, are the most interesting for further investigation and future selection. However, before coming to any final conclusions, all of the potentially interesting populations must be subjected to field trials to evaluate plant performance under the same growing conditions. Further field trials will show how much of the observed variability belongs to the influence of genotype and how much of it was under the influence of environment.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1519 OXIDATIVE STRESS IN RADISH PLANTS GROWN ON SOILS WITH DIFFERENT Cu AND Pb LEVEL Tomislav VINKOVIĆ 1 - Nada PARAĐIKOVIĆ 1 - Hrvoje LEPEDUŠ2 - Ivna ŠTOLFA2- Tihana TEKLIĆ1 1 Faculty of agriculture Osijek, University of J.J. Strossmayer, Trg Sv. Trojstva 3, 31 000 Osijek, Croatia, e-mail: tvinkovic@pfos.hr 2 Department of biology, University of J.J. Strossmayer, Trg Lj. Gaja 6, 31 000 Osijek, Croatia Abstract: This research shows the antioxidative response in radish grown on soils with an elevated Cu and Pb content. Plants grown on soils with higher heavy metal content showed increased activities of guaiacol peroxidase, catalase and lipid peroxidation rate. Increased content of total polyphenols, proteins and proline was observed in the same plants. In general, Cu accumulation was more pronounced in leaves and Pb in hypocotyl. It can be concluded that growing radish on soils enriched with these heavy metals leads to oxidative stress in plants and the risk of Pb accumulation in plant edible part (hypocotyl) can not be neglected. Keywords: catalase, heavy metal stress, lipid peroxidation, peroxidase, polyphenols, proline, radish Introduction One of the environmental stress factors for plants is the toxicity of heavy metals in contaminated soil. They can take effect through the soil-plants-water-animals-man food chain, because they affect to the enzymatic and physiological processes (Bálint et al., 2007). Stress tolerance is thus based on the activation of antioxidant compounds and antioxidant enzyme systems which are capable of neutralising the effects of stress factors (El-Tayeb, 2006; Balla et al., 2007). In stressed plants, higher activity of antioxidative enzymes such as peroxidases (El-Tayeb, 2006) and accumulation of protective components such as proline and other osmoprotectants (Ashraf and Foolad, 2007) are parameters of their stress tolerance. As reported by Prokisch et al. (2006), in the case of Cu, the country scale measurement shows elevated anthropogenic Cu concentration at numerous sites, because of the frequent usage of Cu sulphate based pesticides. Lead accumulation in urban and suburban soils can be explained by longterm usage of fosil fuels. Recently, more attention is paid on health effects of particulate matters and heavy metal pollution effects on food production, (Flachner and Bozo, 2006). The aim of this study was to evaluate plant uptake of Cu and Pb from soil, lipid peroxidation level, protein, total polyphenols and free proline content as well as activity of guaiacol peroxidase and catalase in radish leaves and hypocotyls. Materials and methods Seedlings of two radish (Raphanus sativus L. var. sativus) cultivars (Cherry Belle and Saxa) were cultivated in commercial substrate in glasshouse conditions. At three to four leaf stage, the uniform plantlets were transferred to plastic pots (10 L volume) filled with two soil types, one urban soil with lower (Pbl - control) and higher (Pbh - excessive supply) Pb content and the other soil with lower (Cul - control) and higher (Cuh - excessive supply) Cu content was taken from vineyard area (Table 1). Both experiments were settled in four replicates per treatment and each replicate had twenty plants. Radish plants were grown outdoors for 50 days (May 22 – July 12, 2007), with mean daily temperature of 19.2oC and regular watering with tap water when necessary, until the full formation of radish hypocotyls. Lipid peroxidation level was estimated as the amount of</p><p id="Pg126">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1520 thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) after Heath and Packer (1968). Total peroxidase activity (GPOX) was determined using guaiacol as a substrate (Siegel and Galston, 1967), and total catalase activity (CAT) was evaluated after Aebi (1984). Protein content (PRO) was estimated after Bradford (1976) and free proline (PRL) as described by Bates et al. (1973). Total polyphenols content (POL) was evaluated as an equivalent of tannic acid (Turkmen et al., 2006). Soil agrochemical properties were determined using standard laboratory methods and analysis (Table 1). Table 1.

The concentration of Cu and Pb in soil and plant was measured by AAS and expressed in mg kg-1 soil or plant dry matter (after wet digestion). Each experiment had a split-split plot design with factors: plant part (A), cultivar (B) and soil (C). The results were statistically analyzed using ANOVA and Ftest. Results and discussion This research shows that radish response to Cu and Pb stress depended on plant part in question (factor A), cultivar (factor B), HM content in the soil (factor C) and their interactions (Tables 2 and 3). Concerning both HMs, TBARS differed significantly between cultivars, plant parts and treatments (P≤0.01). CAT activity was significantly increased (P≤0.01) in plants grown on Pb enriched soil both in leaves and hypocotyls, with higher (P≤0.05) activity observed in leaves. GPOX had the same activity trend both in excessive Pb and Cu soil, where it was significantly higher (P≤0.01) as compared to related controls. In general, GPOX activity was higher in hypocotyls than in leaves and significantly differed (P≤0.01) between cultivars. Total POL content was significantly higher (P≤0.01) in plants grown on soil with excessive Pb and Cu content as compared to related controls. Phenolic substances play an important role in protecting plants against biotic and abiotic stresses and the enhancement of their metabolism is one of the responses to heavy metal stress, as they are reductants they may scavenge AOS or chelate heavy metals (Górecka et al., 2007). Regarding the PRL content, its accumulation in radish was significantly higher (P≤0.01) in excessive Pb and Cu soil supply. Generally, hypocotyls had significantly higher (P≤0.01) PRL content than leaves. PRO content showed similar pattern in both experiments and was significantly higher in plants grown on soils with higher HM level.</p><p id="Pg127">VII.

Conclusions Growing on soils with an excessive Cu and Pb content, radish plants showed increased TBARS level and activation of GPOX and CAT as well as the accumulation of PRL, POL and PRO. All investigated parameters had higher values on soils with higher heavy metal content except for CAT activity in leaves in Cu experiment. Cu accumulation was more pronounced in leaves, whilst Pb accumulated in hypocotyl. Since hypocotyl is an edible part, it is recommendable to avoid growing radish on soils possibly enriched with Pb, such as urban gardens and fields near the high-traffic roads.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1523 MODELLING SOIL FLUXES OF NITROGEN AND CARBON GASES ABOVE A SEMI ARID GRASSLAND IN HUNGARY Balázs GROSZ 1 – László HORVÁTH 2 – Attila MACHON 3 1 Institute of Chemistry, Eötvös Loránd University, Pázmány P. sétány 1/A, 1117 Budapest, Hungary grosz@mail.datanet.hu 2 Hungarian Meteorological Service, Gilice tér 39, 1181 Budapest, Hungary 3 Institute of Botany and Ecophysiology, Szent István University, Páter Károly utca 1, 2103 Gödöllő, Hungary Abstract: Using the DNDC biogeochemical model we have estimated the soil emissions of greenhouse gases as CO2, N2O and CH4 and emission of some other nitrogen forms (NO, N2, NH3). Direct determinations of these gasses are difficult due to the expensive instrumentations and/or the problem of the generalization and upscaling of measurements. Soil flux of CH4 was negligible compared to CO2 emission. Emissions of NO and NH3 were more effective comparing to rates of N2 and N2O. Modelled emissions are in good agreement with the measured fluxes. Keywords: modelling, DNDC, trace gasses, grassland Introduction The exact knowledge of trace gas fluxes within ecosystems and atmosphere is important both from point of view of ecosystems and atmospheric environment. There are two ways to estimate the fluxes, i.e. the measurement and modelling. Measurements are expensive and require sophisticated equipments and the generalization of results to other regions is limited. By modelling we can estimate the fluxes for larger regions but the disadvantage of models is the need of huge quantity of input data based also on measurements. Generally, modellers are using measurement data for validation and/or calibration of models. There are some models simulating the ecological processes successfully, like e.g. Biome-BGC model (Hidy et al., 2007) for CO2, but do not estimate all of trace gas emissions from soil. In this study, we applied the DNDC (Denitrification-Decomposition) biogeochemical model for the evaluation of soil gas fluxes like NH3, CH4, CO2, N2, NO and N2O. The model consists of two parts. The first part includes the crop growth, meteorological and soil parameters and evaluates the pH, redox potential, vegetation characteristics and farming practice. The second one is modelling the soil properties and estimates the gas fluxes. Materials and methods The modelled site lies in the middle of Hungary, in Kiskunság National Park, called Bugac puszta (46°41´ N 19°36´ E). The experimental site is a semi natural, semi arid, sandy grassland. Dominant plant species are Festuca pseudovina, Carex stenophylla and Salvia pratensis. Hungarian Grey Cattle are grazing (0.5-0.8 cattle ha-1) in the period of investigations. The DNDC model requires three groups of input parameters. The first one consists of soil parameters, which includes particular information of soil texture, soil type, pH, bulk density, SOC, etc. The second group is the meteorological dataset like daily maximum and minimum air temperatures (°C), daily precipitation (mm), global radiation (MJ m-2 day-1), and finally, the third group is the farming management (Changsheng et al., 2000). However, there are lots of opportunities to choose different types of farming practices, in our case, there was only a slight grazing at low cattle density.</p><p id="Pg130">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Soil fluxes of different gases at Bugac-puszta, in 2006 As figures 1-5 show, yearly pattern of fluxes reflects to meteorological conditions like rain or dry, hot weather and we can also observe correlation between the soil parameters and daily fluxes. Most important parameter governing the soil fluxes is the soil temperature causing peak values in summer months in parallel with increasing soil temperature. The rate of denitrification and nitrification and other microbial activity strongly depend on temperature. Other important factor is the soil water content that controls the share of N2, N2O and NO production. High peaks for fluxes of N2, N2O and NO occurred in Mach are in connection with melting and the subsequent sudden emission of N forms gathered during frozen period in soil. From the results in Table 1 we can follow that exchange of methane is practically negligible, while among of different N forms emissions of NO and NH3 were more effective comparing to rates of N2 and N2O. The low ratio of N2 and N2O in soil N fluxes is the consequence of the unusual dry soil, when denitrification processes were suppressed and circumstances favour the NO production by nitrification. Conclusions The results of the simulation show, DNDC model is a good tool to estimate the soil fluxes of gases. Measured and modelled fluxes are in good agreement and it gives a good chance to estimate the trace gas fluxes in regional scale, for the whole country.

The results obtained suggest, that the impact of the production site on soybean quality is remarkable, especially regarding oil- and raw protein contents. This phenomena could be experienced both in case of early and mid-early varieties, though not in the same degree. Keywords: soybean, quality, effects of the production area, cultivars, oil, fat, raw protein Introduction Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) is the leading oil and protein crop of the world, which is used as a nutrition source for both human consumption and animal breeding and many other industrial purposes, respectively (Sudaric, 2007). Soy can exceedingly be produced in the regions apt for it in Hungary. This means, considering both ecological and soil makings nearby 300000 ha land appropriate for soy production. (Kajdi in Antal, 2005) Owing to it’s protein and oil contents soybean is indispensable in forage production furthermore, it plays an increasing role in human consumption not only in our country but all over the world. Soybean is a leguminous crop the production of which has, therefore, a N-supplementing effect on the soil as well as a remedial effect on soil structure which makes energy- and watersparing soil management possible. By increasing the proportion of the crop area of legume plants the proportion of plants with high dry matter production deepening chronic drought situation and overtaxing the waterstock of the soil will be reduced. The evolution of herbicid resistance can be detained by soy production and on the other hand it offers an opportunity for the control of resistant weeds developed in the grain phase. The economic copulation of soil is very easy same as that of all other legume plants, and it is also a very important export produce. It can be stated on the whole that the production of legume plants increases the general level of agriculture. (Balikó, 2003) Through the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen by a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria (Rhizobium spp.) legume plants, such as soybean play a very important role in sustainable agriculture. (Andric et al, 2007) The experimental results of Redzepovic et al. (2007) show that the type of soil has a significant effect on the activity of the symbiosis between soybean and the soil bacteria Rhizobium Japonicum and hereby also on the extent of N-fixation and consequently on protein contents as well. The soybean has 13 recognized ripening groups: 000, 00, 0, and from I to X. The groups marked by low numbers (000-IV) demand a longer day for blooming so the northern areas where the nights are shorter in the vegetation period fit them better.</p><p id="Pg134">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

(Balikó, 2003) Materials and methods Our experiments were conducted in the years 2006 and 2007, at two production sites: at the Szárítópuszta Agricultural Training Farm in Gödöllő, and in the area of the Bóly Agricultural PLC in Bóly. Considering agroecological conditions the two production areas are remarkably different:  In Bóly the soil of the experimental area is brown forest soil with clay slosh with low humus content (1-1,5 %) and poor nutrient supply, but with good air, heath and water utilization. The area being situated in the southern part of the Transdanubium is one of the oldest soybean growing areas of the country. Thanks to the hig temperature amount and the long sunlit period the soybean crop is rich in the area.  Szárítópuszta in Gödöllő is situated in the northern region of the country with a much cooler wheather than that of Bóly. The soil here is also brown forest soil with clay slosh and poor nutrient supply. Four new varieties not yet wide-spread in the domestic production have been tested in the two different production areas within the framework of small-plot experiment with a traditional Hungarian variety applied for control. The varieties have been:  Bóbita: mid-early control variety. The variety gained state recognition in 2001. The holder of both the variety authorization and maintenance is the Bóly Plc. Utilization purpose: animal feed.  Altapro: early Canadian variety. Utilization purpose: human consumption. Year of recognition: 2006.  Minnpro: early Canadian variety. Purpose of utilization: human consumption. Recognized in 2006.  Primapro: very early Canadian variety. Utilization purpose: human consumption. Date of recognition: 2006.  Royalpro: mid-early Canadian variety. Utilization purpose: human consumption. Year of recognition: 2006. Raw protein and fat contents have been analysed after harvesting in case of both production sites. These components have been stipulated in proportion of weight percentage by an Instalab 600 NIR type measuring instrument on the one hand and in case of protein contents appllying a destruction method ont he other hand. Results and discussion The results of two years are available from both production sites concerning all the four varieties subject to the experiment as well as the control variety. In case of the four new varieties included in the experiment bred lately in Canada it has been one of the breeding purposes that the varieties should be capable of a high protein performance even in production areas with relatively cool wheather circumstances. In the year 2006 the average temperature was 0,6°C higher and the level of rainfall somewhat lower than usual in the country but the monthly values of both the</p><p id="Pg135">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1529 temperature and the rainfall showed a strong diversity. The quantity of rainfall notably exceeded the ususal level in spring, sowing could, therefore, regrettably be done much later than ideal, late May only on both experimental areas. The summer was extraordinarily hot, with several sizzling days followed by a long, warm and dry autumn advantageous for the ripening of the soybean. The Figures 2 and 3 show the oil and raw protein contents of the different verieties int the first year of the experiment. It can be observed, that the protein contents of the soy harvested in Bóly were higher in case of every variety while the oil contents were higher int he northern region in Szárítópuszta. The variety Altapo showed the highest protein contents on both sites, while the control variety Bóbita and Primapro proved to be the best regarding oil contents. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 B ób ita (K ) Al ta pr o M in np ro P rim ap ro Ro ya lp ro Á tla g Row protein % Oil % 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 Bó bi ta (K ) Al ta pr o M in np ro Pr im ap ro R oy al pr o Át la g Row protein % Oil % Figure 1.Oil and protein contents Figure 2.: Oil and protein contents 2006, Bóly 2006, Szárítópuszta The dry winter of 2007 was followed by an also extraordinarily dry spring with remarkable rainfall in March only. The summer was also hot and and even drier than usual. In this year soy bean was sown in the ideal time, early April. The plants grew well in both areas and thanks to the regular mechanical weed control the plant stock was free of weeds. The harvesting tokk place late Sptember. The Figures 3 and 4 show the oil and protein contents of the crop. The variety Altapo showed an outstanding performance regarding protein contents this year as well. Similar to the previous year the oil contents were higher in Szárítópuszta in 2007 again, and the oil contents of the varieties Bóbita and Royalpro were repeatedly the highest both in Bóly and Szárítópuszta production sites. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 B ób ita (K ) A lta pr o M in np ro P rim ap ro R oy al pr o Á tla g Row protein (%) Oil (%) 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Bó b i ta Al ta pr o M in np ro Pr im ap ro R oy al pr o Av er ag e Row protein (%) Oil (%) Figure 3.

Cereal Research Communications 1530 It can be stated in case of both vintages examined that the protein contents of all the four new varieteies as well as that of the control variety were higher in 2007 than in 2006. This is most probably due to the warmer summer, i.e. the vintage effect. Comparing the oil content results of the two years the figures are, quite on the contrary, higher in 2006 in case of each variety. Conclusions On the basis of the results of the experiment it can be assessed that among the new soybean varieties bred for cooler territories the protein contents of Altapro have been notably high also on the Szárítópuszta experimental site in the northern part of the country. Furthermore, the figures have been nearby as high as in Bóly, so this variety is outstandingly apt for production also in the northern territories of Hungary. Additionally it can be stated that the cooler production site and the relatively cold vintage and the poor soil nutritional value have resulted in higher oil contents and lower protein performance in case of all the five varieties so we can come to the conclusion that the qaulity parameters of soybean are intensively effected by the production site’s soil-climatic factors. A further important aim of the experiment among others was to decide if the soybean varieties concerned can be recommanded for production int he Gödöllő region as their preceding crop effects are very useful. Knowing the results of the experiment we recommend all the four varieties for production as their protein performance on the Szárítópuszta production site was in both years substantially higher than that of the variety Bóbita traditionally produced in Hungary.

The lower fertilization resulted in better agronomic traits and lower production costs than the higher rate. The studied traits were more influenced by location then by fertilization rate. Keywords: flue-cured tobacco, reduced fertilization, nutrient use efficiency Introduction Mineral fertilization of flue-cured tobacco should provide sufficient quantities of accessible nutrients, for good yield and quality at lower costs. Numerous authors investigated effect of nitrogen or of all the three macronutrients, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium on various cultivated plant species like wheat (Varga et al., 2007; Baric et al., 2006), corn (Izsáki, 2007; Mesić et al., 2007), canola (Nemeth et al., 2007), cotton (Venugopalan et al., 2007) and tobacco (Marchetti et al., 2006; Sifola and Postiglione, 2003; MacKown et al., 1999; Sisson et al., 1991). When one considers fertilizer quantities needed for tobacco crop, it is important to bear in mind all the factors which affect plant growth (Hawks and Collins, 1993; Marchetti et al., 2006). Excessive fertilization, even without negative effects on yield affects farmers income directly, by increasing production costs, or indirectly, by negative influence on the quality of cured leaf (Marchetti et al., 2006). Through leaching and denitrification, nitrogen is responsible for agriculture-related pollution. Therefore cultivars with high nutrient use efficiency would be interesting for production. Improvement of flue-cured tobacco cultivars in nitrogen use efficiency has been made over time (Sisson et al., 1991). The objective of this study was to assess differences among the Croatian flue-cured tobacco cultivars in fertilizer use efficiency for the commercial production purposes. Materials and methods Factorial experiments including flue-cured tobacco cultivars and two fertilization rates, were conducted at two locations, Kutjevo (silt loam soil), and Virovitica (sand loam soil), during the 2000, 2001, and 2002 growing seasons. In the first and second year there were five, and in third year eight flue-cured tobacco cultivars under study. Two applied fertilization rates were: 60 kg N, 35 kg P2O5 and 210 kg K2O per ha (NPK/60:35:210), and, 40 kg N, 25 kg P2O5 and 150 kg K2O per ha (NPK/40:25:150). Each year experiment was set up as randomized complete block design (RCBD), with</p><p id="Pg138">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1532 four replications and three 22 plant rows per each experimental plot. Planting distance was 100 cm between and 50 cm within rows. Twenty plants of the middle row were analyzed for morphological traits at plant topping time: number of days to flowering, plant height, and leaf number per plant. Harvesting was performed by insertions from plant base to plant top when each leaf insertion was adequately ripe. Curing was in bulk curing barns with heated air flow. Cured leaf was classified into six commercial grades. From leaf yield and proportion of grades of an experimental plot, and price (kn kg-1 *) of each grade, yield (kg ha-1) and average price (kn kg-1) of each experimental plot was calculated. Value of each experimental plot was calculated by multiplying its average price and respective yield, and expressed as value per ha (kn ha-1). For each year, combined analysis of variance was carried out taking fertilizations and genotypes as fixed effects. LSD test was used for comparison of means. * 1€ = 7.35 kn Results and discussion In 2000, significant difference between the fertilization rates was found only for plant height, while the studied cultivars differed significantly in all the studied traits (Table 1).

Fertilization x cultivar interaction was significant for plant height and leaf number, and cultivar x location interaction for yield. Sisson et al. (1991) found genetic variability in nitrogen use efficiency in flue-cured tobacco. Collins and Hawks (1993) suggested applying nitrogen fertilizer in quantity of 50 to 80 lbs per acre depending on the topsoil depth and cultural practice. In our study the flue-cured tobacco cultivars gave good agronomic results at the lower fertilization rate. Similarly Marchetti et al. (2006) recommended applying 40 kg of N ha-1 for growing flue-cured tobacco in northern Italy. Conclusions The fertilization with 40 kg N, 25 kg P2O5 and 150 kg K2O per ha resulted in better agronomic traits than the fertilization with 60 kg N, 35 kg P2O5 and 210 kg K2O per ha. The former fertilization rate could be recommended for commercial flue-cured tobacco production in the tobacco growing regions of Croatia. The lower rate reduces production costs, and can be treated as more environmental friendly. The studied traits varied more with genotype and location than with the fertilization rate.

The aim of the small-plot field experiments is to evaluate the impacts of growing technology factors (tillage, crop number, crop rotation, irrigation) on the yield of maize hybrids. This research is part of a several step laboratory examination which aims to detect the most suitable maize hybrids for bioethanol production analyzing a great number of maize hybrids. Keywords: starch, maize hybrids, small-plot experiment Introduction This examination was the first of a several stage study to select the most suitable maize hybrids which later may be the feedstocks of bioethanol plants in Hungary. The aim of the small-plot field experiments is to evaluate the impacts of growing technology factors (tillage, crop number, crop rotation, irrigation) on the yield of maize hybrids, the quality of maize and maize starch and bioethanol productivity. The experiment site is located on the Hajdúság loess ridge, its soil is Great Plain chernozem with lime deposits developed on loess with deep mould layers. The net area of a parcel is: 121,6 m2 , the examinated block occupies an area of 12,0 ha (120,6 m2 x 100 hybrid). The maize hybrids commonly produced in Hungary chosen for bioethanol production where set up in the experiment. The long-term experiment is arranged split-split-plot, on the main parcels there are cultivation and irrigation varieties without repetition. The maize hybrids are planted onto the primary sub-parcels with a plant number of 50-70 thousand, while the fertilization treatment takes place randomised on the secondary sub-parcels in four repetitions. The tillage block occupies an area of 8064 m2 that is divided into an irrigated and a non-irrigated block. The specially examined maize hybrids in 2007 are: DKC (DE); (DE) Tarján; (DE) Koppány. The size of the main parcel set up with each maize hybrid is 2688 m2, while the size of the parcel of fertilizer treatments is 336 m2. The net area of a parcel is 30 m2. Bioethanol feedstock: The selection of the most appropriate feedstock for ethanol production strongly depends on the local conditions. Evidently, European countries such as Hungary plans to base its ethanol industry on starchy materials due to the agroecological conditions. Hungary is situated in Europe’s corn producing zone therefore, one fourth of all tillage area is occupied by corn fields (Nagy, 2006; Hingyi et al., 2006) For ethanol production purpose big variations in different maize hybrids occur in starch content. Az elmúlt évtizedben a növénynemesítők munkájának köszönhetően jelentős mértékben, mintegy 10-15%-kal nőtt a gabonafélék hozama, javult a genetikai állomány és hatékonyabb lett a növények tápanyag-felhasználása is.</p><p id="Pg142">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Infratec 1241 Grain Analyzer is a Near Infrared Transmission (NIT) instrument which is capable of simultaneous and accurate determination of several constituents in whole grain samples. The measurements are based on the fact that the main constituents in the grain (corn), such as protein, moisture, starch, fat and others, absorb electromagnetic radiation in the near-infrared region of the spectrum. Since the Infratec 1241 Grain Analyzer uses transmission absorption, sample preparation is unnecessary. Results and discussion We compared and statistically analysed starch content and starch productivity per hectare under the application of various growing technologies in small-plot experiments. Field experiments will make it possible to examine the impact of various production factors on bioethanol yield. The laboratory analysis of maize samples where made in the laboratory of the Center of Agricultural Sciences. The Near Infrared Transmission (NIT) examination detected, oil, protein, moisture, test weight as well as the starch content of all the 100 hybrids. Results were displayed and dumped via a modem cable to a PC. After having all the results statistical tools were used to organize the database. The data of starch content (%) was evaluated with various statistical methods. The comparison of samples showed a significant difference between the various maize hybrids starch content (Figure 1). The smallest starch content measured was 53,5% which seems to be insufficient for energy purpose production of bioethanol. Hybrids with 60-62% starch content or less are only eligible for different utilization (animal feed, human consumption etc) (Figure 2). The average starch content of the hybrids were 59,6 %.The maximum starch content of a hybrid was 64% and the minimum was 53,5%, therefore the range is 9,7%. In Hungary maize hybrids with 67-73% are outstanding and the average is at about 63%, but the range is significantly wide. From the three hybrids showed inthe figures DKC (DE) had the highest starch content which was 62,75% (Figure 4). The next figure (Figure 5) shows the effect of cultivation type (autumn ploughing, disk ripper treatment, spring ploughing) on the maize hybrids starch content. Hybrids cultivated in autumn ploughing reached an average starch content of 62,925% which was the highest of all three cultivation cases. The autumn ploughing is the most favourable for hihg starch content maize production. Our examination was carried out for the effect of fertilization on hybrids starch contnet aswell (Figure 6), showing that unfertilized samples reached the highest starch content. Our case showes that the less fertilized hybrids (120kg N/ha) had better starch levels than the hybrids recieving the double amount of fertilizer. The effect of irrigation is</p><p id="Pg143">VII.

Conclusions According to economic forecasts, the demand for maize is expected to increase continuously on the European and World market. Maize has been playing a decisive role in the Hungarian plant growing for decades. The Hungarian crop and seed production – considering the excellent Hungarian ecological conditions – and the use of Hungarian hybrids has a determining role in the agricultural production and export, as 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 s ta rc h ( % ) D E 3 7 D E 3 5 D E 3 4 D E 3 2 D E 2 8 D E 2 4 D E 2 1 D E 1 8 D E 1 5 D E 1 0 D E 9 D E 7 D E 3 hybrid (coded) Hybrid starch content (%) 48 50 52 54 56 58 60 62 64 m a iz e h y b ri d ( c o d e d ) D E 1 D E 7 D E 1 3 D E 1 9 D E 2 5 D E 3 1 D E 3 7 D E 4 3 D E 4 9 D E 5 5 D E 6 1 D E 6 7 D E 7 3 starch (%) Starch content of maize hybrids (%)</p><p id="Pg144">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1538 well as in the increase of the income producing capability in rural areas. The success of maize production is provided by the improvement of the yield stability of maize hybrids. Therefore it is an important task to choose the hybrids best suitable for the regional fundamentals. It is not an easy task, as the number of hybrids authorised for common growing was 365 in Hungary in 2006. Adaptability, drought resistance and grain moisture content at harvesting became the most important aspects in choosing maize hybrids in Hungary, as these are the factors affecting the profitability of maize production the most. In the past years, the highest drying costs were imposed on producers. Therefore the issue of choosing the most suitable hybrids from the point of bioethanol production became important again. It is very important for the producers to choose the hybrids carefully and realise an acceptable yield, independent of the crop year to come (dry, medium, wet crop year). The results of the small-plot experiments can give a reliable basis for the decision. The results of multifactoral long-term field experiments make it possible to get more acquainted with the adaptability, nutriment and water utilization and water take-off ability of maize hybrids. The dry weather of the recent years proves that one of the most important limiting factors in Hungary is the quantity and distribution of precipitation. Given this knowledge, the researchers, developers and producers should equally pay great attention to choose the most suitable hybrids on the given production site. The adaptability and drought-resistance became one of the most important requirements in choosing the Hungarian maize hybrids. The outputs of grain sector are acknowledged on an international level also. Owing to our ecological fundamentals, traditions and expertise, this sector has significant comparative advantages compared to the fundamentals of several European countries. On one hand we really have significant results regarding volume and outputs, on the other hand the efficiency of production, the profit producing ability, the degree of the products’ processing and the logistics background show a great backwardness compared to that of the more developed European Union states (Harsányi et al., 2006). The available arable land for dedicated bioenergy crop cultivation of Hungary will continue to raise for 413,000 ha until 2010 and this tendency will grow further on basis of CAPSIM-calculations. Parallel to this tendency, the employment rate of agriculture will increase as well, solving the problem of unemployment (Harsányi et al., 2007).

It is important they have a well-developed root. Inoculation by the mycorrhizal fungi influences better development of the root, and consequently more exuberant plant development and earlier flowering. Seeds of Tagetes patula were sown in substrate inoculated with the vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus mossae in two concentrations. This procedure produced positive effects on Tagetes compared with the control, especially in characteristics such as: number of developed leaves, flower buds and inflorescences. Keywords: Tagetes patula, Glomus mosseae, plug production, growth, flowering Introduction French marigold (Tagetes patula L.) is an ornamental annual that is excellent for bedding and planting the edge of a mixed border in parks and gardens. Numerous studies report on the nematocidal effect of marigolds with root-knot (Meloidogyne spp.) and root-lesion (Pratylenchus spp.) species in appearance being particularly sensitive to marigold species (Piedra Buena et al., 2007). Most researchers agree that Tagetes patula seems to be the most efficient marigold species in reducing root galling in plants and root-knot nematode populations in soil (Ogden, 1997). Therefore Tagetes patula as well as other species of the Tagetes genus is welcome in farming and vegetable growing crop rotations. For best nematocidal effect it is important that the root system is well developed. Numerous researches on farming cultures show positive influence of endomycorrhization by mycorrhizal fungi of Glomus. The influence on inoculation by the mycorrhizal fungi Glomus fasciculatus on wheat root length and density was researched by Singh et al. (2007); on important characteristics of root and plant Sharma et al. (2007), and generally on wheat growth Miransari et al. (2008). Research was also conducted on other important farming crops: rice (Raimam et al., 2007; Herdler et al., 2008), barley (Khaosaad et al., 2006), corn (Miransari et al., 2007). Also there was research on clovers (Fuzy et al., 2007). Besides the fact it has different influence on growth and development of different species and cultivars, well established mycorrhiza also influences absorption of nutrients from soil. Research conducted on French marigold and zinnia sown into substrate inoculated by the mycorrhizal fungus Glomus etunicatum also shows earlier and exuberant flowering. The reactions of these plants to mycorrhizal infection were shown to be independent of changes in the phosphorus, potassium and sodium content of the plants (Aboul-Nasr, 1995). Linderman and Davis (2004) report that marigolds generally become mycorrhizal but do not always exhibit significant responsiveness under P-limiting conditions (Graw, 1979; Ezawa and Yoshida, 1994; Aboul-Nasr, 1995).

Therefore the goal of this research was to determine the influence of endomycorrhiza on growth and development of the Tagetes patula, inoculated by the mycorrhizal fungus Glomus mossae. Materials and methods ‘Eco Brill’ substrate, which was sterilized before inoculation at 105º C, was used in research. After cooling the substrate to 20º C, the inoculation by the mycorrhizal fungus Glomus mossae was conducted in concentration of 0 % (M1), 3 % (M2), and 5 % (M3). Immediately, at 11th week, two seeds of the Tagetes patula cv. Bounty were sown in each pot (volume 350 ml) into substrate prepared in this way, and further growth and development was monitored until week 22. The experiment was set up in randomized block arrangement in five repetitions. After treatment there were a total of 100 growth pots. Two weeks after the sowing the number of germinated plants (GP) was noted, and they were thinned so that in each growth pot there was only one which was monitored for growth dynamics based on the following characteristics: the number of leaves counted twice (NIL and NL), plant height (PH), plant diameter (PD), shoot number (SN), number of buds (B1 and B2) and inflorescences (I1 and I2) in two turns, and the root length and density (RL and RD) at the end of the experiment. Data obtained by measuring above mentioned characters were processed by the analysis of variance. Statistical analysis of interactive relations for the tested traits was done by the standard method, based on estimating the least squares for general linear models using the GLM procedure. Before sowing and at the end of the experiment chemical analysis of the substrate was conducted (% of dry matter, pH (CaCl3), pH (H2O), NO3 mg100g-1, K2O mg100g -1, P2O5 mg100g -1).

It is visible from the table 1 that two weeks after sowing on average most plants germinated from the substrate treated by 5% inoculum. Treatment by the endomycorrhizal fungus alone didn't significantly influence the average plant height and diameter or number of shoots per plant, while during week 4 and 6 after the sowing there was a larger number of leaves per plants treated by the larger concentration of inoculum. Considering the influence of mycorrhiza on the development of buds and inflorescences, Table 1 shows that in the beginning mycorrhiza had a positive effect on the development of buds and inflorescences, while in the second measuring more buds were counted for the inoculation by 3% concentration of inoculum. Aboul-Nasr (1995) also cites earlier and more exuberant flowering of the plants of Tagetes erecta and Zinnia elegans which were grown in soil inoculated by the mycorrhizal fungus Glomus. The influence of the mycorrhiza on the root development by monitoring average values of root length and density shows that the root was shorter but denser in the larger concentration of inoculum, although the differences were not statistically significant. The results of the experiment (Linderman and Davis, 2004) also point to different reactions to inoculation by different varieties of mycorrhizal fungi on different cultivars of the Tagetes. Table 2.

The results obtained for the plant height and plant diameter also weren't significantly different, and the averagely tallest plants of the averagely largest diameter were measured for treatment with smaller percentage of inoculum. The root was averagely densest, although not significantly, in the sample treated with the 5% inoculum. Total K2O and P2O5 in mg100g -1 were smaller as the percentage of inoculum grew.

Strossmayer University, Trg Sv. Trojstva 3, 31000Osijek, Croatia, flory@pfos.hr 2 Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Zagreb, Heinzelova 55, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia Abstract: Cervid infection by giant liver fluke (Fascioloides magna) is very important problem in Europe. In Croatia, the first case of this disease was described in January 2000, in red deer (Cervus elaphus) from the Baranja region (east Croatia). The aim of our research was to determine the impact of habitat, especially soil and plants cover, on distribution of mentioned disease in deer game. The survey was carried out during 2001 – 2004 in eastern Croatia. Samples had been taken from different habitats in order to determine the presence of this parasite. For monitoring were used qualitative coprological tests. The highest number of invaded deer’s was determined in forestry-flooded areas near Danube with prevalence of 35 – 60%. In forestry habitats with mostly unfolded areas, with related flora characteristic for dry soil, presence of giant liver fluke wasn’t valid. Moor, as well as aquatic plant structure which characterise it, have very important role for expansion of giant liver fluke, and especially for his intermediate host Lymnaea (Galba) truncatula. Keywords: Fascioloides magna, red deer, Cervus elaphus, habitat, soil, plant, Croatia Introduction Giant liver fluke Fascioloides magna (Bassi, 1875) parasites in liver parenchyma of wild cervids mostly, but also (rare) in liver parenchyma of domestic ruminates. It was introduced in Europe with deer’s from American continent back in 1865, remaining there until nowadays with time vary prevalence. In second half of the XXth century limited enzootic area was determined in Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria (Majoros and Sztojkov, 1994; Rajsky et al., 1994; Ursprung et al., 2006). In Croatia, F. magna was described for the first time in red deer in January 2000 (Marinculić et al., 2002). The occurrence of F. magna in those countries is limited to the Danube inundation territory where intermediate host Lymnaea (Galba) truncatula is present abundantly (Špakulová et al., 1997). The aim of this study was to determine the impact of habitat, especially soil and vegetation cover, on distribution of F. magna in Croatia, and foresee its further expansion. Materials and methods From 2001-2004, faecal samples of red deer (Cervus elaphus) were collected in six hunting grounds (altitude range 82-626 m ASL) in eastern Croatia. In the hunting ground XIV/9 Podunavlje-Podravlje (area of 25.533 ha; 82-86 m ASL), where the first Croatian case of F. magna was found, samples were collected in 15 locations. In hunting grounds XIV/11 Šarkanj-Vrblje (1.337 ha; 85-86 m ASL), XIV/3 Haljevo (1.681 ha; 90-101 m ASL), XIV/10A Podravlje (8.410 ha; 86-90 m ASL), XI/15 Krndija II (6.740 ha; 266-626 m ASL) and XIV/2 Đurđenica (22.350 ha; 95-102 m ASL) samples were collected on 2 (sub)locations. Three hunting grounds are located in flooded area of Danube and Drava River and three in unfolded area. A sedimentation</p><p id="Pg150">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1544 technique for detection of F. magna eggs was carried out to determine fluke egg counts from collected faecal samples (Thienpont et al., 1979). Eggs were observed in Petri dishes under microscope (magnification 100 X and 200 X). The prevalence was calculated as a percentage of positive samples from collected samples. The statistical analysis was carried out by a computer program STATISTICA (StatSoft 7.1). Results and discussion Table 1. Number of examined and positive faecal samples of red deer (Cervus elaphus) on eggs of F. magna in flooded and unfolded habitats From the data presented in Table 1., it is obvious that the highest number of positive samples were in hunting grounds XIV/9 "Podunavlje-Podravlje", where the first case of fasciloidoses in Croatia, was found, and also in hunting XIV/11 Šarkanj – Vrblje. Those two hunting grounds are located in eastern Croatia in forestry – flooded area near the Danube River, and according to its biological and ecological characteristics make one entirety with the most quality habitats and with the biggest population of deer game. The highest prevalence in those hunting grounds can be explained considering its continental and hydrological connections via Danube. Owing to hydrological regime of Danube, the main characteristic of these habitats is that they are flooded the most time over the year. After water recession, on forest ground remains water retentions (Biba et al., 2006; Štekauerová et al., 2006), which are extremely useful media for development of intermediate host – snail Lymnaea truncatula. Moreover, according Gusev and Novák (2007), Nagy et al. (2007) and Stehlová (2007) soil water which belongs to the class of subsurface water represents the major volume of terrestrial water resources. Also, with regard to hydrological connection of hunting grounds in Hungary with those in Croatia, in which F. magna occurred at the first time, it is possible that developing forms of F. magna had been introduced in Croatian area via Danube not only with red deer, but also via snails brought during the flood. Mayoros and Sztojkov (1994) reported of similar possibilities of giant liver fluke entry from Slovakia to Hungary.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1545 and hydrological conditions for development of intermediate population in F. magna cycle, which is in Europe mostly a snail L. truncatula. Pintér and Szigethy (1979) reported of similar situation occurred in Szigetköz area along the Danube River in Hungary. Based on this, appearance of giant liver fluke has multiple meaning. Prior, it presents a big risk of spreading of invasion in game because of the fact that eggs of giant liver fluke can hibernate in environment (Erhardová-Kotrla, 1971) and they can be transported with water on very far distances. Depending of environmental temperatures, developing stages of F. magna can subsit in those snails differently long, till the metacercariae stay vital up to one year, especially in areas free of frost, because swamp vegetation is of great importance for their survival (Griffiths and Christensen, 1972). Undoubtedly, an important role has swamp ground of those habitats, as well as characteristic plants serving as habitat for snails, but also as a media on which (meta)cercariae will make a capsule. This statement are supported with results of our researches (Table 1.) which confirms spreading of F. magna during 2003 and 2004 from primary focus along the Danube River on nearby flooded habitats along the Drava River (Hunting Ground XIV/10A Podravlje), with optimal conditions for development of giant liver fluke and his intermediate host. In hunting grounds along the Danube River, the prevalence was between 35 and 60%, while along the Drava River it was considerably lover (Figure 1.), which could be referred to initial faze of spreading. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 2001 2002 2003 2004 Year P r e v a le n c e ( % ) Podunavlje - Podravlje Šarkanj - Vrblje Podravlje Figure 1. Invasion prevalence of F. magna in red deer in flooded areas Slightly higher prevalence of F. magna in deer game had been registered also in Check Republic (70-80%) in permanent focus in the flooded area of south and central Check Republic back in 1960 and 1970 (Erhardová-Kotrla, 1971). Špakulova et al. (1997) reported that during 1990 in Slovakia in similar habitat were found eggs of F. magna in 63% samples. Many authors refer those high prevalence of F. magna exactly to flooded area (Rajský et al., 1996; Špakulova et al., 1997). From Table 1. it can be seen that in hunting grounds located in more eastern parts (XIV/3 "Haljevo", XI/15 Krndija II and</p><p id="Pg152">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1546 XIV/2 Đurđenica) eggs of F. magna wasn’t found during our research period. Those area has no direct hydrological connection with other hunting grounds near Drava and Danube, ground has not been flooded regularly during one year period and it is located on higher altitude. Therefore, our results confirms that it can be expected slowly spreading of F. magna, prior in Danube valley, which had been also predicted in Hungary by Majoros and Sztojkov (1994), based on their results. Conclusions Distribution of giant liver fluke F. magna in red deer with rather strong invasions is limited on flooded area in eastern part of Croatia near Danube. On this water soil grow specific swamp plants which present ideal media for giant liver fluke expansion, as well as for survival of its intermediate host, L. truncatula. Mild, less severe infections were found in flooded areas along Drava River, till on dry grounds wasn’t found at all. Thus, it can be expected that spreading of F. magna will extend the left side of river Danube at the first place, which means Republic of Serbia, and than the hunting grounds near Drava River in Republic of Croatia.

Strossmayer, Trg sv. Trojstva 3, Osijek, Croatia, e-mail: smarcela@pfos.hr 2 Medical Intertrade, Franje Tuđmana 3, Sveta Nedelja Abstract: Zeolites are crystalline hydrated aluminosilicates of alkali and alkaline earth cations, consisting of three-dimensional frameworks of SiO4 and AlO4 tetrahedra linked through the shared oxygen atoms to form an open crystal lattice with approximately uniform pores of molecular dimensions. The dietary use of naturally occurring or synthetic zeolites has been reported to improve feed efficiency, thus leading to a beneficial growth response in pigs. Three groups of weaned piglets (N=60), crossbreed (LWxSL)x Pietrein, the same sex proportions, aged 28 to 70 days were involved in the trial. Tribomechanically activated zeolite clinoptilolite (0.2% was added to the first experimental group, modified clinoptilolite was added to the second experimental group in the same concentration. Piglets in all groups were of similar body weights during both experimental periods. Plasma glucose, urea, total protein, sodium, potassium, chloride concentration were changed with the diet added modified clinoptilolite. Keywords: natural zeolite clinoptilolite, pig, biochemical parameters Introduction Because of the legislators in European Parliament which decided to prohibit the use of antibiotica in animal feed in the view of reducing antibiotic resistance phenomena (Bomba et al, 2006), the effects of others feed additives are researched. Natural zeolite clinoptilolite is alumosilicate of volcanic origin, due to their specific crystal chemical characteristics. It is well-known its amendment in soil treatment to reduce soil phytotoxicity and to improve the quality of plant growth on such amended soils (Barkoczi et al., 2006). Its dietary inclusion on farm animals’ diet has been established for the last two decades. It is well-known as effective micotoxins and heavy metals adsorbents (Šperanda et al, 2006), as well as potent immunomodulator in swine (Kyriakis et al, 2002). The effect of dietary addition of clinoptilolite on growth performances, metabolical parameters and animals’ health, depends on different concentration of clinoptilolite (Šperanda et al, 2006), particle size (Leung et al, 2006), as well as chemical modification and stability at different pH values (TomaševićČanović et al, 2003). Its importance is even more as we know that nowadays feed safety is measured for food safety. Risk assessment is a method used to estimate a public’s increased risk of health problems in relation to the feed assurance (Eđed and Horvat, 2007). Therefore the aim of our investigation is to determine the influence of two different methods of zeolite preparation on biochemical parameters in piglets during a 21 day period after weaning. Materials and methods Three groups of weaned piglets (N=60), crossbreed (LWxSL) x Pietrein, the same sex proportions, aged 28 to 70 days were involved in the trial. Piglets from all groups were fed on fodder mixture for weaned piglets containing 22% crude protein and 13.84 MJ ME/kg until 21st day after weaning and on fodder mixture for growing pigs with 19% crude protein and 13.74 MJ ME/kg until they were 70 days old.

Cereal Research Communications 1548 group (E1) was added 0.2% tribomechanically activated zeolite clinoptilolite (TMAZtribomechanical mineral activation process of disintegration of crude particles characterized by high speeds and particle collisions in short periods), the second experimental group (E2) was added 0.2% clinoptilolite modifed by dubble layer organic cation. The fine powder of TMAZ contained 80% clinoptilolite, whereas the remaining 20% consisted of the silica, montmorillonite and mordenite zeolite. Chemical composition of the TMAZ: SiO2 70.06%, Al2O3 12.32%, Fe2O3 1.48%, CaO 3.42%, MgO 0.96%, TiO2 0.71%, P2O5 0.05%, MnO 0.02%, Na2O 0.68%, K2O 2.38% SO3 0.17%, H2O 7.3%. Chemical composition of the modificated natural clinoptilolite: SiO2 68%, Al2O3 13 %, Fe2O3 0.8-2.5%, CaO 3.5%, MgO 0.8%, CaO 2.5%, Na2O 0.8%, K2O 2%. Body weight was controled on the weaning day, the 21st and 42nd day after weaning. Avarage gain was recorded and marked as WG1 (from the beginig of the trial until 21st day), WG2 (from 21st to 42nd day) and the total gain (TWG for the whole experimental period). Blood samples were taken from the animals on the 21st day after weaning in order to determine biochemical indicators. Five millilitre samples were obtained from the v. Cavae cranialis using a Venoject (R) vacutainer into a test for biochemical tests. Levels of metabolites (glucose, urea, creatinine, cholesterol, total proteins, triglycerides), enzyme activities (aspartate amino transferase-AST, alanine aminotransferase-ALT, alkaline phosphatase-ALP, gamaglutamyltransferase-GGT), and mineral levels (iron-Fe, sodium-Na, potassium K, chloride-Cl) were established by using the automatic analyzer Olympus AU 640. The values obtained from the investigated indicators were processed by the general linear model procedure of the STATISTICA (StatSoft, Inc. 2005). The differences between the control and trial groups were statistically tested by using the repeated measurement model with Fischer’s post hoc test. Animals used in this study were maintained in facilities approved by the Croatian Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, and in accordance with the current regulations and standards issued by the Croatian Ministry of Agriculture. Results and Discussion Piglets in all groups were of similar body weights during both experimental periods. The average weight gain was the best in E1 group in addition to C and the total weight gain was better in E2 group in relation to the control one (Fig. 1). Table 1.

They determined slightly lower glucose concentration in group swine fed with zeolie addition. Urea concentration was significantly lower in E2 groups in relation to other groups. Concepcion-Rosabal et al, (1997) found pure clinoptilolite as a excellent glucose adsorbent and therefore usufull in diabetes mellitus treatment. According to the Figure 1. Body mass (kg) and body weight gain (kg) of weaned piglets during different periods of measurement Figure 2. Enzymes activities and mean electrolite concentration in the weaned piglets sera with addition of differently prepared clinoptilolite control group, piglets from the E2 group had significantly (P&lt;0.05) lower level of total protein, probably because three-dimensional structure of zeolites have the strongest influence on adsorption (Akiyama et al, 1999). Zeolites have a low Si/Al2 ratio and therefore high ion-exchange capacity. Concentrations of triglyceride, cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol were slightly lower in E2 group, in relation to the other two groups, but without of any statistical significance. The addition of clinoptilolite in feed E2 group of animals decreased electrolite concentration, most likely because of its cation-exchange and absorption properties. Significantly (P&lt;0.01) lower concentration of sodium, potassium and chloride is determined in E2 group in relation with control and E1 group, but it did not cause any electrolite disbalance. It is, therefore, obvious that the plasma chloride concentration was parallel to that of sodium.

Different preparing of clinoptilolite influenced on enzymes activity, but without any significancy. It is not in relation to Prvulović et al (2007), who described greater activity in swine fed with clinoptilolite and Šperanda et al (2007) with adition higher concentration of clinoptilolite (0.5%). Conclusions It is concluded that the supplementation of diets with natural zeolites clinoptilolites of similar physical and chemical properties, but differently prepared, at the inclusion rate of 0.2% during 21 day after weaning is not associated with any adverse effect on weaned piglets. Animals reached slightly better body weights in groups with clinoptilolite, group of piglets added TMAZ does not provoke any undesirable effect on the evaluated serum biochemical parameters. Less pronounced changes in serum glucose, urea, total protein, sodium, potassium and cloride concentrations were affected by modified clinoptilolite without tribomechanically activation.

In order to achieve it, new hybrids with higher tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress are continuously being created. In order to compare performance of maize hybrids in environments with different levels and types of stress, and relate it to the stalk lodging incidence, we compared performance of 64 maize hybrids obtained by crossing 16 inbred lines with four inbred testers in three different environments. Two environments at same location (Rugvica) differed in crop rotation, and the third environment at location Botinec was considered as dry because of low water capacity of the soil. Mixed models that included all design elements and genetic background of hybrids were used to analyze the effect of lodging on yield in different environments. The results show that stalk lodging had a significant effect on yield, but significant lodging x environment interaction indicates that this effect was rather environment specific. Keywords: maize, hybrids, stress environment, yield, stalk lodging Introduction Stability of maize yield in a wide range of environments, differing in soil fertility, weather conditions, prevailing pests and diseases as well as cultural practices, is of great importance for safe maize production. Soil fertility together with nutrient supply is one of the most important environmental factors, which can significantly influence maize yield (Kovacevic et al. 2006; Vragolovic et al. 2007; Vukadinovic et al. 2006, Kovacevic et al. 2005; Izsáki 2007). Recently, due to increasing demand for maize, maize crop has been often grown in monoculture (repeated sowing maize after maize) as well as on soils of lower quality. In maize crop grown in monoculture the incidence of stalk rot would increase due to higher incidence of fusarium stalk rot and antracnose diseases. Stalk rot can decrease grain yield directly through premature death or indirectly through the higher expected proportion of stalk lodging. By growing resistant hybrids the incidence of stalk rot could be significantly decreased. Selection procedures used in breeding for stalk rot resistance in maize include artificial infection (Palaversic et al. 2007; Szőke et al. 2007) as well as recurrent selection methods (Buhinicek et al. 2005.; Buhinicek et al. 2007). Soil water deficit caused by low precipitation and often enhanced by low water capacity of certain soils can seriously decrease yield of maize (Bruce et al. 2002). Duvick (1997.) considers higher tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress as one of the factors of higher yields of new generation maize hybrids. For those reasons, it is necessary to continuously create new inbred lines and hybrids, with higher stress tolerance to overcome the conditions that arise in the field conditions. Although the genetic variability and heritability of grain yield or improvement in maize breeding</p><p id="Pg158">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1552 decreases more in the stress environments than in the optimal ones during the development of inbred lines (Banzinger and Cooper, 2001.), selection for tolerance and resistance to abiotic nad biotic stress is more effective in targeted environments and for specific stresses (Betran et al., 2003., Edmeades et al.,1999., Chapman and Edmeades, 1999.). On the other hand, Blum (1979.) warns that selection in only targeted stress environments can make the selection of superior genotypes difficult, and suggests parallel selection in both stress and optimal environments. Goal of the present study is to compare performance of maize hybrids in environments with different levels and types of stress, and relate it to stalk lodging incidence. Materials and methods Sixty four maize hybrids obtained by crossing 16 inbred lines with four inbred testers were included in the study. Field trials were set as four replicate row-column design in three different environments in 2007. Two environments at location Rugvica (semigley soil) included different crop rotations, maize after maize (CC) and maize after wheat (NE) and the third environment at location Botinec (calcaric alluvial soil) was considered as dry location (DE) because of low water capacity of the soil. The experimental plot consisted of two 4 m long rows. Cultural practice in all three environments was as recommended for optimal maize production. Data were collected on machine harvestable grain yield and stalk lodging. First stage of data analysis was carried out for each environment separately, modeling yield with the respect to trial design. Model effects included all design elements: rows and columns nested in replicates as random effects; replicates and long columns as fixed effects. Described mixed model was used to obtain yield estimates for hybrids, which were then used as inputs to the second stage analysis. Model used at this stage consisted of two fixed parts: first part used stalk lodging as covariate, allowing the differential response to stalk lodging in three experimental environments; second part was related to the genetic background of hybrids, and included the effects of lines, testers, and their interaction. All statistical analyses were carried out using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., 2007) procedures MIXED and GLM. Results and discussion Overview of the results begins with the second stage of the analysis, because first stage served only to obtain estimates to be used as inputs for the second stage. Analysis of variance for the second stage is shown in Table 1. Stalk lodging had a significant effect on yield, but significant lodging x environment interaction indicates that this effect was rather environment specific. Multiple comparisons between environments revealed significant differences between all of them, with highest yield scored at CC (92.76 dt ha-1), somewhat lower at NE (75.61 dt/ha), and substantially lower at DE (38.99 dt ha-1). Effects of lodging on yield decrease at different environments displayed similar pattern: at CC each additional percent of plants damaged by lodging decreased yield for 1.34 dt ha-1, whereas at NE and DE coefficients of regression of yield on lodging were -0.92 and -0.55 dt ha-1, respectively (Fig. 1).</p><p id="Pg159">VII.

By conducting multilocation trials wheat breeders are able to select genotypes well adapted to a wide range of environments. The objective of this study was to evaluate grain yield and quality traits of new promising breeding lines from Bc Institute Zagreb in different environments. Botinec (calcaric alluvial soil) and Rugvica (semigley soil) were locations with favorable grain yield whereas at Lovas (degraded chernozem soil), better quality was achieved by all tested genotypes. Several breeding lines performed well regarding grain yield as well as quality traits in comparison with standard cultivars. Due to significantly higher grain yield compared to all other genotypes, breeding line Bc9362 can be pointed out as the most promising for commercial production in a broad range of environments, whereas Bc5204 and Bc5167 had most favorable quality traits (protein content, Zeleny sedimentation value and water absorption). Keywords: wheat, environment, yield, quality Introduction Stability of quality parameters in bread wheat is becoming an important requirement for the milling and baking industries, because of potentially high annual and local variation in both grain yield and quality (Grausgruber et al., 2000; Baric et al., 2004; Drezner et al., 2007; Pepó 2007). Among the environmental factors, distribution of precipitation, soil water availability as well as nitrogen fertilization (Campbell et al., 1981; Bhutta, 2007; Guarda et al. 2004; Matuz et al., 2007; Varga et al., 2007) proved to have most significant influence on wheat grain quality. By conducting multilocation trials wheat breeders are able to select genotypes well adapted to a wide range of environments (Gunjaca et al., 2007). The objective of our study was to evaluate grain yield and quality traits of new promising breeding lines from Bc Institute Zagreb in different environments. Materials and methods Field experiments including eight wheat genotypes were conducted during the 20032004 (2004) and 2004-2005 (2005) growing seasons at three locations in Croatia Botinec (calcaric alluvial soil), Rugvica (semigley soil) and Lovas (degraded chernozem soil). Three commercial cultivars (Sana, Žitarka and Renan) and five elite breeding lines (Bc5204, Bc9362, Bc5263, Bc5137 and Bc5167) created at the Bc Institute for Breeding and Production of Field Crops in Zagreb were included in the study. Cultivars Sana and Žitarka are standards for grain yield and quality, respectively in the Croatian national variety trials. Genotypes were sown in six row plots of 5 m2 at a density of 700 grains m-2. The experimental design was a randomized complete block design with five replications. Agricultural practice was as recommended for optimal wheat production at each</p><p id="Pg162">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1556 location. Data were collected on grain yield and six grain quality traits determined by standard methods published by International Association for Cereal Chemistry (ICC, 1994). Protein content (PRO) was determined by Kjeldal method (ICC 105/2). Wet gluten content (WetG) and the gluten index (GI) were measured on Perten Glutomatic 2200 System according to ICC method 155. Zeleny sedimentation volume (SED) and Hagberg falling number (FN) were determined using ICC methods 116/1 and 107/1, respectively. Statistical analyses included analysis of variance and Tukey’s HSD test for mean comparisons, and were carried out using SAS (SAS Institute Inc.. 2007) GLM procedure. Results and discussion Analysis of variance revealed significant differences among genotypes, years and locations for grain yield. Mean grain yield for eight genotypes and three locations is shown on Fig. 1.. Grain yield of the line Bc9362 (8.53 t ha-1) was significantly higher compared to the standard cultivar Sana, whereas the other genotypes were not significantly different from the standard. Similar mean grain yields were found at Botinec and Rugvica (8.10 and 8.08 t ha-1, respectively), whereas at Lovas a significantly lower grain yield (6.53 t ha-1) compared to the first two locations was observed.

The most favorable location for quality traits was Lovas, which was followed by Rugvica, whereas at Botinec all quality traits were at significantly lower level. From the results of this study it is obvious that location most favorable for quality traits (Lovas) grain yield was at the lovest level. Drezner et al. (2007) also found significant differences among locations in Croatia in mean expressions of quality traits and grain yield of bread wheat. Conclusions Botinec and Rugvica were locations with favorable grain yield whereas at Lovas better quality was achieved by all tested genotypes. Several breeding lines performed well regarding grain yield as well as quality traits in comparison with standard cultivars. Due to significantly higher grain yield compared to all other genotypes, breeding line Bc9362 can be pointed out as the most promising for commercial production in a broad range of environments, whereas Bc5204 and Bc5167 had most favorable quality traits (protein content, Zeleny sedimentation value and water absorption).

Katalin@mkk.szie.hu Abstract: The aim of our research was to measure the effect of different tillage methods on the CO2 flux from soil. The field experiment was conducted in Hatvan region (Hungary) on a loam soil. The five tillage treatments included ploughing, direct drilling, cultivation, disking, loosening and disking. According to our experiment, the least emission was determined on the direct drilled soil and the greatest quantity of carbon dioxide emission was measured in case of ploughing treatment. This result proves the positive effect of soil conservation and protection tillage to compare with conventional land use and offer a significant potential to preserve or to increase soil C levels and to decrease the carbon dioxide emission from soil. Keywords: tillage systems, CO2 emission, climate change Introduction Agricultural production has a great effect on atmosphere quantity of the greenhouse gases. Soil is the main source and at the same time the potential sink of greenhouse gases (e.g. CO2, CH4). It is widely known that the mean yearly temperature has increasing (in Europe the temperature is 0,3-0,6 ºC is higher than ten years ago) and the main cause of this trend is that the CO2 concentration of the atmosphere has rising too (EEA 1998). The rising CO2 concentration has an influence on plants. The intensity of photosynthesis is depending on the CO2 concentration of atmosphere too. If the soil moisture and nutrient content is appropriate the higher carbon dioxide concentration can be advantageous for growth of plants (this is the so-called carbon dioxide manuring). But, if other environment factor is changing (for example moisture content of soil) this positive effect can decrease or not happened (Veisz et al. 1996; Anda – Lőke 2006). The prognosis for Hungary connection with the global climate change is that the climate will be warmer and arid (Várallyay 2006). Five percent of yearly CO2 emission originates from soil tillage (Cole 1996). It is a well-known fact that the conventional land use, including tillage, may influence even in climatic changes (Gyuricza 2004). The soil inversion by ploughing regularly induces a great carbon dioxide emission from the croplands. There is scientific evidence that intensive soil tillage has been a significant component of the increase in atmospheric CO2, which has occurred in the last decades. Intensive tillage results in the reduction of carbon resources by 30-50 %, mainly due to the breaking of the soil (Birkás et al.2006). The carbon dioxide evolving during the increased mineralization of the organic matter can vanish into the atmosphere. In opposition to this the conservation tillage technologies (inversion free technologies, no-tillage etc.) can increase the humus content of the soil by 1 ton per year (Birkás et al. 2007; Gyuricza 2004). The humus content of the soil has an effect for the plants. If the soil humus and nutrient content is is appropriate the yield of agricultural crops is higher (Blazenka et al. 2007).</p><p id="Pg166">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1560 Materials and methods We participated in a research program of the Department of Soil Management (Szent István University) to examine different tillage systems. One of the adjectives of this program is to study the interaction between tillage systems and CO2–emission from soil. The CO2-emission from soil was examined in a long-term experiment, which represents five different tillage treatments (tillage treatments are the followings: ploughing, direct drilling, cultivation, disking, loosening and disking) in Hatvan region on a loam soil (Calcic Chernozem). The CO2 emission of soil was measured in situ, by means of an INNOVA 1312 (Multigas monitor), after cultivation and after sowing. We covered the soil surface with a plastic chamber, and we measured the changing of the CO2 concentration after determined time. The INNOVA 1312 multi-gas monitor measure the CO2 emission in ppm. To calculate maximum CO2 emissions from soil in flux the following formula was used (ZSEMBELI at al. 2006): F=d * V/A * (c2-c1)/t * 273/(273+T) F= CO2-flux (kg m -2 h-1) d= 1,96 kg m-3 (density of CO2) V= volume of head space of chamber (m3) /= 0,00366 m3/ A= area of chamber (m2) /= 0,0314 m2/ c1= CO2 concentration at time of start (m 3 m-3) c2= CO2 concentration at time o fend (m 3 m-3) t = duration of measurement (h) T= air temperature (°C) Results and discussion Figure 1 shows the CO2 emission at different tillage methods after cultivation in ppm. Figure 2 presents the maximum CO2 flux using different tillage treatments, in kg m -2 h-1. The most CO2 emission from soil was measured in a ploughing plot both during the experiment time and in case of maximum emission. The range of treatments based on maximum carbon dioxide emission (kg m-2 h-1): ploughing (9,19); loosening and disking (5,47); disking (4,58); cultivation (4,37); direct drilling (2,84). The range of treatments is different a little bit if we consider the complete measure time, loosening combined disking plot has less CO2 emission than using cultivation and same as in case of disking treatment. It can be concluded that the conventional and intensive tillage treatments cause more carbon dioxide loss than the soil conservation tillage technologies.</p><p id="Pg167">VII.

Immediately after sowing the most carbon dioxide emission from soil was measured in direct drilled plot, but after 150 minutes decreased significantly. If we consider Figure 4, it can be concluded that the CO2 flux was the least in case of direct drilling. These results shows that the emission from soil immediately after the sowing was high rate, but this quantity of CO2 hardly increased after 30 minutes, when the emission reached a peak.

Strossmayer, Trg Ljudevita Gaja 6, 31000 Osijek, Croatia Abstract: Sweet pepper Istra F1 hybrid was grown in a greenhouse on K rich soil. For evaluation of K antagonism, two K rates (55 and 85 kg ha -1 ) were applied in a randomized complete block design with four replication. Total number of fruits, total number of BER affected fruits as well as average fruit mass were recorded for each harvest. Fruit and leaf K and Ca content were determined at three plant growth stages (at the stage of the first, third and fifth fruit cluster). Higher K rate gave higher : average fruit mass (169.45 g), total number of fruits per plant (7.95), number of BER affected fruits per plant (3.82), K in leaves (5.44% DM), K in fruits (6.35% DM), but negatively correlated with Ca concentration in fruits (0.57% DM) and leaves (3.24% DM). This resulted in decreased marketable yield of sweet pepper fruits. Keywords: Ca, Capsicum annuum L., fruit analysis, leaf analysis, K fertilization rate Introduction The Ca concentration in the soil is usually about 10 times that of K, but the uptake is usually lower. Ca is a divalent ion and as ions increase in valence, the uptake decreases. High concentrations of K+, Na+, and NH4 + (monovalent ions) in soils can have an adverse affect on Ca2+ uptake (Mengel and Kirkby, 1989). As for K, many studies showed wide spreading of negative K balance in soils (Kovačević et al., 2006). Ca plays a very important role in plant nutrition, ranging from a cell wall stabilizer to a secondary messenger in the cytoplasm, and Ca deficiency manifests as local decay of fruits called blossom-end rot (BER). The Ca concentration in the plant ranges from 0.1 to 5% of the tissue dry weight and 0.2 to 0.3% in the fruit (Taylor and Locascio, 2004). In a study by Gunes et al. (1998), as K increased in hydroponic solution, Ca uptake of tomato plants decreased. Both pepper and tomato fruits absorb high amounts of K from the soil. With optimum nutrition, nutrient uptake increases rapidly during the fruit growth period. At this time, K is the dominant nutrient (Fontes et al., 2000), and Ca deficiency can be expected. Also, excessive K not only influences on Ca deficiency, than on other micronutrients deficiency as well such as Zn, Mn and Cu as shown in study with maize by Jurković et al. (2006). Furthermore, in a study by Nagy et al. (2007) with sweet cherry, applied K treatments increased both the leaf and fruit K, whereas decreased the leaf and fruit Ca. Therefore, the most important component of the plant production technology is the proper subsequent delivery of nutrients (Kismányoky and Lehoczky, 2007). The aim of this study was to determine the effect of excessive K soil and plant supply on Ca status in pepper fruits. Material and methods In the region of eastern Croatia, located Gajić, Baranja region, (45o49’ N, 18o44’ E), the pepper plants (Capsicum annuum L., cv. Istra F1, Harris Moran) with crop density of 3.0 plants m-2 were grown on the soil in heated greenhouse during 2006 year. Daily</p><p id="Pg170">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1564 temperatures during trial were 18-28°C, and at night 12-16°C. Relative air humidity was 70-80%. Soil was fertilized with mixture of turf, cattle and chicken manure and sand and analyzed afterwards. Analysis showed following chemical properties: humus 3.74 %, pH 6.49 (in 1M KCl), AL-P2O5 300 mg kg -1 and AL-K2O 291 mg kg -1 of soil. Standard fertilization was done prior to planting on the entire trial plot of 100 m2 with 200 kg ha-1 8:26:26 and 100 kg ha-1 of urea CO(NH2)2, whilst after transplanting there were 20 fertigations using drop-irrigation (over the period 20.02.-01.07.), with MultiComp Base 350 kg ha-1 14:13:20+2MgO+ME. Because of high K and P in the soil, during fruit bearing stage the fertigations were reduced, applying totally 55 kg ha-1 (K1 treatment) or 85 kg ha-1 K (K2 treatment) using 120 or 185 kg ha-1 Multi-K (13:0:46). Each plant was watered with 1 – 1.2 L of the respective nutrient solution three times per week. On all the other days, plants were given 1.5 – 2.0 L of water for all period (April – July). Along with the standard fertilization, 0.1% solution of Ca (Ca-nitrate 15.5-00+26.5 CaO) was additionally applied in the form of foliar treatment every 7 days over the period of May 5 to July 24, giving totally 18.5 kg Ca ha-1. The experiment was settled in four repetitions with 30 plants per repetition in randomized block design system. Plants were trained around a vertical string, and suckers were pruned every week. For better pollination, plants were shaken every day when they were watered and bumblebees were introduced 4 weeks after transplantation. There were 9 harvests of fruits (May 10 – August 7), and the total number of fruits per plant, number of BER affected fruits per plant and average fruit fresh mass were recorded. For chemical analysis, plants (leaves and fruits) were sampled at three separate growth stages. The samplings were performed at the stage of the first, third and fifth fruit cluster. Plant material, leaves and fruits, were dried for 48h at 80°C and ground to pass a 2–mm sieve. The K and Ca content of the ashed (560°C) material was determined by atomic absorption spectro-photometry. Data were statistically analyzed using ANOVA and correlation method (t-test). The significance of the applied treatments was tested by Ftest and differences between treatments were evaluated using LSD-test. Results and discussion The investigation shows the antagonism between K and Ca in pepper plants. Statistical analysis of data showed significant linear correlation between K concentration in fruits and: BER incidence (r=0.864**), average fruit number per plant (r=0.875**), Ca concentration in leaves (r=-0.787**), K concentration in leaves (r=0.931**) and average fruit mass (r=0.976**). Also, significant negative linear correlation occurred between K and Ca concentration in fruits (r=-0.784*). K and Ca concentrations in leaves were also in negative linear correlation (r=-0.824**), which further confirms the antagonism of these elements. In the same time, as K concentration in leaves increased, average number of fruits also increased (r=0.767*), along with the increased number of BER affected fruits (r=0.856**). Regarding the K fertilization levels, statisticaly significant differences appeared in K concentration in fruits (p≤0.01) and leaves (p≤0.01) and Ca concentration in fruits (p≤0.05) and leaves (p≤0.01). Similar results were obtained by Locascio et al. (1991), who have showed that increasing K fertilization significantly reduces Ca content of</p><p id="Pg171">VII.

Our investigation showed similar results. Along with an increased fruit mass and fruit number under influence of higher K fertilization rate, there was significantly more BER-affected fruits (p≤0.01) (Figure 1) and Ca concentration decreased both in fruits and leaves (Table 1).

Increased K fertilization rate gave higher pepper fruit mass, but negatively correlated with the Ca concentration in the fruit and leaf, resulting in higher number of BER affected fruits. Future research needs to focus on screening for varieties that are less susceptible to BER, using these varieties for breeding purposes, as well as the application of water and fertilization management practices that promote Ca uptake and decrease the antagonistic effects.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1567 INVESTIGATIONS ON THE NUTRIENT CONCENTRATION OF YELLOW NUTSEDGE (CYPERUS ESCULENTUS L.) Kamilla BUZSÁKI – Éva LEHOCZKY - Imre BÉRES Pannon University, Georgikon Faculty of Agricultural Sciences, Institute for Plant Protection, Keszthely, Hungary Abstract: We investigated the changes of nutrient concentration of yellow nutsedge in pot trials. Samplings were made at 11 occasions, weekly between June 1 and 24 August in 2007. Summarised it can be stated, that the nutrient concentration of yellow nutsedge shows just a minimal changes. The concentrations of all tested nutrients were higher in the shoots than in the underground parts. Keywords: Cyperus esculentus (L.), N-, P-, K-, Ca-concentration. Introduction Yellow nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus) is a cosmopolitan, tropical, subtropical plant. On the basis of Ujvárosi life-form it is a G2 perennial plant, overwintering with tubers in the soil. It occurs in every continent. Nowadays, the Working Committee of Invasive Plants of the EPPO consider it as a highly damaging internationally important weed. Because of its rapid spreading by its extensive tuber- and seed production, yellow nutsedge is a strong competitor of the cultivated plants by causing yield- and quality damages. It can be especially harmful in the spring sown crops, with a high row distance, mainly in maize, sunflower, potato and sugarbeets. Spontaneous occurrence of yellow nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus L. var. leptostachyus) was observed at first time in Hungary in 1993. (Dancza et al., 2005). The plants compete for nutrients, water and light, these are the three main factors of their life. The plant producers need to know the biological characteristics and nutrient uptake of the weeds to be able to achieve an effective weed control (Lehoczky, 2000). Lehoczky et al. investigated the nutrient uptake by weeds in a Long-term maize field experiment (2006). Lehoczky investigated the N-, P-, K-, Ca-concentration of 54 weeds (1994). Tóth et al. studied the nutrient uptake of Sorghum halepense (2007), Nádasy et al. studied the nutrient uptake of Convolvulus arvensis (2004). We investigated the changes of nutrient concentration of yellow nutsedge in pot trials. Materials and methods The 5 repetition pot experiment has been started April 19. 2007. Large-sized pots were filled with a mixture of mould and sandy loam in a ratio of 1:1, and planted in each pots 25 yellow nutsedge tuberlets collected from a field located at Somogytúr. Weekly one plant and its progeny were harvested from each pot to measure their N-, P-, K- and Caconcentration of shoots and underground parts (=roots, tubers and rhizomes). Nitrogen concentration was determined by Kjeldahl method, phosphorus concentration by spectrophotometer, potassium and calcium concentration by flame photometer. Samplings were made at 11 occasions, weekly between June 1 and 24 August in 2007.</p><p id="Pg174">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

In comparison with other monocotyledons the yellow nutsedge has a lower demand on nutrients (Lehoczky 2002, Tóth et al. 2007). The concentrations of all tested nutrients were higher in the shoots than in the underground parts. The Kconcentration was the highest from the tested nutrients in the shoots and underground parts. Maize is a K demanding crop (Lehoczky 2002.), so yellow nutsedge is a probable K competitor of maize. The K/Ca rate was 3-3,5 in shoots, and 2-3,5 in underground parts. Similar K/Ca rate was reported earlier by Lehoczky, the author studied the nutrients uptake of weeds (2004.). References Dancza, I., Hoffmanné P.

The area occupied by this weed is continuously bigger. Though the basic biological characters of this plant is well.known, still its control is a significant problem, the damages increase on the areas occupied by this weed. Keywords: common milkweed, ecology, spread, damage, allelopathy, growth analysis, nutrient uptake. Introduction and survey of the literature The common milkweed is considered to be an invader, a difficult controllable weed. Its spread is continuous in the last decades. It causes more and more problems in the weed control and on nature conservation areas. The common milkweed is a fast growing plant, can have a tallness of 80 to 150 cm. Its roots spread horizontally at 10-40 cm depth in the soil, sometimes however reach a depth of 1,0-1,2 m. It has a life form of G3, and has propagative roots. Its roots can be found even at 4 m depth, depriving water and nutrients from cultivated plants like grape, some fruit plants, forest trees. According to Ulman (1951) its water demand takes 400500 mm in a year. Its roots able to emerge even from a depth of 1,2-1,5 m. The yearly spread by the roots may be of 3,0 m (Varga, 2003). At natural circumstances the seedlings appear at a soil temperature of 15 ºC during the end of April and first week of May. Under laboratory circumstances the dormancy of the seeds ceases continuously from November on, germinate at a temperature of 20-30 ºC, the maximum germination can be achieved in the first part of April. At natural circumstances late frosts of -1 -2 ºC kill the young seedlings, while adult plants can survive at this temperature (Varga, 2003). According to Groh this species prefer soils of good quality and good water management, especially loam and sandy soils developed on loess (Ujvárosi, 1973). It can be found mainly on soils with good water management (Cramer and Burnside, 1981). According to Ulman (1951) it can grow well on soils with a pH-value of 8,25 to 4,5, but it prefers more the alcaline soils. The dry and acidy soils hinder the development of the seedlings (Valachovic, 1991). Bagi (2004) has found, that at the living-space of milkweed under the colonies there is a higher humus content in the soil, the amount of available P and nitrate-nitrogen is higher than at the other, non-cultivated fields, the chemical reaction of the soil is more acidy, and the CaCO3-content is decreased. The common milkweed deprive the nutrient- and water content of the soil, by this may cause considerable yield loss of cultivated plants. According to Cramer and Burnside</p><p id="Pg178">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1572 (1982) it caused 18-30 % yield loss in sorghum, 12-19 % in soya, and 2-10 % in corn, where it was spread. In field trials at a density of 12 weed plants per m2 in spring wheat caused 47 % yield loss. Beside yield loss, the weed may hinder the harvest of lower plants. Under natural circumstances the shading effect of this weed may be more important than its allelopathic effect (Bagi, 2004). The milkweed colonies kill other plants growing in their colony, and this spots will fall out of useful cultivation for a long period (Bagi 2004, Varga 2003). The reservoir-effect of milkweed is known in case of some diseases and pests, however not fully. Bagi (1999) mentioned this plant to be a nutritive plant of Californian thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis), which is a vector of some viruses (TSWV, tomato spotted wilt virus), and as host plant of the cucumber misaic virus (CMV). Conclusions The common milkweed is spread over North-America between the 35th and 50th degree of western latitude and 60th 103rd degree of longitude. Millions of hectares are polluted by this weed in the United States. Important is its spread also in Asia (Iraq), in Europe (Carpathian Basin, Polen, Bulgaria, Switzerland, France, Austria, Germany), as well as in the area of the former Soviet Union (Belorussia, The Baltic Countries, Caucasus, and the Ukraine). The weed surveys made four times in Hungary show that the weed rapidly spread on the arable fields, orchards, in forests and on non-cultivated areas. In the time of the first survey (1947-1953 ) it was not yet on the weed list. During the 2nd National Weed Survey in 1985 it took the 285th place only, and occurred on 32.000 ha. In the 3rd Survey in 1989 it took the 113rd place and occurred on 16.000 ha arable field and beside that also in forests, orchards, grape plantages and non-cultivated fields. In 1989 the most contaminated counties of Hungary were Bács-Kiskun, Tolna, Jász-NagykunSzolnok, Somogy and Pest (Varga, 2003). In the time of the 4th National Weed Survey (1996-1997 ) this weed took the 76th place on the list. In the time of the last Survey (1996-1997 ) the weed contaminated more or less 200.000 ha in Hungary (Varga, 2003). The National Service of Plant and Soil Protection has mapped the occurrence of this weed in the period of 2000 to 2003 and found, that it still exist at all fields where observed it in 1986. In county Zala the weed occurred on non-cultivated fields in 1986, but in 2000-2003 it has been found on arable fields, too. It has been found in 6-7 settlements occupiing larger area than 5 m2, and 23 settlements on smaller area tha 5 m2.The largest adjacent area with 300 m2 occupied surface has been found in the vicinity of Zalacsány (Novák et al., 2004). The airborne hyperspectral image spectrometry a novell method of the weed survey , which was applied on field of Hajduság loess platau. This spectraly detailed datasourse was more effective to distinquis weed species than earlier used a neaer-field broad-band remote sensining methods. The results of thematic maps was important tool to estimate Shannon biodiversity index in ecological forecast. Changes in the soil ownwerships, soil preparation methods, weed control and climate in the last decades are the main reasons of the rapid spread of the common milkweed in Hungary. During this period the number of frost-free days decreased, which promoted the propagation of the warm-demanding weeds and prolonged their growing season. By</p><p id="Pg179">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1573 these they can emerge earlier, can create more biomass and more seeds and other propagative organs (Szőke 2003). Further spread of this weed can be expected on areas degraded andropogenically, like non-cultivated earlier arable fields, forestations and deforestations, secondary grasses on sandy soils (Bagi, 1999). Also soil erosion, soil compactation, shallow pluggings, overgrazing may lead to the spreading this weed. The lack of competitors and the damage of soil are more important with respect to the spreading than the other characters of the soil (Bagi, 2004). Also activities leading to nutrient increase (i.e. fertilization, forest burning, mineralization by driing out marhes) may lead to the colonization by milkweed. The area of degraded fields is still growing, which promotes this weed. Lehoczky (2000) studied the nutrient content of common milkweed and found, that in average it has 1,58 % N, 0,31 % P, 3,74 % K and 3,85 % Ca. The N-uptake of the plant is considerable during its life, it is translocated in its sprouts during the first part of the season, and later on into the propagative roots. The P-content of the sprouts and roots is similar, showing the high energy-demand of their metabolism. The K-content is highest in the sprouts. The high K-content of the roots is attributed to the intensive carbohydrate metabolism there. The The K-uptake is intensive up to the flowering stage and during the seed development. There is no difference in Ca-content between sprouts and roots, the Ca-content is on a high level during the whole season. The N-content is just a quarter of the high K- and Ca-content (Figure 1.). Among the similarly invader plant species the Johnson-grass (Sorghum halepense /L./ Pers.) were studied for its biomass production, N, P, K and Ca content (Lehoczky and Tóth, 2007). Figure 1. The changes of nutrient uptake in common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca L.) shoots and roots.</p><p id="Pg180">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1574 Kazinczi et al. (1999) studied the allelopathic effect of common milkweed. They have found that its root extract do not hinder the germination of sunflower seeds, but effectively hinder the emergence of maize and cress seeds. Tóth and Lehoczky (2003) investigated the characters of early development of common milkweed emerging from seeds. This is important with respect to the colonization. They have found that the early development is slow in the first three weeks, and accelerates from the 5th weeks on. The growing rate of plants emerging from propagative roots (AGR) has been found to be positive during the season, the relative growing rate (RGR) has two positive maxima. The leaf area growing rate (RLGR) as well as the photosynthesis (NAR, LAR) proved to be most intensive in the period of 4-12 June. We have to reckon with the continuous spread of common milkweed in forests, orchards, grape plantages and arable fields. It can cause the biggest problem in orchards and grape cultures. This weed can considerably hinder the development of young trees by depriving the nutrients and water. On arable lands it has lower importance, however because of incomplete control it may spread and cause damages. Also its allelopathic effect may be of importance. By occupation of living space in natural conservation areas it may supersede the useful local species. Acknowledgements The Hungarian Scientific Research Fund (OTKA K60314) supported this research.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1575 STUDY ON COMPETITION BETWEEN MAIZE AND WEEDS IN LONG-TERM SOIL TILLAGE EXPERIMENTS Éva LEHOCZKY1* - András KISMÁNYOKY1 – József RITECZ1 - Tamás NÉMETH2 1 Department of Herbologie and Pesticide Chemistry, Plant Protection Institute, Georgikon Faculty of Agriculture, Pannon University, Deák F. Str. 16, H-8360, Keszthely, e-mail: lehoczky@georgikon.hu; 2 Research Institute for Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest, Hungary Abstract: Our study was carried out at Keszthely, in 2006. The effect of different cultivation methods: no-till drill, disk tillage, conventional tillage (ploughing) and five increasing N doses were studied on the weediness. Samples were taken 4 and 9 weeks after the sowing of maize. For the reason of competition studies no herbicides were applied on sampling sites. For comparison, maize plants from neighbouring herbicide-treated sites were harvested and analyzed. The aerial parts of plants were collected, and the fresh and dry matter weight was measured. We analyzed in detail, the occurrence of weed species, and the biomass production of weeds in comparison with maize. Data obtained from weedy and weed-free control areas were then compared. The effect of different cultivation methods markedly demonstrated the weed cover, the number of perennial and annual weeds and the number of occurring weed species. As a result of crop-weed competition we can establish, that the shoot mass of maize plants was more than 40 % lower on weedy sites than on herbicide treated (weed free) sites. We found that uptake of nutrients in large amounts by weeds at the early stage of the development of maize is an important factor in crop-weed competition. Keywords: biomass production, maize, soil tillage, weediness, competition Introduction The valuation of cultivation systems and comparison takes important place in the research of plant production. The weeds bring on indirect and direct damage in the plant production. Still, as a widely spaced crop, maize is highly susceptible to competition from weeds during it’s early growth period, with losses greater than 30 % commonly reported (Lehoczky et al. 2006). The methods and tools of soil cultivation dispose to weed control effect. As follows the ploughing, disc tillaging, harrowing, cultivating. Tóth and Kismányoky (2001) observed that the yield of maize was usually higher in crop rotation than in continuos cropping. The high variability of the yield year by year in continuous maize experiment was due not only to the climatic factors of the different crop years, but to the weed conditions as well (Tóth and Kismányoky 2003). There are essential differences in the cover of weeds and in the number of the weed species depending on the fertilization system employed (Lehoczky and Kismányoky 2005). Nitrogen fertilization often cannot increase the competitive ability of crops to weeds; it may even reduce it depending on the weed species. In case of favourable fertilizer application weeds took advantage over maize in weight production intensity (Lehoczky et al. 2006). In the last decades the disc tillage and the no-till drill cultivation methods have come to the forefront. In hungary the opinion of the scrutineers about direct drilling is differing. It is fact, that the weediness is one of the derogatory factors of the direct drilling (Birkás et al. 1999). Materials and methods The study was carried out in Keszthely, 2006 (Lehoczky et al. 2006). The seeding of maize was 10th of May in 2006. Samples were taken 4 and 9 weeks after the sowing of maize. The first sampling date was on the 1st of June. All weeds were taken by hand</p><p id="Pg182">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1576 from 1•m2 and five maize samples from each plots. For reason of competition studies no herbicides were applied until this time on sampling sites. Before using herbicide we blanket 4 m2 area from each plots. For spraying were used Motivell Turbo 1L ha-1 (a.i. nikosulfuron) + Dash HC 0.4L ha-1 on the 9th of June. The second sampling date was on the 4th of July. All weeds were taken by hand from 2 m2 non-herbicide treated “weedy” area, and three maize samples from the weedy area and two from the herbicide treated area. The aerial parts of plants were collected, and the fresh and dry matter weight was measured. We analyzed in detail, the occurrence of weed species, and the biomass production of weeds in comparison with maize. Results and discussion In the trial we found a total of 17 weed species. At the end of the study, we determined that the fewest weed species and weed cover were found on the conventional tillage plots. Altogether 14 species were present, of which three were perennial. The total weed cover was 1.95 %. The most weed species occurred on the no-till drill treatments, a total of 16 species. In these weed species we found 6 perennial. The total weed cover was in this treatment 28.28 %. On the disc tillage plots we found 14 weed species (with 15.24 % weed cover), which included 5 perennial. In the different cultivation method treatments there were appreciable differences noted in the number of all weed species and perennial weeds found. On the conventional tillage plots the rate of perennial weeds found compared to all weed species was 21.4 %; on the disc tillage plots it was 35.7 % and finally on the no-till drill plots the rate was 37.5 %. On the ploughing treatment, the average weed cover were found on a small scale (1.95 %). The biomass productions of weeds were found the less in the conventional tillage treatment. On the treatment disc tillage the biomass production of weeds was 3 times higher, of the treatment no-till drill 5 times higher than that of conventional tillage treatment. We studied the rate of biomass weight in given unit area (1 m2). We found different rates by the cultivation methods. The rate was 44 % : 56 % between maize and weeds of conventional tillage treatment. On the disc tillage plots this rate changed appreciably in favour of weeds (77 % : 23 %). On the no-till drill treatment the rate of biomass production means 87 %. In the N3 treatment we found higher weed weight rate, which is hang together with the occurrence of C. arvensis. On the no-till drill plots we found small scale change, but in the N5 treatment through the multitudinous occurrence of E. repens and C. arvense species, the rate of weed weight was higher than on the other treatments. By the weed cover it can be stated, that the perennial L. tuberosus occurred the highest number in the N0 treatment especially in the disc tillage and no-till drill methods. A. artemisiifolia occurred with especially high weed cover (12 %) on the control (N0) plots of no-till drill cultivation method. With the increasing N levels, the weed cover decreased (0.5-1.8 %). At the second sampling date, the maize was in the code 33 growth stage by the BBCH identification keys. In this time we had opportunity to compare the growth of maize samples, from the weedy and herbicide-treated sites. In results the highest biomass production of maize was in both sampling date on the weedy and the herbicide treated plots on the conventional tillage treatment (Fig. 1).</p><p id="Pg183">VII.

The dry matter weight of weeds and maize, at the first and second sampling date (g m-2). The least biomass production was on the no-till drill treatment. The difference was in both cases more than 30 %. On the herbicide-treated plots by the disc tillage treatment, the biomass weight of maize was 18 % higher than on the no-till drill treatment. This difference was on the weedy plots smaller 6 %. It can be stated to study the biomass production of weeds, that in the early sampling date, (when the suppress capacity of maize come not to the forefront) there were higher differences, but in tendency are the same with the data’s of the second sampling. One month later after maize sowing the weed weight was 3.3 times higher on the disc tillage treatment and 5.2 times higher on the no-till drill treatment than that of treatment conventional tillage. At this time the weed control effect of soil tillage predominated. The results of the study which was made one month later the extent and the biomass production of weeds were different on the plots of several soil tillage methods. The least weed was in the ploughing treatment. On the disc tillage treatment the rate of weed weight found compared to the conventional tillage treatment was 27 % higher, on the no-till drill plots was 39 % higher. Likewise to the first sampling the occurred numbers of weeds were found essential differences in the several soil tillage treatments as well as the numbers of perennial weeds and in the dominance order of biomass production of weed species. On the disc tillage plots were found one more perennial weed than on the ploughing treatment. The most weed species were found on the no-till drill treatment, 16 pieces. Here occurred the most perennial weeds, 8 pieces. On the disc tillage plots the biomass production of the first three weeds found compared to the whole biomass production was 67 %. These weeds are: A. retroflexus , E. crus-galli, P. miliaceum. On the no-till drill treatment the biomass production of the first three weeds (E. crus-galli, S. glauca, Ch. album) found compared to the whole biomass production was 43 %. It is important to mention, that A. artemisiifolia occur with high density on the no till-drill treatment, while on the conventional tillage plots and on the disc tillage plots occur with small numbers. A. artemisiifolia is the 4th in the order of dominance by the no-till drill treatment, which is appreciable.</p><p id="Pg184">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1578 Conclusions The cultivation methods used in the experiments demonstrated marked differences in the weediness of maize. In the trial we found a total of 17 weed species. At the end of the study, we determined that the fewest weed species were found on the conventional tillage plots. Altogether 14 species were present, of which three were perennial. The average weed cover was 1.95%, the biomass production 2.81 g m-2. The most weed species occurred on the no-till drill treatments, a total of 16 species. In these weed species we found 6 perennial. On the disc tillage treatment the weed cover was substantially, 7.8 times higher and the biomass production was 3.3 times higher than on the conventional tillage method. On the no-till drill treatment the weed cover was powerful 14.5 fold higher, the biomass production was five times higher than on the conventional tillage method. In the second sampling date were significant differences noted in the dry matter weight of weeds (LSD5% 36.32) and maize (LSD5% 29.58) resulting from the effect of differing soil tillage methods. The dry matter weight of maize was in all soil tillage methods on the herbicide-treated site 2-2.3 times higher, than on the weedy site. In case the weedy as well as the herbicide treated maize the conventional tillage ensure the best condition on the growth. This vantage manifest in the higher suppresses capacity on the weedy plots. In our results A. artemisiifolia occur with highest density on the no till-drill plots. The biomass production of A. artemisiifolia found compared to the whole biomass production was 8 %.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1579 SOIL-PLANT INTERRELATIONS: THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SOIL DEGRADATION AND THE THE RISK ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY FOR SALINIZATION Andrea HAGYÓ 1 – Tibor TÓTH1 – Esther BLOEM 2 – Sjoerd E.A.T.M. VAN DER ZEE 2 – Eszter HORVÁTH 1 1 HAS Research Institute for Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry 2 Soil Physics, Ecohydrology and Groundwater Management Group, Wageningen University, Netherlands Abstract: Numerous methodologies are used in the EU Member States to assess the risk for different soil threats related to various agricultural practices (erosion, salinisation, organic matter decline, compaction and landslides). Our aim was to evaluate the risk assessment methodologies (RAMs) utilized for salinization in the Member States based on questionnaires sent to experts and policy makers. A first analysis of the obtained information reveals that most countries affected by the problem do not have official methodology and some countries do not have any methodology at all. Hungary has an officially recognized assessment. Slovakia and Spain has a RAM used by scientists. Greece and Cyprus provided information about RAM that they would prefer. Salt-affected soils occur in Bulgaria, France, Italy and Romania also, but we didn’t get answer from these countries. To fill the information gaps we need a further analysis on scientific papers. Keywords: soil degradation, salinization, risk assessment, European Union Introduction The threat of soil salinization has been recognized since long ago. Salt-affected soils (SAS) are soils in which the influence of cations and anions dominates with regards to physical, chemical, and biological properties. The basic problem encountered with SAS is that the balance between the inputs and outputs of salts is upset, leading to an increase of generally soluble salts or leading to an inproper composition of salts in soil. Commonly, salinity involves the alkali and earth alkali cations and anions such as chloride, sulphate, and (bi)carbonates. The basic problems associated with salinization may be diverse. A rather direct effect is that increasing salinity leads to higher osmotic values of soil water, which is considered to contribute to water stress of plants, as they are unable to extract the available water (Farooq and Azam, 2007). As SAS are the best examples of strong soil-plant interrelations, the relationship between crop yield and soil salinity can be described by simple equations (Maas, 1990). Different countries use various methodologies for risk assessment, as local circumstances vary (soil, climate, political framework) and interests of countries differ. Similar problems may have varying causes or comparable problems may be approached differently by each country. A first step in risk assessment involves general identification of the threat and areas at risk. Subsequently, within the delineated zones, specific locations with high salinity risks have to be identified, preferably using process-based models at high resolutions and other areas must be taken out of scope (Tóth et al., 2006). Eckelmann et al (2006) named this procedure the tiered approach, where tiers refer to the different levels of scale and related level of information detail. They distinguish three types of approaches to identify areas at risk: qualitative, quantitative and model approach. Our objective was to compare the existing RAMs of Europe and point to their most common features as a basis for their future harmonization.</p><p id="Pg186">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1580 Materials and methods We constructed two questionnaires, one for scientific experts and one for policy makers. The questionnaires have been sent to researchers and policy makers within EU25 member states in order to proceed to an inventory of methodologies used for assessing salinization risks. The questionnaire for policy makers consists of general and specific questions about RAMs related to the five soil threats involved in the EU thematic strategy for soil protection (soil erosion, landslides, organic matter decline, compaction and salinization) and ranking of their priorities about RAMs. The questionnaires for experts are divided by soil threats and are more detailed. The questionnaire for salinization is consisted of seven main questions about RAMs for salinization. The main topics of the questions were:  General information: if the country has a risk assessment methodology at present or in development and if yes, how long has it already been in use. We asked for references and/or weblinks about the RAM.  Input data: we offered possibilities to indicate what data are used by the RAM.  Description of the RAM: questions allowed to evaluate the relations with policy, the sensitivity, the type of methodology and used techniques, the data quality, availability and time resolution, the geographical coverage of the RAM  Output documents of the RAM: these questions allowed to describe the output type, scale and comprehensibility. Results and discussion We received filled questionnaires from five countries. There are salinity RAMs in use in Hungary, Slovakia and Spain (Table 1.). Hungary has an officially recognized assessment. Slovakia and Spain has a RAM used by scientists. Greece and Cyprus do not have an implemented RAM, but they provided information about their preferred RAM. Salt-affected soils occur in Bulgaria, France, Italy, Austria and Romania also and there are areas at risk of salinization also in further countries (Macedonia, Ukraine), but we haven’t got answer from these countries. The questionnaire from Hungary can be divided into two RAMs. RAMHU1 is the evaluation of the Tisza River irrigation project (Szabolcs et al., 1976). It includes the survey of salinity and alkalinity status of soils and potential factors of salinization and alkalinization processes. RAMHU2 (Kovács et al., 2006) is the evaluation of TIM (Soil Protection Information and Monitoring System), a quantitative expert analysis based on temporal changes of monitored data covering the whole country representing all regions and soil types. The method uses statistical analyses between the groundwater depth and soil salinity. Conclusions are made based on the detected changes. RAMSL, the Slovakian RAM has been in use for 14 years. It is a qualitative weighting-rating system. It is used for monitoring purposes and has a geographical coverage for the whole country. The scale was not indicated and there was not any references given. RAMSP, the Spanish RAM (De Paz et al., 2004) is not used yet for monitoring purposes but it is planned. Spain does not have a national system; there are only case studies. They have regular data source for the implementation. For now, there are data for two years in time resolution of four periods plus irrigation periods and after heavy rain events per year.</p><p id="Pg187">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1581 The range of input parameters of the studied RAMs are similar, the observation density is similar in RAMHU2 and RAMSP and much higher in RAMHU1, the data is mainly obtained by field observation and laboratory analysis, in RAMSL by remote sensing and in RAMSP also GIS technique is used (Table 2). The output type and scale depend on the goal of each research activity (Table 3). Table 1.

Cereal Research Communications 1582 characteristics and groundwater information in their assessment. Soil typological, soil texture, chemical properties of irrigation water, climate, soil hydraulic properties, and land use are used in most of the RAMs and pedotransfer function and combinations with models are also used in some RAMs. From this we can say that there are common criteria in all RAMs. Most of the RAMs have been used in case studies. Hungary and Slovakia have RAMs which are used at national or regional scale. Three countries use field observations in combination with laboratory analysis. Two of them use also GIS as third technique. Slovakia is the only country with a different approach, they use remote sensing. Comparing the collected RAMs to the guidelines of Eckelmann et al. (2006) we concluded that these RAMs can be used at Tier 2, that is for the measurements and implementation within the risk zones identified by Tier 1. RAMHU2 and RAMSL give medium-scale maps (1: 50,000 – 1: 10,000) that are recommended for more detailed classification than country or continental scale. RAMHU1 and RAMSP provide largescale maps (1: 50,000 – 1: 10,000) that are needed only for practical operations at hot spots. The used input parameters agree with those recommended by Eckelmann et al., 2006. The temporal resolution is equivalent or higher than given in the guidelines for the large-scale mapping (1-3-6 years, depending on the variable). Since we haven’t received answer from more countries that have areas at risk of salt and/or sodium damage we must complete our review from scientific literature. The harmonization of RAMs and the subsequent EU-wide protection of soils will improve soil quality and the conditions of crop production.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1583 CHARACTERIZATION OF WINTER BARLEY GENOTYPES IN CROATIAN ENVIRONMENT Josip KOVACEVIC1 - Alojzije LALIC1 - Zorica JURKOVIĆ1 1 Agricultural Institute Osijek, Juzno predgrade 17, 31000 Osijek, Croatia , e-mail:josip.kovacevic@poljinos.hr 2 University J. J. Strossmayer in Osijek, Faculty of Agriculture, Trg Svetog Trojstva 3, 31000 Osijek, Croatia Abstract: Research is based on grain yield results reached from field trials carried out with 14 winter barley varieties (Hordeum vulgare L.) during four growing seasons (2004 to 2007), at four sites (Osijek-eutric cambisol, Pozega-pseudogley, Tovarnik-hypogley and Nova Gradiska-alluvial soil) and with two sowing densities (300 and 450 kernels per m 2 ). Significant effects of year, locality and variety on grain yield were estimated (F=0.001). Difference between two sowing densities (300 and 450 kernels per m 2 ) was not significant, as well as interaction variety*sowing density. Significant interactions year*sowing density, locality*sowing density, year*locality*sowing density, locality*variety, year*variety, year*variety*locality were found. Based on realized grain yield, variance of deviation from regression (S 2 di), coefficient of regression (bi) and interaction scores (AMMI1 analysis), varieties Barun, Gvozd and Prometej are suitable for more intensive conditions of growing. Higher parameters of stability and interaction scores (AMMI1 analysis) indicate that variety Bingo, which had the highest grain yield, showed favorable reactions of grain yield also in more extensive growing conditions (at lower level of production). Keywords: winter barley, variety, grain yield, GEI Introduction During the evaluation of genotype in process of breeding and introduction of variety into production it is significant to investigate the adaptability and stability of the grain yield and parameters of special purpose quality in different conditions of production, at different localities, but also in different years. Based on estimated great importance of environmental effects, especially effects of the year, Costa et al. (2001) indicated that it is justified to carry out the selection during longer period of time and that increasing of the number of localities is not recommendable as an alternative solution for shortening the process of breeding. For specific subregion, breeding for specific adaptability aimed at increasing of the grain yield and special purpose quality of grain is significant strategy of utilization of the positive interaction genotype*environment (Annicchiarico, 2002, Bhutta, 2007, Erzsébet and Pepó, 2007). Application of this breeding strategy in sustainable agriculture is also significant because it enables reaching of maximal utilization level of subregions' potentials with appropriate genotypes which are especially suitable for growing in arid and semi-arid areas. Material and methods Ten 2-rowed and four 6-rowed winter barley cultivars were grown under field conditions on four localities–Tovarnik (hypogley), Osijek (eutric cambisol), Pozega (pseudogley) and Nova Gradiska (alluvial soil) = a, b, c and d, respectively) for four growing seasons (2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007). Soil properties were different degrees for barley growing (pH in 1n KCl: 7.10, 5.95, 4.20 and 7.60, for a, b, c and d, respectively). Ten varieties were developed at Agricultural Institute Osijek (Sladoran, Rex, Zlatko, Gvozd, Prometej, Barun, Trenk, Bingo, Lord and Princ), varieties Tiffany and Vanessa originate from Germany, variety Plaisant from France and variety Favorit</p><p id="Pg190">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1584 was created at BC Institute Zagreb. The trial was set in three replications with two sowing densities (300 and 450 grain/m2). Surface of the basic plot was 7,56 m2. Effect of variety*environment interaction was investigated. Stability of grain yield was estimated for each variety by coefficient of regression (bi) (Finlay and Wilkinson, 1963), ecovalence (Wi) (Wricke, 1962) and variance of deviation from regression (S2di) (Erberhart and Russell, 1966). Values of the main effects and the first interaction axis for interpretation of genotype*environment interaction were presented in graphic representation–biplot analysis of AMMI1 model, and biplot for 14 varieties and tested localities was constructed (Gauch, 1992; Annicchiarico, 2002). Variance analysis was carried out according to GLM procedure for RCBD plot design (SAS 8e). The software IRRISTAT, released by IRRI of Manila, was used for AMMI1 biplot analysis. Results and discussions Variance analysis by ANOVA was used to estimate significant effects of year, locality and variety on grain yield (F=0.001). While significant difference between two sowing densities (300 and 450 kernels per m2) and significant interaction variety*sowing density were not estimated, significant interactions Y(year)*D(sowing density), L(locality)*D, Y*L*D, L*G(variety), Y*G, Y*G*L were found (Table 1.). Significant difference in grain yields for different sowing densities was not obtained. With sowing density of 450 kernels per m2 realized grain yield was 6.793 t/ha, and with sowing density of 300 kernels per m2 grain yield was 6.796 t/ha. The highest and statistically similar grain yields had varieties Bingo (7.357 t/ha), Barun (7.336 t/ha), Gvozd (7.281 t/ha), Zlatko (7.214 t/ha) and Prometej (7.147 t/ha) (Table 3.). Table 1.

Difference in period of earing between mentioned groups of varieties was from six to twelve days, depending on year and variety. That reaction of late maturing varieties is certainly related to date of earing and period of grain filling interaction, and also drought (stress) conditions of growing that are usual in Republic of Croatia and south-eastern Europe. Shakhatreh et al. (2001) indicated that lasting of the grain filling period in terms of favorable humidity has favorable effect on grain yield and grain quality, but in drought</p><p id="Pg192">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1586 conditions genotypes with longer period of vegetation gave much lower grain yields. Dofing (1999) points out that a better understanding of relationships between developmental traits and grain yield would enable breeders to select for lines having growth patterns that optimize the conflicting requirements of high grain yield and early maturity. Interaction scores (IPCA 1) (Graph 1 and 2) and grain yield level (Table 3.) indicate significant reactions of varieties depending on location with reference to different soil types and different pH value in interrelation with climate conditions and applied technology. High interaction scores (IPCA 1), opposite, were found at localities Osijek and Nova Gradiska, and also in years 2004 and 2006. Those scores indicate that positive or negative, but certainly specific reactions of tested genotypes at mentioned localities could be expected. Related to localities, variety Tiffany and Favorit had high positive interaction scores (IPCA1), but at lower level of grain yield. Variety Barun had higher negative interaction scores at higher level of grain yield (Graph 1, Table 3.). Related to year of testing, high interaction scores were obtained for variety Tiffany with lower average grain yield. Variety Bingo had higher negative interaction score, but with high grain yield. In the case of AMMI1 analysis, represented interaction scores for mentioned varieties were higher for the year of testing than for localities. Higher differences between interaction scores for year and locality were obtained in the case of variety Trenk what indicates that it is possible to expect more important reaction of this variety if it is influenced by the year than by tested localities. Conclusions Results indicate existing of significant differences among varieties in grain yield, reactions of varieties on environment and production technology. Therefore, by choice of variety we can significantly influence the success of production, improve quantity and stability of production and achieve adequate quality of grain.

Elimination of this species is required since it hinders secondary succession. In June 2006 broadcast-applied glyphosate was sprayed to three oldfileds. Broadcast application of glyphosate affects both target and non-target species in the plant community. In June 2006 and 2007, percentage cover of vascular plant species was estimated in 1 m 2 plots. Relative abundance of categories of seed bank types and time of seed production were used to explore the effects of herbicide treatment on the resident vegetation. The revealed changes showed that non-target vegetation was significantly affected by the extensive herbicide application in the study sites. The time of seed production has more predictive value on the nature of vegetation changes than does soil seed bank type. Species producing seeds before glyphosate application gained advantage in contrast with species of usual seed production after the glyphosate treatment. The abundance of species with different seed bank types changed according to the time of seed production. Keywords: oldfield, glyphosate, vegetation composition, non-target effects Introduction Biological invasion is considered to be a major threat to biodiversity along with global climate change (Várallyay 2007; Dobó et al. 2006). In Hungary, large agricultural areas were abandoned in the late '70s (Szirmai and Czóbel 2006). Several of them have been invaded by common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca L.). Elimination of this species is essential in oldfields since it hinders regeneration processes. Glyphosate application may be a cost-effective way to control common milkweed. Broadcast application of herbicides reduces surface disturbance needed for seed germination of common milkweed and is less labour-intensive than spot spraying. However, glyphosate is a nonselective herbicide and affects both target and non-target species in the plant community (Mason and French 2007). Timing, extent and intensity of spraying determines the direction and speed of changes in the resident vegetation. Large-scale non-selective herbicide applications mean catastrophic disturbance events to the non-target vegetation. In these cases the role of soil seed bank increases as a primary propagule source, especially in short time scales. Based on seed longevity data Thompson (1992, 1993) described three categories of soil seed bank. Seeds of species with transient seed bank remain viable in the soil for less than one year. Germination of short-term persistent seeds ceases between two and five years. Long term persistent seeds keeps germinability for five years or longer in the soil. Species with long-term persistent seed bank are primarily supposed to be able to contribute to the regeneration of grasslands after management measures (von Blanckenhagen and Poschlod 2005). The timing of treatment may also have great significant effects on the nature of changes. In semiarid sandy oldfields the growing season is interrupted in summer for many plant species due to drought period (Stekauerová and Nagy 2007). Species with seed</p><p id="Pg194">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1588 production solely before and after herbicide application are supposedly either facilitated or suppressed following glyphosate treatment. We hypothesized that: 1. Species with long-term persistent seed bank increase while those with transient seed bank decrease in abundance following glyphosate treatment. 2. Species producing seeds before glyphosate application gain advantage and increase in abundance in contrast with species of usual seed production after the glyphosate treatment. Materials and methods The study sites are situated near the strictly protected Fülöpháza Sand Dunes in the Kiskunság National Park, Hungary. The climate is continental with a strong semiaridity character, particularly in the summer months. Mean annual temperature is 10.5 oC and mean annual precipitation is 550-600 mm. The soil of the site is coarse textured sand soil with high calcium-carbonate, low organic matter content and extreme soil moisture regime (Várallyay 2006). The three study sites have been abandoned for approximately 20 years. They are similar according to abiotic characteristics and distance from natural vegetation. The potential vegetation is considered to be open sand grassland (Festucetum vaginatae). In June 2006 broadcast-applied glyphosate (Medallon, 2 l ha-1) was sprayed to the study sites. Since the common milkweed was not controlled at all at the used dosage rate, two weeks later the treatment was repeated with 7 l ha-1 Medallon solution. Altogether 48 randomly selected 1 m2 plots were designated in the three study sites. Because of differences in within site heterogeneity of the vegetation, the following number of plots were sampled at the sites: 10, 8, 30. In June 2006 and 2007, percentage cover of each vascular plant species was estimated. Seed bank types according to Thompson (1992, 1993) and Csontos (2001) and time of seed production were used to explore the effects of herbicide treatment on the resident vegetation (Table 1). Each species was assigned to one category of each trait. Relative abundance of aboveground vegetation data were used to show changes following glyphosate application. The statistical significance of the response of each category to glyphosate application was tested using paired t-test. Percentage values were arcsin transformed to conform the normality assumptions of the test. Table 1.

Changes in the relative proportion of seed bank and seed production time categories based on cover abundance of aboveground vegetation data following glyphosate application in June 2006. For abbreviations see Table 1. Our results show that species are strongly dependent on seed crop from the previous year. Mean abundance of species that could not produce seeds dropped to one third (from 0.60 to 0.18, t47= 12.968, p&lt;0.001) after glyphosate treatment. The share of species that succeeded in producing seeds before glyphosate application increased significantly from 0.34 to 0.72, (t47= -9.992, p&lt;0.001). The ratio of species with different seed bank types changed according to the time of seed production. Some of the transient species had dispersed seeds before June. The abundance of these species is one and a half times as large as it was before the treatment (from 0.21 to 0.35, t47= -2.964, p=0.005). The share of transient species dispersing seeds usually after June was low in 2006 (0.01 on average) and decreased further to 0.08 (t47= 0.283, p=0.778). Although species with long-term persistent seed bank are supposed to be the primary sources for grassland regeneration (von Blanckenhagen and Poschlod 2005), long-term seed persistence does not guarantee higher abundance after disturbance as a rule. The ratio of species with long-term persistence dropped significantly from 0.44 to 0.11 (t47= 9.755, p&lt;0.001) between the two years. Halassy (2001) studied the soil seed bank of sandy oldfields near our study sites and confirmed the general observation that the similarity of soil seed bank and aboveground vegetation is very low in grasslands. This may explain the vast changes in the species composition in our study.</p><p id="Pg196">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1590 Conclusions The revealed changes showed that non-target vegetation was significantly affected by extensive herbicide application in the study sites. The time of seed production has more predictive value on the nature of vegetation changes than soil seed bank type. According to the results the first hypothesis has been rejected. Even species with longterm persistent seeds could increase in abundance only if seed dispersal was successful in the previous year. The second hypothesis on the role of seed production time has been accepted. Species producing seeds before glyphosate application gained advantage in contrast with species of usual seed production time after the glyphosate treatment.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1591 EU BIO-FUEL TECHNOLOGIES AND POLICIES: AN ENVIRONMETAL BENEFIT FOR SUSTAINABLE ENERGY Attila PERCZE 1 – Péter BALÁZS3 1 Institute of Crop Production, Szent István University, Hungary, percze.attila@mkk.szie.hu 2 Institute of Economics, Szent István University, Hungary 3Institute of Reginal Economics and Rural Development, Szent István University, Hungary Abstract:The production and use of bio-fuels in Europe has been developing more seriously only just the past five to ten years. Bio-fuels are an important technology for reducing the CO2 emission in transport. For fuels produced from biomass, various conversion routes are available that follow from the different types of biomass feedstock’s. Although insights on technological and cost developments and the expected commercial availability of these bio-fuels are changing continuously, it can be stated that these bio-fuels will probably not be produced and applied on a commercial scale before 2010. Currently, only ethanol, (and its derivative ETBE) are applied on a commercial basis on the European market. They will remain the dominant bio-fuels in the coming decade, as alternative bio-fuel technologies are still in the development stage. At present, the biofuel producing countries in the European Union only have a small share in global production of bio-fuels, (&lt;6%). The main ethanol producers are the USA and Brazil. However, Europe is the most important producer of bio-diesel on the global market. Although the importance of the use of bio-fuels in transport has already been stressed in the EU White Paper on renewable sources of energy (1997) and the Green Paper on a European strategy for the security of energy supply (2000), this has not led to the development of concrete bio-fuel specific national policies in many EU Member States. Keywords: Bio-fuel, CO2 emission, biomass, pyrolysis, soil organic matter Introduction The use of biofuels in automotive engines has been known for a long time, but in Europe the production and use of these fuels has been developing more seriously only just the past five to ten years. In the development of the engine in late nineteenth century biofuels (ethanol) were used for experiments. During the twentieth century other fuels, namely petrol and diesel derived from crude oil, developed so strongly that biofuels were only used on a very small scale in the transport sector. A reason for the dominance of fossil fuels in this sector is the large and cheap supply of its main feedstock, crude oil. Nowadays, petrol and diesel are still the most common fuels used in vehicles but the (experimental) application of biofuels has been expanding, which is partly due to European and national environmental policies (EC, 2005). In the EU, transport is responsible for an estimated 21% of all greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to global warming, and the percentage is rising. In order to meet sustainability goals, in particular the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions agreed under the Kyoto Protocol, it is therefore essential to find ways of reducing emissions from transport. This is not the only challenge. Nearly all the energy used in the EU transport sector comes from oil. Known oil reserves are limited in quantity and restricted to a few world regions (Demirbas, 2004, 2005). New reserves exist, but will mostly be more difficult to exploit. Securing energy supplies for the future is therefore not only a question of reducing import dependency, but calls for a wide range of policy initiatives, including diversification of sources and technologies.</p><p id="Pg198">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1592 In the EU a range of actions is already being taken. Vehicle manufacturers are developing new models that are cleaner and more fuel efficient, as well as working on new concepts. Efforts are also being made to improve public transport and encourage the use of environmentally-friendly modes of transport where possible. Further endeavors are needed to make reductions in the amount of energy used for transport (EC, 2006). The central importance of energy policy in helping the EU meet the challenges of globalization was confirmed by the Union’s heads of state and government at the informal Hampton Court summit in October 2005 where the Commission was requested to prepare proposals for the development of a reinvigorated European Energy Policy. One important element of such an approach would be means to address Europe’s overdependency on imported oil and gas and to develop a coherent approach, based on a robust economic, environmental and social impact analysis, on how to progressively reduce this dependency (EEA, 2005, IEA, 2004). The EU is supporting biofuels with the objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, boosting the decarbonisation of transport fuels, diversifying fuel supply sources and developing long-term replacements for fossil oil. The development of biofuel production is expected to offer new opportunities to diversify income and employment in rural areas (EC, 2004, 2006). In the context of the review of the Biofuels Directive that the Commission is due to carry out by the end of 2006, attention will be paid to the issue of cost-effectiveness, the level of ambition after 2010, and to assessing and monitoring the full environmental impact of biofuels. The production of biofuels from suitable feedstocks could also generate economic and environmental benefits in a number of developing countries, create additional employment, reduce energy import bills and open up potential export markets. In particular, the production of bioethanol could offer a feasible alternative for some sugar-producing countries affected by the reform of the EU sugar regime (EC, 2006, Czövek et al. 2006, Kassai et al. 2006, Márton, 2006, Tanács et al. 2006)). Biofuels in Europe Resulting from programs launched in the late 1970s to help compensate for oil related constraints; biofuels now have been under industrial development for over 20 years. This still handicapped by high costs, their future once again looks promising because they might be able to help reduce oil consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector. This is especially true in Europe, where recently approved directives contain ambitious production volume targets encouraging member states to develop biofuels . Following the oil shocks of the 1970s, many countries saw biofuels as a realistic solution to the problem of dependence on oil resources. Furthermore, biofuels could be blended with conventional fuels to achieve gains in the area of polluting vehicle emissions. Their development was slowed, however, by the counter-shock of 1986 and the persistence of high prices (EC, 2005). The context has become more favorable subsequent to at least three changes: - Public opinion is exerting pressure on public authorities to fight the greenhouse effect. The latter are looking for solutions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG)</p><p id="Pg199">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1593 emissions, especially in the transport sector. It is thought that the use of biofuels substantially reduces GHG emissions compared to conventional motor fuels. In fact, when biofuels are used in their pure form, the decrease in GHG emissions ranges from 60% to 70%, respectively, for ethanol versus gasoline and for vegetable oil methyl esters (VOME) versus diesel. - Given that conventional crude reserves are concentrated in the Middle East, that there is uncertainty as to their medium and long-term prospects and that regional production might peak, many governments are implementing policies to promote the emergence of alternative energy resources. In this respect, biofuels appear to be a significant option. - Finally, the uptrend in oil prices over the last two years encourages the development of alternatives solutions, especially biofuels. The biggest barrier to the large-scale development of biofuels remains their excessive cost compared to petroleum motor fuels. But biofuels are attractive because they have a major advantage over other alternative fuels: they can be blended with conventional motor fuels, so that there is no need to adapt vehicles or develop a dedicated distribution system. Environmental Benefits For years, biofuels were saluted as offering the means of decreasing conventional polluting vehicle emissions (in the early 1980s). This is less true today, due to advances in the combustion technologies applied to engines and exhaust treatment systems (catalytic converters, particle filters). In the future, biofuels will be developed to help reduce GHG emissions and the degree of dependence on oil resources. According to Figure 1, biofuels are expected to yield gains of 60-70% compared to conventional solutions, when considering the entire production cycle (from raw materials to end product combustion). This is called life cycle analysis (LCA). Fig 1. GHG emissions: The gains of biofuels compared to conventional motor fuels</p><p id="Pg200">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1594 Conclusion Mechanisms need to be put in place in order to ensure that the the whole chain of biomass and biofuels production is sustainable. This requires options for efficient and sustainable crops and involves the promotion of both the primary and residual forms of agricultural and forestry operations; the entire value chain needs to be evaluated for biofuels using a “well-to-wheels” (WTW) type analysis. This will require optimisation of the geographical locations of production facilities and the origins of feedstock. Production and feedstock supplies need to be assessed globally, taking account of different growing conditions (climate), soil organic matter and labour costs. There are many alternative types of biofuel and production processes. To ensure competition in the delivery of competitive, renewable and secure biofuels it is important not to lock into one product or technology today, but to create an environment in which such products and technologies can evolve. The expected growth of the biofuels market and the development of new transformation pathways, such as gasification, make it timely to investigate new integrated refining schemes. The biorefineries will be characterised by an efficient integration of various steps, from handling and processing of biomass, fermentation in bioreactors, chemical processing, and final recovery and purification of the product. Biofuels and their raw materials are traded on world markets. In view of increasing our security of supply, a fully self-sufficient approach to meeting the EU’s needs is neither possible nor desirable. The Commission should pursue a balanced approach in encouraging both domestic production and imports. Export of European biofuel technology to countries that export biofuels to the EU will help the EU biofuel technology industry to achieve and maintain a competitive position globally.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1595 SURFACE WATER AS NATURAL RESERVES OF SOIL WATER IN RYE ISLAND Yvetta VELÍSKOVÁ – Renáta DULOVIČOVÁ Institute of Hydrology, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Racianska 75, 831 02 Bratislava, Slovakia, e-mail: veliskova@uh.savba.sk Abstract: The aim of this paper is assessment of values of hydraulic conductivity as the important characteristic for determination of permeability or rate of interaction between surface water in the Komárňanský channel and ground or soil water nearby the channel and also assessment of changes of aggradation state of this channel at the Rye Island channel network in the period from 1993 to 2004. Keywords: soil water, surface water, interaction, natural reserves Introduction Water resource management at the Rye Island have to solve problems during dry periods or floods, which are connected with irrigation or drainage function of the channel network at this area. To regulate water regime at this area needs information about mutual interaction between the channel network and groundwater and by this way soil water. The aim of the built channel network has been to drain wet area, to irrigate fields during dry period and to regulate the groundwater level. The aim of this paper is determination of hydraulic conductivity of silts in the Komárňanský channel at the Rye Island channel network and to evaluate the change of aggradation state of this channel in the period from 1993 to 2004. Basic characteristics of Rye Island region and channel network Rye Island is part of the Danube Lowland and, because of its favourable climate, soil and morphological conditions, is one of the most productive agricultural areas of Slovakia. The area of Rye Island is approximately 2000 km2, which represents about 4% of the Slovak territory, but about 10% of the most productive arable land. Its average slope is about 2,5.10-4, and this was one of the reasons for building channel network at this area (as a drainage system). Rye Island is the result of sedimentation of the Danube River. There are medium soils in majority (66%), then heavy soils (23%) and the rest are light or very heavy soils (Šútor - Štekauerová, 2000). The general direction of groundwater flow during periods of low discharges in the Danube River along the length of Rye Island is in a south-eastern direction, more or less parallel to the Danube flow direction. When the water level in the Danube is relatively high, large amounts of water infiltrate into the Rye Island aquifer, with velocity vectors of the seepage water being close to 90 degree to the Danube River flow direction (Kosorin, 1997). In order to secure recharge into the Rye Island aquifer, it is necessary to keep water levels in the Danube River relatively high, and run seepage channels which allow one to control the water table. It is possible to use to regulate and control the groundwater table at Rye Island area by existing channel network. The problem of water level regulation at this area is complex. Therefore, many specialists were interested in solution of it (Kosorin, K. 1997; Nagy et al., 2007; Stehlová, 2007; Štekauerová et al., 2006; Várallyay, 2007). Channels, manipulating objects and pumping stations as basic elements of this channel network allow to control</p><p id="Pg202">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1596 water level in channels to achieve optimal position of groundwater table during vegetation period. The thickness and structure of bed silts are factors influencing this interaction, therefore it has been necessary to assess also the impact of channel network silting up on it and characteristics which are necessary for evaluation of surface water impact to soil water reserve, it means the hydraulic conductivity and by this way permeability. Measurement of Komárňanský channel silting up The measurements of silt thickness were performed in 1993. Measurements were done at the distance 1,0-2,0 m in cross-section direction and distances of evaluated crosssections were in the range 2,0-5,0 km. The measurement data included distance of a measured point from the right channel bank, water depth, silt thickness and average silt thickness in the profile. The average silt thicknesses were determined as a ratio of a cross-section profile silt area and width of the channel. The average silt thickness distribution along Komárňanský channel is shown in Fig. 1. 0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1 1,2 1,4 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 channel distance [km] av er ag e si lt t h ic k n es s [m ] Figure 1. The average silt thickness distribution along the channel In 2004 there were performed control measurements at selected profiles of Komárňanský channel for checking of the silting up changes. It is desirable to remind that all measurements were done from surface water level, so only the differences between silt top and channel bottom levels were estimated. The volume of suspended load sediments was calculated from average silt thickness and from its distribution along the channel and its values are in Tab.1. The shape of cross-sections along this channel has been changed. The changes of silt thickness are variable along the channel. At the beginning part it is without change (Hadovce - km 2,2), but in the middle part (Okoličná na Ostrove - km 14,8) it increased from 0,4 m to 0,8 m. This part of channel was rather wide and deep with dense water vegetation. In the last part of the channel (Nový Golyáš - km 26,0) distribution of silt through this cross-section showed in 2004 relatively uniform trend. In this part was observed moderate increase of silt. Hydraulic conductivity of silts The water level in the channel network system has effect to groundwater level and in reverse. From view of mutual interaction between channel network and groundwater</p><p id="Pg203">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1597 and its impact on soil water reserves it has been necessary to know not only the silt thickness in the channels, but also permeability of silts. For that reason we also took the samples of silts for determination of its granularity and hydraulic conductivity at the same time as we measured the silt thicknesses. However, in some cases there was not possible to take them (the banks were overgrown with vegetation; the alluvium had liquid consistence and thin thickness or the silt included large content of organic mass). So it was not possible to establish its parameters (granularity and value of hydraulic conductivity). If we want to know the permeability of silts in the channels, we have to determine their hydraulic conductivity. It is possible to use several empirical relationships for this, but as we could not take of undisturbed samples, we could use only the relationships by Beyer-Schweiger (cited in Mucha - Šestakov, 1987) and by Špaček (1987). These relationships are: - Beyer-Schweiger formula for the hydraulic conductivity (m s-1)  210 6 dC10.5,7K  (1) where C= f (d10, d60), d10 – particle diameter in 10% of soil mass (m), d60 – particle diameter in 60% of soil mass (m) and conditions of validity 6,0d06,0 10  ; 20 d d 1 10 60  . - Špaček formulas for the hydraulic conductivity (m d-1)   059,0 1060 013,1 10.I dd 5,0 d.577,20K           (2)     7726,060 8866,0 10.II dd4386,108K  (3) and conditions of validity for application of eq.(2) are: 1. d10 &lt; 0,01mm or 2. 106010 d5765,00576,0d13,0d01.0  and conditions of validity for application of eq.(3) are: 1. mm0,13d10  or 2. 106010 d5765,00576,0d13,0d01.0  . Conclusions Aim of this paper was determination of permeability or rate of interaction between surface water in the Komárňanský channel and ground or soil water nearby this channel and also to evaluate the changes of aggradation state of the channel at the Rye Island channel network in the period from 1993 to 2004. Measurements of silt thickness were done in 1993 more detailed. Then in 2004 were done measurements at selected profiles for checking of the silting up changes. According to results of measurements we can say that at the beginning parts of channels the silt thickness are nearly without changes. In the middle parts we observed luxuriant water vegetation and the silt thickness increased. In the ending parts of the Komárňanský channel there was observed only moderate increase of silts. The values of silt volume in km 4,0 – 26,0 of the Komárňanský channel are presented in table 1. These values document that silts have been increased from 161 344 m3 to 234 729 m3 in monitored period.</p><p id="Pg204">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1598 The observed facts could be useful for channels maintenance, as a base for expectation of silting up process in the channels. Also the knowledge about silt thickness in the channels is important from the view of interaction between channel network and groundwater, especially when this information is supplemented by the hydraulic conductivity as important characteristic of rate of interaction between surface water in the Komárňanský channel and ground or soil water nearby the channel. So the other aim of field measurements was determination of the silt permeability, which is characterised by hydraulic conductivity. Their values were calculated by empirical formulas mentioned above and results are shown in Table 2. The hydraulic conductivity values obtained from the same sample are rather different (in several cases), so it is necessary to choose valid number very carefully. These characteristics will be used for simulation of interaction between channel network and groundwater at the Rye Island area and for determination of surface water impact on reserves of soil water at this area.

Both grass and maize formed more porous soil in Macov, with nearly the same hydraulic properties for both plant covers. Both grass and pine formed less porous soil in Sekule by hydrophobic coatings of soil particles. The hydraulic properties, measured in both sites of this locality, were influenced more by the changes in soil water content than in plant cover. Keywords: wettable soil, hydrophobic soil, hydraulic conductivity, bypassing ratio Introduction Infiltration is one of the processes, through which an influence of climate change on soil water regime is realized (Farkas et al., 2005; Stekauerova, 2005; Mikulec, Stehlova, 2006; Gombos, 2007). Infiltration rate is affected by soil characteristics (including ease of entry, storage capacity, and transmission rate through the soil), management practices, vegetation types and cover, water content of the soil, soil temperature, and rainfall intensity (Kutilek, Nielsen, 1994). Vegetation creates more porous soils by both protecting the soil from pounding rainfall, which can close natural gaps between soil particles, and loosening soil through root action. Enhanced infiltration can protect sloping plots from runoff, nutrient losses and soil erosion (Pekarova, Veliskova, 1998; Sebin et al., 2007). On the other hand, vegetation can create less porous soils by hydrophobic coatings of soil particles. Potentially hydrophobic organic materials are produced by plant root exudates, certain fungal species, surface waxes from plant leaves, and decomposing soil organic matter (Doerr et al., 2000; Hallett et al., 2001; Belnap, Lange, 2006). The aim of this study was to estimate the impact of land-use change on hydraulic properties of wettable and hydrophobic (water repellent) soils. Materials and methods The study was undertaken in Macov and Sekule (south-western Slovakia). The soil in Macov was Calcari-Haplic Chernozem (WRB, 1994) and had a loamy texture (SSM, 1993). The soil in Sekule was Regosol formed from windblown sand (WRB, 1994) and had a sandy texture (SSM, 1993). As the basic characteristics of the soils studied are nearly the same in both sites of each locality, the mean values are presented in Table 1. Two sites were demarcated in each locality. In Macov, the first site was uncultivated and covered with grass. The second site was cultivated and planted with maize. The hydraulic properties were measured here from 6 till 9 September 2002 with 15 replicates (site 1), and from 22 till 26 July 2002 with 10 replicates (site 2). In Sekule,</p><p id="Pg206">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1600 the first site was a meadow with the predominating grass species. The second site was a pine forest, with the soil covered predominantly with moss species. The hydraulic properties were measured here separately for wet and dry spells in June – August 2005 and in July – September 2006, with n = 4–7 replicates. The daily temperature maximums and daily precipitation amounts with accentuated hot and dry spells are presented in Table 2 in Lichner et al. (2007). Table 1. Basic characteristics of the soils studied Locality Depth (cm) Sand/Silt/Clay (%) CaCO3 (%) C (%) pH (H2O) pH (KCl) Macov 0–10 37.0/48.8/14.2 26 1.38 8.0 7.7 Sekule 0–5 92.7/1.9/5.4 &lt;0.05 0.55 5.3 3.9 The gravimetric soil water content θ was determined after drying at 50oC. The persistence of water repellency was measured by means of the water drop penetration time (WDPT) test. Three drops of distilled water (with the volume of 585 μL) from a medicinal dropper were placed onto the soil surface and the actual time tp required for infiltration was recorded (Doerr et al., 2000). The following classes of the persistence of WR were distinguished: wettable or non-water-repellent soil (the water drop penetration time tp &lt; 5 s); slightly (tp = 5–60 s), strongly (tp = 60–600 s), severely (tp = 600–3600 s), and extremely (tp &gt; 3600 s) water repellent soil (Dekker et al., 2000). The first two terms of the Philip infiltration equation were used to estimate hydraulic conductivity as follows: I = C1 t 1/2 + C2 t (1) where C1, C2 are coefficients and t is time. The saturated hydraulic conductivity Ks was measured with a double-ring infiltrometer at a pressure head h0 = +3 cm, and estimated from: Ks = C2/m, using m = 0.667 noted as the most frequently used value (Kutilek, Nielsen, 1994). The inner-ring diameter of the infiltrometer was 24.5 cm, the buffer ring diameter 34.5 cm, and the length 23.5 cm. The hydraulic conductivity k(h0) was measured with a tension infiltrometer (Soil Measurement Systems, Tucson, USA) in Macov and with a mini disk infiltrometer (Decagon Devices, Inc., Pullman, USA) in Sekule, at pressure head h0 = –3 cm and –2 cm, respectively, and estimated according to the instructions in user’s manuals. Both pressure heads exclude flow through pores with diameters &gt; 1 mm, as the contact angle α in Sekule was set to be about 45° in accordance with the findings by Czachor (2006). The share of flux through the pores with radii r more than approximately 0.5 mm (macropores) called bypassing ratio Br, was calculated from: Br ≈ [Ks – k(h0)]/Ks (2) with r = 2σ cosα/ρgh0, where σ is the surface tension of water, α is the contact angle between the water and the pore wall, ρ is the density of water, g is acceleration due to gravity (Watson, Luxmoore, 1986).</p><p id="Pg207">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1601 Results and discussion Different land use in Macov resulted in significantly different standard deviations in the estimates of saturated hydraulic conductivity only, when the standard deviation obtained at the meadow site was more than 10-times than that obtained in the maize field (Table 2). It could be the cause of a small volume (less than the representative elementary volume REV) of the soil studied. Three months after ploughing and harrowing, the number of hydrological effective (= surface vented) macropores in the maize field seems to be nearly the same as that in grass site, as it can be seen from very close values of the saturated hydraulic conductivity. It should be mentioned that temporal variations of hydraulic properties Ks, k(h0), and Br in the maize field can gain 2, 3, and 1 order of magnitude, respectively, due to management practices and rainfall, as it was measured in growing season 2000 (Lichner, Houskova, 2001). However, shortly after such a disturbance the organisms start to recover optimal conditions for their existence, e.g. by forming the surface vented macropores and aggregates to enhance infiltration, etc. Table 2.

Even the increase in soil water content, resulting in the decrease in water drop penetration time in three orders of magnitude, did not result in substantial differences in the estimates of hydraulic characteristics. In contrast with these results, Dekker et al. (2000) found higher persistence of repellency in the surface layer of dune sands covered with grass vegetation than that with vegetation consisting of pine. Wahl et al. (2003) found that forest transformation from Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) ecosystems to mixed pine-beech does not exhibit positive effects on water retention, while infiltration capacity remains unaffected.

Winter wheat data were subjected to the Additive Main Effects and Multiplicative Interaction (AMMI) analysis. Results indicated a significant GEI for grain yield and its components that influenced the relative ranking of the genotypes across the environments. Informative visualization of AMMI results in form of biplot is discussed. Keywords: multiple environment trials, GEI, AMMI model, winter wheat, yield Introduction Multiple environment trials are important for bread wheat breeding programs in producing high-yielding, adapted lines for a wide range of environments differing in soil fertility whether conditions and prevailing pests and diseases. Plant nutrient supply at particular environment can vary with soil type (Prokisch et al., 2007) as well as with local agricultural practice (Baric et al 2007; Novoselovic et al., 2007). Among abiotic stresses, soil water deficit (Balla et al., 2006; Inagaki et al., 2007; Bhutta, 2007) and salinity (Farooq et al., 2007) can cause severe decrease of wheat yield particularly in genotypes purely adapted to such conditions. Additive Main effects and Multiplicative Interaction (AMMI) analysis give more precise estimates of genotypic yields within locations than means across replicates, which facilitate formation by cluster analysis of more cohesive groups of genotypes and locations for biological interpretation of interactions than occurred with unadjusted means (Crossa et al., 1991). The objective of our study was to provide biologically meaningful interpretation of genotype by environment interactions of yield and its components for cultivar recommendations using AMMI. Materials and methods Field experiments with eight wheat genotypes were conducted during the 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 growing seasons at three locations in Croatia: Botinec (carbonate alluvium), Rugvica (semigley) and Lovas (degraded chernozem). Three commercial cultivars (Sana, Zitarka and Renan) and five elite breeding lines (Bc 5204, Bc 9362, Bc 5263, Bc 5137 and Bc 5167) created at the Bc Institute for Breeding and Production of Field Crops were sown in six row plots of 5 m2 at a density of 700 grains m-2. Agricultural practice was as recommended for optimal wheat production at each location. Genotypic and environmental means on grain yield, test weight and thousand kernel weight was used for construction of two way table with following abbreviations for 8 selected genotypes: Sana = SANA, Zitarka = ZITA, Renan = RENA, Bc 5204 =</p><p id="Pg210">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Data were analyzed using AMMI models, which are defined by the equation: ijl )1n,1mmin( 1l jlilljiij egy     , where yij is yield of genotype i in environment j;  general mean; gi and ej main effects of genotype i and environment j; m and n numbers of genotypes and environments; l, il, and jl eigenvalues for interaction principal component axe (IPCA) l, genotype i and environment j; and ijl model residual. This definition represents the whole family of AMMI models (Gauch, 1992) with F test used for selection the best model (Cornelius, 1993; Gunjaca et al. 2007). All ANOVA models was conducted by SAS procedures MIXED and GLM (SAS Institute Inc., 2007) and MATMODEL software (Gauch, 1998) for fitting AMMI models and selecting the best among them. Results and discussion Here we present results for AMMI model analysis by its biplot visualization. Any genotype with an AMMI score close to zero shows general adaptation of that trait to the tested environments and these genotypes can be considered as stable in an agricultural sense. A large genotypic AMMI score reflects more specific adaptation to environments with AMMI scores of the same sign (Fox et al., 1997). 9362 ZITA SANA 5263 5137 5204 5167 RENA BO45 RU45 RU34 BO34 LO34 LO45 -50,0 -40,0 -30,0 -20,0 -10,0 0,0 10,0 20,0 30,0 40,0 60,00 65,00 70,00 75,00 80,00 85,00 90,00 Mean Yield (dt ha-1) IP C A 1 Grain yield Figure 1.

Cereal Research Communications 1606 Conclusions Presented diagnostic features can be a powerful aid for selecting representative and noncorrelated locations, especially emphasized on soil types subjected to constant increase of different stresses (Várallyay, 2007). The most accurate way to evaluate the adaptability and stability of a genotype for a certain trait is to select the trial locations with the highest possible agricultural differences in crop production area. The characterization of the locations by soil types, microclimate, etc. in breeding programs, seems to be the crucial and continuous task for breeders in order to make the interpretation of the results given by AMMI model (or any other GEI analysis) meaningful and useful.

IN REGARD TO DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS Silvio ŠIMON 1 – Ivana Vladimira PETRIC 2 – Ivan PEJIĆ 1 1 Department of Plant Breeding , Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zagreb, Svetošimunska 25, Zagreb, email: ssimon@agr.hr 2 Croatian Institute of Viticulture and Enology Abstract: Škrlet bijeli is autochthonous grapevine cultivar grown in continental region. In the year 2000 programme of clonal selection started, 80 elite mother vines were selected and planted into two experimental collections. Most important agronomic traits were measured for 44 evenly distributed clonal candidates were measured and compared to their position in microdistricts in vineyard. Significant impact of the year was detected for all the traits. Variability between clonal candidates was also observed and some of them are promising candidates for individual clonal selection. Keywords: Vitis vinifera L.,cv. Škrlet bijeli, clonal selection, soil Introduction Cv. Škrlet bijeli is one of Croatian autochthonous grapevine cultivars and is predominantly grown in continental region. It is considered to be old cultivar and till recent no systematic selection was done. In the absence of genetic and sanitary selection differences in morphological and sanitary characteristics might appear even though grapevine is vegetatively propagated (Zdunić et al. 2007). Clonal selection of Škrlet bijeli started in the year 2000 and included whole growing region of this cultivar and as a result 80 elite vines were selected. Phenotypical differences observed between vines of the same cultivar may be due to phytosanitary status or can be a result of a mutation thus leading to intra cultivar genotypic variability (Konrad et al. 2004). Environment has a significant effect on phenotypical expression of the genotype of grapevine and in order to evaluate the genotype environmental effects must be minimized (Zdunić et al. 2007). Numerous researches have showed that crop year had significant effect on yield and experiment treatments (Jolánkai et al. 2006, Balla et al 2006). In addition fertilization is also one of the important factors in producing high yields (Balemi 2006). Nutritional status of the plant is dependent on the sorption complex of the soil and especially on the mutual ration of the cations (Nemeth et Izsaki 2005). The most important macro elements for grapevine are: nitrogen (N), potassium (K) and phosphorus (P). Nitrogen is the most important element in plant production and is required in a sufficient, as crop responses to variability in mineral nitrogen exert their effect on both yield and quality, especially that of a vegetative character (Horvat et al. 2006). Potassium is highly mobile in plants and can be redistributed from the older to the younger plant tissues (Tůma et al. 2007). In contrast the mobility of phosphorus in soil is low because of the generally low solubility of phosphate compounds and the strong P-binding capacity of soil components (Fodorne Feher et al. 2007) and soils need a sufficient pool of plant-available P (Füleky 2006). As previously reported intra varietal variability of cv. Škrlet bijeli was observed (Vokurka et al. 2004). The aim of this work was to test whether the position of the vine inside the vineyard (different microdistrics) can influence performance of clonal candidates (their variability).</p><p id="Pg214">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1608 Materials and methods The programme of clonal selection of cv. Škrlet bijeli started in the year 2000 and 80 elite clonal candidates were selected because of superior phenotype characteristics. In the subsequent years (2001 to 2003) two experimental vineyards were planted both containing vegetative progenies of same elite mother vines. Collection 1 was planted in Popovača and Collection 2 in Repušnica. Both terrains are on similar altitude above sea and are typical viticultural land. Both vineyards were cultivated according to standard viticultural practice. From the collection of 80 clonal candidates 44 evenly distributed in both collections were selected for this research. Experimental vineyards were divided into three microdistrics (top of the hill, in the middle and the bottom) and soil samples were taken in September 2007. Collections were planted as complete random design and selection of clonal candidates was according to spatial distribution among the vineyard. Soil analyses were done by the Department of Plant nutrition. Clonal candidates were analysed from 2004 to 2007 in the harvest and measured traits were: yield per vine, number of clusters per vine, sugar content of must (˚Oe, total acid in must (g/l as tartaric acid) and pH value of must. Analysis of variance was done using SAS Stat 9.03 and mean values were separated using Duncan multiple range test. Results and discussion Soil analysis (Table 1.) showed that there are some differences between the collections. Soil in collection 1 is slightly acid with 1.29 to 1.84% of humus, 0.07 to 0.11% of N and relatively low amount of K and P. Collection 2 had slightly higher pH reaction (up to 6.97) and the amount of P and K was optimal for grapevine. Table 1.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1609 unexpected results are for yield and sugar content (most important agronomic traits for grapevine). Collection 1 is significantly better than collection with average yield per vine of 3.56 kg in comparison to collection 2 (2.92 kg/vine) even though the soil analysis showed better results for collection 2. Microdistricts were significant for total acid content and for pH value but the F value for those traits are small when compared to F value for year (respectively 5.67 compared to 516.22 and 5.04 compared to 804.71).

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1611 TRENDS OF SUBSIDY AND CREDIT APPLICATION OF PLANT GROWER FARMS IN BÉKÉS COUNTY Veronika KELLE Institute of Social Sciences and Management, Faculty of Economics, Tessedik Sámuel College, Hungary 5600 Békéscsaba, Bajza u. 33., vkelle@zeus.tsf.hu Abstract: The most significant problems of the agricultural enterprises are the asset deficiency, the capital shortage, the low profitability and the financing problems of current production and development. The subsidies, the favourable credit terms, the European Union sources play an extremely important role in the improvement of financial condition, realization of investments and current assets financing of the farmers. In my survey by means of a questionnaire I analysed the application of agricultural subsidies and borrowing credit in Békés county, besides I studied the changes during the application of subsidies and credits in the last two years, comparing the results of my former analysis in 2006 with the results of my current questionnaire survey. Keywords: agricultural subsidies, preferential credit facilities, tendency of subsidy and credit application Introduction Due to the limited resources of small and medium sized agricultural enterprises, external resources necessary for operation have significant role. (Takács, TakácsGyörgy, 1999) In the previous years, farmers could apply for several national and European Union subsidies and favourable credit terms with special respect to area-based subsidies, opportunities of Agricultural and Rural Development Operative Programme (ARDOP) and National Rural Development Plan (NRDP), as well as operating funds credits dated over a year (capital supplemental credit), and investment credits. (Kelle, 2006; Baranyai, Takács, 2007) The experience of SAPARD, ARDOP and NRDP shows that previous doubts concerning the utilization of development sources were not proved, the financial demand in tenders and applications exceeded the set financial limit in some cases significantly. (Weisz, Kovács, 2007) Most of the priorities among the objects of ARDOP allowed SAPARD tenders which were rejected because of resource gap to be repeated. (Lengyel, 2006) Since Hungary became the member of the EU, the system of directly granted, area-based subsidies for farmers operate from two sources, yet connected to each other: standard area-based subsidies (SAPS) which are financed by the Guarantee Department of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), the additional national area-based subsidy (Top-up) which is connected to SAPS, however its source is the Hungarian budget. Since in Békés county the rate of arable land is outstandingly high, area-based subsidies are of significant importance. At the beginning of 2009 a unified supportive system for enterprises will be introduced whose aim is to turn the subsidies previously linked to the sector into income support independent from production. Hungary took full advantage of pre-joining subsidies and our situation seems promising for the future too, as development resources of more than 5 milliard euros have become accessible for the period between 2007 and 2013 through the New Hungary Rural Development Program for the Hungarian agriculture and countryside. The supportive system can not have an end in itself though, it must serve the sustainable development of the Hungarian agriculture which also increases its competitiveness (Várallyay, 2007; Husti, 2006), through which it provides the establishment of plants of viable size</p><p id="Pg218">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1612 (Takács-György, 1994), and it encourages the adaptation to new technological challanges in time. (Takács-György, 2007) In my survey I studied the application of agricultural subsidies and borrowing credit in Békés county by means of a questionnaire survey. This article aims at revealing the changes during the application of subsidies and credits in the last two years, comparing the results of my former analysis in 2006 with the results of my current questionnaire survey. Materials and methods The data of this study come from a quetionnaire survey containing 30 questions and filled in by 35 agricultural enterprises in Békés county selected at random out of 50; among these considering the type of the enterprise are 2 agricultural co-operatives (6%), 1 Ltd (3%), 1 deposit company (3%), 10 listed family-run enterprises (28%), 3 entrepreneurs (9%), and 18 primary producers (51%). The quite low rate of willingness to fill in the form can be explained by the fact that the questionnaire asks about detailed data, sums of credit, which a lot of agricultural entrepreneurs did not wish to answer. Due to this, the number of sample can not be regarded representative, however it is sufficient to identify major factors and processes. I divided the questions of the questionnaire into 5 topics, which are: features of economy; agricultural credits granted in the last 2 years; the future intention of farmers to apply for subsidies; utilized subsidies; supplier debts of agricultural enterprises; purchaser demands. At some questions more than one answer could be chosen. In the article summarized data are presented, I studied the data by general and statistical methods. The period under inspection is between 2006 and 2008 including the results of my analysis two years before, in which I carried out a survey covering the period of 2001 and 2006 by a questionnaire concerning the first 4 topics of this questionnaire. Results and discussion 86% of the inspected farms are run by men, while 14% are run by women. In 49% of the farms the manager is between the age of 40-60, in 31% between the age of 30-40 and in 14 % between 20-30. More than half of the farms (54%) deal with arable land plant growing, which is typical of Békés county being a grain and industrial crop growing area. The rest (46%) circled mixed farming. 31% of enterprises have a farm of between 20 and 50 hectares, the rate of those who own 20 hectares of land or even less is 29%, and farmers owning an area between 50 and 100 hectares is 26%. 43% of farmers have yearly sales returns from agricultural activity between 600000 and 3 million, 40% have between 6 and 30 million, and 6% of them have between 3 and 6 million HUF. Another 6% of farmers have yearly sales returns between 30 and 100 million, and the rest (6%) have over 100 million HUF. In 54% of enterprises 80-100% of the yearly sales returns come from agricultural activity, in 32% of them 50-80%, in 11% of them 30-50% and in 30% of them 0-30%. In the data and rates of the first topic, no considerable change has occurred compared with the survey in 2006. In the last 5 years 63% of the enterprises were granted credit, 37% of them were not, which shows a small degree of change compared with the rate of 66%-34% of the previous survey. In case of borrowing, credits dated over a year dominated. (Figure 1)</p><p id="Pg219">VII.

Enterprises chose on the basis of already known conditions, credit constructions, campaigns or the role of references, earlier experience and the distance of the bank were also key factors. Advertisements and the media were not mentioned as the reason for choice. The answers relating to borrowing credit were analysed through the comparison of 2006 and 2008 (Table 1). In case of short-term credit, both the number of applications and the extent of the required amount decreased considerably, which is also true to the mediumterm current assets credit, both on average and altogether less capital reconstruction credits were applied for in the last two years by enterprises than before 2006. In respect of guarantee belonging to credits, the number of state guarantees decreased significantly in every category. For paying off the required credit, none of the enterprises applied for another credit, which shows that they can pay off their credits properly. The future intention of enterprises to apply for credit is low, moreover it is aimed at development. All of the enterprises inspected utilized some kind of agricultural subsidy in the last five years. Beside the area-based subsidy applied for in one’s own right, I must emphasize that 62% of enterprises took part in the National and Rural Development Plan, first of all the support of Agricultural environment farming (69%), the support of meeting the requirements of Environment protection, and Animal welfare (43%) were typical, the interest in both types of support has increased in a great extent. The smallest amount of required subsidy was 300000 HUF, the highest amount was 50 million, on average agricultural subsidies in the value of 5,2 million HUF were required. I analysed how much purchaser and supplier debt the farmers own. I established that the debt towards the suppliers exceeds the purchaser demand, and the demands take a longer time to come in than the average payment date of suppliers which leads to liquidity problems usually temporarily. Purchaser pre-financing occurred at nearly half of the enterprises, typically with the value limit of 1-1,5 million HUF. 24% 32% 21% 23% short-term credit medium-term current assets credit long-term investment credit Europe Plan Agricultural Credit Programme survey in 2008 survey in 2006</p><p id="Pg220">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

The demand on short-term credits has significantly decreased, while the number of applicants requiring long-term investment credits has increased, the amount of credits required has gone up, the extent of average interest has dropped, and farmers could have access to credits with favourable conditions. All of the farmers inspected required subsidies, which were mostly the support of Agricultural environment farming and the support of meeting the requirements of Environment protection, and Animal welfare. In Békés county we can observe the agricultural sector lining up, the improvement of farmers’ liquidity and income. References Baranyai Zs., Takács I.: 2007.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1615 AFFECT OF MOULDS GROWTH IN MIXED CULTURES ON PRODUCTION OF AFLATOXINS ON MAIZE HYBRID Senadin DURAKOVIĆ 1 – Lejla DURAKOVIĆ 1 – Nada VAHČIĆ 1 – Andrea SKELIN 2 – Zijad DURAKOVIĆ 3 1 Department of Biochemical Engineering, Faculty of Food Technology and Biotechnology, University of Zagreb, Pierotti street 6., 10.000 Zagreb, Croatia, e-mail: sdurak@pbf.hr 2 Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zagreb 3 Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Zagreb Abstract: The relationship between mould biomass and the biosynthesis of aflatoxins B1 and G1 (AFB1 and AFG1) on solid substrates (whole and crushed maize grains) at temperatures from 15-40 o C and a water content in the substrate of 20-40% has been investigated. The experiments have been carried out with the aflatoxigenous mould Aspergillus parasiticus NRRL 2999 in pure culture and in the mixed culture respectively, the latter with the mould Fusarium graminearum ZMPBF 1244 and Trichothecium roseum ZMPBF 1226. Keywords: moulds, aflatoxins, maize, mixed cultures Introduction The great toxicity of mould metabolites, known collectively as mycotoxins, arose on a world-wide scale in 1960, when it was unambigously proved that the epizootic outbreaks of Turkey "X"-disease had been caused by toxic groundnut meal, where in occasionaly fragments of mould hyphae had been detected. The mould was identified as Aspergillus flavus Link ex Fries, and the name for the toxic principle was coined from the initials of the producing species – aflatoxin (Pitt 2000). Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), the most potent aflatoxin, is extremely toxic, mutagenic, carcinogenic and teratogenic to both humans and livestock and chronic exposure to low levels of AFB1 pose a serious health and economic hazard (Chu 1991, Pitt 2000). According to the findings of numerous investigators, aflatoxins were found in nearly all mould-contaminated substrates (Samarajeva et al. 1990, Chu 1991, Gourama and Bullerman 1995 , Marton et al. 2007). Considering the fact, that on natural substrates mixed mould cultures grow rather than pure ones, the problem of aflatoxin biosynthesis during the growth of mixed mould cultures, as well as the possibility of their detoxification, becomes as especially significant one (Hudec 2006, Cosic et al. 2007, Svečnjak et al. 2007.). Duraković and Beritić (1994) studied the influence of mould growth in mixed cultures on biosynthesis of AFB1. Therefore, we were interested to find out if, at which time, and to what extent, under chosen conditions of growth, a degradation of AFB1 and AFG1 takes place, when the mould Aspergillus parasiticus NRRL 2999 grows on maize in pure culture and in mixed culture respectively, together with moulds most frequently encountered as contaminants on maize, but not synthesizing aflatoxins themselves (Tarnawa and Klupács 2006, Polišenská and Tvarůžek 2007). Materials and methods The two moulds which most frequently occur on maize as natural contaminants were identified as Trichothecium roseum and Fusarium graminearum, and taken up into the Collection of Microorganisms of the Faculty of Food Technology and Biotechnology,</p><p id="Pg222">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1616 Zagreb, (ZMPBF) under serial Nos. 1226 and 1244. The mould A. parasiticus NRRL 2999, described as one of the most potent aflatoxin producers, was used as a test microorganism. The biosynthesis of aflatoxins B1 and G1 was performed with the mould A. parasiticus in pure culture, as well as with the two moulds A. parasiticus, T. roseum and F. graminearum ZMPBF 1244 in mixed culture. The cultures were maintained on slants of Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) stored at 4 oC. Before each experiment, the organisms were transfered to another PDA slant and incubated at 28 oC for 7 days. Whole and crushed maize grains (ZG SK 502 A hybrid) were used as the medium for growth of investigated moulds and aflatoxin biosynthesis. The cultivation was performed in stationary culture with 50 g of substrate in 300 mL – Erlenmeyer flasks. Parameters of cultivation were the following: Initial water content in the substrate: 20%, 30% and 40%; Initial number of conidia: 1 107 per gram of substrate; Temperatures of cultivation: 15 oC, 20 oC, 30 oC and 40 oC and cultivation time: 42 days. The growth of the fungi was monitored by measuring the analysis of chitin as glucosamine, as a criterion (Donald and Mirocha 1977). Aflatoxins from all samples were extracted by shaking with 150 mL of chloroform in a laboratory shaker. HPLC analysis of aflatoxins was performed by using a HPLC unit Varian (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA) as described by AOAC (AOAC International 2005). The percentage change of both toxins were determined according to the formula: % inhibition = 100 -           culture purein gaflatoxin of g culture mixed ingaflatoxin of g 1- -1 100 Results and discussion Figures 1 and 2 represent the relation of biomass to the synthesized AFB1 and AFG1 during the growth of investigated moulds in pure and mixed cultures at incubation temperature of 15 o, 20 o, 30 o and 40 oC, respectively. Out of the three chosen initial water contents in the substrate, the last one (40%) gave highest increment of biomass and best aflatoxin production. At all cultivation parameters crushed maize grains proved as better substrate for both the growth and the synthesis of aflatoxins. Pitt (2000) stated 15.5% as the minimal water content for the growth of A. flavus. Duraković and Beritić (1994) demonstrated that a water content of 32-35% was optimal for the biosynthesis of aflatoxins on solid substrates. Comparing the amounts synthesized at various cultivation temperatures it appears that not only the amount of the two toxins, but also their ratio depend on the temperature, e.g. at 20 oC a greater amount of AFB1 is synthesized (ratio B1:G1 = 1:1.5). At 30 oC the amount of AFB1 exceeds by far of AFG1 (ratio B1:G1 = 3.5:1), whereas at 40 oC this becomes even more pronounced (B1:G1 = 5:1). Figure 2 comparatively shows the decrease of concentration of the two toxins after six weeks of growth of the moulds in pure and in mixed culture at all chosen parameters of cultivation in mixed culture. The results reveal that, depending on parameters of growth, the biomass of mixed culture decreases the concentration of aflatoxin B1 by 20-60%, and that of G1 by 35-70%. The values were calculated on the basis of the highest amounts of aflatoxin synthesized. Hence it appears that at the same cultivation temperature a significant decrease of concentration of both investigated toxins occurs in the substrate with a higher initial water content.</p><p id="Pg223">VII.

Considering that the mean summer temperature in the continental parts of Croatia ranges from 20-24 oC, it is unlikely that during the growth of cereals in the field a substantial growth of the aflatoxin-producing fungus and the toxin biosynthesis itself would take place. However, during storage of cereals without sufficient ventilation of the stored commodities, significant defferences in temperature and water content due to the process of respiration can arise (Tarnawa and Klupács 2006). An uneven distribution of water in the goods can locally lead to a rank growth of mould, although</p><p id="Pg224">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1618 the mean water content is considered to be within allowed limits (Tarnawa and Klupács 2006). The respiration of the growing mould increases the humidity of adjacent grains, thus stimulating further growth, regardless of the mean water content in the whole heap of grains.

Soil moisture was measured on research basis of SUA (Slovak University of Agriculture) in locality Kolíňany (48° 22' 0" latitude, 18° 12' 0" longitude and 200 m above sea-level). The soil type of experimental area is classified as a sandy-loam Haplic Luvisols with humus content of 2 – 2.99 %. There was used VIRRIB instrument for measuring of soil moisture which works on TDT (Time Domain Transmissometry) method. Two kinds of models have been used; the first one was the Global and the second one was DSSAT 4 model. Keywords: soil water content, TDT method, GLOBAL, DSSAT 4 Introduction The accumulated soil water content directly determines vegetative layer in the soil profile of aeration zone (Štekauerová, Nagy 2006, 2007). In natural conditions water content in the zone varies in a large range: from absolutely dry soil in summer period to soil saturated by water (Antal, 1996). Measuring of the time series of the soil water content in the soil profile requires long-time measure modes and demanding instrument equipment. Nowadays to diagnose the essential parameters of the water regime in aerated zone of soil is successful due to application of mathematical modeling. The successful mathematical modeling is impossible without direct monitoring that is important for the model verification (Nagy 2003). After reaching of satisfactory longtime measurements in a particular place the model verification for particular conditions may be done. Consequently the model is prepared for simulation of chosen parameters of the natural environment e.g.: soil water content, part of water balance, movement of substances in the soil profile and plants productive parameters. Material and methods The experimental basis with monitoring of soil moisture that belongs to Slovak Agricultural University is located in Kolinany (48° 22' 0" north, 18° 12' 0" east and altitude of 200 m above sea level). The soil type is classified as brown soil. Results of grain distribution show that the sandy loam soil is in a humus horizon (Akp) (fractions content &lt; 0,01 mm in interval 20 – 30 %) and that the loamy soil is in a deeper Bt horizon (0,4 m) (Chlpík, Pospíšil 2004). Table 1 shows basic hydrophysical parameters of the soil profile: hydraulic conductivity Ks, parameters of analytic description of retention curve by van Genuchten (1980) α, n - in this case the hysteresis of retention curve was taken into account, reduced bulk density ρd, residual moisture θr, soil water capacity θFC and saturation soil moisture or full water capacity.

Phenological data connected to plant cover are represented by Leaf Area Index (LAI), roughness of plants, albedo and by the depth of the root zone. There have used two simulation models in this study: Global model (Majerčák, Novák 1995) – and DSSAT 4 model (Tsuji et al. 1994).The simulation results were compared with the results of the field measurements made in already mentioned locality Kolinany during the vegetative season 2002-2004. After that, the correlation analysis and the comparison of the time series of simulated and measured soil moisture were made. We have found the differences (percentage match) between measured and simulated values up to ±15%. Soil moisture was measured by electromagnetic sensor VIRRIB, working on TDT principle (Time domain transmissometry). Results and discussion The climate data for the analysis of particular years have been provided by Šiška, Repa (2004) and Šiška, Čimo (2006). On base of results analysis we may state that both models Global and DSSAT 4 have a satisfactory match with the measured values according to comparison of the selected time series of the measured soil moistures with the simulated ones. The 80 % match of results up to ±15% accuracy limit was chosen as a satisfactory condition match (Žalud, 1999). The Figure 1 shows measured and simulated values of the volumetric soil moisture in Kolinany for the years 2002 - 2003. The trends of soil moisture course varied from the field water capacity (FC) to the point of point of decreased availability for the plants (PDA) during the vegetative season of the given period what correspondents with the rainfall totals. Comparison of measured and simulated values in 2002 showed that Global model had a difference up to ± 15% of 40 identical measurements from the total number of 48 measurements, what represented 83.3 % with the correlation coefficient 0.66. DSSAT 4 model had 37 identical measurements from total number of 48 measurements what represented 77.1 % with correlation coefficient 0.72 (Tab. 2). The year 2003 was drier in comparison with the previous year that was reflected in the simulated trends of the soil moisture course. The Figure 1 shows the trends of simulated and measured soil moistures which were below the point of decreased availability for plants PDA during the vegetative season.

Conclusion Time periods of measured and simulated values of the soil moisture were analyzed during the years 2002-2004. After that, the correlation analysis and the analysis of the percentage match of measured and simulated values were made with the difference up to ±15%. It can be concluded that both models Global and DSSAT 4 have a satisfactory match with the measured values according to comparison of selected time series of measured soil moisture trends with the simulated ones. In the percentage expression the identical measurements were between 75 % - 85.7 % for Global Model and between 77.1 % - 83.3 % for DSSAT 4 model.

Impact assessment was carried out on base of simulation results obtained by agroecological model Daisy. The meteorological data have been generated according to general circulation model CCCM for emission scenarios SRES A2 and SRES B2. Five field crops were used for modelling study. According to statistical analyses of simulation results the increasing of variability and the decreasing of soil water content is expected in vegetation period of researched region. Keywords: climate change, soil water content, agroecological modelling, model DAISY Introduction Climate change determined by the increased CO2 concentration in the atmosphere and affecting by the global temperature increasing seems to be a serious environmental problem. Till the climate conditions change may represent a decisive influence on the agricultural production their consequences may be either positive or negative. There is also expected increase of weather variability, rising of extreme events frequency occurrence, as well as the changes in precipitation totals and their distribution during the year. In Slovakia the possible climate change consequences on agriculture have been evaluated in the various works e.g. the U.S. Country Study Program or more precisely in National Climate Program of the Slovak Republic (SR). As a part of the climate change consequences evaluation on agricultural production in the SR there arose the questions connected to impact of climate change on soil water regime. The supplemental irrigation will be an essential condition of the soil water regime optimization to satisfy the agricultural production demands. Materials and methods Evaluation of the climate change impacts on soil water content was based on simulations by agroecological model Daisy. Model Daisy is a one-dimensional model for water, energy, nitrogen and soil organic matter balance modelling. Among hydrological processes considered in model belong: snow accumulation and melting, interception, through-fall, evaporation of water in the crop canopy, infiltration, surface run-off, water uptake by plants and water flow in the soil matrix as well as in macropores. Crop development and yield production are possible to simulate in dependence on crop rotation and various management strategies. Model Daisy allows the building of complex management scenarios (Hansen et al., 1990, Abrahamsen and Hansen, 2000). Crop parameters were calibrated according to experimental data of field experiments carried out by Research Institute of Irrigation situated in locality Most near Bratislava during the years from 1981 to 1987. For model verification were used results from the experimental plots in Lehnice farm as well as data from the stationary experiment of Research Institute of Irrigation Bratislava from the years 1990 – 1994 (Takáč and Košč,</p><p id="Pg230">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1624 1995). Simulation by the model DAISY had been performed for the reference period of the years 1966 – 1985 and for emission scenarios of climate change SRES A2 and SRES B2 according to atmosphere global circulation model outputs CCCM 2000 (Lapin et al., 2001, Melo, 2004). There has been assumed the gradual increase of CO2 concentration into the atmosphere. The time series of daily values of global radiation, air temperatures and atmospheric precipitations have been prepared for the numerical simulations from the climate station Hurbanovo that represents the climate conditions of Danubian Lowland region. The simulation has been performed for 5 field crops – spring barley, winter wheat, maize, sugar beet and lucerne. Soil conditions of the locality are characterized by loamy soil. Soil horizons of the soil profile have been defined by the texture, soil water retention curve parameters, hydraulic conductivity, humus content and by C:N ratio. Results and discussion Long-term measurements and numerical experiments results confirm the existence of a long-term cyclic character of soil moisture regime in Daubian lowland (Takáč, Košč, 1995). Maximal water content in the soils is occurring in the end of winter or at the beginning of spring in dependence on winter rainfalls character and on melting term of the snow cover. Minimal water storage in soil occurred during summer months. The basic statistic characteristics of the annual course of the water content in soil profile 0 – 100 cm for the period 1966 – 1985 in Danubian Lowland are shown in figure 1. According to median value, it is the soil water content below 50 % value of the available water capacity (AWC) from the end of June almost till the end of September. According to the third quartile value the soil water storage is below 50 % of the AWC from the beginning of July until the end of second September decade. According to performed simulations, using the climate change scenarios, there is expected decrease of soil water content during vegetation period. In studied locality has been found the highest decrease of the average soil water content during the vegetation period according to scenario SRES B2 in the period 2031 – 2050. A moderate decrease has been shown, with exception SRES B2 scenario in the period 2031 – 2050, only in the period from the beginning of June to the beginning of July. From the beginning of November till the beginning of April is expected to increase soil water storage according to simulation results in Danubian Lowland. The basic statistic characteristics of the annual water content course in the soil profile 0 – 100 cm according to climate change scenarios in Danubian Lowland are presented in figure 2. In the locality according to results of the statistic soil water content analyses, there will increase for one thing the year-on-year variability, for another the water content variability in the soil during year. It confirms the increase of standard deviation and variation coefficient. It has been also found the maximal increase during summer and autumn months. On the other hand, in the vegetation period, particularly during summer months, it intensifies a water deficiency in soil, what confirms the decrease the value of lower but also high quartile, median and average during vegetation period, mainly in the period from May to September markedly. According to simulation results, using climate change scenarios for Danubian Lowland, there will increase the number of days with soil moisture below 50 % of AWC. The longest continuous period with the soil water content below 50 % of the AWC has been</p><p id="Pg231">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1625 reached according to scenario SRES B2 and it lasts from the end of May until the half of December. The soil water content below the 50 % of AWC has been most frequently simulated for months July and August. There is more than 20 such days at an average according to all scenarios. The most of them occurred according to scenario SRES B2 during the period 2031 – 2050 and that represent up to 29 days in July and 27 days in August. 01.01. 01.02. 01.03. 01.04. 01.05. 01.06. 01.07. 01.08. 01.09. 01.10. 01.11. 01.12. 01.01. 200 240 280 320 360 400 440 S o il w a te r c o n te n t [m m ] max, min quartile median Danubian Lowland 1966 - 1985 Figure 1.

Following the results of simulations we have found higher occurrence of the days with soil water content below 50 % of the AWC during the period 1986 – 2005 in comparison with</p><p id="Pg232">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1626 period of the years 1966 – 1985 (about 4 days). The continuous period duration has been extended up to 12 days. The precipitation and their distribution during the vegetation period will not probably be sufficient for the crop water demands coverage. For above mentioned climate change conditions the water will be the limiting factor of an agricultural production in Danubian Lowland. These assumptions also generally confirmed the other author’s research results (Farkas et al., 2005; Stehlová, 2007; Stekauerová, Nagy, 2006 and Takáč, Šiška, 2007). Conclusions On the base of the soil moisture simulations by the agro-ecologic model DAISY, according to emission scenarios SRES A2 and SRES B2 it is possible to state that in climate change conditions can be expected the water content decrease in soil and the period’s duration prolongation with the soil moisture less than 50 % of the AWC in vegetation period. This trend also has been confirmed by simulation results for the period of the years 1986 – 2005.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1627 WEED CONTROL IN MAIZE WITH NEW HERBICIDE TOPRAMEZONE Matija GORŠIĆ – Klara BARIĆ – Natalija GALZINA – Maja ŠĆEPANOVIĆ – Zvonimir OSTOJIĆ University of Zagreb Faculty of Agriculture, Department of Weed Research Svetošimunska 25, 10 000 Zagreb, Croatia e-mail: mgorsic@agr.hr Abstract: Topramezone is a newly introduced herbicide for use in maize. Field experiments were carried out on several locations during a three year period. Untreated check (weedy check), two rates of topramezone (low a.i. 50.4 and high 67.5 g · ha -1 ) and standard treatment (nicosulfuron + bentazone + dicamba a.i. 40+640+180 g · ha -1 ) were applied at maize growth stage 4 – 6 leaves. Major weeds present were Amaranthus retroflexus, Ambrosia artemisiifolia, Chenopodium album, Chenopodium polyspermum, Echinochloa crusgalli and Setaria glauca. All herbicide treatments controlled broadleaved weeds more than 95 %. A low dose of topramezone reduced Echinochloa crus-galli from 38 to 100%, whereas a high dosage resulted in 100% control. Both doses of topramezone controlled Setaria glauca at the same level, 68.9 – 100%. Keywords: maize, weed control, herbicide, topramezone Introduction Maize is a major crop, which is grown on around 400 000 ha and accounts for the major part of the herbicides used in Croatia. Weed control is a decisive management practice in sustainable maize production (Vad et al., 2007). Öerke (2005) estimated that potential yield losses due to weeds are 37-44%. Atrazine is the mostly used herbicide in maize in Croatia. It is a persistent herbicide, however, and there is the problem of its having an impact on the sensitive crops in rotation. Also there is the problem that atrazine leaches into surface- and groundwater (Sraka et al., 2007). In Directive 91/414 EEC the European Union restricted the use of atrazine products in most member countries. Croatia forbade atrazine products after July 1, 2007. Topramezone is a newly introduced herbicide that could be used as a replacement for atrazine for use in maize. It belongs to the chemical class of the pyrazolones. In sensitive plant species topramezone inhibits the enzyme 4-hydroxy-phenyl-pyruvatdioxygenase (4-HPPD) which in susceptible weeds disrupts carotenoid synthesis, causing leaf bleaching, necrosis and plant death (Schonhammer et al., 2006). In Croatia no topramezone products have been registered. When applied post-emergence, topramezone can control several broadleaf and grass weeds in maize. Topramezone water solubility and persistence are in the medium range, which results in weed control also through soil uptake (Schonhammer et al., 2006). The aim of field trials was to compare the efficacy of two rates of topramezone with local standard treatment applied post-emergence at two locations. Materials and methods Field trials were conducted in the Šašinovečki Lug research station of the Faculty of Agriculture Zagreb, in 2003 and 2004 and Oborovo (near Zagreb) during 2004 and 2005 year. In Šašinovečki Lug the type of soil is stagnic podzoluvisol and in Oborovo gleysol. The trials were arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replications. The plot size was 14 m2 (2.8 x 5m). Treatments consisted of untreated</p><p id="Pg234">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1628 control, two rates of topramezone (low rate at a.i. 50.4 and high rate at 67.2 g · ha-1) and a nicosulfuron+bentazone+dicamba treatment (40+640+180 g a.i · ha-1). All herbicide treatments were applied with the adjuvant Dash (1.0 l · ha-1). Weed flora in experimental plots occurred naturally (Table 1). In all years maize was sown in the first decade of May, within the optimum planting date window. Herbicides were applied when maize plants were in the 14-16 BBCH growth stage (Meier, 2001), in the first decade of June, with a Solo knapsack sprayer with Lurmark AN-1.0 nozzles (three). Total spray volume was 200 L/ha at 2 bar pressure through flatfan spray nozzles. Weed control was evaluated using the EWRS 1-9 scale (Johannes and Schuh, 1971). Weeds were separated by species and counted in the area of one square meter in July when most weeds were in the maximum growth stage (flowering). Weed control was expressed as a percentage of weed reduction in weed number compared to the number of weeds on the untreated control using Abbott’s formula. Analysis of variance was used to study the influence of herbicide treatments and was performed for weed density and EWRS scale parameters. Data obtained were subjected to ANOVA, and the LSD test at 5 % probability was calculated to detect the difference between treatment means. Results and discussion The weed population differed among the years and locations (Table 1). Major broadleaf weeds presented in all experiments were Amaranthus retroflexus (AMARE), Ambrosia artemisiifolia (AMBEL), Chenopodium album (CHEAL) and Chenopodium polyspermum (CHEPO). Major grass weeds were Echinochloa crus-galli (ECHCG) and Setaria glauca (SETGL) (Table 1). Those species are a great problem in Croatia and are also on the list of the 20 most common Hungarian weeds (Nagy and Foldesi, 2007). Table 1.

No significant difference was found on the untreated check plot among trials. Among treatments, the largest number of weeds was present at Oborovo in 2004. This was because many grass weeds were so abundant that they were not reduced when herbicides were applied. When other trials were compared, there were no major differences among herbicide treatments within a given trial.</p><p id="Pg235">VII.

This was because in Oborovo 2004 Echinochloa crus-galli plants were in the 4-6 leaves growth stage and reduction was consequently not satisfactory. However, the high rate of topramezone reduced even plants that were in a more adult growth stage and could not be controlled by a low dose (Figure 1).

Trial plots on several locations were highly infested with Setaria glauca. The number of Setaria glauca plants on untreated check plots ranged from 73 – 127 per square meter depending on location (Table 1). Topramezone applied in both doses reduced Setaria glauca from 68.9 to 100 %. The average reduction achieved with the high dose (90.6%) was slightly better than with the low (86.3%). The treatment nicosulfuron+bentazone+dicamba controlled the same species with an average of 90.6%, but the range was from 38.8 to 100%. The lowest efficacy of combination nicosulfuron+bentazone+dicamba was observed in Oborovo 2004 because Setaria glauca plants were in an advanced growth stage, so only the younger plants were controlled. Conclusions Compared to the untreated check, all herbicide treatments significantly reduced weed number. Herbicide topramezone applied at low and high doses controlled all broadleaved weeds presented in field trials acceptably. All grasses were controlled when herbicide was applied on time (the younger growth stage of weeds). A high dose of topramezone reduced Echinochloa crus-galli plants satisfactorily throughout the season. Neither dose of topramezone was any different in the reduction of weeds from the local standard treatment nicosulfuron+bentazone+dicamba Acknowledgements This paper was funded by the project Integrated Weed Control in Sustainable Arable Crop Production, number 178-1780496-0366 of the Croatian Ministry of Science, Education and Sports and supported by BASF Croatia.

Averaged over the plants and treatments, the effectivity of FYM was 85% as compared to equivalent NPK fertilization. On the zero plots there was a relative high N-uptake (33-60kg.ha -1 atmogenic-N) by w.wheat and maize, respectively. Great differences were caused in yield level by the favorable and less favorable crop sequences at wheat (63%) and at maize (37%). There were great differences in N-utilization depending on type and level of fertilization and the kind of the field crop. The least N-utilization belonged to wheat with the highest FYM dose (18%), the greatest was found at the least mineral-N dose of maize (70,5%). Keywords: crop yield, effect of previous crop, N-balance, N-utilization. Introduction Winter wheat and maize are the most dominant crops of the Hungarian agriculture, they take together about 50% of the arable land up and very often follow each other on the field. Consequently the success of their cropping has a great influence on the whole agriculture. Wheat is not directly farmyard manured, it is more favorable to give farmyard manure (FYM) to its previous crop. In contrast to wheat, maize can better utilize fresh applied FYM. N fertilization is the most effective and also one of the most expensive factor of their cropping. Knowledge on short-term and long-term availability of N after application of organic fertilizers is important to optimize fertilizer use with benefits for the production and the environment. The N-balance over several years is also an important indicator for the assessment of N use and the risk for environmental pollution (Gutser et al., 2005). Many factors influence the utilization of applied N by winter wheat or maize: soil properties, quantity and form of the nutrients, crop management, the history of previous cropping, weather conditions etc. (Nagy 2006; Balogh-Pepó 2006, Pepó 2007; Kádár 2007). Long-term fertilizer experiments are the only reliable means for evaluation fertilizer efficiency and sustainability. Materials and methods The long-term organic-mineral fertilizer experiment, the basis of the present investigations, was set up on a Eutric Cambisol at Keszthely/Hungary (46°40’ N; 17°15’ E) in 1963 with two crop rotations and different doses of (FYM) or equivalent NPK fertilizer and combined treatments of NPK fertilizer and FYM or straw manuring, in four replications. For the present study treatments of simple, double and triple doses of 35 t ha-1 FYM and equivalent NPK treatments of FYM doses have been selected from the two crop rotations “A” and “B” (Table 1). The crop rotations consisted of: „A”: potato (till 2002 sugar beet) - maize- maize - w. wheat- w. wheat; „B”: potato - w. wheat w. wheat - maize - maize.

Results and discussion Grain yields as a function of mineral or organic fertilization Influences of organic (FYM) or NPK fertilizer equivalent to FYM doses, were evaluated for winter wheat and maize grain yields in four-four growing seasons of the last decade, irrespective of the weather conditions. Average crop yields are demonstrated in Figure 1. Highest yields were associated with mineral fertilization at both crops. Long-term FYM treatments were always accompanied with lower yields.

That calls attention to the application of such N fertilizer rates, besides which atmogenic N-sources can be utilized sufficiently. - The great differences in yield level caused by the favorable and less favorable crop sequences and influenced by fertilizer level as well, indicate that in N-fertilizer recommendations, all kind of previous crops, -not only leguminae-, have to be considered to avoid under-, or excessive nutrition.

Atrazine banning requires new solutions for weed control. This paper compares the efficacy of registered herbicides in maize which can replace atrazine in pre-emergence. Combinations of terbuthylazine, mesotrione, isoxaflutole and flumioxazin with acetochlor are compared with atrazine+acetochlor through control percentages of total, broadleaved and grass weed numbers. Results are obtained from herbicide trials conducted over several years and locations. Treatment efficacy was dependent on precipitation. With terbuthylazine+acetochlor, mesotrione+acetochlor and flumioxazin+acetochlor similar weed control was obtained as with atrazine+acetochlor. Isoxaflutole+acetochlor provided better weed control results than atrazine+acetochlor. The tested herbicides can be considered possible substitutes for atrazine and, like atrazine, all need the assistance of herbicides efficient on grass weeds. Keywords: atrazine, water contamination, replacement of atrazine, maize Introduction According to European Commission Directive 91/414/EEC, and the complementary Commission Decision 2004/248/EC, plant protection products containing atrazine have been withdrawn in EU. The banning of atrazine means that new solutions are required for weed control in maize. Atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-1,3,5-triazine) has been a widespread and one of the most frequent herbicide found in surface and ground water worldwide. In Croatia atrazine is mostly used in maize. The main grown area is between Sava and Drava rivers. Because of its persistence and leaching ability we consider atrazine a potential pollutant of surface and ground water in Croatia (Ostojić et al., 2004). Maximum allowable concentration (MAC) for a single herbicide is 0.1 µg l-1, while for total pesticides it is 0.5 µg l-1 (Official Gazette, 2004). Sraka et al. (2007) found triazine herbicides residue (atrazine and simazine) to be the most frequent herbicides in soil samples taken from Drava valley. They found atrazine in concentrations exceeding MAC in 42% of samples, while terbuthylazine, another triazine herbicide, was not found. Gojmerac et al. (2006) found atrazine in concentrations that exceeded the MAC during May and June in surface water samples soon after atrazine application. But at several locations, atrazine residues were found in autumn (October), which indicate its persistence. Depending on soil type, the activity of microorganisms and the rate of chemical degradation, atrazine degradation can be various. In addition, herbicides can decrease the number of total viable bacteria and microscopic fungi (Sándor, 2006). Mesotrione, isoxaflutole and flumioxazin are currently available for replacement of atrazine in pre-emergence. The application rates for these herbicides are lower than those for atrazine (100-225 g a.i. ha-1 for mesotrione and 75-105 g a.i. ha-1 for isoxaflutole) (BCPC, 2000).</p><p id="Pg242">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1637 The most common broadleaved weeds on untreated plots were Ambrosia artemisiifolia, Chenopodium album and Polygonum persicaria while the occasional presence of Abutilon theophrasti was observed. These weeds are highly competitive and can cause a significant reduction in corn yield (Dávid and Kovács, 2007). Among annual grasses the most frequent were Echinochloa crus-galli and Setaria glauca. The weed control values obtained are shown in table 4. At the Orovac and Gorice locations, there was no significant difference between treatments. Mesotrione+acetochlor efficacy was in accordance with the efficacy of combination atrazine+acetochlor. The total and grass weed control obtained was quite low, on the edge of an acceptable level, which might be the consequence of the small quantity and late occurrence of precipitation. Mesotrione+acetochlor obtained satisfactory efficacy on broadleaved weeds (87.2%). Combination gave good control of CHEAL (Orovac-90.6%, Gorice-100%). Control of AMBEL (58.8%) was lower and insufficient (data not shown). Armel et al. (2003) showed that the addition of acetochlor improved mesotrione efficacy on AMBEL and CHEAL and especially on Setaria faberi. Efficacy was better in case of rainfall seven days after treatment. In years with normal precipitation distribution, all treatments achieved good control. Bollman et al. (2006) state that mesotrione achieved good efficacy on the triazine resistant and susceptible CHEAL and on ABUTH, while for the control of AMBEL it needed the help of atrazine. Table 4.

Between treatments there was no significant difference, indicating</p><p id="Pg244">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1638 terbuthylazine as a possible atrazine substitute. Novak and Ostojić (1993) also found that terbuthylazine can be considered an alternative for atrazine. They showed that terbuthylazine alone gave weed control similar to that with atrazine combinations. More variable results were obtained at the locations Prečec and Štakorovec, both dominated by ECHCG. Flumioxazin+acetochlor gave weed control similar to atrazine+acetochlor on total and broadleaved weed numbers. A significant difference was obtained only in grass weed number reduction. Flumioxazin+acetochlor gave lower but acceptable weed control (90.0%) compared to atrazine+acetochlor on grass weeds. In 2004, seven days after pre-em treatment there was not enough rainfall to activate the herbicides applied at the locations Rugvica and Šašinovečki Lug. Because of lack of precipitation, weed emergence was slower (a low weed number especially in Šašinovečki Lug). The combination isoxaflutole+acetochlor achieved significantly better total and broadleaved control than the combination with atrazine. Atrazine+acetochlor provided low efficacy on broadleaved weeds, and acceptable control of grasses, which might be a consequence of the lower acetochlor rate in combination with low rainfall in the critical period (15 days after treatment). Conclusions Treatments containing terbuthylazine and atrazine in combination with acetochlor obtained similar levels of weed control. There was no difference in efficiency between mesotrion+acetochlor and atrazine+acetochlor. Flumioxazin+acetochlor also showed no difference regarding total and broadleaved weed control. Isoxaflutole+acetochlor provided better weed control than atrazine with acetochlor. Treatment efficacy is dependent on precipitation. According to the results obtained we can consider all the herbicides tested possible substitutes for atrazine. Like atrazine, all these herbicides need the assistance of herbicides efficient on grass weeds. References Anonymous 1992.

Merr.] response. Experiments were set under natural weed flora with significantly higher weed infestation at the Oborovo location (190 weeds m -1 ) when compared to Šašinovečki Lug (SL) 1 (26 weeds m -1 ) and SL 2 (52 weeds m -1 ). All treatments reduced weed biomass and increased soybean yield plant -1 when compared to the untreated control. Satisfactory broadleaved biomass reduction (88.5-99.0%) was achieved by all herbicide treatments except at the Oborovo location where imazamox 40 g a.i. ha -1 achieved 64.1% reduction due to poor biomass reduction for Chenopodium album which was reflected in lower soybean yield. Addition of bentazone or tifensulfurone to imazamox or split applicaton of imazamox improved weed control by an average of 35 % and soybean yield by 38.7 %. On other locations there was no statistical difference among herbicide treatment in broadleaved biomass reduction and soybean yield. Keywords: imazamox,, soybean, weed, herbicides Introduction Soybean is the leading oil and protein crop of the world with production of 206 408 000 tonnes (FAO, 2006). Furthermore the ability of soybean to fix atmospheric nitrogen by Rhizobium spp. gives it a very important role in sustainable agriculture (Andrić et al., 2007). Weed infestation causes considerable yield reductions so that timely and effective weed management is needed to preserve the yield (Singh and Jolly, 2004). While in Europe the soybean is conventionally produced, USA, Argentina, Canada and other overseas produce genetically modified soybean resistant to the herbicide glyphosate. This approach has greatly changed weed control methods. Nowadays even in conventionally produced soybeans, weed control is often based on post-emergence treatments due to ecological and financial benefits as well as the large number of available herbicides. This has led to the concept of a critical period of weed control during which weeds must be controlled to prevent soybean yield losses. Several investigations have determined the critical period in the soybean. Rajender and Rajender (1999) suggested that the critical time of weed control is 30 to 45 days after sowing whereas Zimdahl (1980) reported a period of 2 to 4 weeks after soybean emergence. Eyherabide and Cendoya (2002) estimated that the critical period is from the second to the eight node of soybean stage (V2-V8). Broadleaved weeds control in post-emergence, is more complex than grass weed control owing to a few efficient graminicide highly selective to the soybean. In Croatia there are four registered active ingredients to control broadleaved weeds in post em treatment. Imazamox is a residual early post emergence herbicide that controls a broad spectrum of broadleaf weeds, and several grass species. Single mid-post applications at the V3 soybean stage are commonly used to avoid the need for multiple applications (Hilgenfeld et al. 2004).</p><p id="Pg246">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1640 The objectives of the experiments were (1) to compare weed biomass reduction with the post emergence herbicide imazamox applied alone and in split treatment as in combination with bentazone and tifensulfuorne and (2) to evaluate soybean yield, yield component and plant height with respect to different herbicide treatments. Materials and methods Three field experiments were conducted during two growing seasons near Zagreb (Sasinovecki Lug (SL) and Oborovo (OB). Experiments were conducted under natural weed infestation. The soybean, the Sivka cultivar, was sown in the first decade of May each year in 12.5 cm rows. Experiment design was a randomized complete block with four replications. Plot size was 15 m2 (3.0 x 5.0). Treatments consisted of an untreated control and four post-emergence herbicide treatments. Herbicides were applied at a water volume equivalent to 200 l ha-1 through flat-fan nozzles using a Solo knapsack sprayer. Herbicide treatments: imazamox 40 g a.i./ha; imazamox 20+20 g a.i./ha; imazamox 40 + bentazone 900 g a.i./ha and imazamox 40 + tifensulfuron 6 g a.i./ha were applied after weed and soybean emergence at second to fourth soybean trifoliate (V2-V4). The weeds in trial plots were cut at ground level within 1 m-2 separated by species and the wet mass was weighed in mid-July when the weeds were in the maximum growth stage. Weed control was expressed as percentage of reduction in fresh weed biomass compared to the untreated control according to Abbott’s formula. At soybean maturity all plots were evaluated for grain yield and yield components. Twenty five soybean plants were randomly chosen to analyze plant height, pod number and seed yield. Standard analysis of variance and LSD (P=0.05) were used to study the influence of herbicide treatments on weed reduction and soybean response. Results and discussion The averaged number of weed species and weed density at the experimental locations are shown in Table 1. At the untreated check at the OB location there was significant difference in weed density (190 plants m-2) and fresh broadleaved weed biomass (3270 g m-2) compared to other two locations owing to high infestation with CHEAL (150 plants m-2). Due to poor weed management practices in previous years CHEAL had become the predominant weed in the field most likely because of abundant seed production of CHEAL as reported by Sartorato et al. (1996). In contrast, fresh grass weed biomass was significantly higher and fresh broadleaved weed biomass lower at the location SL 2007 (650 g m-1) than at the other two locations. All herbicide treatments reduced weed biomass when compared to the untreated check, as expected (Table 2). Good broadleaved biomass reduction was achieved in all herbicide treatments and ranged from 88.5 to 99.0%. A significant year x treatment interaction was mainly because of OB location where imazamox achieved low broadleaved biomass reduction (64.1%) due to low CHEAL biomass reduction (64%). Sartorato et al. (1996) also reported the lack of highly effective active ingredients for this weed species. In the study of Taylor et al. (2002) CHEAL control was 73 to 86 % when imazamox was not preceded by a pre herbicide pendimethalin or flumioxazin. In our study the addition of bentazone or tifensulfurone to imazamox, or the application of imazamox in split treatment significantly increased CHEAL biomass reduction (98.399.7). On the locations at SL there was no significant difference among herbicide</p><p id="Pg247">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1641 treatments regarding broadleaved weed biomass reduction. Statistical analysis showed no treatment x location interaction for grass biomass reduction. Average weed control efficacy on grass species ranged from 34.8 % to 75.7 % depending on treatment. The lowest efficacy (34.8%) was found with imazamox applied in split treatments and the highest (75.7%) with imazamox applied alone. From Table 1 it is evident that grass weed occurrence in the untreated checks was small. Relatively low grass weed efficacy could be explained by the high density of broadleaved weeds, which probably prevented herbicide deposit on grass weeds. Taylor et al.

Cereal Research Communications 1642 Soybean yields differed among locations. In the untreated controls where weed competition occurred, soybean yield plant-1 was greatly reduced (Table 2). All herbicide treatments allowed a significantly higher average soybean yield than imazamox treatment alone. Average values of imazamox+tifensulfuron combination produced soybean yield that was by 20.2 % higher than that with imazamox treatment. This is in accordance with low weed biomass reduction achieved with imazamox at the OB location. At the OB location soybean height was significantly increased by 30 % when bentazone was added to imazamox. On SL locations herbicide treatments had no significant effects on soybean height in both years (Table 2). In contrast, Panneerselvam and Lourduraj (2000), reported reduced soybean plant height because of the severe competition from weeds during all the stages of crop growth, while David and Kovacs (2007) reported reduced plant height in other row crops (maize) in weedy control plots. Conclusions All herbicide treatments achieved good efficacy on broadleaved weeds except at the Oborovo location where imazamox applied at 40 g a.i.ha-1 showed 64.1% efficacy only due to low CHEAL biomass reduction. Adding bentazone at 900 g a.i. ha-1 or tifensulfurone at 6 g a.i. ha-1 to imazamox significantly reduced CHEAL biomass and increased soybean yield. All herbicide treatments increased soybean yield and pods numbers when compared to the untreated check and a higher yield was obtained with herbicide combination imazamox+tifensulfuron. Good broadleaved weed control proved to be obtainable when herbicide combinations in post-emergence treatment were applied. References Andrić, L., Teklic T., Vratarić M., Sudarić A., Duvnjak V. 2007.

INBREDS TO HERBICIDE NICOSULPHURON Klara BARIĆ* - Boris VARGA - Zvonimir OSTOJIĆ - Zlatko SVEČNJAK University of Zagreb Faculty of Agriculture, Svetošimunska 25, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia, *e-mail: kbaric@agr.hr Abstract: Field experiments were conducted over two years to characterize maize inbred responses to herbicide nicosulphuron. In the first year of research (1999), 30 maize inbreds were tested (preliminary screening). Based on the first year results, eight inbreds were selected and evaluated in the second year of research (2000). Herbicide nicosulphuron was applied at the permitted (48 g a.i. ha -1 ) and double (96 g a.i. ha 1 ) rate when maize plants were at the growth stages with 1-3, 3-5 and 5-7 visible leaves. The effect of herbicide was estimated visually at 14, 30 and 60 days after herbicide application using the ERWS scale. Maize inbreds significantly differed for their tolerance to nicosulphuron. All inbreds were more sensitive to nicosulphuron in the dry growing season of 2000 compared to the normal growing conditions of 1999. However, tested inbreds varied greatly in response to nicosulphuron depending on growing conditions. The application of double rate tended to increase inbred sensitivity to herbicide applied. Tested inbreds were more sensitive to nicosulphuron when its application was done at the more advanced maize growth stages. Keywords: maize, inbred line, nicosulphuron, tolerance Introduction When compared to hybrids, maize inbreds are more sensitive to external stress factors mainly because of their smaller growth (Bonis et al. 2003). Consequently, maize inbred plants have been shown to be less competitive with weeds. Moreover, it was observed from the very beginning that maize inbreds are more sensitive to herbicide application than hybrids. Maize inbred sensitivity was found even with some highly selective herbicide in maize crop such as atrazine (Grogan et al., 1963). Genotypic differences in their sensitivity to 2,4-D herbicide were firstly reported as early as 1947 (Kidnie, 1998). Sulfonylurea herbicides are relatively new herbicides that are widely used in maize crop. These herbicides are important for effective weed management in maize, particularly after atrazine application has been restricted (according to Annex I of the EU Directive 91/414/EEC). However, previous work indicated that maize inbreds and hybrids may differ in their sensitivity to various sulfonylurea herbicides (Green and Ulrich, 1994; Barić et al. 2001; Bonis et al. 2003). Consequently, none of the sulfonylurea herbicides has been registered for an application in maize inbred crops. Therefore, hybrid and inbred tolerance is to be investigated before commercial release of any new herbicide. Tolerance to some specific herbicide does not imply similar tolerance to the other ones (Mekki and Leroux, 1994). Materials and methods Field experiments were carried out in 1999 and 2000 growing seasons at the Bc Institute in Rugvica (near Zagreb). Thirty inbred lines were tested in the first year of research (1999) for preliminary screening. Based on the first year results, eight inbred lines, namely Bc24, Bc502, Bc14, Bc190L, A661, Bc706-9, Bc741-16 and Bc741-5 were again evaluated in the second year of research. Herbicide nicosulphuron was applied at the maximum permitted (48 g a.i. ha-1) and double (96 g a.i. ha-1) rate. Herbicide was</p><p id="Pg250">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1644 applied when maize plants where in the growth stage with 1-3, 3-5 and 5-7 leaves according to BBCH scale (Meier, 2001). Application was done using «Solo» sprayer with three flat fan nozzles (TCSI 02-110). Sensitivity evaluation was done using the EWRS scale of 1 to 9 where 1 = no injury and 9 = complete death (Johanes and Schuh, 1971) at 14, 30 and 60 days after treatment (DAT). These visual estimates were transformed into percent injury damage (Johanes and Schuh, 1971) before statistical analysis. Individual plots were 2.8 m wide (four 0.7 m maize rows) and 4.0 m long. The experimental design was a split-split plot with four replications. Analysis of variance was computed with inbreds, herbicide rate and time of application considered fixed. Mean differences were assessed using the LSD values if the F-test was significant at P = 0.05. Temperatures during the growing season were optimal in the both years of research. Precipitation for May-August period along with the 30-yr average and data for the optimal temperatures in the US Corn Belt (Wallace and Bresman, according to Gotlin, 1967) are shown in Table 1.

Moreover, significant interactions among these factors were also found except for herbicide rate × application date interaction (Table 2). All genotypes were more sensitive to nicosulphuron in 2000 (Figure 1), which was extremely dry growing season for maize production. Bonis et al. (2006) also reported about the effect of unfavorable growing conditions on the metabolism of maize inbreds, which in turn, decreased their tolerance to the sulphonylurea herbicides applied. However, water stress conditions in the growing season of 2000 showed different effect on tested inbreds. Genotypes A661 and Bc741-5 were highly sensitive to herbicide nicosulphuron in the growing season of 2000. In contrast to A661, inbred line Bc741-5 was tolerance to herbicide nicosulphuron in the previous growing season of 1999. Inbred line Bc190L shown to be genetically sensitive to herbicide nicosulphuron most likely because of one recessive gene as reported by Green and Ulrich (1994). Plants of this inbred were completely damaged regardless of growing conditions, herbicide rate and time of its application. Bonis et al.

Trojstva 3, HR-31000 Osijek, Croatia Abstract: Nine maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids were grown under field conditions on two soils (eutric cambisol and eugley) for two growing seasons (2004 and 2005). Seven domestic maize hybrids (OsSK444, OsSK554, OsSK644 and OsSK713, Bc66-61 and Bc778) and two foreign (ZPSK633 and ZPSK778 - from Serbia) were used. The field trial was conducted in five replicates (gross of basic plot 56 m 2 ). Grain yield in 2005 was 13% lower than in 2004 (8.28 and 9.53 t ha -1 , respectively). Yields on eutric cambisol were lower than on eugley (6.96 and 10.84 t ha -1 , respectively). Also, differences of yields among the hybrids were very significant. The hybrid Bc778 yielded 10.37 t ha -1 or 32% more compared to the hybrids Bc592 and ZpSK704. Leaf-N was in 2005 11% higher than in 2004 (means 2.53% N and 2.81% N, respectively), while leaf-P (mean 0.28% P) and –K (mean 1.68% K) differences between two years were non-significant. Leaf-K under eugley conditions was 25% lower than on cambisol (means 1.44% K and 1.92% K, respectively). Differences in leaf composition among the maize hybrids (influences of genotype) were in the ranges from 2.59% N to 2.76% N, from 0.25% P to 0.30% P and from 1.62% K to 1.76% K. In general, low connection was between leaf nutritional status and yields probably because relative favorable soil fertility of both soil types, although the first-ranged hybrid regarding yield (Bc778) was in the group of the hybrids with the highest leaf-N, -P and –K. Also, two lowyielding hybrids (Bc592 and ZpSK704) characterized considerably lower leaf K. Keywords: maize hybrids, soil influences, yield, leaf-N, leaf-P, leaf-K Introduction Yield and nutritional status of the field crops are under environment and heredity influences (Sarić 1981, 1983; Sarić and Kovačević 1980; Kovačević and Vujević, 1993; Kovačević et al., 2006; Barić et al., 2007; Hegyi et al., 2007; Nagy, 2007; Pepo, 2007). Aim of this study was testing yield and plant status of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in nine of commercial maize hybrids growing on two soil types. Material and methods The field experiment, sampling and chemical analysis Nine maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids were grown under field conditions on two soils (Karanac eutric cambisol and Vardarac eugley) of Baranya region (Osijek-Baranya County) for two growing seasons (2004 and 2005). Seven domestic maize hybrids (OsSK444, OsSK554, OsSK644 and OsSK713 – developed in Agricultural Institute Osijek; Bc66-61 and Bc778 – developed in Bc-Institute Zagreb) and two foreign (ZPSK633 and ZPSK778 – developed in Maize Research Institute Zemun Polje, Serbia) were used. The field trial was conducted in five replicates (gross of basic plot 56 m2). Maize was sown manually by planters (interrow spacing 70 cm and distance in row 26 cm) at end of April. Two seeds were sown in each sowing place. Thin out of young plants (one plant per each sowing place) was made in three-leaf stage (theoretical plant density or TPD = 54945 plants ha-1). Soil and crop management practices were identical</p><p id="Pg254">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1648 for both locations (fertilization kg ha-1: 170 N + 120 P2O5 + 120 K2O). Harvesting of four internal rows (total area 28 m2) was made manually at middle of October. Maize yield was calculated on TPD and 14% grain moisture basis. Soil sampling (0-30 cm of depth) was made before the start of the experiment. The earleaf of maize (25 leaves in the mean sample) was collected for chemical analysis at flowering stage (the second half of July). Soil pH and humus contents were determined according to ISO standards (ISO 1994, 1998). Nitrogen in leaf samples was determined by Kjeldahl procedure. For P and K determination, wet procedure was used: 0,5g of sample + 5ml acid mixture (100ml cc. H2SO4+5ml cc. HClO4); +10 ml H2O2. After the digestion sample was filtred and filled with deionised water up to 100 ml Phosphorus was determined spectrophotometrically by molibdat-vanadat method and K by flame photometry. The soil and weather characteristcs Two tested soil types have been similar in pH values and humus contents. The eugley was more supplied with N, EUF-extractable Ca and Mg as well., while P and K supplies were lower compared to the eutric cambisol (Table 1). Precipitation regime for 5-month period of maize growing season was specific in both years because precipitation quantity was 27% lower (2004) and 70% higher (2005) compared to long-term mean (Table 2). In general, high yields of maize are in close connection with water deficit and higher air-temperatures, especially during July and August (Josipović et al., 2005). However, in our study, distribution of moderate quantities of precipitation for the 2004 growing season was favorable and maize yields in both soils were higher (Table 3) compared to wet 2005 growing season.

The hybrid Bc778 yielded 10.37 t ha-1 or 32% more compared to the Bc592 and ZpSK704. Leaf-N was in 2005 11% higher than in 2004 (means 2.53% N and 2.81% N, respectively), while leaf-P (mean 0.28% P) and –K (mean 1.68% K) differences between two years were non-significant. Leaf-K under eugley conditions was 25% lower than on cambisol (means 1.44% K and 1.92% K, respectively). Leaf-K on eugley was mainly close to inadequate K supplies (less than 1.5% K maize leaves: Bergmann, 1992; Mengel and Kirkby, 2001). Table 3.

Three hybrids (ZpSK633, ZpSK704 and C2 OsSK554) were in the group of lowest leaf N (mean 2.61% N), while three hybrids (OsSK644, OsSK444 and Bc778) in the group of the highest leaf-N (mean 2.74% N).The lower leaf-P was in the hybrids Bc66-61, OsSK713 and ZpSK704 (mean 0.26% P), while in the OsSK444, Bc778 and Bc592 it was the higher (mean 0.29% P).The hybrids Bc778 and ZpSK633 ad the considerably higher leaf-K (mean 1.74% K) than the hybrids Bc592, OsSK444 and OsSK644 (mean 1.63% K). In general, moderate connection was between leaf nutritional status and yields probably because relative favorable soil fertility of both soil types. However, the first-ranged hybrid regarding yield (Bc778) was in the group of the hybrids with the highest leaf-N, -P and –K. Also, two low-yielding hybrids (Bc592 and ZpSK704) characterized considerably lower leaf K (Table 3). Conclusions Genotype and soil properties considerably influenced maize yield and nutritional status. Based on our study, the higher/lower concentrations of N, P and K in maize leaves could be in moderate connections with tendency to the higher/lower yields of the hybrids.

Wheat grain under conditions of Kragujevac vertisol contained considerably higher N (+26%), Ca (+13%), Fe (+32%) Cu (+64%), Zn (+2.6 fold) and Cd (+2.5 fold) compared to wheat on Novi Sad chernozem. Also, with exception of Mg, significant differences of wheat grain composition among the cultivars were found. For example, the cultivar Evropa characterized with the lowest contents of N, P, Ca, Fe and Cu. The cultivar Milica had the highest Fe and Ni contents, the lowest Mn as well. The cultivar Renesansa had the highest K, Ca, Cu and Zn, and the lowest Ni contents. The highest Mn contents in grain of the Tera and Pobeda were found. Additionaly, the Pobeda has the highest N and Mn, as well the lowest Zn contents. The Renesansa and NS rana 5 have the highest K contents in grain. Specifities of the Tera and Jarebica were the highest Mn and the lowest K, respectively. Keywords: wheat variety, grain, contents of macro– and microelements, location, interaction. Introduction The field crop properties are under influences both environmental and heredity factors (Czövek et al., 2006; Kovačević et al., 2006; Užik and Žofajová, 2006; Drezner et al., 2007; Gáspár et al., 2007; Győri, 2007; Pepó and Győri, 2007; Pepo, 2007). Micronutrient deficiencies in crop plants are becoming very important globally, being involved in severe decreases in crop production and nutritional quality of harvested products. Among the micronutrients, iron and zinc deficiencies are well-documented in crop plants, especially on calcareous soils of arid and semi-arid regions. Plant derived from seeds with low concentrations of micronutrients are highly sensitive to biotic and abiotic stresses during seed germinations and early growth stages (Cakmak, 2005). Manganese deficiency in cereals is the most important nutritional disorder in major part of Northern Europe, including Skandinavia (Husted et al., 2005). Iron deficiency is the most common nutrient deficiency affecting more than half of the world's population (about 3.5 billion). World Health Organization (WHO) attributes 800,000 deaths wordwide each year to Zn deficiency and over 20 million healthly life years lost. It is estimated that Zn deficiency affects one-third of the word's population. Taking in consideration the importance of wheat–based products in human diet and animal feeds, we wanted to improve the knowledge of the contents of biogenous elements as well as of some heavy metals, those recognized for harmful effects. For this reason, aim of this study was testing environmental and hereditary influences on nutritional status in wheat grain of seven commercial Yugoslav winter wheat varieties.</p><p id="Pg258">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1652 Materials and methods Seven domestic cultivars of winter wheat developed in Institute of Field and Vegetable Crops (Evropa, Milica, Renesansa, Tera, NS-rana 5, Pobeda and Jarebica) were grown on Novi Sad (chernozem) and Kragujevac (dedegraded vertisol) experimental fields for the 2004/05–growing season. The field trial was conducted by randomized block design in three replicates (gross of the basic plot 100 m2). Wheat was sown in the second half of October (sowing rate 600 emergeble grains per m2) in three replicates. Grain sampling was made during harvesting (beginning of July) at full maturity stage. Novi Sad loam chernozem soil characterizing favorable chemical and physical properties, while heavy texture and low available P level are main characteristics of Kragujevac vertisol (Table 1). The growing season 2004/2005 was regarding mean 9-month air-temperature in range of the long-term mean (LTM). However, at the same time precipitation in Novi Sad was for 33% higher and in Kragujevac for 13% lower compared to the LTM. The coldest month for both localities was February with the lower (comparison with the LTM) airtemperature for 1.60C and 1.20C, for Novi Sad and Kragujevac, respectively (Table 2). Table 1.

The Renesansa (B3) and NS rana 5 (B5) have the highest K contents in grain. Specifities of the Tera (B4) and Jarebica (B7) were the highest Mn and the lowest K, respectively. Knežević (1997) reported grain N contents in four wheat cultivars and their six F2 hybrids in ranges from 1.68% N (Jugoslavija) to 2.01% N (NS rana 2) and from 1.87% N (Jugoslavija x Žitnica) to 2.12% N (Žitnica x NS rana 2). Seed nutrient reserves are an important factor in the early growth of crops, especially on low fertility soils. Moussavi-Nik (1997) found that seed Mn contents can improve vegetative growth of wheat cultivars growing in Mn-deficient soil more effectively than application of Mn fertilizers in soil. Conclusions Further research concerning plant nutrition and plant breeding is required to increase nutrient concentrations in seed, especially Zn, Fe and Mn, to adequate levels, there by enchancing both crop production and human nutrition and health.

Whole rosehips and Rubus berries were collected from seriously contaminated vs. background spots and analyzed according to standard lab procedures. The species differed in all focal elements except Ba and S. Rubus berries in general were richer in most macro- and microelements, particularly of Mn, Ca, Cu, Sn, Zn, Fe and Ni. The sampling site had a significant effect on all elements except Ca, Cu and Se. Rosehips had very low Cd (&lt; 0.08), As (&lt; 0.12), Pb (&lt; 1.63) concentrations (mg kg -1 dw). Ba, Cd, Mn, Ni and Sn were found to accumulate consistently in both species’ fruits at the contaminated sites. The element composition of entire fruits was shown to be an inadequate indicator of elevated heavy metal levels in the soil in a situation where marked acidification associated with pyrite oxidization is an important process. Keywords: heavy metal, bioaccumulation, food chain, minor element, Gyöngyösoroszi, ICP-OES Introduction The exposure of the biota to contaminants in the environment is a matter of general concern, especially for the assessment of human health risk. Reliable bioindicators of heavy metal contamination have been an important focus of environmental studies, particularly in metalliferous minesite remediation and monitoring (Steinborn and Breen, 1999). In this study we suggest a simple, easily standardised method for mine waste heaps with natural, generally poor, vegetation. The method is classified as passive biomonitoring based on accumulation indicators. We also emphasize some dietary and toxicological concerns of pollutant accumulation in wild-grown, popular edible fruits. Materials and methods A major historic ore mine complex of Hungary was situated 7 km north of the village Gyöngyösoroszi, in the southern part of the Mátra Mts, N-Hungary. The area has been known country-wide for its severe environmental problems associated with the mining practices for gold, ZnS (sphalerite) and PbS (galena), of previous generations (Horváth and Gruiz, 1996; Szili-Kovács et al., 2006).</p><p id="Pg262">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1656 The spoil dumps at Száraz-völgy are made up of c. 3,000 000 m3 of slurry from mineral processing based on a froth flotation technology. Substrate conditions of the contaminated site are characterised by adverse soil structure, poor water supply, low nutrient levels, acidification due to pyrite oxidisation, and high degree of spatial heterogeneity. Plant available heavy metal levels were reported to be remarkably high for As, Cu, Zn and Pb, but also for Cd (Tóth et al., 2003). Whole rosehips (fruits of the dog rose, Rosa canina agg.) and blackberries (bramble, Rubus fruticosus agg.) were collected from seriously contaminated and several control spots in the Northern Mid-height Mt Range. Sampling was done in September 2003, 2004 and 2005 before full ripening of the fruits. Composite samples were made by filling 22 cm3 plastic containers with 5-10 individual fruits picked randomly from any one plant. From control and contaminated sites respectively, 15–18 samples were obtained. These were stored, washed, homogenized and digested following standard lab procedures (Allen et al., 1986). Elemental analysis was carried out by ICP-OES (Spectroflame instrument by SPECTRO, Kleve, Germany; and IRIS Intrepid II by Thermo Electron Corporation, Waltham, MA, USA). Concentrations were given as mg kg-1 DM which can be calculated to fresh weight considering 82% water content of fruits (Hampe, 2003). Statistical analyses were performed using the freeware package “PAST” (Hammer et al., 2001). Results and discussion MANOVA for a two-factor species x site (2 x 2) design revealed that “SPECIES” had a significant effect on all elements except Ba, “SITE” also on all except Ca, Cu and Se, while the interaction between the two factors was significant for many elements except Ba, Ca, Fe and Sn. This suggests that element uptake and translocation was more influenced by the species than by the soil properties. The two species responded differently to the soil nutrient pools, particularly for the critical pollutants (Al, As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn). K, Ca, Mg and S were classified in the “macroelement” 1,000 – 10,000 mg/kg concentration range and typically found at lower concentrations in fruits from the polluted area (Fig. 1), particularly in Rubus. It was the only element that showed slightly higher concentrations in rosehips than in blackberries (p &lt; 0.05). There was no difference for S, while Rubus was far richer in Ca and Mg (p &lt; 0.001) overall. Concentrations of Cd were again very low in Rosa (&lt; 0.08 mg/kg) but much higher in Rubus. In the latter, it was considerably accumulated at the polluted site (mean: 1.01 vs. 0.07 mg/kg). The mobility of Cd in soils is known to be high (e.g. Panwar et al., 2007) and tends to be translocated to the shoot and even to the reproductive organs. Heavy metal adapted strains of AMF like Glomus mosseae may protect their hosts against Cd toxicity at polluted sites rather than improve their nutrient uptake (Biró and Takács, 2007). Contrary to the expected pattern, Cu did not accumulate at the contaminated site in either species. Moreover, its concentration in rosehips was markedly higher at the control site (p &lt; 0.001). It agrees with the moderate mobility of Cu in the soil environment, particularly in comparison with that of Cd and Zn (Farsang et al., 2007).</p><p id="Pg263">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1657 However, Mn was found to accumulate considerably in both species at the polluted site (Rosa: 2x, Rubus: 12x). This is likely to be associated with the higher mobility of Mn in the acidifying substratum, similarly to Al. Mn content of blackberries was remarkably high irrespective of the pollution level (grand mean 173.5 mg/kg). The mean 13.7 mg/kg fresh w. at the unpolluted locations agrees with concentrations reported for wildgrown woodland raspberries in the northern regions of Poland, almost twice the lower end of the range (7–60 mg/kg) for several edible berries (Falandysz et al., 1992). Of the critical heavy metals, Pb was detected at rather low levels (0.35–1.63 mg/kg) in both species and very slightly (yet significantly) accumulating in blackberries at the polluted site. Together with Cr, Pb is thought to be less mobile and phytoavailable in soils (Csillag et al., 2006). Mean concentration of Zn was ca. twice higher in Rubus (mean: 18.87 mg/kg) than in Rosa, but some accumulation was observed only in the latter (Fig. 1). 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 Al Ba Ca Cd Cu Fe K Mg Mn Ni Pb S Se Sn Zn C o n c e n tr a ti o n r a ti o rosehip blackberry 1:1 Figure 1.

Cereal Research Communications 1658 Conclusions The element composition of wild-grown fruits and berries was found to be a poor indicator of elevated heavy metal levels in the soil except for Cd in Rubus fruticosus. Higher uptake of Mn and Al is possibly associated with acidification of the substratum owing to pyrite oxidisation, resulting in increased mobility and phytoavailability of these elements. Although Pb is known to accumulate belowground in roots and rhizomes, to a very low extent it tends to be translocated to the aboveground parts and even to generative ones like the fruits.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1659 EFFECTS OF FOLIAR FERTILIZATION AND WATER STRESS ON YIELD AND PHYSIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF POTATO Tea HORVAT 1 – Adrijana MAJIĆ 3 – Zlatko SVEČNJAK 2 – Vesna JURKIĆ 1 1 Department of Plant Nutrition, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zagreb, Svetošimunska 25, HR-10000 Zagreb, Croatia, e-mail: thorvat@agr.hr 2 Department of Field Crop Production, Grassland and Forages, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zagreb 3 Faculty of Agriculture, University of Mostar, Bosnia-Herzegovina Abstract: The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of four foliar fertilization treatments (Control, Epso Salt, Megagreen, Drin) and water stress on potato tuber yield, the number of tubers by size and the number of tubers with brown spots. Foliar fertilization was carried out five times during vegetation in the period from the start of tuber formation to the stage of full tuberization. The water deficit stress was induced at the stage of full tuberization. Potato tuber yield was greatly reduced under water stress conditions, and so was the number of large tuber size grade 50-75 mm. Foliar fertilization resulted in higher resistance to water deficit. Significantly the highest potato tuber yield and the 50-75 mm tuber size grade was achieved by Epso Salt treatment, the lowest yield by Drin treatment. Keywords: potato, foliar fertilization, water stress, tuber yield Introduction The yield of arable crops may be influenced by many factors such as water, temperature and nutrient deficiency (Bertic et al., 2007). High potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) yields can only be obtained through the application of optimal nutrient doses in balanced proportions (Poljak et al., 2007). Study of plant adaptation to a water deficit is ever more topical, as the water deficit leads to a fall in the uptake of nutrients, a restriction on chlorophyll content and photosynthesis, dry matter formation, the amount and quality of the yield (Hnilička et al., 2007, Poljak et al., 2005). The potato is well known as one of the most sensitive crops to water stress. Water stress during mid and late bulking reduces yield while increases the percentage of undersized tubers and causes tubers brown spots. Fertilizer utilization is influenced by the moisture content of the soil, because water is required for nutrient utilization (Huzsvay and Nagy, 2005). Nutrients such as Ca, Mg, B, Mn are mainly transported through the xylem and not easily translocated to leaves, especially in soil water deficit (Arif et al., 2006). The alternative approach is the application of these nutrients to plant leaves and stems through foliar fertilization (Horvat et al., 2006). Foliar fertilization allows direct intervention into the nutrient supply of plants. Nutrient supply through leaf fertilization acts rapidly as through the leaf surface the ions can join metabolism directly (Takacs et al., 2007). Foliar fertilization is not a new practise. However, there is limited research information and use of foliar nutrients on potatoes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of foliar fertilization and water stress on total yield, number of tubers size grade and physiological disorder of potato tubers. Materials and methods During the vegetation year 2006/2007 tests were conducted in the conservatory of the Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zagreb, in partly controlled conditions. Sprouted</p><p id="Pg266">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1660 tubers cv. Courage (28-35 mm) were planted in pots (25 L) filled with a mixture of soil and perlite at a ratio of 3:1. The basic fertilization, calculated by pot, was carried out with 750 kg ha-1 NPK 7:20:30 and 250 kg ha-1 KAN before planting. Tests involving four foliar fertilization treatments (Control (water), Epso Salt (Mg-sulfate, B, Mn), Drin (alpha amino acid), Megagreen (Ca and Mg)) with three replications were arranged in a randomized split-plot design. Foliar fertilization was carried out 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 days after planting as instructed by manufacturers. Drip irrigation was used. Water deficit stress was induced by interrupting irrigation 90 days after planting at the stage of full tuberization. Measures were taken during vegetation to protect the plants from weed, insects and diseases. After 20-day exposure of the plants to water stress, fresh tuber yield, the number of tubers by size and the number of tubers with brown spots were calculated. Data were subjected to the analysis of variance. For comparing average values, LSD test was used when F test was significant at the level of P ≤ 0.05. Results and discussion Foliar fertilization, water stress and their interactions significantly influenced the fresh potato tuber yield, the number of large tubers size grade 50-75 mm and the number of tubers with brown spots (Table 1). Potato tuber yield significantly varied in dependence on growth conditions and in 2006 yield was higher by 28%. Tuber yield (413 g per plant) among plants cultivated in stress conditions is significantly lower than tuber yield (501 g per plant) in optimum water supply conditions. The negative impact of water stress on potato tuber yield was determined by Pereira and Shock, 2006. Table 1.

By contrast, plants subjected to Control treatment as well as those treated with Megagreen and Drin in water stress conditions have a significantly lower yield (Table 2). On the other hand, in stress conditions Epso treatment demonstrated a higher yield (392 g per plant). The positive impact of foliar fertilization by Epso on soya and sugar beet yield was accomplished by Vratarić et al. (2006) and Takacs-Hajos et al. (2007). Significantly the lowest yield in stress conditions occurred with Drin treatment. The analysis of variance has provided a statistically justified interaction between treatments and water stress for the number of tubers with brown spots (Table 1). A</p><p id="Pg267">VII.

In water stress conditions a significantly lower number of tubers of that size grade was obtained (Table 2). The likely reason is that in water deficit conditions the stoma closure decreased the intensity of photosynthesis, prevented the translocation of assimilates into the tuber and increased photorespiration. The reduced number of large size grade tubers in water stress conditions was reported by Walworth, 2002. The greatest average number of 50-75 mm size grade tubers was achieved with Epso treatment (3.2), the lowest number of tubers with Drin treatment (1.7) (data are not shown). No significant differences were found between foliar treatments in optimum water supply conditions. In stress conditions a significantly higher number of 50-75 mm size grade tubers was obtained with Epso and Megagreen treatments, and a significantly lower number of tubers with Drin treatment.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1663 EFFECT OF TOPPING HEIGHT, RIPENESS AT HARVEST AND CULTIVAR ON CERTAIN PROPERTIES OF LEAVES FROM THE UPPER STALK POSITION OF FLUE-CURED TOBACCO IN CROATIA Miroslav ČAVLEK – Kristina GRŠIĆ Tobacco Institute, Svetošimunska 25, 10 000 Zagreb, Croatia, e-mail: mcavlek@agr.hr Abstract: Tobacco ripening, a continuous process that includes the absorption of nitrogen from the soil, the reduction of nitrates into nitrogen compounds in the plant, photosynthesis and the accumulation of starch in the leaf, was studied during 2004-2005. For this purpose, investigations were organized in the main tobacco growing regions in Croatia, according to the split-split plot method. The treatments in the field trials were topping height (20 and 17 leaves for harvest), ripeness (underripe, ripe, overripe) and cultivar (HVT 1, VJ 1 and DH 17). The results of the study of flue-cured tobacco leaves from the upper half of the stalk (12-20 leaves) showed trends of greater yield, higher selling price per kg and increased overall value per ha of the harvested underripe tobacco leaves, according to the customary visual ripeness criteria for crops in the tobacco growing region. Better results were recorded in 2005, which was a wetter year. Interactions between the cultivar height and ripeness at the moment of harvest, for 12–14 leaves, in 2004 and 2005 for tobacco yield and in 2004 for the value per hectare, indicate better ripening of low-topped tobacco. The differences produced by treatments in the nicotine content, reducing sugars and total nitrogen were not consistent. The content of reducing sugars in the meteorologically more favorable 2005 was significantly higher and accompanied by significant reduction in the overripe phase. Interactions found between the degree of ripeness at the moment of harvest and the cultivar in the nicotine and total nitrogen contents lead to the conclusion that the cultivar DH 17 is somewhat late ripening in comparison to the cultivars HVT 1 and VJ 1. Keywords: ripeness, topping height, cultivar, flue-cured tobacco Introduction Metabolic priorities during growth are the receiving and reducing of nitrate and they depend upon the initial fertility of the soil, nitrogen nutrition and soil moisture content (Monneveux et al. 2006, Nagy 2007, Németh et al. 2006, Weybrew et al. 1983). Photosynthesis is an energy source necessary for nitrate reduction ( Klepper et al. 1971, Weybrew et al. 1983). Data from the literature on the harvest results of tobacco in states of underripeness to overripeness are not consistent. The greatest yields are achieved with harvest in the phase of physiological ripeness (Moseley et al. 1963, Weybrew et al. 1984). Postponement of the moment of harvest leads to weight loss (Moseley et al. 1963, Suggs 1986) and very often to a higher price per kilogram, so that the overall financial effects are equal to or slightly less within a very wide harvest period (Suggs 1986). Ripening of the tobacco leaves generally lowers the content of reducing sugars and total nitrogen while increasing the nicotine content (Moseley et al. 1963, Suggs 1986, Weybrew et al. 1984) but the expression depends upon the genetic potential and characteristics of the cultivar (Moseley et al. 1963). However, Weybrew et al. (1984) state that the quality of the leaf is more significantly influenced by the stalk position than by ripeness (Weybrew et al. 1984). The goals of the investigation were to determine (1) the topping height, ripeness and cultivars and (2) the interaction of the included factors with some of the economic and quality properties of the cured leaves in the upper half of the stalk of flue-cured tobacco.</p><p id="Pg270">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1664 Materials and methods Investigations were performed according to the split-split plot method during 2004– 2005. The treatments in the trial were as follows (1) topping height (20 leaves and 17 leaves for harvest), (2) ripeness at the time of harvest (underripe, ripe and overripe) and cultivar (HVT 1, VJ 17 and DH 17). In all the treatments, the tobacco was picked in 6 primings (2 leaves in the first priming, 3 leaves in the second, third, fourth and fifth primings, and 6 and 3 leaves in the sixth priming, depending on the topping heights of 20 and 17 leaves for harvest). The ripeness of the leaves for harvest was evaluated according to the generally accepted criteria, visual indicators for harvest. All the samples in the trial were cured in the same barn according to the curing method for ripe tobacco leaves. After curing, according to Croatian regulations for the collection of tobacco, they were divided into 6 classes. By weighing the tobacco leaves at harvest, the yield is calculated and it is possible to calculate the price per kilogram and the value per hectare. Samples of the cured leaves from the 5th priming (12, 13 and 14 leaves) and 6th priming (15-20 leaves) were used for the analysis of the economic indices and analyzed for nicotine content, total nitrogen and reducing sugars. Results and discussion During the vegetation period (May – September) in the year 2004, there was 65,7 mm lower rainfall than in the year 2005. The draught of 2004 is evident in the lower average yield, price per kilogram and value per hectare.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1665 Regarding the degree of ripeness at the moment of harvest, a general trend of better economic results was established for harvesting during the stage of underripeness or the same as for the harvesting of ripe leaves. Such results are in agreement with those of other authors (Moseley et al. 1963, Suggs 1986, Weybrew et al. 1983). However, in both years of the study, in 5th primings interactions were found between the topping height and the ripeness for yield and in 2004 also the value per hectare (Table 3). In the year 2004, with topping at 20 leaves, the lowest yield was realized with the harvesting of ripe leaves, and with topping at 17 leaves with the harvesting of overripe leaves (Crafts-Brandner 1991). The same trend was also shown by the value per hectare. The next year, with plant topping at 20 leaves, the lowest yield was achieved for the harvesting of overripe leaves and for topping at 17 leaves without any difference regarding the degree of ripeness at harvest. In both years, the poorest economic results were achieved with the cultivar VJ 1. Although some statistically justified differences were found in the chemical composition of the cured leaves, the general trends regarding the treatments in the trial, were not recorded and actually were covered by interactions between the content of nicotine and total nitrogen (Tables 2 and 3). In the year 2005, in both primings the greatest average reducing sugar content and a lower content of total nitrogen were found in underripe leaves. The content of reducing sugars in the year 2004 confirmed the results of Weybrew et al.(1983) that the climatic conditions have a more significant impact than the physiological status and in 2005, that the content of reducing sugars decreases after physiological ripeness (Weybrew et al. 1983).

In this manner, the maximum economic effects are assured for the producer, without significantly diminishing the value in use of the raw material. The results also indicate that cultivars HVT 1 and VJ 1 ripen somewhat earlier than cultivar DH 17.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1667 COMPARISON OF PETIOLE SAP NITRATE CONCENTRATION AND CCM CHLOROPHYLL READINGS IN ESTIMATING FLUE-CURED TOBACCO LEAF RIPENESS AT HARVEST Kristina GRŠIĆ – Miroslav ČAVLEK Tobacco Institute, Svetošimunska 25, 10 000 Zagreb, Croatia, e-mail: kgrsic@agr.hr Abstract: A field trial was conducted for the purpose of comparing two diagnostic tests, the petiole sap nitrate test and the chlorophyll meter, and their applications in determining the ripeness of tobacco leaves for harvest. The treatments were topping height (20 and 17 leaves for harvest), the manner of harvest (7, 4 and 3 primings) and the degree of ripeness at the time of harvest (4000 mgL -1 , 3000 mgL -1 and 2000 mgL -1 ). The nitrate content was measured in the midrib sap in the laboratory using an ion selective electrode (ISE) and Cardy meter, and in the field using a Cardy meter. The chlorophyll content index (CCI) was measured with a CCM- 200 chlorophyll meter. The nitrate concentration of the midrib measured with an ISE in the laboratory showed significant correlation with the nitrate concentration measured by the Cardy meter in the laboratory, r=0.95, and there was a somewhat less significant correlation with the Cardy meter reading in the field and the chlorophyll meter reading, 0.66 and 0.56 respectively. In the evaluation of commercial properties by rapid tests in the field, greater reliability in the assessment of the yield was obtained with the Cardy meter, and in the assessment of the price per kg and value per hectare with the CCM-200 chlorophyll meter. Keywords: nitrate petiole test, Cardy meter, Chlorophyll meter, ripeness, flue-cured tobacco Introduction Metabolic priorities during the growth and development of plants are nitrate uptake and reduction (Suggs et al., 1986, Weybrew et al. 1984). Research data and experience clearly indicate the relationship of the nitrogen status and nitrate concentration in the developmental phase of the plants to the yield. This fact is used today in many cultures as a control for basic fertilization with nitrogen and eventual additional fertilization (Izsaki et al. 2006, MacKown et al. 2000, Nemeth 2006, Lyons et al. 1996, Sexton et al. 2002, Szeles 2007, Varga et al. 2007). It has also been determined that the nitrate concentration rapidly declines in the leaf during the advanced ripening phase (Khorasani et al. 1997, Lyons et al. 1996). Conventional methods for determining the nitrate status in dried plant tissue require considerable time. Therefore, alternative methods are used for the rapid determination of the nitrate status in a leaf, such as ion selective electrodes, the Cardy meter and the chlorophyll meter (Izsaki et al. 2006, Janaki et al. 2004, Lyons et al. 1996, Sexton et al. 2002, Szeles 2007, Wu et al. 2007). By determining the petiole sap nitrate concentration, the reserves of inorganic N are determined (Westcott 1993), while a chlorophyll meter reading is used to determine the nitrogen status based upon its correlation with the chlorophyll content (Martin 1995). Tobacco, which is highly sensitive to nitrogen fertilization (Tso 2006), is an excellent test culture for many agricultural investigations. The beginning of the ripening of tobacco leaves nearly completely depletes the N reserves in the soil during the phase at flowering, reducing the nitrate concentration in the leaves, followed by starch accumulation in the leaves. Therefore, the nitrate concentration in a leaf can serve as a good indicator of its degree of ripeness. Lyons (1996) investigated the nitrate concentration in the lower 10 cm of the midrib when employing various fertilizer treatments. He determined that for a suitable yield and quality of the cured leaf, the nitrate concentration in the midrib at the time of harvest should be less than 2500 mgL-1.</p><p id="Pg274">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1668 The goals of the investigation were (1) a comparison of the nitrate concentration value in the leaf midrib obtained using an ion selective electrode with the values obtained using Cardy meter and chlorophyll meter readings and (2) assessment of the efficiency of the evaluation of tobacco ripeness according to nitrate concentration in the leaf midrib obtained using the Cardy meter in the field and CCM readings. Materials and methods The trials were conducted in Slatina, Croatia, during 2006 and 2007. The treatments in the trials were the topping height (20 and 17 leaves for harvest), manner of harvest (7, 4 and 3 primings) and the degree of ripeness at the time of harvest (4000 mgL-1, 3000 mgL-1 and 2000 mgL-1). The degree of ripeness during both years of the trials was evaluated through analysis of the nitrate concentration in the lower 10 cm of the midrib of the tobacco leaf, with the standard technique – ion selective electrodes (ISE) using the PHM250 Ion Analyzer (MeterLab, Radiometer Copenhagen, Denmark). The nitrate concentration was monitored once a week during vegetation in the 2nd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th and 15th leaves on five plants in three replications, starting the first week after the removal of the flower and the leaves from the apex. In 2007, prior to the taking of samples from the lower 10 cm of the leaf midrib, the chlorophyll content index (CCI) was measured using a CCM-200 chlorophyll meter (Opti Sciences, Tyngsboro, Massachusetts, USA), 5 cm from the base along every side of the leaf midrib. Samples of the lower 10 cm of the midrib were then wrapped in aluminum foil, placed in paper bags and transported in a portable refrigerator to a laboratory on the same day. In the laboratory, the petiole sap was extracted using a garlic press and the nitrate concentration was measured using an ion-selective electrode and Cardy meter (Horiba Ltd., Kyoto, Japan). The same year, the nitrate concentration was additionally measured in the field with the Cardy meter, also at the lower 10 cm of the leaf midrib. All the data were analyzed using SAS 8.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Results and discussion Through analysis of the values obtained for the nitrate concentrations in the lower 10 cm of the tobacco leaf midrib measured under laboratory conditions with a standard ionselective electrode (ISE) and simultaneously on the same samples with a portable nitrate ion Cardy meter, a significant correlation was determined, r=0.95 (Fig. 1). Such a result indicates the high degree of the reliability of nitrate measurement with the Cardy meter under laboratory conditions. A weaker correlation, r=0.66, was obtained by comparing the nitrate concentration values measured with the Cardy meter in the field and the ISE in the laboratory (Fig. 2). This result suggests the possibility of the lower reliability of the rapid analysis of nitrate concentration using the Cardy meter in the field. The differences determined in the correlation may also be due to inadequate evaluation of the uniformity of the properties of the sampled leaves analyzed in the field and selected for parallel laboratory analysis. A significant linear correlation was obtained between the chlorophyll reading measured by the CCM-200 chlorophyll meter in the field and the nitrate concentration in the leaf midrib measured with an ISE in the laboratory, r=0.56 (Fig. 3).

Conclusions This investigation has determined that there is complete correlation between the measured nitrate in the petiole sap of a tobacco plant using the ion selective electrode method and the Cardy meter under laboratory conditions. The reliability of the rapid tests used in the field shows strong correlations obtained between the nitrate concentrations of the lower 10 cm of the leaf midrib, r=0.66, or chlorophyll meter (CCM) reading, r=0.56. Furthermore, this investigation attempted to demonstrate the high reliability of yield assessment based upon the analysis of nitrate concentration in the lower 10 cm of the leaf midrib using the Cardy meter, and the prices per kg and values per hectare with the chlorophyll meter reading (CCM-200). The commercial effects are considerably influenced by nitrogen fertilization and environmental factors. Therefore, in order to assess the limit values at the moment of harvest based upon the rapid tests investigated, many years of research will be required.

Abstract: Coenological relevés were prepared by authors on different pastures (grazed by horse, cattle or sheep) of the Great Hungarian Plain in 1997 and 2005. Two groups of coenological relevés were prepared in 1997 and 2005 on sandy, alkali areas near Hódmezővásárhely town. Based on data gained during the two periods, vegetation changes caused by animal husbandry can be compared. During coenological studies, monitoring of spatial changes has also played an important role, this is why data were gained from two groups of releves. Besides observing the effects of grazing on vegetation, we have also concentrated on how to strain of effects of trampling. Intensity of grazing has changed on the areas observed in 1997, as slightly and intensively grazed or overgrazed areas were separated. Keywords: grazing, trampling, alkali grassland, coenologocal examination Introduction Agricultural production is going on at the significant part of the total area of Hungary. Thus it is understandable that nature conservation activity is dependent on the cooperation with agriculture. The conservation and if it is necessary, the restoration of the protected areas are amongst the important elements of the management methods of these areas. From the extensive grasslands in Hungary, more than 200 thousand hectares are under nature protection. In the conservation of these areas grazing animal husbandry could own a determinative role. However the nature conservation activity is prominently important, it is not suitable also for the economically suitable management of protected grasslands (Antal-Huzsvai 2007). Management takes place on the Hungarian natural grasslands as well. This usually means extensive activities such as mowing or grazing. The total cover of grasslands exceeds 1148000 hectares, that is 11% of the total area of Hungary, 213468 hectares of this being under nature protection (Ángyán 2000). This is why harmonizing aims and tasks of agriculture and nature conservation is highly important on these areas (Szentes et al. 2007). Among nature protected areas in Hungary, grasslands own the second place. In many cases, grazing takes place in these natural grasslands. As a consequence of Hungary’s natural backgrounds, economic state and EU accession tasks, agricultural use and the aims of nature conservation should be harmonised in these areas, too (Kiss et al. 2006). Overgrazed parts had alredy been transformed into anthropogenic, degraded ruderal areas with little botanical; the grassland became even poorer in species. The composition of dominant species in grasslands further away from the summer lodging has not changed significantly (Penksza et al. 2005). Based on the investigations it can be stated that arcas grazed to a lesser extent are in good condition from a botanical point of view thought the stands of several protected species have thinned or disappeared (Barczi et al. 2004, Görcs et al. 2007). The rainfall quantity int he summer half-year had a decisive effect ont he grass yield (Nagy 2006). The Carpathian Mountains have impacts on the lower mountains of the Carpathian Basin. These impacts are reflected by the vegetation, climate and soils (Centeri et al. 2007). Water resources in the Carpathian Basin are limited. According to</p><p id="Pg278">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1672 the predictions the resources will not be increasing - more probably will be decreasing - in the future. On the other hand they have to fulfill the society demands in the future. Further problem is that the limited water resources differ in space and time (Várallyay 2006, Nagy et al. 2007). Knowledge about climatic change and its impact to the soil water storage and ecosystems is very important not only for local but for wide scale too (Stehlová 2007). The vegetation of the alkali grasslands close to the sampling sites of our publication was studied by Bodrogközy. Detailed coenological tables were published about the associations and subassociations of the alkali areas of Székkutas, Orosháza, Nagylak. Materials and methods Two groups of coenological relevés were prepared in 1997 and 2005 on sandy, alkali areas near Hódmezővásárhely town. Used previous coenological data as basis for comparison were published by Penksza et al. (1999). Coenological relevés prepared in 1997 belong to the group of data gained farther from the farm. For 2005, the area has been divided and fenced. One half of it (group B among relevés) is grazed by few animals and mowed as well. These areas can be considered as similar to the other farms of the Great Hungarian Plain. Intensive grazing takes place on the other fenced area and a fold was built here as well (group A). Coenological investigations were prepared between April and July both in 1997 and 2005. Botanical examinations followed the method of Braun-Blanquet (1964), using 2×2 m quadrates. As evaluation, group unit share was counted based on covering rates. Among relative ecological value categories according to Borhidi (1995), areas were evaluated based on nitrogen demand (NB) values. Evaluation of social behaviour types were made according to Borhidi (1995) and ratio of nature conservation value categories according to Simon (2000). Species names follow the nomenclature of Simon (2000). Data gained from the area closer to the farm are signed as group A and those from the farther one as group B. These two groups were not differentiated during the observations in 1997, this is why data gained that time were used as standards during the evaluation of data gained in 2005. Results and discussion Overgrazed areas (group A) contain more species than those lying farther from the farm. Comparing with previous observations it can be stated that the area has not become poorer, however, new species appeared on the area, being mainly weeds or natural disturbance tolerant species (Convolvulus arvensis, Ononis spinosa). A significant difference could be detected considering dominant species. On the areas near the farm, Lolium perenne has become dominant. Evaluation based on relative ecological value categories: Relative nitrogen demand: The plant species referring to oligotrophic and mesotrophic environment (value 3 and 5) cover the highest rate in the observed areas. Plants of nutrient poor (value 2), sub-mesotrophic (value 4) and nutrient rich (value 7) sites exceed about 10%. Species indicating nutrient poor circumstances cover a greater rate than nitrogen indicating species of manured areas. Number of species with value 1 had been especially high (17%) in the previous studies, but their number has decreased</p><p id="Pg279">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1673 significantly during the two investigation times. Considering nitrogen relations of the observed areas it can be stated that low and medium nitrogen level indicating species are present in case of all the three areas. Social behaviour types of species Greatest part of species found on the observed areas belong to the group of natural disturbance tolerant ones (DT), ruderal competitors (RC) and competitors (C). Rate of ruderal competitors, indicating greater disturbance, is only 1% in 1997, however, their rate has almost exceeded 30% for 2005 (Figure 1). Rate of weeds (W) and disturbance tolerant species (DT) is higher on the areas affected by more intensive use. Moreover, species belonging to rare specialists (Trifolium subterraneum) can be found only here. Hódmezővásárhely (SBT) 0,0% 5,0% 10,0% 15,0% 20,0% 25,0% 30,0% 35,0% 40,0% 45,0% DT RC W C NP G S Sr AC 1997 (kontroll) A B Figure 1. Social behaviour type values Aggressive invasive (AC) species have appeared in this area for 2005. Considering social behaviour types per area it can be stated that natural disturbance tolerant ones (DT), ruderal competitors (RC) and competitors (C) are present with the highest rate. Comparing categories indicating natural and disturbed state one can discover that plant species of secondary and anthropogenic habitats and of natural habitats are characteristic in a rate of about 50-50% on the areas. Nature protection value categories Analysing the nature protection value categories one can state that, similarly to the social behaviour types, natural disturbance tolerant (TZ) and weed (W) species occur with the highest rate. Natural disturbance tolerant (TZ) species exceed the highest rate (70%) in the areas farther from the stables. While rate of weeds (W) has not exceeded 10% in 1997, it passes 40% around the fold by 2005 (Ambrosia artemisiifolia, Carduus achantoides, Conyza canadensis). Rate of accompanying species (K) which refer to natural conditions and rate of pioneers (TP) have decreased between the two investigation periods. In the farther areas, where a bigger rate of natural composers should be expected, there is no representative of association composers (E). Besides these, one species can be classified into the category of crops. Conclusions A significant change in species composition could be detected. Particularly, deterioration of areas could be experienced. These negative processes are extremely heavy inside and near the animal husbandry farm. Even aggressive, invasive plant species occurred. Among dominant grass species, dominance relations and covering rate</p><p id="Pg280">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1674 of disturbance tolerant Cynodon dactylon and Lolium perenne species have increased, caused partly by overgrazing and trampling as well. Farther from the farm, rate of degradation showed by vegetation has decreased compared to the areas closer to the farm, however, it has increased even on the farther area between the two time periods. During the preparation of management plans for the grasslands, these data should be considered at a higher rate in favour of preserving natural values, especially because the biggest population of nature protected Trifolium subterraneum lives in this area.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1675 STUDIES ON THE TOLERANCE OF MAIZE HYBRIDS TO CORN ROOTWORM ON VARIOUS TYPES OF SOIL Csaba SZŐKE - János PINTÉR - Zsuzsanna HEGYI - L. Csaba MARTON Agricultural Research Institute, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Hungary, Martonvásár Brunszvik út 2. email: szokecs@mail.mgki.hu Abstract: The corn rootworm, which has been introduced from North America, is becoming an increasingly serious problem for maize producers in Hungary. Control of the pest is complicated by the fact that farmers often ignore the need for crop rotation, the most effective measure, despite ministry regulations. Chemical control not only increases production costs, but is not always effective. The present paper describes studies on the tolerance level of 60 Martonvásár hybrids at four locations. Significant differences were found in the tolerance levels of the hybrids, and a close positive correlation was revealed between root-pull resistance and yield, while there was a close negative correlation between root lodging and yield and between root-pull resistance and lodging. Root regeneration is also an important factor, good values of which were found for three hybrids. Key words: Western corn rootworm, tolerance level, resistance breeding Introduction Maize production is one of the most important sectors of agriculture in Hungary. On the basis of profitability it has been one of the top-ranking field crops in recent years, and is grown on an area of around 1.1–1.2 hectares. Until recently, apart from a few pathogens, it has suffered little damage from pests, but this situation changed after the appearance of the corn rootworm in 1995, which became a major maize pest within a few years. It is estimated that around 15,000 ha were affected in 2007, with damage of economic proportions on almost 7000 ha (Ripka, 2007). The yield losses caused by the pest may range from only a few per cent to as much as 70–80% (Sivcev and Tomasev, 2002, Nagy et al., 2003). American data indicate that yield losses combined with the cost of control lead to a loss of income amounting to around a hundred thousand dollars a year (Krysan and Miller, 1986). Insect numbers and the extent of damage are greatly influenced by the weather in the given year (Keszthelyi, 2006). In addition to agronomic, chemical and biotechnological control measures, work has been underway for several decades to breed maize varieties resistant to the pest (Bigger et al., 1941, Owens et al., 1974, Abel et al., 2000, Pepó and Bódi, 2006, Ivezic et al., 2006). Among the three basic mechanisms of host-plant resistance (non-preference, antibiosis, tolerance) defined by Painter (1951), conventional plant breeding can only be based on tolerance, where differences arise mainly as the result of diverse growth habits (stronger stalks, more robust root mass, better root regeneration). According to Seitz (2006) a combination of molecular markers and the DH technology could open up new possibilities in breeding against the pest. The present paper aimed to determine the corn rootworm tolerance levels of sixty maize hybrids.</p><p id="Pg282">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1676 Materials and methods In order to determine the level of tolerance against corn rootworm, 60 Martonvásár maize hybrids were sown in experiments at four locations with three replications in 2007. The extent of natural rootworm infection in the previous year and the type of soil were taken into consideration when choosing the locations, which included two heavily infested chernozem soils (Kőszárhegy, Lászlópuszta), one sandy soil with moderate to severe infestation (Mezőfalva) and one non-infested chernozem soil (Martonvásár). The two-rowed plots were 6 m in length with row and plant spacings of 0.7 m and 0.2 m, respectively. At each location the root-pull resistance was recorded on two occasions (22 June, 15 Sept.) on 5 plants per plot for each genotype, after which the visible root damage was scored using the Iowa scale (1: no damage, 6: loss of three or more root levels) and the root diameter was measured. The latter values were used to determine the extent of root regeneration (by subtracting the June values from the September values). After counting the number of lodged plants the yield was harvested from a 2 m section of each plot. The data were evaluated using analysis of variance and regression analysis. Results and discussion Different levels of root damage were recorded for the tested hybrids at the four locations. The infestation was most severe in Kőszárhegy, followed by Mezőfalva and Lászlópuszta, with the least damage in Martonvásár. A higher level of infestation was expected based on the corn rootworm damage in the previous year. The decline in the rootworm population could have been due to the sandy texture of the soil in Mezőfalva, which is unfavourable for larval development, as it dries out easily (Széll et al., 2005). Differences in the degree of infestation were also observed between the two scoring dates for root damage. At the second scoring date there was a substantial reduction in damage compared with the first scoring date in Kőszárhegy, mainly due to root regeneration (Fig. 1), which could be attributed partly to timely rainfall and partly to genetic differences in regeneration between the hybrids (Fig. 2). It is clear from the figure that three hybrids exhibited a high level of root regeneration. -3 -2 -1 0 1 Mezőfalva Kőszárhegy Lászlópuszta Martonvásár Io w a sc al e 0 5 10 15 R o o t re g en er at io n ( cm ) Iowa scale Root regeneration 0 5 10 15 20 -1-0,5 0,490 0,10,49 0,5-1 1,11,49 1,5-2 2,12,49 2,5-3 3,13,49 3,5-4 Frequency groups F re q u e n c y Fig. 1.

Cereal Research Communications 1678 Conclusions The 60 maize hybrids tested were found to have different levels of tolerance against the corn rootworm. Tolerance is based mainly on external traits such as a stronger root system with better regeneration ability. Three of the hybrids examined had outstanding root regeneration ability. The analysis showed that root-pull resistance is closely correlated with both root lodging and yield. A close correlation was also demonstrated between root lodging and yield, as reported by other authors (Hataláné-Zsellér and Széll, 2001, Pepó, 2006). The selection method used in the experiments, based on rootpull resistance measurements combined with the counting of lodged plants and the scoring of root damage on the Iowa scale, proved to be suitable for the relatively rapid testing of the tolerance of large numbers of maize genotypes.

Abstract: Understanding better the processes of N-cycle are necessary to proceed to practical, rational, environmental friendly fertilization for supplement of N-nutrition. Soil core and pot incubation experiments are used to estimate the available nitrogen capacity of the soil and the N-gaseous losses. The substance of the two methods is to determine the different nitrogen forms and the gaseous losses after the soil incubation witch happening in a defined time period and moisture levels. Modelling of the processes of the transformations is happened with the “four-pools” model. The pools are connected by kinetics differential equations. An essential of the experiments is that the quantity of the available nitrogen sources and the gaseous losses are possible to determine in every moment. Keywords: N-gaseous losses, soil core incubation experiment, pot experiment, “four-pool” model, kinetic differential equations Introduction The movement and transformation of nitrogen compounds in the soil /plant /atmosphere system is determined by complex chemical, biological and microbiological cycles. Application of N-fertilizers, using large quantities of manure are significantly loading this kind of bio-geochemical cycle of nitrogen and improving the NOx and N2O emission (Tarr,2000.,Bálint et al.2002). NOx in the atmosphere cause acid rains and decompose stratospherical ozone. N2O is one of the greenhouse gases which contribute to global warming and climate changing. As the most important problem of our era is climate changing in this article concentrates on the model of denitrification process. (Várallyay,2007) The first known mathematical model is the “two-pool” model (KIRKHAM and BARTHOLOMEW,1954) was applied, where one of the pools contained the accessible N (NO3 -, NH4 +), and the other one contained the non-accessible N (organic-N, fixed NH4 +). The mineralization/immobilization processes were described by first-order differential equations. Nowdays, more and more sub-processes are taken into account, and mostly the “three-pool” model (MYROLD and TIEDJE, 1986) is used. But to determine the gaseous nitrogen losses by indirect technique necessary to expand the “three-pool” model to “four-pool”:</p><p id="Pg286">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1680 Materials and methods 1. Soil core incubation experiment: with a column height 10 cm for 30 days (Tarr, 2000; Bálint et al., 2002) Brown-forest soil samples from Gödöllő (Hungary) were used in the experiment and made by Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry of Szent István University. The soil is an acidic [pH(KCl) 4.66 and pH(H2O) 5.30] soil with low nitrogen content (0.98%). The soil moisture content of the columns was adjusted to 25, 50, 75% WHC before the incubation commenced and kept constant during the experiment. (15NH4)2SO4 and K15NO3 fertilizer solutions containing 10 at.% 15N were injected into the upper 3-4 cm layers as an N-source in 4.62 mg N/100 g of soil, corresponding to fertilizer doses of 120 kg N/ha. Two-third of the soil cores were treated with fertilizer labelled 15N, and the others were used as controls. The soil cores were incubated for 30 days at 27ºC. The 10 samplings were at day 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, 30 and a baseline sampling at day 0 2. Pot experiment (OTKA 1547, Debreczeni et al. 1997, 1998) Clay-elluviated brown forest soil samples from Keszthely (Hungary) were used in the experiment made by Pannon University of Agricultural Science. 40 kg dry soil (pH(KCl) 7.7 and pH(H2O) 7.1) was filled into pots (surface: 1256 cm 2) with maize test crop and without crop. Gas collecting traps (1.8 dm3/pot) were built in the soil at 20 cm depth. 15NH4Cl and K 15NO3 fertilizer solutions were irrigated into the soils as an Nsource in 6.28 g N/40 kg of soil, corresponding to fertilizer doses of 500 kg N/ha. The incubation took 8 weeks at different moisture levels (WHC1=85%, WHC2=65%) in a greenhouse. After starting the experiment, soil air gas samples were taken from the traps through silicon pipes on the 6th, 20th, 34th, 48th and 68th day.

Cereal Research Communications 1682 In this experiment we got similar results. The highest gaseous losses were measured at the biggest WHC (85%). The losses are depend on the treatment, because it was higher at the application of KNO3 fertilizer. In addition in this experiment the effect of the plant covering on the gaseous losses was examined. Plants are growing the quantity of the losses. Conclusions The soil core incubation and the pot experiment are suitable for examine the processes of the soil. The sub-processes can be described by different kind of order kinetic equations. In this paper we modelled the denitrification sub-process of the N-cycle mainly by first order kinetic equation. The presented results have confirmed that the quantity of the N-gaseous losses from the N-fertilizers depend on the soil’s moister, the treatments and plant covering. The loose N-gasses are greenhouse gasses which are contributing the global warming and climate changing. That is why important to modelling the processes of the N-cycle. Acknowledgements Cs.

Abstract: The present investigation was undertaken to examine the influence of the different nitrogen sources on the Lepidium sativum L. Two parallel experiments were set up, one with plant nutrient solution (Hoagland type) and one with soil in different water holding capacity. Bio and artificial fertilizer were applied to examine the effect on garden cress in the event of difference between treatments. According to results the bio fertilizer turned out as the best treatment at 50 % water holding capacity in case of soil. In case of artificial fertilizer a correct evaluation can not made caused by miss plant. The vitamin C and chlorophyll content determination were done, too. The highest vitamin C and chlorophyll content was found in case of biofertilizer samples. Keywords: Lepidium sativum L., biofertilizer, chlorophyll, vitamin C, garden cress Introduction The garden cress (Lepidium sativum L.) probably comes from the present area of Iran. Several writings prove that this plant was well known and very popular in the ancient times: Emperor I. Yin claimed that cress is the most delicious salad. Today it is the renaissance of garden cress again, since it is commonly used in sandwiches. Garden cress is found to contain significant amounts of iron, calcium and folic acid, in addition to vitamins A and C. This study is focused on the vitamin C changes in the function of the different treatment. The chlorophyll content was also determined by the use of thin layer chromatography. Materials and methods Treatments: N-content corresponding to a 120 kg N ha-1 different ((NH4)2SO4, KNO3) fertilizer dose. Jiwei Compound Biofertilizer was measured according to the referred dosage (seed dressing: 0.5-1kg per mu (666 m2)). Treatment was done in three replicates. I.

About 0,2-0,3 g plants (without roots) were rubbed with 0,05g SiO2 in a mortar and the chlorophyll content was dissolved with 2ml acetylene, then the solution was filtrated by filter-paper (MN 619 G 1/4 , Macherey-Nagel, Düren) immediately. In case of each samples 10 μl solution spot was applied to a silica gel thin layer chromatogrhaphy plate, about one centimeter from the base. The solvent was the mixture of hexan-6 and acetylene in 7:3 proportion. Results and discussion Result of vitamin C determination: The result neither of vitamine C nor chromatoghraphy can not be a base for a correct evaluation in case of artificial fertilizers caused by miss plant. The measured vitamin C content in biofertilizer has been compared with the vitamin C content of the conrol sample. After completing the variance analysis (ANOVA one-way test, SPSS v.15) became clear that significantly difference can be determined between the biofertilizer and the control samples in case of the plant nutrient solution as it is shown in the Table 2. The divergence of the measured data means that the plants treated by biofertilizer contain higher nutritional value. These cresses were grown faster, and their physical parameter as the length of roots, stalks and the leaf area reached higher value than the cresses of control. Table 2.

Hungary , e-mail: balint.agnes@mkk.szie.hu Abstract: A huge amount of experimental information concerning the effects of N-fertilizers and the pathways of N-transformation in ecosystems is available. The general evaluation of this, however, is hardly possible, while the ecological conditions of the experiments are different and the dynamic studies mostly deal with certain subprocess but neglecting their interactions. In this paper the quantity of amino acids proteins hydrolisable with 6 molar HCl in winter wheat grain was determined by amino acid analyser, while the quantity of free amino acids were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography (with ophthaldialdehyde reagent) and protein content was measured by acryl-amide gelelectophoresis (PAGE). It can be stated that in the content of protein amino acids the quantity of glutamic acid and proline increased most, but in all other N-fertilised treatments the quantity of amino acids raised apparently. In case of free amino acids, primarily the content of asparagine and leucine, increased compared to the control samples due to the effect of fertiliser. All changes of the measured protein, free amino acids and proteins were significantly different from the control. Keywords: fertilizer, amino acids, proteins, winter wheat Introduction It’s well known and has been certified by our earlier examinations that the 20-80% of nitrogen-based fertilizer is used directly by plants, the rest volume will be get into the soil’s cycles, or will appear as loss (Notas et al., 2007). The plants’ nitrogen-intake is highly affected by ecological and agronomical environments, like the type and race of the raised plant, dose of manure usage and time(s), water-supply, the method of groundcultivation and so on. Microbiological transformations between the different nitrogen-forms of the ground (ammonium, nitrate, organic-N) are acted as important participants of hewing the ratio of the accessible nitrogen-forms, and also determining the loss (scouring, denitrific gasloss – Notas et al., 2007). The climatic (Varallyai, 2006) and ergonomic environments (wetness, temperature) are prevailed on wide time scale depending on the passed in nitrogen-sources (Song et al, 2004) and volume of other materials (like C/N ratio). The warming up has an effect on the quality of wheat grain’s protein. If CO2 concentration is high, the protein content is lower one (www.aaccnet.org/cerealfoodsworld/samplepdfs/CFW-51-0034.pdf). It’s important to determine the N-bindings after determining the N-usage of plants. For example the N-embedding of the wheat’s core-protein was found interesting. Because of the strong N-fertilizer the poor in lysine spare-protein came to the front. Hereby, it’s easy to understand why cores are rich in proteins sometimes biologically invaluable. Materials and methods In the following this experiment is reviewed: using NH4NO3 fertilizer at different times and ratios on winter wheat as indicator plant in microplot environment. The goal of research was to study the effect of fertilizer on winter wheat grain total and free amino acid, and protein-content.

Determining the amino-acid content of the winter wheat grain using amino-acid analyzer 100 mg gently milled wheat sample was hidrolyzed with 5 cm3 6 molar hydrogen chloride on 110 Celsius degrees temperature, during 24 hours. The sample was filtered by ash-free round shaped filter-paper (MN 640d, type: 2050, Macherey-Nagel, Duren). The filtration was filled out with 2.20 pH valued citric puffer to 10 cm3. The quantity of the taken up sample was 30 μl (used temperature: t1 = 40 oC; t2 = 60 oC; t3 = 80 oC). The following buffers were used: A: pH = 3.25 citric-puffer; B: pH = 4.25 citric-puffer; C: pH = 5.25 citric-buffer. The amino acids were developed with ninhydrin reagent. Determining the amino-acid content of the grain of the winter wheat using HPLC The wheat-sample preparation for the analysis was the next: 500 mg gently milled wheat sample was pulped with 85% etil-alcohol, then it was filtered and the filtration was stored in a refrigerator for 24 hours, then it was re-filtered (the filtration could contain free amino acids and peptids, these are differed with specific reactions) and distilled, then resolved with 200μl bi-distilled water. 30μl 0.1 molar KH2PO4 solution, 15μl 2% Na-dodecylsulfat (which was made in 0.4 molar Na-borate buffer) and 15μl OPA reagent was given to 30μl amino acid solution. The reaction time of the amino acid with OPA was (Hill et al. 1979; Jones et al. 1981; Csámpai et al., 2004; ShantI et al, 2006): 1 minute. After 1 minute 20μl sample taken out from the solution was taken up to the reversed phased (C18) column. From linearity modified concentrate-gradient was applied. The used eluents were the following: A: 0.05 molar Na-acetate solution (pH =6.8) containing 5% methanol; B: 40% methanol+40% iso-propanol+20% 0.05 molar Na-acetate solution. The flowing velocity of the used eluent was: 1cm3 per minute.

As it shows on chart, in the case of treatment with chemical manure the glutamine-acid- and proline-content is increased, but all N-chemical manure treatment the other amino acid content is noticeably higher than in case of the control samples. Using the treatments the lysin-content was increased slightly. One-factor (chemical treatment effects were examined on all and free amino acids) variance-analysis was done with SPSS v. 14. Conclusions on each amino acid: Lys, Arg, Ala, Ile: between the first and third treatment there gives no significant difference. Asp: between the second and third treatment there gives no significant difference. Cys and Val: between the control and the third treatment there was no significant difference. Significant differences can be noticed mainly at chemical manure and control treatments.

The vital resources of water and soil have been recklessly overexploited for decades, resulting in disastrous environmental damages, like soil salinity and degradation, water pollution and groundwater overuse. The changing conditions show an adverse impact on agricultural productivity and development. Competing water and soil users claim these resources inconsiderately, causing quantitative and qualitative changes to the environment. The operation of irrigation systems results environmental changes either inside or outside of their perimeters, often reacting on the conditions of its own operation. Irrigation frequently goes with clashes of interests and environmental conflicts. Beside sound assesments and scientific justification of the developments, coordination and cooperation with different groups and institutions at various levels are key elements of problem-solving, contributing to a sustainable agriculture practice. Keywords: landscape ecology, soil moisture, irrigation. Introduction The formation of vegetation cover on the continents about 500 million years ago is a relatively recent event within the roundly 4 billion years evolution of the biosphere. The fact, that major vegetation zones of the recent age can be identified rather closely by mean temperature and precipitation, seems to suggest that climate was the major determinant of ecological conditions also in the past. One of the striking feature of the planetary-scale evolution is the tendency of climate to remain within a surprisingly narrow range of the global mean temperature, while its two fundamental determinants, the solar radiation and the CO2 content of the planetary atmosphere varied significantly, but almost exactly compensatingly. Within this narrow range, however, the mean temperature of the Earth’s surface was in unceasing rise and fall, thus becoming a major spur for ecological change and biotic evolution. Through photosynthesis, vegetation is a major regulator of the significant seasonal CO2 variations in its fast cycle. At the same time, vegetation also participates in the much slower geochemical cycle of CO2, and it affects climate through changes in surface albedo and in humidity regime as well. The responsiveness of the continental vegetation cover to climate and atmospheric CO2 is remarkably written into geological history in the form of the coal deposits of the Carboniferous age, when, some 340 million years ago, the temperature was some 10 Centigrades higher, and the atmosphere was some 10 times richer in CO2 than today. The rapidly increasing significance of integrating the accumulated impacts of human age with natural trends is shown in climate predictions (Fogarassy et al., 2007). Recently an estimated 24 % of the Earth’s land surface is cultivated. However, in many parts of the World, agriculture is not fulfilling its vital function of feeding people, providing other basic agricultural commodities, and generating stable income. More than 500 million people are suffering from malnutrition and many more from hunger. A world in which hunger and poverty are endemic will always be prone to ecological and other crises. For this reason, top priority should be given to sustainable agriculture and</p><p id="Pg298">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1692 rural development within the overall sustainable development efforts (Farkas et al. 2005, Dobó et al. 2006). During the XXth century, demand for water has soared with rapid growth of population, agriculture, urbanization. Agriculture is the major user of freshwater, accounting for about 70 % of the total demand (Orlóci, 1991, Nováky, 1993). Agricultural water use is expected to increase by about 14 percent between 2000 and 2030, a slower rate than in the past, and slower than population growth. Further growth in agricultural production will therefore depend more on increasing agricultural productivity with respect to both land and water. (UN Report, 2004.) Water-related questions in land use allocation and in crop production Water is an indispensable resource for sustainable agriculture and rural development. FAO’s World Agriculture Toward 2000 (1988) emphasizes the importance of water as key input for agricultural production by stating: “Notwithstanding the fact that land is indispensable for agricultural production, it is water rather than land which is the binding constraint. It is only when this water constraint is released that other technical constraints such as nutrients and pests become important.” A water-centric investigation of theoretical and practical questions arising in the broader context of climate, landscape ecology and crop-production usually leads to a comprehensive analysis of the water balance processes taking place within the roote zone, and to the evaluation of risks and environmental consequences of the soil moisture conditions and controls. A properly formulated and parametrized numeric water balance simulation model and procedure could serve as a basic methodological tool for answering a great number of questions asked by agricuturalists or land use planners. From point of wiew of time horizon and practical orientation, these questions belong to two groups. The approach for regional planning, land allocation decisions and nature resources preservation arrangements considers longer perspectives. As a result of watercentric investigations, an ordered and evaluated set of possible land use options and its consequences could help the decision-making on land allocation. The other aspect of considerations of the water processes is the question of the farmer and the agricultural communities, who wish to select the revenue-maximizing species of plant and adequate technology for crop production, taking into account the costs of cultivation and the potential risk of yield loss, caused by possible cases of unfavourable water conditions. This is a short-term, market-oriented motivation, and the answers from a water-centric investigation of the given site could be expressed in form of probable events and risks belonging to the options of plant type and technology. In more exact terms, these require an ordered set of probability functions describing the expectations for cropendangering shortages and excesses of water, first in terms of soil-hydrological events, then translating these into risk-functions of losses in crop yields (Pintér, 1984, SzőkeMolnár and Szalóki, 1984, Szalai and Cselőtei, 2007, Szalai et al., 2008). In fact, these two directions of questioning and problem-solving are closely interlinked not only through the water balance process itself, but also in the practical outcomes of evaluation methodology, as no meaningful land use options can be formulated and assessed at given site conditions without prior knowledge of the potential risks and</p><p id="Pg299">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1693 consequences of various technologies (Szesztay, 1979, Orlóci et al., 1993, Fogarassy, 2003). Soil moisture simulation method The soil moisture content of the root zone is the resultant of a multivariate water movement procedure, which can be simulated, with strong simplificartions, by a stepby-step calculation of the inflow and outflow of key components, like precipitation, evapotraspiration, water intake from groundwater, infiltration leaving the root zone, surface runoff and others. The effective water storage capacity of the root zone is a determining limit parameter of the water balance processes. With regard to quantifying evapotranspiration, there seem to be important differences between the water-stress controlled and the heat controlled strategy of plant growth. When soil moisture is unlimited and the system maximizes biomass production under given radiation and heat constraints, the use of water in the form of evapotranspiration can be well approximated, for a given plant species and a given phase of phenological evolution, through atmospheric data alone. Applying this heat-controlled approach to modelling the soil moisture processes, some 2000 computerized soil moisture simulations were made for Hungary’s farmlands, combining 13 alternative crop-groups with 3 levels of farming technologies, 4 soil types acoording to the infiltration and effective water storage capacity of soils, and 4 categories of groundwater depth, for the purposes of the National Water Management Master Plan for Hungary (1984), to evaluate the interconnections between crop production and water management needs. The calculations were based on precipitation and temperature data series of ten-day decades in 50 years at 23 meteorological stations, characterizing regional climatic differences within the country. Continuous soil moisture simulations were executed for selected combinations of site conditions, cropcategory and production level. Wherever the soil moisture content drops below the level of unrestricted water availability – which varies widely according to crop type, soil conditions and the phases of plant growth –, the root zone is hypothetically filled up to field capacity. The amount of irrigation water needed to this effect was registered in the simulation procedure as a measure of natural (climatic) water deficiency event, whereby the accumulated amounts of these hypothetical irrigations provide a quantitative measure of water needs corresponding to the supposed combination of local conditions. The amount of excess waters – exceeding the soil storage capacity – was simultaneously taken into account. The major results were summarized in the form of maps, quantifying the deficiencies and excesses of the soil moisture balance according to major crop-groups and seasonal periods, for selected combination of characteristics. The probability functions of the water shortages and excesses of certain vegetation periods, and correlation curves of effects of different local conditions, like water table level, production level, on water shortages and excesses, were also elaborated. The maps presented the effects of local circumstances on production conditions of different crops on a convincing way.</p><p id="Pg300">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1694 Conclusion Irrigation and water management entail clear benefits for the ever-increasing population of this Globe, and these remain to be one of the most important options of agricultural development activities in the future. What we have yet to learn and practice are means of making water management schemes safe and ecologically sound both for human communities and for the nature and the environment, avoiding harmful side effects. With the tendency of reduction of market-distorting and unsustainable agro-subsidies, the local conditions, the objective informations to measure them, and adaptivity in crop production shall come into more importance. While we do have some information on potentials of croplands, we also have to realize that more research has yet to be done. References Szalai, S., Ligetvári, F., Kulkarni, S.

Kovačića 1, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia Abstract: Environmental hazards of intensive agriculture have renewed an interest in the low-input nitrogen (N) fertilization practices for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). A two-year study was conducted to determine the influence of N fertilization, namely the low-N (67 kg N ha -1 ) and high-N (194 kg N ha -1 ) rates on grain yield and mineral composition of three bread wheat cultivars widely grown in Croatia. More favorable weather conditions significantly increased grain yields and concentrations of most minerals except P. When compared to the high-N rate, the use of the low-N rate brought about significant losses in grain yields (20%) and reduction in the concentration of N (23%), Ca (14%), Zn (8%) and Mg (6%), but had no effect on the concentrations of P and K. Cultivars significantly differed for mineral element concentrations and this variation tended to be similar to or lower than the variation caused by growing conditions or N fertilization. Keywords: cultivar, N fertilization, grain minerals, wheat, yield. Introduction Public concerns over the potential environmental hazards of intensive agriculture have renewed an interest in the less intensive N fertilization practices for wheat crop. Fertilization effects of N on wheat protein and yield have been well documented (e.g. Barić et al., 2007; Pepo, 2007; Varga et al., 2007). Many authors demonstrated that intensified wheat fertilization with N resulted in better milling and baking quality through increased grain protein content and bread volume. Increasing N availability generally increases yield more than protein until a yield maximum is reached, whereupon protein levels increase if N is increased further (Varga and Svečnjak, 2006). The mineral contents of wheat grains may be affected by a number of factors including soil, climate and cultural practices. The grain contents of P, Ca, Fe and Mn have been shown to vary as much as 66, 133, 100 and 133%, respectively (Miller, 1958). Limited information is available on the influence of N fertilization on the mineral composition of modern wheat cultivars and the implications in terms of the nutrient content of wheat for human consumptions. Study of Syltie and Dahnke (1983) showed no consistent response of mineral concentration of wheat grain to the rate of N fertilization. In contrast, Ryan et al. (2004) found variations in grain minerals for wheat crop grown under conventional and organic management practices. The findings of Syltie and Dahnke (1983) indicated that wheat cultivar may differ in their responses to N fertilization for grain minerals. Our objective was to evaluate the grain mineral composition and yield variations of wheat breadmaking cultivars as affected by N fertilization. Materials and methods Field experiments in a winter wheat–corn (Zea mays L.)–soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] crop rotation were conducted in northwestern Croatia during the 2000–2001 (hereafter termed 2001), and 2001–2002 (2002) growing seasons on a silt loam soil</p><p id="Pg302">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1696 (Typic Udifluvents). Nitrogen fertilization treatments (high and low) formed 10 main plots. The high-N fertilization rate involved 194 kg N ha-1 out of which 86 kg N ha-1 was applied before planting. The remainder N was topdressed in spring applications. The low-N fertilization rate consisted of 67 kg N ha-1, with 40 kg N ha-1 applied before planting followed by one spring topdressing application of 27 kg N ha-1. Subplots consisted of three cultivars (Marija, Renan and Žitarka) widely grown in Croatia. Crops preceding wheat in the rotation were grown under low-N rates to minimize the effect of residual N. At seeding, plots consisted of 10 rows 11 cm apart and 8.0 m in length. Weeds and diseases were controlled throughout vegetation. The grain was harvested at maturity using a small plot combine, and grain samples were dried in a forced air drier at 40°C. Average 1000-grain weight was determined by counting and weighing two 100-grain samples. Grain yields and 1000-grain weights are expressed on a kilogram per hectare basis at a 130 g kg-1 moisture basis. Grain samples for nutrient analysis were ground in a coffee mill and stored in plastic bags until analyses. Grain nitrogen was measured by Kjeldahl analysis. Duplicate samples of ground whole wheat were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission for P, Mg, Ca and Zn contents and by atomic absorption spectrophotometery for the total content of K. The experiment consisted of two treatment factors: two N fertilization rates (main plots) and three winter wheat cultivars (split-plot), with five replications. Combined analysis of variance was computed with year, N rate and cultivar considered fixed. Mean differences were assessed using the LSD values if the F-test was significant at P = 0.05. Direct relationships among grain quality traits were analyzed with simple Pearson correlation coefficients. Results and discussion The analysis of variance revealed that grain yield, as well as the concentration of mineral elements were significantly affected by year, cultivar, N fertilization and the interactions among these factors (Table 1). Grain yield was markedly higher in 2002 (8295 kg ha-1) than in 2001 (6641 kg ha-1). These increases in grain yields in 2002 were associated with improved grain mineral concentrations for all nutrients except for P (Table 2). Thus, it appears that more favorable weather conditions may increase the concentrations of grain minerals. McGrath (1985) also reported that the concentrations of most minerals improved as wheat grain yields increased, whereas Feil and Fossati (1995) found opposite responses for triticale (× Triticosecale Wittm.).

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1697 The low-N fertilization rate significantly decreased grain yields, which averaged 6725 kg ha-1 compared with 8211 kg ha-1 at the high-N rate. In contrast, the 1000-grain weight showed an opposite pattern of response because it was significantly lighter at the high-N (38.6 g) than at the low-N fertilization rate (43.5 g). Grain mineral contents were also affected by N fertilization for most minerals (Table 1). The N content under the low-N fertilization averaged 17.1 g kg-1 only, which may limit wheat use for breadmaking. The reductions in grain mineral contents associated with low N-rate were consistent in both years regardless of variations in grain yields (Table 2). In contrast, Feil and Banziger (1993) reported that the increases in grain yields induced by applications of N fertilizers hardly affected the concentrations of many grain minerals. In our research, only grain P content was not affected by N fertilization or growing season (Table 1) and averaged 4.70 g kg-1 across all treatments. Interestingly, the findings of Feil and Fossati (1995) clearly indicated no consistent relationship between the results of top soil analysis and mineral element concentration in the grains of triticale (× Triticosecale Wittm.).

The extent of cultivar variation in the concentrations of minerals is shown in Table 3. Variations was relatively large for the N, Zn and Ca and relatively low for Mg, P and K. The variation in mineral element concentration among the cultivars tended to be similar to or lower that the variation caused by N fertilization and growing conditions (Table 2). The highest average grain N content had cultivars Renan (20.1 g kg-1) and Marija (20.0 g kg-1), which were significantly larger than that for Žitarka (18.7 g kg-1). The relationships between grain yield and concentration of grain minerals in tested cultivars were seldomly very tight, suggesting that factors other than grain yield might be also important in determining the concentrations of mineral elements. Cultivars Žitarka and Renan produced similar grain yield, but concentrations of most mineral elements were higher for cultivar Renan (Table 3). In addition, the grains of cultivar Renan were markedly higher in N. These data suggests that the grains of high-protein cultivars are higher in mineral; whereas those of low-protein cultivars are lower in minerals. Correlations between the values of all cultivars tested confirmed that concentrations of protein and minerals are positively related (data not shown). This clearly argues for a physiological link between the accumulation of protein and minerals</p><p id="Pg304">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1698 in tested cultivars. However, the causes for the positive relationship between the concentration of protein and mineral elements are not clearly understood. Cultivar differences in the concentration of mineral elements in whole grains may be due to variation in kernel size and plumpness through their influence on the proportion of the endosperm to total grain weight. As can be seen in Table 3, the grains of cultivar Žitarka were clearly lighter than those of cultivar Renan. It is, therefore, possible that the share of the outer layer in total grain weight was relatively higher for cultivar Žitarka. Correlations between the values of our three cultivars showed that higher 1000-grain weight tended to be associated with increased levels of protein and minerals (data not shown), whereas Peterson et al. (1983) reported the opposite pattern of response. Table 3. Average grain yield and mineral contents of bread wheat cultivars.

The investigations were carried out on the long-term soil tillage experimental field in Józsefmajor, (SZIE GAK Kht. Józsefmajor Experimental and Training Farm) in the region of Aszód and Hatvan, Northern-Hungary. The experiment was set up in 2002. The cultivation of winter wheat had been continuous between 2002 and 2006. It can be concluded that tillage method had significant effect on the occurrence of aphids only, while different nutrient rates had no effect on the presence of any insect groups. Keywords: conservation tillage, nutrient rate, insect occurrence, winter wheat Introduction Continual soil inversion can in some situations lead to a degradation of soil structure leading to a compacted soil composed of fine particles with low levels of soil organic matter. This process can directly and indirectly cause a wide range of environmental problems. Reducing the intensity of soil cultivation lowers energy consumption and the emission of carbon-dioxide, while carbon sequestration is raised through the increase in soil organic matter. Under conservation tillage, a richer soil biota develops that can improve nutrient recycling and this may also help combat crop pests and diseases (Holland 2004). Giving up conventional methods are essential in order to reduce soil compaction, dusting and CO2 emission, this way the loss of organic matter decreases, humidity circulation improves (ECAF 1999, Birkás 2000; 2007, Gyuricza 2000, Holland 2004, Tóth 2005, Huisz 2006, Kovács 2005). In our opinion, total or partial restriction of ploughing, decreasing of mechanical actions and leaving plant residues on soil surface raise some questions. When shifting from conventional to conservation tillage, advantages and disadvantages of the new systems are to be considered, too. Limiting ploughing, increasing the amount of plant residues left on soil surface is likely to influence the activity and distribution of pests, pathogens and weeds. The soil fauna is unfortunately vulnerable to the mechanical disturbance caused by soil tillage which is crucial for preparation of a seedbed, for mixing manure, litter and soil and for controlling weeds through the growing season. It is considered important to find tillage methods which promote the highest possible productivity while causing minimum damage to the microflora and fauna in the soil (Petersen 2000). Materials and methods In our long-term experiment the effects of different conservation tillage methods and nutrient rates on the occurrence of certain insect groups in winter wheat have been</p><p id="Pg306">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

The cultivation of winter wheat had been continuous between 2002 and 2006. Soil tillage long-term experiment The area of the experimental field is 5.18 ha, plot-area is 2158 m2. Number of replications: 4, split-plot design, randomized. The field is homogeneous and flat, exposed to north-western wind. Soil type is Calcic Chernozem, loamy soil, susceptible to compaction and slightly acidic. In the upper 20 cm layer contains 23% sand, 42% loam and 35% clay fraction. Humus content in 0-40 cm layer is 3.27% (0-10 cm, 4%; 10-20 cm, 3.37%; 20-30 cm, 3.1%; 30-40 cm, 2.62%). The average yearly precipitation is approximately 580 mm, in the vegetation period 323 mm. During the time of insect monitoring, 3rd May – 15th July 2005, 222 mm; 10th May – 19th July 2006, 186 mm precipitation was recorded. Tillage treatments: 1. conventional tillage, ploughing as control (26-30 cm) (PL), 2. no-till (NT), 3. shallow cultivator use (14-16 cm) (SC), 4. cultivator use, leaving mulch (16-18 cm) (CLM), 5. disking (16-20 cm) (D), 6. loosening + disking (40 cm + 16-20 cm) (L).

Plots have been fertilized at right angles to tillage treatments with four different nutrient rates in two replications, which meant 3x, 2x, 1x and 0x 34 kg/ha N. Insect collection Insects have been collected by a modified petrol leaf-blower (BV126 type) 8-8 times from beginning of May to harvest in 2005 and 2006, either. Statistical analyses following microscopic identification were carried out with SAS 9.1 (2004) program. The effect of tillage method, applied nitrogen rate, field-margin, as well as the effect of year has been evaluated by the general linear model (GLM). In this study the occurrence of the following insect groups are covered: 1. beetle (Coleoptera) adults, 2. cicada (Cicadellidae) adults, 3. aphids (larvae + adults) (Aphididae), 4. thrips (Thripidae) larvae, 5. thrips (Thripidae) adults. Figure. 2. Insect collection in Józsefmajor, Northern-Hungary, 2005. Results and discussion It was shown, that the interaction of nitrogen application and tillage method had no significant effect on the occurrence of investigated insect groups. Regarding beetle (Coleoptera) adults the year-effect (P&lt;0.001), for aphid (Aphididae) adults tillage method (P=0.0212) and the presence or lack of margin (P=0.0378), for thrips (Thripidae) adults presence of field margin was proved to be significant (P=0.0170). The occurrence of thrips (Thripidae) larvae and cicada (Cicadellidae) adults were not influenced by any factors significantly (P&gt;0.05). Conclusions The results of our investigations carried out in the long-term soil tillage experiment are remarkable in some aspects. Data from our field insect monitoring have clearly shown that in 2005 and 2006 growing seasons tillage method had significant effect on the occurrence of aphids only, while different nutrient rates had no effect on the presence of any insect groups.</p><p id="Pg308">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1702 The effect of field-margin was proved to be significant regarding aphids (Aphididae) and thrips (Thripidae) adults, and this fact is of high importance in environmentalfriendly insecticide application. Our findings show that despite 4-year winter wheat monoculture under conservation tillage, the occurrence of herbivorous insects have not increased remarkably.

Quantitative assessment of the water balance elements was performed in order to compare the water regime of the two genotypes in the soil-plant system under favourable and drought-stressed conditions. Statistically significant differences were found between the actual evaporation and transpiration values of the two genotypes. The extremely good drought stress tolerance of the “Mv Emese” wheat genotype was proved. Keywords: drought stress, wheat genotypes, soil water balance, stress diagnosis system, climatic room Introduction At present climatic conditions, drought stress is one of the major constraints limiting winter wheat biomass production in most areas of the Carpathian Basin (Várallyay, 2005; Hermann et al., 2006). Climate change scenarios developed using the latest global climate model present four different descriptions of how climate may change (IPCC, 2007). For Hungary, each of the scenarios predict increase in mean annual temperature and decrease in summer precipitation (Bartholy et al., 2007), which will lead to further decrease in surface water resources. Hence, selection and development of new drought stress tolerant wheat genotypes that can adapt to the expected consequences of climate change is essential to ensure sustainable and productive wheat production in the future (Hagyó et al. 2007). Drought and heat tolerance of different wheat genotypes are determined in stress diagnostic systems of different types. In glasshouse stress diagnostic systems (Djilianov et al. 2005), a large number of pots are used. Thus precise and continuous monitoring of soil water balance elements would be very expensive and time-consuming. Results obtained from field stress diagnosis systems (Pant et al. 1998) are difficult to reproduce due to uncontrolled weather conditions. Hence, the quantitative assessment of drought stress tolerance of various wheat genotypes still calls for further attention. This paper gives brief introduction of a stress diagnostic system set up in a climatic room in RISSAC and presents the results of soil water balance studies carried out on two different winter wheat genotypes in a drought stress tolerance experiment. Materials and methods In total, 14 identical plexi boxes with a volume (V) of 7.2x10-3 m3 were filled with airdried soil at dry soil bulk density of 1.18x103 kg m-3. The soil type was defined as Calcic Chernozem (WRB, 1994), with main soil properties given in Table 1. The pots were placed in a climatic room with controlled temperature, air humidity, wind speed and light conditions (Lukács et al., 2008). “GK Élet” and “Mv Emese” (Gáspár et al, 2005) winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes were planted, in six boxes each. Two soil columns were left without any plants. Initial soil water content of the pots with stressed (S) and non-stressed (NS) plants was set at field capacity (FC) and to soil moisture content of 0.20 m3 m-3, respectively. An irrigation strategy was developed according to the hydrolimits, derived from soil hydrophysical properties (Štekauerová et</p><p id="Pg310">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1704 al.; 2006). In case of both genotypes, three plants were provided with optimum water supply, ensuring soil water content () between 60% and 100% of FC. The other three plants were drought-stressed keeping the soil water content around 20% of the FC. The total amount of water in each pot was monitored by mass measurements 2–3 times per week. The potential evapotranspiration (PET) was determined by pan evaporation method (Szász, 1997). Potential evaporation from bare soil surface (PE) was evaluated from mass measurements of the pot with saturated soil left without plant. Actual evaporation from bare soil surface was calculated according to Varga-Haszonits (1987). Actual transpiration (TR) was determined from precise water balance calculations as described in Lukács et al. (2008). Differences in water balance elements attributed to different genotypes were analysed by ANOVA. The F statistics was used to separate significant differences in response parameters. Significance is indicated at P&lt;0.05. Table 1.

Figure 1. demonstrates the temporal variation of total soil water (TSW) in the whole soil column of NS and S treatments. The results of the statistical evaluation of the TSW for nine chosen days are given in Table 2. In general, in S and NS treatments the observed differences in TSW between the two genotypes were statistically significant mainly between Days 12–25 (S) and 29–40/60-90 (NS), respectively. This indicates that the processes, governing loss of water from the soil-plant system were different between the two wheat genotypes in the stressed treatments, probably because of observed differences in root distribution (Csorba, 2007) and, consequently, plant water uptake. Once the soil water content was close to wilting point no differences between the TSW values of the S treatments were found except the next few days after irrigation events. In treatments with optimal water supply (NS) no significant differences between the TSW values during the drying period (Days 1-35) were found, most probably because in these pots the initial soil water content was much higher and no drought stress occurred in the beginning of the experiment. However, statistically significant differences between the TSW of the soil columns under the two genotypes were found after the first irrigation event and during the last 30 days of the experiment, indicating that the redistribution of available water between the soil water balance elements could be different. Statistically significant differences between the soil water balance elements of the pots under the two different wheat genotypes were found (Table 3).</p><p id="Pg311">VII.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1707 SOME MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF TIMOTHY AND THEIR RESPONSE TO ANNUAL WEATHER CONDITIONS DURING PRIMARY GROWTH Károly PETŐ – Péter KOVACS - Géza NAGY Department of Rural Development, Faculty of Agronomy and Rural Development, Debrecen University Abstract: This paper presents some detailed results on the spring growth of timothy (Phleum pratense L.) based on field investigations between 2004-2007. Extended shoot height, number of leaves and number of dead leaves per shoot were increasing during primary growth. Number of active leaves and sum of active leaf lamina length were first increasing than decreasing. Index of leafiness was decreasing through the investigation periods. The weather conditions were different in experimental years. The spring growth of timothy primarily showed positive response to annual precipitation. Keywords: timothy, morphological characteristics, primary growth Introduction Harvestable grass yield during the defoliation of primary growth in spring is constituted basically from the stems (vegetative or generative) and leaves (sheath and lamina). In the case of late utilization, these are supplemented with inflorescence. Spring development of these grass parts on a tiller shows a well known pattern (Robson et al., 1988; Nelson and Moser, 1995). After a tiller has been differentiated and starts to grow, the vegetative stems remain short (consisting of nodes and very short internodes) hidden under the leaves’ sheaths and new leaves are developing consistently from the nodes within certain periods of time (e.g. in 7-10 days at the height of the growing season, Alberta and Sibma, 1968). The leaves which now develop have a limited life span (e.g. 3 weeks) after which they die and are replaced by the new leaves (Robson et al., 1989). This means that the number of live leaves on the tiller is constant; a typical grass shoot may bear three live leaves per tiller at the height of the growing season (Alberta and Sibma, 1968). This procedure is terminated by the generative development, whereas the vegetative shoot elongates, overgrows the last leaf sheath, and finally differentiates into the reproductive structure, the inflorescence. This overall pattern of spring grass phenological development is well represented in grassland science, but less has been published on the genetically determined species-specific morphological details of it. The phenological development of grasses is also influenced by the environment, including weather conditions. These were the reasons why a basic research programme was conducted at Debrecen University, to quantify some morphological characteristics of spring grass phenological development and to search the effects of weather conditions on them. Five grasses were involved in the field experiment. This paper presents the results of timothy. Timothy is a tall grass. Its leaves are long (reaching 45 cm) and are produced at a slightly faster rate than the leaves of perennial ryegrass (PRG)(60-70 day.degrees compared to 100 day.degrees respectively). The maximum number of leaves per tiller is up to 6-7 (rarely 8) against only 3 for PRG. The leaf life time is about 360 day.degrees (300 for PRG) (Peeters 2005). In Hungary, timothy is rare in native grasslands, but it is widely used in seed mixtures for cutting systems.</p><p id="Pg314">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1708 Materials and methods Morphological measurements of timothy were made under field conditions at the demonstration garden of Debrecen University, Agricultural Centre. Existing ecological conditions on the site: soil structure is high fertility loam (chernozem); average climatic conditions (last forty years) to the middle of June – precipitation 227.1 mm, T-sum of mean daily temperatures 1244.5 °C, sum of sunny hours per day 889.2 hours. Individual shoots of timothy (n=30) were randomly selected from pure stand of the cultivar “Szarvasi 60” and tagged with a plastic ribbon. Leaves on the shoot were numbered upwards from ground level; the plastic ribbon tags were placed between the last dead and the first live leave on the first day of measurement. The measurements were then repeated seven times (altogether 8 measurements per year) in weekly intervals during the primary growth between mid-April and early June. Primary data recorded on each shoot and on each occasion were:  extended shoot height/length (ESH),  number of dead leaves (NDL) (a leaf was considered dead if more than half of the leaf lamina from the tip was withered),  lamina length (LL) of the live leaves (cm). During the evaluation procedure, secondary data were generated from the primary data:  number of leaves (NL) per shoot developed to date (pieces),  number of dead leaves (NDL) per shoot on each date (pieces),  number of active leaves (NAL) per shoot on each date (pieces),  sum of active/live leaf lamina (SALL) lengths on the shoot (cm) on each date,  index of leafiness (IL) ratio of SALL to ESH, which is used as an indicator for the leafiness of a grass. For the evaluation of the existing weather conditions during the investigation periods of time, the climate index for grass growth (Vinczeffy, 1991) has been calculated. This is a ratio of annual precipitation to annual temperature sum (both accumulated from the 1st of January) expressed as mm C°-1. The annual dynamics of climate index in the experimental years is compared to the average of the last 40 years. Detailed analysis of weather conditions primarily influencing spring grass growth and development refers to the relative availability (%) of the investigated weather conditions based on the last 40 year average. Special attention is paid to annual precipitation, as consistent water supply is more essential in herbage production than in grain production where, only a few periods of time is crucial in phenological development of graminae plants (Németh et al., 2005). Data of the investigation were statistically analyzed by General Linear Model of the SPSS 13.0 for Windows (2004) software. Result and discussion The extended shoot height (ESH), the numbers of leaves per shoot (NL) and dead leaves per shoot (NDL) were increasing through the investigation period and amounted to 72.19 cm, 7.70 pieces and 3.06 pieces, respectively (Table 1). On average, there were 5.66 active/life leaves per shoot during the investigation period of primary growth. However, in the beginning it was increasing to 6.10 leaves per shoot, than was decreasing to 4.64 leaves per shoot by early June. The sum of active leaf lamina length</p><p id="Pg315">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1709 was increasing in the beginning and amounted to 133.27 cm by early May. Later on, it was decreasing to 106.35 cm. The index of leafiness was decreasing through the investigation period. In the chronology of emergence of leaves the lamina length (cm) was 13.27 (s=5.09), 17.07 (s=5.23), 20.50 (s=5.39), 23.76 (s=6.61), 27.78 (s=9.20), 26.66 (s=9.15), 21.59 (s=9.52), 15.22 (s=8.14), 10.20 (s=5.29) and 5.33 (s=2.25) for the leaves 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th on the shoots from the ground, respectively. Data show that the successive leaves in the beginning of primary growth were bigger and bigger until leaf size culminated. Later on successive leaves decreased in size. The last leaf (10th) was only 19.2% the size of the biggest leaf (5th one). Table 1. Morphological characteristics of timothy (2004-2007) during primary growth.

Detailed analysis of climatic conditions, primarily influencing spring grass growth and development showed that annual precipitation had the greatest differences between years (Table 2). The experimental years may be considered as rainy, somewhat rainy, extremely rainy and reasonably dry for 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. Temperature conditions and the sunny hour accumulation were more balanced than rainfall in the experimental years. However, both sum of temperature and sum of sunny hours were remarkably higher in 2007 compared to the other experimental years. Table 2.

In many cases there were significant differences in grass morphology among experimental years. Extended shoot height was remarkably high (69.47 cm) in 2006 and outstandingly depressed (42.20 cm) in 2007 (Table 3). The number of leaves developed was outstandingly high (8.12) and remarkably depressed (5.51) for 2005 and 2007</p><p id="Pg316">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1710 respectively. The number of active leaves was depressed in 2006 and 2007. Similar results were found for the SALL per shoot as well, having less than half of the four year mean sum of live leaf lamina length in 2007. The depressed vegetative growth in 2007 (reasonably dry), supports the research results of Szász et al. (2006) who found precipitation an important climatic element for plant production in Debrecen, correlating positively with net primary productivity of ecosystems.

LESZNYÁK Institute of Crop Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Debrecen, e-mail: hunyadie@agr.unideb.hu Abstract: Sunflower production has become the most important industrial crop in Hungary in the last decade. The planting area of sunflower has gone up very rapidly (in 2007 it was 530 thousand ha). In the last decade the hibrid-sortiment of sunflower improved both in quantity (number of hybrids) and in quality (yield-ability, agronomic traits etc) in Hungary. It is very important for the agronomic and economic efficiency of sunflower production that we could select the best hybrids to special ecological and agrotechnical conditions. From 2001 to 2006 1 early, 2 medium-ripening and 1human consumption varieties in Hajdúság on chernozem soil were tested. Our scientific results proved that there are fairly big differences among cropyears and sunflower hybrids concerning the yields (in 2001 year 2899-4264 kg/ha, in 2004 year 2791-3968 kg/ha. We trust that these results of our test will be useful in helping farmers to choose the best up-to-date varieties for their purposes from the ever widening choice available. Keywords: sunflower, cropyear, yield-stability Introduction In recent years different natural resources have gained importance. It is crucial that they can be maintained and the circumstances of their reproducibility broadened. Biological resources are renewable (Várallyay 2007). Substances of biological origin cannot be substituted with anything else in the food supply, they function as raw materials for the industry and also have a role as regional energy resources (Husti,2006). To satisfy these requirements crop cultivation has an important role (Birkás et al.2006) On the other hand, in order to improve both the quantity and the quality of yields, we must acquire a complex ecological attitude and a more rational use of natural resources (Göksoy et al). All this requires favourable material, technical and social circumstances. The exploitation of genetic resources – as a form of renewable resource – is a fundamental method to increase yields. To do this we have to harmonize the biological needs of the given variety, its ecological attributes and the circumstances of its cultivation (Pepó et al. 2007) . Materials and methods The objective of my research was to determine, via the examination of yields in different years, the biotic and non-biotic stress-factors that effect sunflower yields with special attention to the Hajdúság region and the specific varieties of sunflower hybrids, which favour the loess soil. In the vegetation periods of the observed years I surveyed the standing crop and by comparing the obtained parameters with the yields using a correlation function I explored their relationships. Relying on the results gained at the time of the harvest I determined the cropping capacity of hybrids in specific agro ecological environments. For our observations we used the following research area: random block arrangements with four replications. In the research we have applied a unified agrotechnology and an integrated nutrients supply.</p><p id="Pg318">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1712 In 2001-2006 we observed 1 variety from the early, 2 varieties from the medium maturity and 1 variety from the human consumption group. The observations were carried out at the Látókép Plant Cultivation Research Site of Debrecen University. The site is about 15 km from Debrecen. The soil of the research site is calciferous chernozem, with sediments of around 50% and somewhat lower values in the lower layers. Its physical characteristics are that of semi-compacted clay category. Results and discussion The different years may influence yields decisively, however they influence specific varieties in different manner. The worst year for both the varieties with high oil-content and those in the confectionary group was 2006, while the highest yields were observed in 2003 (Table 1). There were also significant differences between specific varieties. The results of the observations have revealed that the ecological factors of the habitat fundamentally influence the yields of sunflower. With the help of linear regression analysis we analyzed the correspondence of the environment (in this case the different yields) and the group of genotypes which were observed every year. Table 1.

The highest dispersion values were observed in the case of Alexandra PR, a representative of the early group. We calculated the linear regression function of the varieties. After analyzing the regression coefficients we put the genotypes into an order that reflected the yield stability. The most productive genotypes are those where there are both high yields and a good stability (Figure 1).</p><p id="Pg319">VII.

Cereal Research Communications 1714 In each of the years we conducted the observations, the variety Alexandra PR was more resistant to pathogens, both in regard to infection-dynamics and to the contamination ratio expressed in percentages. On the basis of the data we gathered the following correlations were observed between Diaporthe helianthi infection and yields. There is negative correlation (r= -0.53602) between yields and the contamination ratio expressed in percentages (based on 6 years of observation). The infection may influence yields decisively, however they influence specific varieties in different manner. By Arena PR there was tight negative correlation (r=-0.74888), by Zoltán there was (r=-0.30704). Conclusions During the observation carried out in the Hajdúság region we confirmed that there are significant ecological differences between specific sunflower varieties. The effect of the different yields is well reflected in the average yields of the 4 varieties (in 2001 the yields ranged between 2780 and 3591 kg ha-1, in 2003 4102 and 4624 kg ha-1, which shows a yield fluctuation in the period observed. The yields we observed proved hat for in evaluation of productivity both the amount of yields and yield stability have to be taken into account. The variety with the best yield levels and yield stability was Alexandra PR. By taking into account the information gathered in the years of observation we can state that the different years influence the yields of genotypes even in favourable soil conditions and by applying the necessary agricultural technologies. Among diseases Diaporthe helianthi was the most destructive. The appearance and the dynamics of infections showed significant differences in succeeding years. In 2002 the average of contamination was 8%, in 2005 was 65%. Although yearly differences primarily effected the degree of contamination and the damage caused, there are significant dissimilarities between varieties in relation to their resistance to serious infections. In 2005 the figures of contamination stood between 42 and 62% for specific varieties, while in the most favourable year, which was 2002, it was only between 8 and 14%. The negative effect of diseases on yields was evident (r= -0.53602). The resistance against Diaporthe helianthi was most obvious in the case of Alexandra PR. References Birkás M., Dexter, A.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1715 THE EFFECT OF PLANT DENSITY ON THE YIELD AND YIELD SAFETY OF MAIZE HYBRIDS IN AVERAGE AND DRY YEARS Mihály SÁRVÁRI 1 – Beáta BOROS 1 1 University of Debrecen Faculty of Agriculture, Institute of Crop Sciences, 4032 Debercen, 138 Böszörményi St., sarvari@agr.unideb.hu, borosb@agr.unideb.hu Abstract: Plant density has a determining role in yield. In a favourable year, hybrids reach higher yields at higher plant densities as the reduction in the individual yield of plants due to the increase in plant density is smaller. The experiments were set up on typical meadow soil in a dry and rainy year, 2003 and 2005, respectively. In 2003, the yields of hybrids ranged between 7.189-10.24 t ha -1 depending upon plant density. The hybrids produced the highest yield at 90 thousand plants ha -1 . This was due to the extremely rainy July, in spite of the 78.5 mm precipitation deficit occurring during the season. In 2005, the amount of precipitation was 114.2 mm higher during the season than the average of 30 years. The yields of hybrids ranged between 11.5-15.82 t ha -1 depending upon plant density. Most of the hybrids achieved the maximum yield at 90 thousand plants ha -1 . Keywords: maize hybrids, optimum plant density, weather, yield. Introduction Plant density has a high impact on maize yield. In the average of hybrids, the optimum plant densities were 35-40 thousand plants, 50 thousand plants and 55-60 thousand plants and 60-70-80 thousand plants per hectare in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, respectively (Győrffy, 1979). The applicability of higher plant densities had a significant role in achieving double and triple yields (Carlone and Russel, 1987). Among the factors determining maize yield, plant density has a 20% role (Győrffy, 1976; Berzsenyi and Győrffy, 1995). According to Pintér et al. (1977), that hybrids sensitive and tolerant to the increase of plant density differ in their light requirements and shadow tolerance. Yield reduction due to shadowing is smaller in the tolerant varieties. According to Menyhért (1988), it would be worthwhile to determine the optimum plant density of each hybrid for each agroecological region. Materials and methods The experiments were set up on typical meadow soil in a dry and a rainy year, 2003 and 2005, respectively. Soil characteristics: The organic matter content suddenly decreased in the soil profile from 4-5 % at the surface to 1.5% in the 40-60 cm layer. The pH value of the soil was 6.0 (KCl), the AL soluble P2O5 and K2O content was 220 and 240 mg/kg, respectively, while plasticity index according to Arany was 52. Weather during the experimental years: The weather of 2003 was extreme. The 30-year average of precipitation during the vegetation period of maize (April-September) is 345.1 mm. In 2003, the amount of precipitation was 78.5 mm lower. The distribution of rain was also extreme, its amount was 14.1 mm, 61.8 mm and 57.3 mm lower than the average of many years in May, June and August, respectively (Figure 1).</p><p id="Pg322">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Conclusions Yields are greatly dependent upon plant density. The optimum plant density is determined by the genetic characteristics of the hybrid, its vegetation period, the growing site conditions, the year effect and water and nutrient supply. In a favourable year, hybrids give the higher yields at higher plant densities, as in rainy years the reduction in individual yield due to increasing plant density is lower. In addition to optimum plant density, optimum plant density should also be determined which the hybrids can tolerate without yield loss. At too high plant densities, the ratio of sterile plants is increased, yield and yield safety are reduced. Optimum plant density under average conditions is 70-80, 65-75 and 60-65 thousand plants ha-1 for FAO 200-300, FAO 400 and FAO 500 hybrids, respectively.

Field experimentation was started on the experimenting fields of University of West Hungary in Mosonmagyaróvár in 2007. The bacterial fertilizer was spread onto the surface of the ground just before sowing, then it was rotated into to soil with seed-bed tillers. Crudeprotein as well as P-, Ca-, Mg-, Mn- and Fe-contents of the plants treated with Bactofil 10 bacterial fertilizer grew significantly, while K-, Na- and Cu-content decreased compared to the chemical composition volume of the control group. Keywords: bacterial fertilizer, industrial poppy species, drymatter, crudeprotein, chemical composition volume Introduction Applying Bactofil B10 bacterial fetilizer we tried to follow the changing of chemical composition volume on two spring crop industrial poppy species during our experiment. From the point of view of the literature required nutrients of industrial poppy species is N 100-120, P205 80-110, K20 80-100kg/ha (Lesztyák, 2005). We should pay attention as well to the upcoming and well-traceable effect of the modification of N-P antagonism, and a K-P sinergism on the required nutrients (Balinkó, 2007). The up-todate expert advise about the expenses saver and environmentally sound management of fertilizing is realized in four stages (1. minimum; 2. environmentally sound management; 3. economical and 4. maximum level of plantfeeding) to optimize the above detailed norms (Csathó, 2007). The plant is able to grow healthily on an acceptable plantfeeding level. In the case of ideal required nutrients, adequate growing technology and good weather conditions even 2,5t/ha yield can be reached (Késmárki, 1992). The applied Bactofil B10 bacterial fertilizer mixed with phytohormones (auxin, gibberelin, kinetin) chemically makes the germination and growth of the plants, and resistance against pathogens stronger and due to bacterial hormones the plants grew bigger amount of roots, as a consequence of it the ability for nutrients and water capacity was enlarged. Increased nutrient capacity was examined by the measurement of chemical composition volume. The intensity of photosynthesis grewn in the presence of bigger insolation (Anda, 2006). In the dry summer the intensity of potosynthesis influenced significantly the amount of drymatter and cudeprotein content of the poppy species. The drymatter and crudeprotein content were increased in the species under experimenting as well.</p><p id="Pg326">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1720 Materials and methods During the carried out experiment we measured the impact of Bactofil B10 bacterial compost on two industrial poppy species by measuring the chemical component volume. One of the species, Kék Gemona, was officially recognised in 1995. It is an avarage breeding seasonal and growing variety, and its seeds are blue. The alcaloid content is 2,5% altogether. Its main alcaloide is the narcotine in proportion of 12-14 per thousands. The weight of one thousand seeds is 0,35-0,40g (Földesi, 1993). The other examined poppy species was Kék Duna, which became recognised by the state in 1973. Kék Duna is an improved hybrid using Papaver Somniferum L. and Papaver Orientale L. parental species to develop. Its firm stem is 100-120 cm tall with 4-5 branches. Its seed is bright blue. The weight of one thousand seeds is 0,45g. Its effective agent contains 4-6 thousands morphia (OMMI, 2001). Bactofil B10 bacterial fertilizer contains Azospirillum lipoferum, Azotobacter vinelandii, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus circulans, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Micrococcus roseus microorganism variancies, moreover macro- and microelements, enzymes biosynthesized by microorganisms and other substances (like growth promoting substances, plant hormones, vitamines). Using bacterias (Azotobacter) the number of N-fixing bacterias and nitrifying organisms grew in the soil, and dissolved ammonia can be decreased by it in the soil. With the help of bacterias mineral substances, trace elements can get into an available state. The added bacterias synthesize growth promoting hormones, which encrease the growth of the amount of the roots, so the ability of nutrients and water capacity can be improved, and moreover the dry endurance of the plants is better. Pseudomonas flouercens bacteriums produce siderofort besides hormones, by which it protects bacteriums originated nosogenic. Azotobacter vinelandii aerob N-fixing bacteria also takes part in the formation of mould with the synthetisation of pigment substances. The bacterial species by fixing the air’s nitrogen and revealing P and K found in the soil make balanced nutrition supply for the plants. The experimentation was carried out four times. The two split-plot experimenting method was set up on the experimenting fields of NYME Mosonmagyaróvár. The number of experimenting parcels was 16 altogehter (Table 1). Both species were untreated and unnaked grains sown on 18 March in 2007. The space between the lines was 14cm and the depth of the sowing was 1-1,5cm. The parcels were formed in the size of 1.25mX10m. The number of stems was fixed one by one with the method of thinning out trying to form 10cm stem distance in the state of having 4-6 leaves. The bacterial fertilizer was sprayed onto the surface of the ground just before sowing, then it was rotated into to soil with seedbed tillers. During the treatment we used 10% solution which is equivalent of 1 l/ha -1 dose. Blooming happened from 20 to 11 June in 2007. Sampling of the plants was in the state of green poppy-head at the beginning of July. Due to the dry summer blooming was fulfilled rather quickly. The plants’ drymatter and crudeprotein components were examined by taking samples from the stems in laboratory procedures. The proportion of treatment can be found in (Table 1).</p><p id="Pg327">VII.

The statistical analysis of the results was carried out by a two-factor variancy analysis. During the analysis we examined the impact of Bactofil B10 treatment on chemical composition volume of the two species (Kék Gemona, Kék Duna).

Between Bactofil B10 and the control</p><p id="Pg328">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1722 group in the case of chemical composition volumes we reached significancy in 10 cases at P=0,1% mistake possibility level. After the Bactofil B10 and control treatment significant treatment effect can not be shown in Ca-content (Table 2). There can not be shown a significant difference on the avarage of the two species as an effect of Bactofil B10 and control treatment (Table 2). Bacterial fertilizer treatment on the avarage of species grew crudeprotein content by 20,2%, drymatter content by 0,4% compared to the control group. In comparison with the control group the growth of P-content was 103,5%, Ca- was 21,1%, Mg- was 29,2% Mn- was 43,4% Zn-content grew 18%, Fecontent grew 106,4% compared to the control group. Both Na-, Cu- and K-content decreased as an effecet of bacterial fertilizer. Conclusions To sum up it can be stated that Bactofil B10 and control treatment result different reactions concerning the species with the exception of Ca-content. There can not be shown a significant difference between the species in the case of Ca-content and Nacontent between Bactofil B10 and control treatment. As an effect of Bactofil B10 and control treatment the crudeprotein content of the species grew significantly besides different species reaction. Bacterial fertilization grew Fe- and P-content significantly, and it is worth mentioning that it is twice as big as the control group’s result. Na- and Cu-content descreased after Bactofil B10 treatment compared to the control group. In comparison with the control group bacterial fertilization grew crudeprotein content significantly (20,2%). Our treatment grew Mn- and Mg-content of the plants by 43,4% and 29%. References Anda A.- Lőke Zs.: (2006): A növény-légkör rendszer kölcsönhatásai kétszeres CO2-koncentrációnál.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1723 EFFECTS OF INCREASING K RATES ON THE NUTRIENT STATUS OF MALTING BARLEY AT THE STAGE OF TILLERING Ágnes BALÁZSY – Katalin SÁRDI Department of Plant Production and Soil Science, Georgikon Faculty of Agriculture, University of Pannonia 16 Deák F. st. H-8360 Keszthely, HUNGARY, E-mail: balazsy.agnes@1999.georgikon.hu Abstract For environmentally sound fertilization, adequate information on the agrochemical characteristics of soils as well as on the nutrient status of crops are necessary. Tillering stage is widely used for characterizing the nutrient status of cereals as nutrient concentrations are high at this stage. Literature data indicating the nutrient concentrations and nutrient supply categories of spring malting barley is still not complete. The main objective of our study was to establish quantitative relationships between K fertilization and plant responses. Our pot experiment was carried out in the spring of 2006 under greenhouse conditions in a Haplic Luvisol. Malting barley, Scarlett variety was used as a test plant. Nine different NPK combinations (unfertilized control + 8 treatments) were applied. Samples were taken at the stage of tillering. Potassium deficient fertilization resulted significant decreases in the K concentration of plants. Highest values of K concentration of plants were obtained at the N1P1 level with K2 treatment and at the N2P2 level with K3 treatment. Tendencies in the changes of nitrogen and phosphorus concentration of plants were very similar. Close relationships were found between DM production and amounts of K taken up by plants as well as between water content and K concentration of young spring barley. Keywords: pot experiment, malting barley, potassium fertilization, nutrient status Introduction With the proper use of fertilization, adequate information on both agrochemical characteristics of soils and the nutrient status of crops are necessary. Tillering stage is widely used for characterizing the nutrient status of cereals as nutrient concentrations are high at this stage (Kádár, 2004; Csathó et al., 2006). Quantification of the relationship between nutrient uptake efficiency and productivity of crops is important also from the aspect of practice (Végh and Rajkai, 2006). Positive effects of potassium on the dry matter (DM) production of crops are strongly related to the favourable water use of plants. With the balanced K fertilization, both yield levels and stability, stress tolerance and resistance to diseases as well as stem strength in cereals can be ensured (Antal, 1999). The main objective of our pot experiment was to establish the relationship between increasing K rates and the nutrient status of malting barley at the stage of tillering. Materials and methods Our pot experiment was carried out at the Department of Plant Production and Soil Science, University of Pannonia in the spring of 2006 under greenhouse conditions on a lessivated brown forest soil, FAO taxonomy: Haplic Luvisol. The main agrochemical characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Spring malting barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), Scarlett variety was used as a test plant. Nine different NPK combinations (unfertilized</p><p id="Pg330">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1724 control + 8 treatments) were applied to observe the effects of fertilization (with special regard to K supply level) at the stage of tillering i.e. 21 days after sowing (DAS), FS: 23. Single rates of nutrients (N1P1K1) applied were as follows: 60 mg N, 100 mg P2O5 and 140 mg K2O per kg of soil. Effects of NPK treatments were studied in 4 replicates. 20 plants were grown per pot containing 4 kg soil. Soil moisture was kept at 70% WHC (water holding capacity) by daily watering. At the harvest, average plant height, fresh and dry matter (DM) production as well as water contents were determined. Whole shoot (all plant parts above ground) was sampled for laboratory analyses (NPK concentrations and amounts of nutrients taken up by plants). Table 1.

Differences between the N1 and N2 level of fertilization are considerable except of the N1P1K0 treatment. Tendencies in the changes of phosphorus concentration of plants were very similar to those of the nitrogen concentration. Comparing our results with literature data it could be established that N and P concentrations of young plants were found in the sufficiency or higher ranges. Significant increases were found in the K concentration of young barley plants with the increasing rates of potassium fertilization. At the N1P1 level, highest values of K concentration of plants were found with K2 treatment. On the other hand, highest K concentration could be observed at the N2P2 level with K3 treatment. N1P1K3 and N2P2K4 treatments could not result in further increases in the K concentration of young spring barley. Potassium deficient fertilization have markedly decreased the K concentration of plants (values were lower than the control, see Table 2).</p><p id="Pg331">VII.

On the other hand, Rama and Sekhon (1987) found that K concentrations between 4.10 - 6.10 K% can be referred as a sufficiency range for wheat at tillering stage taking samples from the whole plant (Table 3). A very close relationship could be observed between DM production and amounts of K taken up by plants (R2= 0.7446, level of significance: 0.001, n=36, data not shown). Increases of K supply have resulted in higher dry matter production in young spring barley. Highest values of amounts of K taken up by plants were found at the N1P1 level with the K2 treatment and at the N2P2 level with the K3 treatment. A close positive correlation could be observed between water content and shoot K concentration of young barley plants (R2= 0.4013, level of significance: 0.02, n=36, data not shown). These results are in good agreement with the findings of several other authors (Krishnakumari et al., 1988; Springob, 1996). Conclusions From our experimental results it was suggested that highly significant increases of potassium concentration of young spring barley were obtained with higher rates of K at balanced NP fertilization. Rates of K exceeding the requirement of plants resulted in imbalances in NPK supply. No further increases were found in K concentration of plants with the higher rates of potassium (i.e. N1P1K3 and N2P2K4 treatments).</p><p id="Pg332">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

There is a need for a more generic approach to link soil and vegetation responses. An alternative approach is to use Ellenberg indicator values as a means of assessing the likely competitive advantage between different species as projected by dynamic soil models. The way of utilization and maintenance, and different environmental influences change the specific soil conditions at their locations by human-induced and natural stresses. Different ecotypes of red clover registered at surveyed locations are adapting to such environmental changes, and may represent the breeding pool for red clover breeding to abiotic stresses. Keywords: red clover, Ellenberg indicator value, soil assesment Introduction Red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) is forage legume important for livestock feeding. Except in arable land, red clover may be found at meadow and ruderal habitats (Dujmović Purgar, 2006). In view of climatic and relief variability of the territory of Croatia, different ecotypes of red clover have been developed. Considering high adaptability of red clover, it may grow in wide range of soil and environmental conditions (Frame et al., 1998). Soils worldwide are subjected to increasing degrees of physical, chemical and biological, natural or human-induced stresses (Várallyay, 2007). As habitat conditions are being changed, botanic composition which point out at specific abiotic characteristics of habitat, changes as well (Ellenberg, 1974; Knežević et al., 2007). There is a need for more generic approach to link soil and vegetation responses. An alternative approach is to use Ellenberg indicator values as a mean of assessing the likely competitive advantage between different species as projected by dynamic soil models (Canham et al., 2003). The adaptability of newly created red clover varieties is a trait increasingly taken into account today. The objective of this research is to find out the specific abiotic characteristics of the habitats of autochthonous red clover populations in order to utilize these populations in breeding programs to tolerance to specific abiotic stresses. Materials and methods Eleven locations of autochthonous populations of red clover were surveyed in northwestern Croatia (NW Croatia). Two types of habitats, meadow and ruderal, were registered on these locations. Surveillance of botanic composition, soil type, altitude, exposition and terrain inclination was carried out at these locations during 2007 (Table 1). Abiotic characteristics of locations [soil humidity (F), soil reaction (R), nitrogen supplies (N)] were determined on the basis of botanical composition, by Ellenberg indicator value (Ellenberg, 1974).</p><p id="Pg334">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Ellenberg indicator values (e) were standardized as   xe ee e sd xx y   , with xe the e-th character of Ellenberg indicator values before standardisation (e = 1…E, E = 3), ye the standardized character, x e the mean of xe and sdxe the standard deviation of xe.

The normalizing constant 8E (= 24) brings the e ijd on the scale from 0 to 1. The 3D principal coordinate analyze (PCA) carried out using SAS/Stat software (V9.1). Results and discussion Ellenberg indicator values of surveyed locations were determined on the basis of their botanical composition, while Centerini et al. (2007) studied and evaluated soil parameters and botanical composition separately. In total, 105 plant taxa were registered on locations of autochthonous red clover populations. Plant taxa were the least numerous at the location DU (16), and the most numerous at the location ZL (37). Sinkovič (2006) records 20 species in average at one location. On the basis of plant taxa registered at the area under surveillance, the mean values for soil humidity (F) point out the prevailing of indicating plants of humid habitats (F=5). Analysis of indicating values for soil reaction (R) point out the domination of moderately acid to moderately alkaline soils (R=6), and is in accordance to Vrbek (2000). Considering the nitrogen supply, the most abundant plant species are those indicating the habitats moderately supplied with nitrogen (N=6). On the basis of Ellenberg indicator values, locations are clustered into six groups: (1.) KU and PR, (2.) ST, SO, BE and KR, (3.) SA and DU, (4.) ZL, (5.) DR and (6.) CE (Figure 1).</p><p id="Pg335">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1729 Figure 1. The 3D PCA of locations surveyed by Ellenberg indictator values Although DR and CE have equal mean values for all parameters assessed (F=5, R=6, N=5), these locations are the most separated because they are geographically the most distant, and differentiate in altitude and soil type (Table 1). Both locations were used as arable land in the past. Today, the location DR is transformed in newly set meadow, while the location DR is fully neglected ruderal habitat. The location ZL is separated from the other groups by the number of species, and differentiates in the phases of succession. Locations BE and SO are grouped in the same group because they have the same mean values for F (F=5) and R (R=6). Recently, these locations were arable lands, but today they are naturally grassed. Locations KR and ST are similar in the average value of nitrogen supply (N=6). Mentioned locations are ruderal habitats alongside the road, with the specificity in terrain inclination at the location KR, as visible from the mean value of soil humidity (F=4). Locations SA and DU are similar in nitrogen supply (N=7). Location SA is meadow habitat, and DU is ruderal habitat, but the way of their maintenance and utilization is quite similar. Locations PR and KU are clustering together due to similar mean values (F=6, R=6, N=5), and the same number of plant species. However, the location KU is completely neglected in comparison to the location PR. The location DR and KU cluster together due to pH value of soil and nitrogen supply (R=6, N=5) and due to fact that these habitats were arable land in the past, and today are utilized as meadows. The only differentiations between DR and KU are manifested in the phases of succession.

Cereal Research Communications 1730 Conclusions The habitats at surveyed territory are mainly humid, with moderately acid to alkaline soil reaction, and moderately supplied with nitrogen. The way of utilization and maintenance, and different environmental influences change specific soil conditions at particular locations, causing human-induced or natural stresses. Different ecotypes of red clover are adaptable to these changes. These ecotypes are registered together with characteristics of surveyed habitats and are representing the breeding pool for tolerance to specific abiotic stresses.

Inside olive orchards, the difference between irrigated and non irrigated plots was observed, in accordance to B. oleae adults population fluctuation and fruit infestation. Olive fruits infestation by B. oleae and fruit drop in Splitsko – dalmatinska county, was higher on irrigated plot from July till November, during both years of experiment, at signifficant level. Olive fruits infestation by B. oleae and fruit drop in Zadarska county, was not recorded during July and August, mainly because of low population of B. oleae adults and unfavourable abiotic conditions. Later, during Sept. and October, olive fruits infestation and fruit drop was higher on irrigated plot at signifficant level. Results of investigation confirm that besides abiotic factors, growing conditions with or withouth irrigation could signifficantly increase B. oleae infestation in fruits. Keywords: olive, olive fruit fly, infestation, dry and irrigated conditions Introduction Olive – Olea europaea L. is considered to be one of the most important cultivated crops in Mediterranean region. Consumption of olive oil in EU reach over 1.300 milion tons, at the end of 20th century (Bjeliš, 2005). Under semi-arid conditions, olive trees are able to crop and yield can be substantialy increased by applying a small amount of water. It is well known that the low level of watter in the soil causes a reduced mineral nutritient availability for plant growth, as well as a reduction in dry weight (Goldhamer et.al., 1994) and lowered uptake of nutritiens (Lakso, 1984). Usefulness of watter application has been proved in many cultivated crops, such as peach (Chalmers et.al. 1981), wheat (Balla et.al., 2006), horse bean (El-Tayeb, 2006), potato (Dolezal et.al., 2007) etc. Olive fruit fly – Bactrocera oleae Gmel. (Diptera, Tephritidae) is most signifficant pest of olive fruits in the Mediterranean countries as well as along the whole Croatian olive growing region ( Bjeliš, 2005). The damage caused by olive fruit fly and it's control measures result in reduction in yeald and quality of olive fruit and hence of olive olive, but also use of toxic chemicals creating many environmental problems. Sellective tendency of olive fruit fly to lay the eggs in fruits could be largely connected with wrinkled or strenched fruit surface in dry or irrigated growing conditions. During 2005-06 trial to evaluate olive fruits susceptibility to olive fruit fly preference in dry and irrigated growing conditions were investigated . Materials and methods Selected experimental orchards represent traditional olive growing system in Dalmatia, planted on karst soil type withouth irrigation. Orchards were mainly planted with dominat domestic olive cultivar Oblica at 6 x 7 m planting distance. Orchards were divided in irrigated plots and non-irrigated control plots. Olive trees were irrigated with micro sprinklers located by the trunk under the tree canopy. Watter was applied four</p><p id="Pg338">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1732 times, in monthly intervals with the ammount of 150 lit of watter per each tree. Chromotrap traps (Isagro, Italy) baited with the female sex pheromone (1,7, dioxaspiro (5,5) undecan), ammonium salts (diammonium hidrogen phosphate and ammonium sulphate), and hydrolysed protein, were used to monitor for B. oleae. Traps were checked weekly and lures were replaced as specified by the manufacturer. Observations of larval stages and total infestation in olive fruits were made by collecting fruit in monthly intervals. Fruits were stripped and number of larval stages were recorded. All results were processed in statistical program ARM and were ranged by Duncan's test (P=0.05). Results and discussion Olive Olea europaea L. fruits infestation with olive fruit fly Bactrocera oleae G. and B. oleae adults population fluctuation, assesed in investigation are presented in Figures 1 and 2 and Table 1. Clime conditions in 2005-06 on Kaštel Stari location were mainly favourable for development and reproduction of B. oleae. Large fruit set during both years made possible media for B. oleae oviposition already during July. But, extremly high temperatures, which reach up over 33 ºC during 2005 and over 35ºC during 2006, with average air humidity lower than 35%, make unfavourable abiotic conditions during July and August and cause high mortality of B. oleae eggs and young larval stages. In these cases, irrigation did not make any positive effect to B. oleae preimaginal stages development (Figure 1, Table 1). Later, from half August till the end of November and start of picking time, abiotic conditions were much more favourable for B. oleae development and percentage of fruit infestation increase in both dry and irrigated plots. Even more, there is statistic signifficant difference in percentage of fruit infestation between dry and irrigated plots. This can be explain with higher preference of B. oleae females to lay their eggs in larger and visualy well developed fruits with strenched fruit surface. Clime conditions in 2005-06 on Biograd location were mainly unfavourable for development and reproduction of B. oleae. Although fruit set during both years were high, which made possible source of good media for B. oleae oviposition already during July, abiotic factors disable fruits infestation during July and August. Aditionaly, acourdng to the trapping data, population of B. oleae adults during July and August was absent. Long term drought period and extremly high temperatures over 35ºC, specialy during August 2006, make unfavourable abiotic conditions and cause high mortality of B. oleae eggs and young larval stages even during September (Figure 2). During September till the end of November 2005-06, abiotic conditions were mutch more favourable for B. oleae development and percentage of fruit infestation increased. Similar results from Kaštel Stari location were obtained on Biograd location. There is signifficant difference in percentage of fruit infestation between dry and irrigated plots. This difference is specialy conspicuous during November, when percentage of fruit infestation were almost ten times higher on irrigated than dry plots (Table 1). Higher preference of B. oleae females to lay their eggs in bigger and visualy well developed fruits with strenched fruit surface is caused by it's survival response and oviopsition behaviour.</p><p id="Pg339">VII.

Pass over from extensive to intensive olive growing systems which include orchard irrigation, will cause increase of B. oleae infestation on olive fruits and probably other harmful olive pests. This will result in higher usage of pesticiedes and creation of aditional envinromental problems in soil-food chain and life quality (Várallyay, 2006). These concerns have emphasised the need for development of selective and alternative improved methods for the B. oleae control. Accordingly, development of alternative improved managment technology for the control of the B. oleae already showes good progress (Bjeliš, 2005, Lentini et.al., 2005). Anyhow, increase of yield on agricultural areas planted with strategic crops is essentially approach of sustainable development. Importance of cultivar sellection for adoption to low soil quality and drought conditions has been investigated (Tubeileh et.al., 2004, Bhutta, 2007). Table 1.

Conclusions Bactrocera oleae is a regular pest of olive fruits in central Dalmacija, with different level of annually infestation. Besides abiotic factors, irrigated or dry growing conditions could increase or decrise B. oleae infestation in fruits. The results of investigation point at significantly higher intensity of fruit infestation by B. oleae in irrigated growing conditions. The difference in the intensity of infestation seems to be caused mainly by two different factors. External morphological characteristics of fruit surface, like fruit size and strenched exocarp, attract B. oleae females to prefere eggs oviposition in fruits from irrigated trees. Aditionaly, internal fruit characteristics with better nutritive endocarp values are more qualitative media for B. oleae larvae development. Further investigations should include resistance assesment of different cultivars to B. oleae and drought conditions. Such results would be of the great practical significance.

Neopulvinaria innumerabilis is a new insect species in Croatia. Mass outbreaks of P. corni were recorded in many vineyards in Panonian region of Croatia, while mass outbreaks of P. persicae and N. innumerabilis were recorded in Northern Adriatic region Istria. Mass outbreak of N. innumerabilis was recorded in Central Adriatic region as well. Different varieties of grapevine weren’t equally subservient to different species of scales of family Coccidae. Various intensity of scale insects infestation were recorded on grapevines on the same soil type. Keywords: Croatia, scale insects, distribution, variety of grapevine, soil type Introduction Grapevine is cultivated in all regions of Croatia. Depending on the region, different varieties of grapevine are grown. There are 198 different grapevine varieties registered. In Croatia there are 60 146 ha of vineyards. Croatian pedosphere is a natural “soil museum” with practically all soil types that exist in Europe, which means that land resources potentially include soils of high as well as low fertility (Bašić et al., 2007). Soil degradation process and extreme soil moisture regime in some Croatian regions cause problems similar to those in Carpatian Basin (Várallyay, 2006). Scale insects are one of the most important pests of grapevines. Except direct damages which they cause by their sap sucking, they cause many indirect damages which include producing honey dew and transmission of plant viruses. The most important viruses which scales transmit are Grapevine leaf roll virus -1 and -3 and Grapevine virus A (Martelli, 2004). One of the very important influence on mass outbreak of scales on grapevine is climate change. It is in accordance with the fact that climate change has big influence on food system (Dobó et al., 2006). The most important scales in Croatian vineyards are P. corni and P. persicae (Masten, 2007). In 2006 species N. innumerabilis was registered for the first time in Croatia (Masten and Seljak, 2006). Today N. innumerabilis became one of the most important scale insect in grapevine, along with P. corni and P. persicae. Materials and methods Survey of scale insects on different grapevine varieties and different types of soil was made in all 21 counties of Croatia in period 2005 - 2007. Infested plant material with scale insects was collected in the period from May to November. Visual inspection of grapevine plant material was performed with the help of magnification (10x). Samples of host plant material infested with the scale insects were put in plastic bags and the collection data for each was noted on a label (locality details, host plant, variety of grapevine, soil type, any damage symptoms, collectors name, samples number and</p><p id="Pg342">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1736 date). Samples for microscopic identification of scale insect species were collected on random and consisted of 10 leaves or one 15 cm stem or one fruit (Williams and Watson, 1990). Samples for counting the intensity of infestation were collected according randomized complete block design in 4 blocks and consisted of 25 leaves per block. In 1 block were 5 plants. 100 leaves per grapevine variety and locality were collected. Slide mounting was carried out according to methods of Williams and Watson (1990). Microscopic identification on the base of morphological characteristics was performed according to keys by: Gill (1988), Hamon and Williams (1984), Kosztarab and Kozar (1988) and Williams and Watson (1990). Results of the intensity of the scale insects infestation on different varieties of grapevine and different soil types were processed in statistical program ARM and were ranged by Duncan's multiple range test (P=.05). Intensities of infestation were classified according to range: 1-5 scale larvae per leaf = very low infestation (VLI) 6-20 scale larvae per leaf = low infestation (LI) 21-50 scale larvae per leaf = moderate infestation (MI) 51-250 scale larvae per leaf = high infestation (HI) &gt;250 scale larvae per leaf = very high infestation (VHI) Localities of findings are marked according UTM military grid (Horvat et al., 2003). Results and discussion During three year investigation of scale insects, in Croatian vineyards were identified: Parthenolecanium corni, Parthenolecanium persicae, Neopulvinaria innumerabilis, Pulvinaria vitis and Planococcus ficus. P. corni and P.vitis were present mostly in Panonian region of Croatia. P. persicae and N. innumerabilis were recorded in Northern and Central Adriatic region. P. ficus was present in Panonian and Adriatic region of Croatia. High infestation of P. vitis and P. ficus were noticed sporadically on some vines while mass outbreaks of P. corni, P. persicae and N. innumerabilis were spread in whole vineyards. Distribution of P. corni, P. persicae and N. innumerabilis on grapevine in Croatia in period 2005 - 2007 according UTM military grid is showed in table 1. Intensity of infestation of P. corni, P. persicae and N. innumerabilis on different varieties of grapevine and different soil types assessed in investigation is presented in tables 2, 3 and 4. Results showed that the most subservient grapevine varieties to infestation of P. corni were Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Pinot gris and Muscat blanc. Less subservient to infestation of P. corni were Savignon blanc, Malvazija istarska, and Reisling italico. In some cases Reisling italico and Savignon blanc were almost resistant to infestation of P. corni. The most subservient grapevine varieties to infestation of P. persicae were Malvazija istarska, Merlot and Teran. Less subservient to infestation of P. persicae were Pinot blanc and almost resistant to P. persicae was Plavac. Very subservient grapevine varieties to infestation of N. innumerabilis were Malvazija istarska, Plavina and Debit. Results show that on the same type of soil, different intensity of infestation of scale insects was present. On Pseudogley, which was the most common soil type in investigation, we noticed intensity of infestation from</p><p id="Pg343">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1737 very low to very high. The same case was with Cambiosol Rhodic (Terra rossa) which is the most common soil type in Istria. Table 1.

The results of investigation point at significantly different intensity of infestation by P. corni, P. persicae and N. innumerabilis on different grapevine varieties. The differences in the intensity of infestation seem to be caused by different morphological characteristics of grapevine varieties and geographic position which is connected to the climate. The most subservient grapevine varieties to infestation of scale insects were Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Pinot gris, Muscat blanc, Malvazija istarska, Merlot, Teran, Plavina and Debit. There was no difference between white vine and red vine varieties. Both of them can be infested in very high intensity. Reisling italico, Savignon blanc and Plavac showed low or very low sensibility to the infestation of the scale insects. The results of investigation showed that on the same soil type, intensity of infestation can highly variate and does not depend on soil type.

As a result of an intensive need for land use (spreading of residential areas, greenfield investments etc.) the natural environment has been diminishing. On the other hand, the needs of society for intact areas have been increased more and more. The Gödöllő Hillside has a big environmental stress, because it is situated close to the Budapest agglomeration. Due to a change in land use, such as the new roads, lots of houses and ever shrinking agriculture and sylviculture, the spatial structure becomes more and more fragmented. The fragmented spatial structure and hillside relief enhance the soil and vegetation degradation. Keywords: habitat loss, soil degradation, vegetation degradation, land use change Introduction The Gödöllő Hillside was used as a royal pasture and a hunting area. It is a diverse land, thanks to the characteristics of landscape factors, since this is a transitory region. The area belongs to Northern Mountain Ranges (Marosi and Somogyi, 1990). The area of Gödöllő Hillside is 550 km2, and it consists of 16 settlements. The landscape’s height above sea level is between 130 and 344 m which reduces towards south east (Marosi and Somogyi, 1990). It is a transitory region between a plain terrain and that of mountain ranges of medium heights due to geological, climatic, botanical and soil features. This region is one of the most eroded landscapes in Hungary. Erosion risk assessments can help to reveal highly erodable spots (Gournellos et al., 2004; Evelpidou, 2006) to outline areas where more care is needed during land use. Soil erosion is especially intense in the northern part of the Gödöllő Hillside, on the Vácegres–Gödöllő–Pécel– Mende line. Channel erosion (e.g. around Isaszeg) and linear erosion (Láng, 1967; Jakab, 2006) is severe in this region. When we examine habitat loss and natural resource degradation, every data is important concerning soil, fauna and flora, especially when there are examinations of any relations between them (Halbritter et al., 2003; Szabó et al., 2007; Várallyay, 2006, 2007; Bádonyi, 2006; Balogh et al., 2006; Penksza et al., 2005; Deák and Keveiné Bárány, 2006; Csontos and Tamás, 2006; Barczi et al., 1997, 1999). The physical geography of the area The deep structure of Gödöllő Hillside is determined by Mesozoic blocks. The formation of today’s surface features can be reckoned from Upper-Pliocene. The climate of the area is intermediate (Láng, 1967). Duality can be seen between the northern and southern parts of the hillside. As a result of it, particular mesoclimate was formed in the region. The area has a thick valley pattern, but the valleys are dry or they transport wa-</p><p id="Pg346">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1740 ter temporarily. The region of the water races fluctuates, which is caused by permeable rocks (Láng, 1967). Most of the water races are polluted so the conservation of the water and the water quality are serious problems (Marosi and Somogyi, 1990). Materials and methods Based on the municipal data of the Hungarian Central Statistical Office I analysed the land use changes in the Gödöllő Hillside during the 19th-20th centuries. For the settlements’ delineation in the Gödöllő Hillside I used the landscape classification of Marosi and Somogyi (1990). I calculated relative indicators for five different years (1895, 1913, 1935, 1966 and 2000) and studied how the land use in general and especially the proportion of cultivated land has changed. From the results I could conclude on the degree of changes in certain cultivations. Results and discussion The share of agricultural areas in the studied region was gradually decreasing (by 31%) between 1895 and 2000. 35 000&lt; hectares were cultivated in 1895, and even 29 000 hectares after the 2nd World War. The most dramatic decrease of the cultivated land happened after the change of the political system in Hungary, when only 12 000 hectares remained. There are several reasons behind the above-mentioned significant decline: changes in land-ownership, declining agricultural production, decreasing number of employees working in agriculture. In the 1990’s the impact of suburbanisation became evident in the area of Gödöllő, as not only the residents but part of the industrial production of Budapest were moving out from the capital. Both residential and industrial suburbanisations are intense phenomenon in the area, and as a consequence, local municipalities have to parcel out new lands. Some of the settlements can do this only if they “reclassify” the plots (from outlying area to residential area). As a result, the proportion of cultivated areas and natural habitats is shrinking, while residential areas are spreading. Compared to the total utilised area, the share of cultivated land changed between 9-87% in 2000, this was the highest dispersion. Suburbanisation has the strongest effect in the settlements surrounding the capital, which can be easily detected in the change of population: increase in population was especially high in Veresegyház (103%), Kerepes (36%) and Mogyoród (64%). Besides the extension of residential areas, infrastructure of transportation (e.g. M3 motorways, ring around Budapest etc.) also requires space. Parallel to the shrinking agricultural land, land use structure has been transformed, which meant the change in the proportion of different forms of cultivation (arable land, orchard, vineyard, meadow and pasture) (Figure 1). Regarding the forms of land cultivation, during the 19th-20th centuries, the most significant variation happened in the case of arable land and forests. Forest areas have increased, while the territory of arable land has shrunk. At the moment, 50% (more than 13 000 hectares) of the cultivated land is covered by forests, which is above the national average. The most forested areas are in the central part of the hillside region, and arable lands are more common in the southern territories.</p><p id="Pg347">VII.

For the time being, 38% (about 10 000 hectares) of the hillside region is covered by arable land. The possibilities for arable farming are very much determined by the soil conditions in the region. The bedrock consists of loess, sand and their mixture in the majority of the area. The micro region’s dominant soils in the forests were and still are woodland soils. Besides the dominant woodland soils there are many intermediate sections in case of soils formed on loess and sandy loess and have been under crop for a long while. Meadow soils make up smaller, lower areas. Original soil profiles can be only found in small patches, due to the intense erosion. In most of the areas ’A’ horizons are totally eroded and in some cases ’B’ horizons have been worn down, too. The most vulnerable soils are those formed on loess parent material. On intensively cultivated lands loess is being exposed. 96 % of the hillside is covered by brown forest soils (Figure 2). 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Regosol Eroded Chernozem Brown earth Chernozem brown forest soil Meadow soil Soil types % Meadow-pasture Arable land Vineyard Orchard Forest Settlement Figure 2.

Cereal Research Communications 1742 Conclusions In terms of land use, significant changes happened during the 19th-20th centuries. The territory of cultivated land has considerably shrunk; large areas have been taken out of agricultural production. The main reasons for this were: extension of residential areas (spreading built-up areas, increasing population in the agglomeration), development of transport infrastructure (the building of roads and motorways) which all needed new land. Considering the individual types of land cultivation, a decreasing trend can be detected with minor variations (e.g. increasing area of orchards until the 1960-1970’s). Transformation was not only due to the economic processes, but the physical characteristics of the area, as erosion is quite intense especially in the southern, cultivated regions. The largest drop happened there, in the proportion of arable lands. Reference Balogh Á. - Nagy A. - Vona M. - Pottyondy Á. - Herczeg E. - Malatinszky Á. - Penksza K.: 2006.

Organic agriculture is a comprehensive system affecting all levels of sustainability by the integrated approach to production which draws on century old traditions and the latest best practice based on scientific results to work in balance with nature. Under organic conditions different plant types are successful than in conventional conditions. The offsprings of the composite crossing YQMS/H2 originating from diverse wheat parents evaluated in this paper produced segregating population, resulting in a wide diversity in characteristics examined. Composite cross populations (CCPs) can provide dynamic gene pools and may be an efficient way of providing heterogeneous crops and of selecting superior pure lines for low input systems characterized by unpredictable stress conditions Keywords: winter wheat, composite cross population, low input conditions, organic agriculture Introduction Many farming systems claim to be sustainable, but offer only partial solutions, while organic agriculture is a comprehensive system affecting all levels of sustainability by the integrated approach to production which draws on century old traditions and the latest best practice based on scientific results to work in balance with nature. Currently more than 31 million has of farmland are under organic management worldwide (Willer et al., 2006). Nowadays it is commonly accepted that we need a more efficient utilization of the natural resources, in particular soil productivity (Várallyay, 2007). Important in this respect is the rational land use and cropping pattern, especially plant nutrition and plant protection technologies. In Hungary agriculture is living on the residues of previous P and K applications since 1990, but this reserves are becoming smaller and smaller (Kádár, 2007). Organic farming depends currently on plant varieties that have been bred for nonorganic farming and that are often not suited to organic production. This position is inconsistent with a holistic approach to organic agriculture (Phillips and Wolfe, 2005). Heritable variation is at the heart of the process of evolution. However, variation is restricted in breeding for uniform crop populations using the pedigree line approach. Pedigree lines are successful in agriculture because synthetic inputs are used to raise fertility and control weeds, pests and diseases (Maric et al., 2007; Bede et al., 2007). There are new efforts to reduce the amounts of synthetic inputs to crops due to high prices and concern over the detrimental environmental impacts these inputs can have (Baric et al., 2007). An alternative method, promoted for exploring the value of variation and evolutionary fitness in crops, is to create composite cross populations (Wolfe, 2005). The value of composite cross populations is dependent on the outcome of mass trials by artificial and natural selection acting upon the heterogeneous mixture. The history of the Hungarian organic agriculture is only two decades long (Markó and Popp, 2006) and organic plant breeding was first initiated in 1999 (Kovács, 2007) under organic conditions at various ecological regions in the country.</p><p id="Pg350">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1744 The aim of the present study was to evaluate the variability of the offsprings of a composite cross populations in low input conditions. Materials and methods The study was conducted at the University of Pannonia Georgikon Faculty, Keszthely during 2006-2007. Seeds of 100 ear originating from the composite cross population YQMS which was established at the Elm Farm Research Center, and containes 21 parents (winter wheat varieties) and 2 male sterile lines. The population was multiplied for two year in Hungary (ARI HAS) under certified organic farming conditions. The ears were isolated from F6 generations from the already adapted YQMS/H2 population. The seeds of an ear were sown in one row, each ear representing a different genotype. Row space was 30 cm. The soil of the experimental site is a lessivated brown forest soil with low organic material, medium K- and P content. The previous crop was rape and the soil was not fertilized after rape. Sowing (13th of Oct.) and harvest (8th of July) was made with hand. Characteristics important from viewpoint of organic production were examined: the number of plants/row in autumn and in spring, time of flowering, number of tillers, plant height, lodging, above ground biomass, ear length, thousand grain weight, number of kernels, grain yield and the frequency of plant diseases. Results and discussion The number of plants/row was evaluated in autumn (27th of Nov.) and in spring (29th of March). From the difference in the number of plants at the two surveys we can estimate the ability for overwintering. There was no difference in the number of plants in 26 rows of the 100, while in the others the number of plants decreased with 1-13 per row. An important quality of a wheat for organic and low-input systems is weed suppression. Successful competition against weeds comprises a suite of individual characteristics: besides overwintering and fast early growing (Figure 1) other traits such as good tillering ability, strong stems, at least medium height and non-erect, broad leaves, the ability to cover soil determines the competitive ability of genotype against weeds.

That is what we have found: early summer of 2007 was rather rainy and windy, so advantageous in quantifying stem stability and the inclination of genotypes to lodging. Some rows, those which have shown lush early growth were totally lodged (row: 1., 3., 25., 45., 47) and 11 further rows (2., 4., 5., 6., 21., 22., 23., 24., 46., 68., 82) were lodged more than 50% (Figure 2). So because of lodging thriftiest growing genotypes are desirable. Similarly, plant height positively influences competition against weeds (Haigh et al., 2007) and is advantageous from point of nutrient acquisition because of the well known positive correlation between plant height and rooting depth, but is unfavourable regarding lodging. Plant height showed high variability, too, it was found between 520- and 1380 mm (data not shown). Figure 2. Lodging expressed in % of the plot.

Thousand grain weight, number of seed/ear and yield/plant were measured to evaluate the potential of the line to yield. Thousand grain weight (TGW) was found between 11,04 and 57,69 g (row 86 and 88, respectively, Figure 3) and the grain yield/plant changed from 12,3 g to 57,4 g showing a wide variability in this characters. Conclusions Wheat breeding programs are going to be directed toward sustainable agriculture with special emphasis on low input and organic varieties. Increasing genetic diversity within a crop can improve stability (Haigh et al., 2007.). Under organic conditions different plant types are successful than in conventional conditions (Kovács, 2007). The offsprings of the composite crossing YQMS/H2 originating from diverse wheat parents evaluated in this paper produced segregating population, resulting in a wide diversity in characteristics examined. CCPs can provide dynamic gene pools and may be an efficient way of providing heterogeneous crops and of selecting superior pure lines for low input systems characterized by unpredictable stress conditions (Wolfe, 2005). Further work is needed to continue to assess the CCPs in the field and quantify the changes that are taking place in characters most important from point of organic and low input crop production.

A. Hlinku 2, 949 76, Nitra, Slovakia, e-mail: jana.repkova@uniag.sk Abstract: Productivity of barley canopy like other plant ecosystems is depended on photosynthesis, which as a key process of biomass production, is very sensitive to environmental stress conditions. The results show that leaves located in different parts of canopy were characterized by diverse sensitivity to stress. We recorded more rapid loss of leaf water content in lower situated dehydrated leaves in compare with upper canopy leaves that result in decrease of stomatal conductance and reducing of carbon assimilation. Tendency of performance index, a fluorescence parameter, was similar. Dehydration of lower located stressed leaves cut down performance index already at mild stress conditions. Keywords: barley, drought stress, photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, chlorophyll fluorescence Introduction In the field conditions plants are often exposed to various environmental stresses. Usually several stress factors act simultaneously on the plant, such as combined water deficit, strong light and high temperature. At the whole-plant and canopy level, the effect of drought stress is usually perceived as a decrease in photosynthesis and growth (Balla et al. 2006). It is commonly assumed that drought-induced decreases in photosynthesis are due primarily to stomatal closure, which decrease CO2 availability in the mesophyll. Stomatal response is probably the most important factor controlling carbon assimilation during drought (Tardieu, Davies 1993; Olšovská, Brestič 2001). Whereas the mild deficit induces stomatal closure, long- term water stress leads to stomatal and non- stomatal limitation of photosynthesis of plants grown in field conditions (Chaves et al. 2002). In spite of relative resistance of primary photochemistry to water stress (Lu, Zhang 1999), parameters of fast chlorophyll a fluorescence transient are available to evaluate changes of energy transfer on photosystem level, so they are considered as a good tool for indication of stress induced impairment of plants (Strasser et al. 2000; Repková, Brestič 2007; Živčák et al. 2008). The aim of our experiments was assessment of barley leaves vulnerability in water deficit conditions. Applying by gas-exchange and fluorescence methods we monitored responses of photosynthetic apparatus of different parts of canopy leaves during simulated drought stress. Materials and methods Barley plants (Hordeum vulgare L.) were grown in plastic pots with soil substrate in the natural environment conditions. After anthesis some plants were exposed to slowly developing water stress induced by restricted irrigation; some of them were remained as control variant with full irrigation. Water status was determined by relative water content (RWC) of the 7th and 6th mature leaves, calculated from equation RWC (%) = (WF – WD) / (WS – WD) * 100, where WF is fresh weight of leaf segment, WS – weight of leaf segment after saturation by water, WD – dry mass of leaf segment. Simultaneously with RWC water potential was</p><p id="Pg354">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1748 measured by psychrometric method using microvolmeter Wescor HR-33 (w, MPa) with measuring chamber C-52 (Wescor, Logan, USA). The activity of photosynthetic processes was determined as CO2 assimilation rate measurement using an open gas-exchange system (Ciras-2, PP-Systems, Norfolk, UK). The CO2 concentration inside the chamber was 370 mol.mol -1 and the light of 900 mol.m-2.s-1 comes from artificial light source (PP- Systems). Stomatal conductance of abaxial and adaxial leaf side was measured by a porometer Delta-T AP4 (Delta-T Devices, UK). The polyphasic rise transient (OJIP) was measured by a Plant Efficient Analyser (Hansatech Instruments, Norfolk, England) according to Strasser et al. (1995). The transients were induced by red light pulse of 3500 mol.m-2.s-1 for 1s flash. All samples were dark-adapted for 30 min prior to fluorescence measurements. Results and discussion Drought is the phenomenon of the recent last years that affects plant production in different extent. In our experiment with spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) we studied effect of water deficit on the physiological processes of canopy leaves. Water stress was induced gradually, by withholding water. During this time the relative water content in leaves (RWC, %) was fall down (Figure 1). We observed decline of RWC to 83% for 6th stressed leaves on the 4th day of dehydration although for 7th stressed leaves was RWC constantly higher.

Stomatal closure is the one of the most important mechanisms in regulation of water regime of plants, although on the other side, it could cause a restriction of CO2 supply to leaf mesophyll and limitate the carbon assimilation. In response to increasing water deficit decrease of stomatal conductance was measured (Figure 2). In response to fast decline of RWC of 6th leaves, stomatal conductance fell down and on the 5th day of dehydration were stomata fully closed.

Cereal Research Communications 1750 The chlorophyll a fluorescence transient as a rich and complete signal offers a number of parameters to characterized energy transfer across the photosystem. One of them, Performance index (P.I.), as presented Živčák et al. (2008) is suitable tool for assessment of efficiency of photochemistry machinery in drought conditions. In spite of general accepted knowledge that water deficit had no or minimal effect on polyphasic fluorescence transient and typical fluorescence parameters as Fv/Fm till the severe stress conditions, we observed changes of P.I. early after dehydration was started. For both measured stressed leaves P.I. had decreasing tendency. The first decline is measured when RWC of 6th stressed leaves fallen down to 80%. In fact, summarily decrease of P.I. for 6th leaves was from 2.3 at the beginning to 1.7. Upper leaves (7th) showed lower sensitivity to water loss - P.I. was reduced after RWC of leaves fell down to 75%, even though the trend of decline was similar as for 6th leaves. Conclusions Results of our experiments show that leaves located in different parts of canopy were characterized by diverse sensitivity and vulnerability to environmental stress. In fact leaves situated in lower canopy parts could play an important role in stress signalization processes.

Research was realized in experimental locality in Milhostov. Experimenal locality is situated in central part of the East-Slovakian Lowland and has continental climate. Two methods of soil tillage (conventional tillage and no-tillage) were examined. From hydrophysical and physical soil properties were determined as follows: bulk density (d, kg.m -3 ), maximum capillary capacity (MKK, %), available water capacity (P, %) and average soil water supply (WØ, mm). In average during years 2000 – 2007 bulk density was higher only about 9 kg.m -3 (0.61 %) at no-tillage system in comparison to conventional tillage. At no-tillage system average values maximum capillary capacity nonsignificantly decreased about 0.55 % and available water capacity decreased about 1.15 % in comparison to conventional tillage. The effect of soil tillage technology on soil bulk density, maximum capillary porosity and available water capacity of Gleyic Fluvisol topsoil is less important than effect of experimental year. There was not observed significant effect of tillage practise on soil water supply in depth 0.0 – 0.3 m. Keywords: heavy soil, physical properties, soil tillage, moisture regime Introduction For the East-Slovakian Lowland high presence of heavy soil with high content of clay elements is chracteristic. Heavy Gleyic Fluvisols, Mollic Gleysols, Planosols and Gleysols are situated till on 65 % of arable land acreage of the East-Slovakian Lowland and soil types and soil textures alternate on short distances. Different sustainable systems of husbandry on soil with various soil protective technologies are frequently studied. Economic preassures on decreasing of inputs to production process and also requirements on keeping soil fertility have very strong effect on surface expansion of these technologies. In spite of the fact, that for Slovak Republic conventional tillage with ploughing is typical, each time frequently soil protective technologies are used in plant production. Some aspects of effect of different soil tillage on its properties were published by Kováč – Švančárková (2003), Dam et al. (2006), Kotorová (2007), Mati – Kotorová (2007). The effect of various soil tillage practice on water supply in soil profile studied Mati et al. (2004), Lacová – Štekauerová (2007) and Nagy et al. (2007). The aim of this work was valued effect of different soil tillage on changes of physical soil properties and soil water supply of heavy soils. Materials and methods In years 2000 – 2007 the field experiments with different soil tillage were carried out on Gleyic Fluvisol. The experimental locality Milhostov is situated in central part of the East-Slovakian Lowland and has continental climate. Gleyic Fluvisol was formed on heavy alluvial sediments by long-time impact of groundwater and surface water. The topsoil has lump aggregate structure with high binding ability and in whole profile it is heavy permeabled. In depth 0.7 – 0.8 m of soil profile coherent layer of dark grey till yellow grey clay is found. Gleyic Fluvisol on experimental site by Novák classification scale (Hraško et al., 1962) is characterized as</p><p id="Pg358">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1752 heavy, clayey-loamy soil with content of clay particles (I. category  0.01 mm) 47.75 %. Granulometric composition of experimental site is shown in Table 1. The field crops were arranged into crop rotation: grain maize – faba bean – winter wheat – soybean – winter wheat – grain maize – spring barley – soybean consist of ten sites. In field experiment two tillage technologies of Gleyic Fluvisol – conventional tillage (CT) and direct sowing without ploughing (NT) – were examined. Conventional tillage consists of current agrotechnics operations: stubble ploughing, ploughing, smoothing, harrowing, sowing. No-tillage system use direct sowing without ploughing by sowing machine Great Plains.

Sampling was carried out by sampling cylinders of 100 cm3 volume of Kopecky method at topsoil to depth 0.0 – 0.3 m from each 0.1 m (with four replications). Soil bulk density and maximum capillary capacity were determined as it described Kobza et al. (1999). Wilting point (V) was calculated according to method of Solnář (Kutílek, 1978). Available water capacity (P) was determined as the difference between maximum capillary capacity (MKK), (its value can characterize field water capacity PK) and wilting point (Hraško et al., 1962). Soil samples for water supply determination were taken from profile 0.0 – 0.3 m from each 0.1 m. Sampling was made each two weeks. Sum of precipitation and air temperature were taken from meteorological station of Slovak Hydrometeorological Institute, in Milhostov. Results and discussion Annual sum of precipitation in years 2000 – 2007 were in range 490 – 655 mm. From point of view of sum of precipitation observed years 2000 – 2007 are characterized as dry till humid. But from point of view of average annual air temperature are these years characterized as normal or very warm.

The experiment was performed under outdoor conditions, applying organic method with soil covering (woven PP foil). One-time harvest was done. The total yield, the quality and the ripening grade of the varieties was evaluated. The results confirm that the tomato-shaped pepper varieties could be safely grown under open field conditions. Varieties could be grown under non-conventional (organic) growing circumstances. Large differences were found between the varieties in yielding, quality and the distribution of maturation grading. The best results were obtained for varieties Vitamin, Pritavit and Pasa. Keywords: pepper, Capsicum annuum, tomato-shaped pepper, organic farming, soil covering Introduction Pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) is one of the most widespread vegetable crops in the world (Csilléry, 2006; Taller, 2006). The spice pepper is a major flavour determinant of the Hungarian cuisine and the sweet pepper became an everyday-used vegetable (Gémes Juhász et al., 2006; Csöndes et al., 2007). The tomato-shaped sweet pepper varieties are grown in a relatively limited region. Due to their excellent flavour, they are processed by food industry, as well as being sold for fresh consumption (Csilléry, 2006). There is a worldwide demand for reducing chemical applications and introducing sustainable development. The growers have to use limited amounts of chemicals and environmentally-safe and sound methods (Németh, 2006). The rational use of soils and ecosystems is also an important element of sustainable development (Várallyay, 2006a; Várallyay, 2006b; Kanižai et al., 2007). In the age of accelerated globalization the small farms are forced to look for alternative activities to ensure their survival (Paksi et al., 2007). One possibility is to produce pepper organically. The production of healthy, disease-free peppers has a special importance (Zatykó, 2006), and the demand for healthy food turns public attention to organic farming (Takács, 2007). Growers, practising organic farming, produce their goods without application of synthetic chemicals and fertilizers, utilizing the advantages of the natural environment and those of the natural productivity of the soil (Kis, 2006). The organic farming could achieve even better quality parameters than other management systems (Daood et al., 2006). The real water loss (ET) is the sum of soil evaporation and the transpiration of plants. The value of ET mostly depends on climatological, and soil conditions as well as on plant factors (Ács et al., 2007; Horváth et al., 2006). The soil covering reduces the ET value, and keeps the soil moisture. In addition, soil mulching has also several advantages. Our aim was to evaluate the total yield, the quality and the ripening grade of 8 tomatoshaped pepper varieties which were grown organically using a soil covering method.</p><p id="Pg362">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1756 Materials and methods The trial was performed in 2006 in Debrecen, at the experimental plantation of the Department of Horticultural Science and Plant Biotechnology with the following varieties: Olympia, Greygo, Piknik, Turbán, Pasa, Gogosári, Vitamin and Pritavit. The sowing date was 24 March 2006. The seedlings were transplanted to open field on 1 June 2006. The applied distance between twin rows was 60 + 30 cm. The distance between plants was 30 cm in each row. Each variety was transplanted in separated plots. The plant number was 160 for each variety and each plot. Total soil covering was applied with black woven PP plastic foils (geotextile). Drip irrigation system was used during the season. The plant nutrition supply and the plant protection were performed according to organic farming guidelines. One-time harvest was done on 11 October 2006. For each variety 20 plants were sampled and all fruits were picked. Fruits were divided into 3 main groups: fully ripened (red), in the stage of ripening (redish-green, turning), and green maturity (green). All main groups had 2 sub-groups: the first consisted of the marketable and the other the unmarketable fruits. Most unmarketable fruits were diseased, others were overripened or sunscalded. The total number and the mean weight of the fruits were measured. ANOVA was performed and significant differences were determined with LSD t-test at 5 % level. Results and discussion There were large significant differences among the varieties (Table 1). The aim of the trial was to find the highest fully ripened varieties; therefore, the evaluation focused on the red (fully ripened) marketable fruits. Two and a half times differences were found in the yield among the varieties. Variety Vitamin yielded the highest marketable red fruit. Acceptable yield was also found for varieties Pritavit and Pasa. The yield of varieties Gogosári and Olympia was moderate, and varieties Greygo, Piknik and Turbán gave the lowest yield. Table 1.

The average fruit weight, the yield safety and the dynamics of maturing were also favourable for this variety. Acceptable results were obtained for varieties Pritavit and Pasa. The disadvantageous feature of variety Pritavit was the unmarketable quantity of the yield, while for variety Pasa it was the proportion of turning fruits. For the former, the yield safety and for the latter, the dynamics of the maturing was unfavourable. Moderate yield was obtained for varieties Gogosári, Olympia and Greygo. Variety Olympia showed the best dynamics of maturing and the best yield safety. But this variety was one of the worst yielding varieties and gave small-sized fruits.</p><p id="Pg364">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1758 The weakest yield was obtained for varieties Piknik and Turbán. Both varieties gave the lowest amount of red marketable fruits. In addition to this, their dynamics of maturing and yield safety were also disadvantageous. The smallest average fruit weight was shown by variety Turbán, but the largest fruit size was obtained for variety Piknik. Conclusions The results confirm that all tested tomato-shaped pepper varieties are suitable for outdoor production. Varieties could be grown under non-conventional (organic) growing circumstances. In our study, varieties Vitamin, Pritavit and Pasa showed the best results on yield and ripening characteristics of pepper fruit.

This is the first paper presenting total antioxidant capacity of pepper measured by PHOTOCHEM R chemiluminometer and evaluating hybrids and their parental lines. Total water-soluble-antioxidant capacity (ACW) and total lipidsoluble-antioxidant capacity (ACL) of pepper lines having three different fruit type as blocky, tomato-shaped and kapia were expressed outstanding variation. Tomato-shaped parental line proved the most remarkably rich in antioxidant capacity measured by both methods. It seems one of the traditional Hungarian pepper types, tomato-shaped pepper, has very precious compounds which could display protective effect against free radicals. Keywords: antioxidant capacity, Photochem, pepper, Capsicum annuum Introduction As a result of the increased level of environment pollution there is now an increasing risk of disturbance of the prooxidant-antioxidant balance in the human body. Among the protective mechanisms against free radicals as antioxidant vitamins; vitamin C, vitamin E and ß-carotene are of special interest (Sies, 1991). Carotenoid and other antioxidant content of spice red pepper (paprika) was investigated several works in Hungary and was proved as a significantly reach source of antioxidant materials (Daood et al., 1996; Daood et al., 2006). Nevertheless sweet pepper, classified as Capsicum annuum L. var. grossum highly diversified in types had been declared as having high antioxidant content too (Simmone et al., 1997). Special types of sweet peppers as tomato-shaped and kapia traditionally consumed in fully ripened stage in national cuisines around Middle-East Europe. Tomato-shaped pepper was reminded to a ripened tomato with thick flesh, red colour and sweet taste. Kapia type pepper had conical shape with mildly less thick wall but more thick skin on it. Tomato-shaped varieties due to their excellent flavour are processed by the frozen food industry, as well as being sold for fresh consumption. The kapia varieties are the best-known type in the Balkans and have become popular in recent years in Western Europe (Csilléry, 2006). Breeders of commercial F1 hybrids have no information on the extent of heterosis manifested in the combinations, since the mean value of the combination is never compared with that of the parents. One of the main variety value of pepper hybrids is special consumption and production traits resulting quality (Zatykó, 2006). Antioxidant capacity being one of the most special and valuable quality traits of pepper would be of high importance in hybrid development in the near future (Holb, 2005; Zatykó, 2006). Breeders have to be informed about quantity and quality traits of antioxidant compounds manifested in sources representing different fruit types as to plan reasonable breeding scheme.</p><p id="Pg366">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1760 The aim of this paper is to demonstrate a part of three year work on comparing antioxidant capacity of red sweet pepper types including hybrids and their parental lines. Materials and methods Tomato-shaped hybrid (P-F1) is based on a cross of tomato-shaped male (P-M) and blocky type female (P-F). Kapia hybrid (K-F1) was a first generation of two kapia type parents (K-M and K-F). The plants were grown under outdoor conditions and drip irrigation system was applied. Randomly harvested fruits at fully ripened stage of two hybrids and their parental lines were involved into measurement trials. The fresh plant samples were lyophilised by a freeze-dryer (Alpha 1-4 LSC lyophilisator) for 24 hours. 25 mg dried sample was extracted with 1 ml of reagent grade methanol (ACL) or water (ACW) for 1 minute with vortex (Biovortex V1). The extracts were centrifuged with ultracentrifuge (Sigma, Sartorius 4-16) for 5 minutes at 10,000 rpm. The upper clear phase was collected and used for the measurement. In our present study, we performed a quick test of the antioxidant capacity of different pepper lines by a PHOTOCHEMR instrument (Analytic Jena AG, Germany). The instrument can measure both the total water-solubleantioxidant capacity (ACW method) and the total lipid-soluble-antioxidant capacity (ACL method). The main feature of the photosensibilized chemiluminescence (PLC) measuring method is to combine the simple and reliable photochemical generation of free radicals with their very sensitive chemiluminometric detection. Comparing to standard conditions, the oxidative reaction is accelerated by a factor of 1000. This result in a reduction in measuring time by a factor of 10-1000 compared to other methods. Results and discussion Both type of antioxidant capacity of red sweet pepper (ACW, ACL) measured by PHOTOCHEMR showed outstanding differences by fruit types and lines. Ascorbic acid content of parental lines and hybrids ranged from 133.38 mg 100g-1 (K-F) to 235.44 mg 100g -1 (P-F1), that proved outstandingly high (Figure 1). 0 50 100 150 200 250 P-F1 P-M P-F K-F1 K-M K-F A s c o rb ic a c id ( m g /1 0 0 g ) Figure 1.

Tomato-shaped parental line proved the most remarkably rich in antioxidant capacity measured by both methods. HPLC separation of that carotenoids demonstrated that tomato-shaped pepper had very widescale compounds and is highly suitable for healthcare-conscious vegetable consumption. Further investigation of antioxidant capacity of special red sweet pepper type is recommended.

Strossmayer in Osijek, Trg Sv. Trojstva 3, 31000 Osijek, Croatia, e-mail: kzmaic@pfos.hr Abstract: This paper presents a methodology for a development of agricultural production on family farms in the Vukovar-Srijem County that aims to synchronize the sustainable environment criterion with the criterion of economic competitiveness by introducing Multicriteria Decision Theory. Comparative sustainability is evaluated on two different farms. One of them is conventional and the other is ecological production system. With the results obtained it is able to conclude that an ecological production system is reconciled with stability, adaptability, equity and autonomy growth, while on the other hand ecological production system have less productivity than conventional production system. Keywords: production structure, economic efficiency, sustainability, Multicriteria Decision Theory Introduction The development of agricultural production on family farms in the Vukovar-Srijem County faces double and also contradictory challenges. Since production and economic life of agriculture is a dynamic process that happens in time, it is necessary to structure such a model which will be able to present these processes realistically. On one hand, the invested capital should be profitable with maximized economic efficiency, and on the other hand there is the socio-ecological environment – i.e. preserving and protecting natural resources in the environment by means of a sustainable development. In order to respond to such challenges it is necessary to use adequate inputs and adjust them to the technologies used, without jeopardizing the food safety standards expected by the society. To reach the ecological sustainability it must be the reach or at least it must be converged to the economic sustained situation. For this reason – according to the mains stream at the economic growth theories – is the aim to attain the „steady state“ position (Vasary et al., 2007). Unfortunately, most of the existing conventional family farms in the Vukovar-Srijem County do not achieve these goals, whereas some of the ecological farms are trying to achieve at least one of these goals. We will therefore present a model which has the purpose of synchronizing the sustainable environment criterion with the criterion of economic competitiveness by introducing Multicriteria Decision Theory (MDT). For this reason, one of the primary problems in constructing and building a model for long term projection of sustainable development is including the process of change of all factors into the model, i.e. making a production-economic model which will present the process of interdependence of change of all production factors in a production system. Materials and methods The research of economic possibilities and evaluation of results achieved by the surveyed family farms in the Vukovar-Srijem County by application of conventional and ecological type of production have been marked and compared by determining optimal production structure by means of the simplex method and MDT. The</p><p id="Pg370">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1764 application of said methods enables, from the normative standpoint, defining production which will enable a compromise between conventional and ecological model, i.e. present the maximum of economic efficiency on ecological farms. The fact is that basic principles of the two mentioned factors are in a close connection with sustainable development, since sustaining agricultural activity is possible and desirable for economical sustainability of a farm as long as it is competitive. The research of economic efficiency of production on conventional and ecological farms is based on the mathematical model of the simplex method which formulates the procedure of planning and optimizing in the following way: max! 1    jx n j jcZ with limitation of factors: ),...,3,2,1( 1 mibxa ij n j ij   provided that the changes in the model cannot be less than zero : ),...,3,2,1( njx j  Preparation for planning on a farm follows simultaneously economic and environmental goals that are set in the paradigm of MDT, and are built in through the capacities of the production factors, their inputs and outputs of the individual production systems. Results and discussion Agriculture is the most important activity in Vukovar-Srijem County with a dominant role in the total economic structure. The majority of the population makes their living in agriculture, which has a development basis in improved soil that is, thanks to its very high soil bonitet, rightfully said to be agricultural soil of the highest quality in the Republic of Croatia. Agricultural area takes up 150.856 ha or 61,8% of the total County area, 93% of that is used for plowfields and gardens, whereas the remaining 7% are pasture grounds, meadows, vineyards and orchards. 50% of the agricultural area is privately owned, and the rest of what was once a part of the former social sector is now owned by the State. Agricultural production is oriented on traditional agricultural crops such as wheat, corn, sugar-beet, soybean, sunflower and barley, whereas cattle production mostly turns to pig and cow breeding. Drawing up the starting programme for identifying optimal production structure on the surveyed conventional and ecological farms comes down to transferring economic input-output parameters to a mathematical model of simplex method by using multiobjectivity, i.e. methods of independent evaluation and compromise programming. In the structure of agricultural production wheat, barley, sunflower, soybean and sugar-beet are meant to be the main crops produced both in conventional and ecological production systems. Coefficients of economic functions with a positive sign represent Gross Value Added (GVA), whereas coefficients of labour cost and energy cost have a negative sign. This kind of methodology enables speedy convergence of efficiency for as long as the number of aims/goals is under two (Romero and Reham, 1989). Therefore we have used two basic goals – maximizing GVA and minimizing energy costs. Survival of a farm requires significant monetary influence through active participation in the market, i.e. through</p><p id="Pg371">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1765 sales. That way the model begins from the point of view of maximizing GVA which has been formed into a linear parity or disparity.

The total maximum economic result of the surveyed farms is expressed in GVA which represents the sum of GVAs in individual production lines less the labour costs. Economic success of both the farm model I and model II depends on the achieved market value and level of external variable costs. As a result of favourable natural conditions and application of modern technology the farm using the conventional production system made a profit of 7.856 €, i.e. 157.12 € for each hectare of area. Transferring to the alternative ecological production system, which means abandoning of chemicals, or their reduced application in farming, resulted in significant decrease of the financial result by 11.6%, i.e. 138.94 € for each hectare of area.</p><p id="Pg372">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Conclusions In this paper farm planning methodology is proposed in order to reconcile criterion of environmental sustainability with economic competitiveness by employing the Multicriteria Decision Theory. Comparative sustainability is evaluated on two different farms. One of them is conventional and the other is ecological production system. With the results obtained it is able to conclude that an ecological production system is reconciled with stability, adaptability, equity and autonomy growth, while on the other hand ecological production system have less productivity than conventional production system.

Land use policy should build on the agreed principles of European environmental and health policies and the principles of sustainable development and should be developed with transparent and inclusive approaches to assessments, planning and decision-making. The implementation of this policy should be based on the principle of new economy: Keywords: New Economy, sustainable land use Introduction The value definition of the New Economy is strikingly different from the traditional one. In traditional sense value is the amount of money buyers are willing to pay for whatever the producer is supplying (Porter, 1985). Amit and Zott (2000) serve us with a substitutive value definition, prepared especially for New Economy organisations. In their sense, value refers to the total value created in business transactions regardless of whether the farmer, the consumer or any other party, - like local community, network co-members, or the environment itself, - is the beneficiary. In New Economy the four traditional P’s of the marketing mix (product, place price, promotion), are added other two P’s. First is process, meaning how commodities are produced. The second is the professionalism of participants assisting the process. (Hui and Chau, 2002). The sources of value creation in the New Economy Novelty is declared to belong to a farm’s value creating potential. In traditional farms new commodities, new market segments or new methods of production, distribution or marketing are the possible sources of new value created. In the New Economy first movers have the possibility to set new standards and through this establish large communities or strong brands. New Economy added the possibility of restructuring transactions. Networks may integrate several elements of the value chain, and so create products, with more added values. Efficiency in the New Economy suggests that with the increase of efficiency the average costs per data processing decrease. Efficiency not only means quicker and cheaper but simpler processes bundled together into streamlined supply chains. With the use of the Internet the information became more symmetric lowering the search costs and extending the trustworthiness of the transaction. With new information technologies not only data processing, but adaptability studies and farming protocols are also easy to construct. Precision Agriculture and sustainable land use Though the term New Economy was classified for companies (p)reacting to turbulent environmental changes, precision farming is a good example for New Economy.</p><p id="Pg374">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1768 Knowledge is basic in sustainable land use László et al. (2006), Juhász et al. (2007). The whole system is based on the preconception, that further and more adequate information on soil, weather, crops, fertilisers, pesticides, herbicides and their correlation facilitate more effective and more environment-friendly farming. The knowledge in sustainable land use has increasing return to scale. The more farmer’s knowledge is accumulated the more successful will the sustainable land use system operate. Precision Agriculture and sustainable land use are based on information Neményi, Milics (2007), Németh et al. (2007). This information has to be gathered, evaluated, analysed and disseminated. As a result sustainable land use is an IT intensive technology. Because of the average Hungarian farm sizes, individual farms are not able to establish sustainable land use systems. This way New Economy is also inevitable for the communication among farmers. The costs of sustainable land use technology make the tighter or looser association of small and medium sized Hungarian farms inevitable. Network effect stands for the value added by more and more members joining the network. However these connections provide numerous advantages additional to financial benefits (Kogut, 1988). Not only the membership in itself creates new economic value (mainly for the customer), but the positive feedback-loop as well. The system is the source of data and information. Knowledge is created by farmers or in research centres, but the real value is created by their interactions. In sustainable land use two types of networks can be formed: (i) peer to peer and (ii) hub and spoke. In case of peer to peer arrangement all parties are equal. Their interests are common and they come to decisions collectively. According to Woods (2001) this is the ideal form of a network, because it is constituted spontaneously, out of farms of the same size and economic power without fear or favour. Though peer to peer networks are the best places for knowledge dissemination and generation, they arise very rarely and predominantly in the United States. Thanks to their economical rationality, hub and spoke networks are quite frequent despite their suboptimal knowledge creating function. The centre of the hub and spoke network is a New Economy actor, who is connected to peripheral members by various kinds of business relations. The member farms are legally autonomous, but the central actor has the right/task of representation, negotiating and contracting. This way, the central actor is practically empowered to decide alone in many situations. Contrarily to traditional supply system models, the distinctive feature of hub and spoke networks is that, peripheral farms may connect to each other directly, excluding the central actor. Therefore it is not only an outsourcing relation between the central actor and the peripheral farms, but the central actor provides other members context, by supplying, information, knowledge, infrastructure and technology. The number of farms in sustainable land use is very limited. Therefore self arranging peer to peer networks are not really probable. However the possibility is given to set up hub and spoke network for sustainable land use. Initiatives may be established by the government, analogue to what happened in China (Wang, 1999). Since the economic performance of the Hungarian state is relatively low, the probability of a government initiative is minimal. Still, the state can take its part by establishing and/or supporting</p><p id="Pg375">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1769 specific research centres. Moreover, these research centres may take the part of the central actor as well. In cases, when universities or research institutions play central part in a hub and spoke network, the system realises informational, knowledge and environmentally based advantages rather than financial ones. A large, economically powerful organisation may also emerge as the central actor. By the gathering and dissemination of knowledge, it could realize economies of scope, and with the improved utilization of infrastructure economies of scale. Taking up the role of a mentor it could gather farmers susceptible to change and so wider strengthen its relative economic power. Applicability It is a duty on all land–users to prevent or minimise harm to soils and reduce the risks relating to soil erosion, organic matter decline, compaction, salinisation, and landslides, by identifying risk areas, and deciding on a programme of measures to address these risks. In many western countries environmental aspects are strongly controlled, and the EU is also planning to introduce such measurements. It is time for Hungarian farmers to act as well. The question is: Why Hungarian farms do not establish networks? Sustainable land use, such as New Economy requires radical changes in technology and information technology, such as in management practices and in the approach to environment and agriculture itself. The first two features (technology, IT) are strongly restrained by economic factors, and can only be overcome with financial support. The latter ones, quite the reverse, are affected by human attitudes. Each and every individual sticks to his routines as far as they are not rudely contradicting economic reality. As far as farmers are not motivated to change their attitudes and behaviour, routines of traditional land use will persist. The price and quality of agricultural commodities and food products, and the intensifying concern of environmental friendly, sustainable agriculture urge change; but not sooner than legal acts are established and legislations are forced will real revolution occur. Although the benefits of sustainable land use have not yet been fully quantified, the costs of degradation are more substantial in terms of off-site effects, than on-site level. Climate change, globalization, food security, urbanization and the changing age structure of the rural population are all significant issues with regard to soil degradation and protection. Sustainable land use needs a policy framework to protect soil and its functions for future generations. Sustainable land use requirements must be integrated into all relevant EU policies, with priority given to the Common Agricultural and internal market policy through the use of cross-compliance introduced in the 2003 CAP reform, and to land use and spatial planning policies implemented by the Member States. Information on soil and the idea of site specific land use has its own value Szabó et al. (2005). While data collection is an inevitable part of sustainable land use, it is not predestined to be costly and labour consuming. Data collection does not always necessitate expensive background. Farmers confidently know the diverse areas of their territories and the distinguished treatment of such areas is in line with the idea of sustainable land use Tóth, (2001), Tóth et al. (2006, 2007).</p><p id="Pg376">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1770 It is far away from an average farmer to operate a complex system. On the other hand it is subsidised to collect data on soil, but it requires further effort to turn these data into information and/or knowledge. Research centres could do the data processing part. Information encapsulated into recommendations, plans and schemes is easy to grasp. If farmers are supplied with information on crop, fertiliser, pesticide and herbicide performance half of the way to sustainable land use is already covered. Farmers have to apply this information to their circumstances, build their own body of knowledge. Networks of farmers can also be built without the initiatives of sustainable land use. Better communication among farmers may facilitate data collection as well as information dissemination and knowledge creation. These networks, with or without a central actor could create protocols, which can be applied by present and future members as well. Community members can not only share experiences and knowledge, but infrastructure and equipment as well. They might purchase crops and fertilisers together and so have a better bargaining position. They might be able to sell their commodities jointly, or further process them. Such well functioning network will be able to buy and apply the technology of sustainable land use in the long run.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1771 GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT CHANGE AND FOOD SECURITY: A SOCIO-ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVE Tamás TÓTH1 – Judit VILLANYI2 – Peter BALÁZS1 – Jószef KAPUSZTA1 1 Institute of Reginal Economics and Rural Development, Szent István University, Hungary, Toth.Tamas.Agri@gtk.szie.hu 2 Institute of Economics, Szent István University, Hungary Abstract: Climate change may affect food systems in several ways ranging from direct effects on crop production, to changes in markets, food prices and supply chain infrastructure. The relative importance of climate change for food security differs between regions. For example, in southern Africa, climate is among the most frequently cited drivers of food insecurity because it acts both as an underlying, ongoing issue and as a short-lived shock. The low ability to cope with shocks and to mitigate long-term stresses means that coping strategies that might be available in other regions are unavailable or inappropriate. In other regions, though, such as parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain of India, other drivers, such as labour issues and the availability and quality of ground water for irrigation, rank higher than the direct effects of climate change as factors influencing food security. Because of the multiple socio-economic and bio-physical factors affecting food systems and hence food security, the capacity to adapt food systems to reduce their vulnerability to climate change is not uniform. Improved systems of food production, food distribution and economic access may all contribute to food systems adapted to cope with climate change, but in adopting such changes it will be important to ensure that they contribute to sustainability. Agriculture is a major contributor of the greenhouse gases methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), so that regionally derived policies promoting adapted food systems need to mitigate further climate change. Keywords: climate Change, sustainability, mitigation, food security Introduction Over the past fifty years, human ingenuity has led to technological advances in agriculture that have dramatically increased crop yields. However, despite these improvements, agriculture is still highly dependent on climate since solar radiation, temperature, and precipitation are the main drivers of crop growth. Since the industrial revolution, humans have been changing the global climate by emitting high amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, potentially resulting in higher global temperatures, changed hydrological regimes, and increased climatic variability. Climate change over the next century may have significant effects on food supply, i.e., how much food is produced, as well as food security, i.e. how much food is available to people. How much, where, and when food supply and security will be affected by climate change are questions many scientists and policy-makers are examining. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in its report World Agriculture toward 2015/2030, estimated that 776 million people located in 98 countries were food insecure during 1997/99, mostly concentrated in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. They also argued that the greenhouse gas induced climate change would further worsen the food security situation, especially in the tropics. Findings from agronomic studies suggest that food security conditions may become even more tenuous under climatic change as does. However this has not been extensively examined other than in terms of crop yield effects. How will climate change alter the ability of the world's growing population to gain access to food? By integrating agricultural and socio-economic models, we can</p><p id="Pg378">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1772 begin to predict if there will be an increase in hunger and famine as a result of global warming. Food security has been defined as "access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life" (World Bank). The World Food Summit, convened in 1996 and in 2002 by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in Rome, highlighted the basic right of all people to an adequate diet and need for concerted action among all countries to achieve this goal in a sustainable manner. How vulnerable households, regions and countries are to climate change's impacts on agriculture will depend on their access to land, water, and government support and action. The World Food Trade Model, designated as the Basic Linked System (BLS), links countries through trade, world market prices, and financial power. The BLS estimates that in 1980, there were about 500 million people at risk of hunger in the developing world (excluding China). Without climate change, the number of people expected to be at risk of hunger in 2060 has been estimated at ~640 million. This is marked decrease from 23% of the population of developing countries to 6% (excluding China). However, with unmitigated climate change, declines in yields in low-latitude regions (where many developing countries are located) are projected to require that net imports of cereals increase. Higher grain prices will affect the number of people at risk of hunger. The number of hungry people in developing countries will increase by ~1% for every 2-2.5% increase in prices. This means that the number of people at risk of hunger grows by 10-60% in the scenarios tested, result an estimated increase of between 60-350 million people in this condition. Socio-economics of Climate Change and Food Security It is generally accepted that climate change is the result of human activity including industrial output, car exhaust, and deforestation. These types of activities increase the concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere (IPCC, 2001). If the current trend in carbon emissions continues, temperatures will rise by about 1 degree C by the year 2030 and by 2 degree C by the next century. This increase, however, will probably have different impacts in different regions. Agricultural impacts, for example, will be more adverse in tropical areas than in temperate areas. Developed countries will largely benefit since cereal productivity is projected to rise in Canada, northern Europe and parts of Russia. In contrast, many of today’s poorest developing countries are likely to be negatively affected in the next 50 – 100 years, with a reduction in the extent and potential productivity of cropland. Most severely affected will be sub-Saharan Africa due to its inability to adequately adapt through necessary resources or through greater food imports. Problems facing farmers can be better understood if one considers the impact of climate change on weather or water precipitation, temperature and sunlight are the main factors behind agricultural production. Climate change can alter these factors causing essential threats to water availability, reduced agricultural productivity, spread of vector borne diseases to new areas, and increased flooding from sea level rise and even heavier rainfall. Climate variability is already the major cause of year-to-year fluctuations in production in both developed and developing countries. The largest reduction in cereal</p><p id="Pg379">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1773 production will occur in developing countries, averaging about 10 percent, according to an FAO. A projected 2 – 3% reduction in African cereal production for 2020 is enough to put 10 million people at risk. These impacts would require adaptation efforts that in many cases will be hardly affordable for people living with little access to the necessary resources or savings. In fact, the real impact will be in areas where food production is already often marginal. Some of the impacts of climate change on food production which are already visible and seem to be advancing at a higher rate than previously anticipated include: Regional temperature rises at high northern latitudes and in the center of some continents; Increased heat stress to crop and livestock; e.g. higher night-time temperatures, which could adversely affect grain formation and other aspects of crop development; Possible decline in precipitation in some food-insecure areas such as southern Africa and the northern region of Latin America; Increased evapotranspiration rates caused by higher temperatures, and lower soil moisture levels; Concentration of rainfall into a smaller number of rainy events with increases in the number of days with heavy rain, increasing erosion and flood risks; Changes in seasonal distribution of rainfall, with less falling in the main crop growing season; Sea level rise, aggravated by subsidence in parts of some densely populated flood-prone countries, displacing millions; Food production and supply disruption through more frequent and severe extreme events (Erika et al. 2006). Since food insecurity depends more on socio-economic conditions rather than on agro climatic ones, the ways in which climate change can affect people’s access to adequate food is rather complex. Future food security will mainly depend on the interrelationships between political and socio-economic stability, technological progress, agricultural policies and prices, growth of per capita and national incomes, poverty reduction, women’s education, trade and climate variability. Climate change, however, may affect the physical availability of food production by shifts in temperature and rainfall; people’s access to food by lowering their incomes from coastal fishing because of rising sea levels; or lowering a country’s foreign exchange earnings by the destruction of its export crops because of the rising frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones (Czövek et al. 2006, Kassai et al. 2006, Márton, 2006, Tanács et al. 2006). Sustainability and Food security Agriculture is not a wholly benign actor on the environment, as it causes accelerated soil erosion by water and wind, through cultivation, and often introduces nitrates and other chemicals into water supplies through the application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. The concept of "sustainable agriculture" endeavors to reduce chemical inputs and energy use in farming systems, in order to minimize environmental damage and to ensure longer-term productivity. Most agricultural assessments of global environmental change made to date have not focused explicitly on sustainability issues, and have neglected the considerable impacts of shifting agricultural zones, alterations in commercial fertilizer and pesticide use, and changes in the demand for water resources. Climate change can impact agricultural sustainability in two interrelated ways: first, by diminishing the long-term ability of agro-ecosystems to provide food and fiber for the world's population; and second, by inducing shifts in agricultural regions that may</p><p id="Pg380">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1774 encroach upon natural habitats, at the expense of floral and faunal diversity. Global warming may encourage the expansion of agricultural activities into regions now occupied by natural ecosystems such as forests, particularly at mid- and high-latitudes. Forced encroachments of this sort may thwart the processes of natural selection of climatically-adapted native crops and other species. While the overall, global impact of climate change on agricultural production may be small, regional vulnerabilities to food deficits may increase, due to problems of distributing and marketing food to specific regions and groups of people. For subsistence farmers and more so for people who now face a shortage of food, lower yields may result not only in measurable economic losses, but also in malnutrition and even famine (Tolimir, et al. 2006, Armstrong, et al. 1998). Conclusion In conclusion, global warming may result in detrimental effects on food supply and security, especially in developing countries. Even if developing countries adapt to climate change, they will not be able to completely avoid the problems associated with climate change. Furthermore, these harmful outcomes of climate change in developing countries and potentially positive outcomes in developed countries will probably increase the gap in wealth, access to food, and health between rich and poor countries. This will affect the worldwide economy as emerging trade-partners are lost, hunger increases, and refugees leave regions harmed by global warming in search of food and resources.

Abstract: On the brown soil of Eastern Croatia the effects of the soil tillage systems have been investigated (A1 - conventional tillage 25-30 cm, A2 - subsoling 35-40 cm, A3 - discharowing 10-15 cm, A4 - no tillage). The study was carried out on different winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars (B1 - Soissons, B2 - Fiesta, B3 – Gabi) as well as the nitrogen fertilization (C1 - 130, C2 - 160, C3 - 190 N ha kg -1 ) in the dry 2002/2003 and the humid 2003/2004 climate conditions. The experiment was set up according to the splitsplit-plot method. Grain yield was very low in the dry climate condition and in the humid year the yield was high. Soil tillage has not affected the yield in any of these years, while in the humid year there were differences between the cultivars. The Gabi cultivar had the highest yield (70,0 dt ha -1 ) in the humid conditions and the lowest (45,3 dt ha -1 ) in the dry year . Increasing the quantity of the nitrogen resulted with the increase in yield in both years. There is no interaction between the tillage and the cultivars, nor any other interaction. Keywords: soil tillage, cultivar, wheat, nitrogen, climate conditions Introduction Climate conditions of the Eastern Croatia affect the yield variety of the crops with often climate changes in the heat and the precipitation system. A lot of attention is brought to these changes lately because of the often droughts which cause the reduction of the winter wheat, corn and many other crops yield. Climate changes in the winter wheat cultivation have been the subject of many investigation and the newest paper point the importance of the effects (Bonifil et al., 1999; Cantero-Martinez et al., 2003; Ozpinar 2006.). As the climate can not be changed, we have to adjust to the climate by selecting the cultivars adaptive to the new situation, with a better water management of the soil such as different soil tillage systems (Anwar et al., 2007). Soil condition demand of the plant can be in the harmony with the soil quality improvement (Birkas et al., 2006). Effects of different tillage systems on the cultivation with different potential of tillering and enlarged amounts of nitrogen (from 130 to 190 kg ha-1) have been investigated in this paper, in two years with different climate. Materials and methods Experiment of the effects of different tillage systems, winter wheat cultivars and the nitrogen on the grain yield have been done in a field experiment on the brown soil type near Osijek in the extremely dry climate conditions 2002/2003 and the humid 2003/2004, according to the split-split-plot method. The soil has extremely well physico-chemical characteristics and good fertility with regularly high grain yield. The main A factor (include four soil tillage systems): CT= standard tillage (ploughing from 25 to 30 cm + the final tillage), ST= subsoiling (35-40</p><p id="Pg382">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1776 cm + the final tillage), DT= discharowing (10-15 cm + the final tillage), NT= no tillage. The final tillage consisted of discharowing 10-15 cm + seed bed preparation. Subfactor B consist tree winter wheat cultivars (Soissons, Fiesta and Gabi) with different potential of tillering. Cultivar Soissons tiller very well, Gabi well and Fiesta poorly. Subfactor C, the amount of nitrogen: N1= 130 kg ha -1, N2= 160 kg ha -1, N3= 190 kg ha -1. The amounts of N, P2O5 and K2O, which were used before the soil tillage, were 90, 84 and 64 kg ha -1. Two top dressing with nitrogen (N) were applied in mid tillering and stem elongation [Zadok's growth stage (GS 25 and 30)]. Basic plot size was 64 m2. Soil tillage and sowing were carried out in agrotechnical period in the other half of October in every year of the investigation. During the vegetation there were several protections against rodents (mice, hamsters), weed and two treatments against diseases. Results and discussion First year of the investigation (2002/2003) was extremely dry for the winter wheat production in the second part of the vegetation, in which there was only 80 mm precipitation. That is just 30% of the multiannual average. Besides, January and February were very cold. In these conditions wheat grew more difficult, it was short, and it has finished the vegetation about 15 days earlier because of the lack of rainfall and high temperature. On the whole, grain yield was a lot lower than the regular yield in earlier years. Table 1.

In these conditions, enlarged amounts of nitrogen in fertilization affected the increase of yield, which was highest with the highest dose. In the next 2003/2004 yield was satisfying, thanks to the climate conditions, first of all, the precipitation regime, according to amount, and the rainfall distribution. Concerning the previous year, there was 376% (222,8 mm) and even 18 % more than the multiannual average, from March to July. The highest yield of 69,8 dt ha-1 was accomplished with ST that year, and the lowest with DT and NT, but not lower than 3,7 and 3,5 dt ha-1, compared to the highest result. Standard tillage had a little lower results then the highest yields. Cultivar selection was based on biological differences concerning the tillering. Cultivars have not reacted much concerning the tillage or in the interaction with an enlarged amount of nitrogen. According to Lenssen et al. (2007), in NT access and adoption of nitrogen is improved because of the water conservation in soil. There were significant differences between cultivars and the amounts of nitrogen in this research. The highest yield was achieved with the highest dose of nitrogen (table 2., table 3.). Conclusions Grain yield depends on the precipitation and the temperature condition. The yield was 21,8 dt ha -1 an average lower in the extremely dry year than in the humid year. Different tillage systems had no major effects on the yield in the dry or in the humid year, although there were some differences. The yield was the lowest in both years with NT, the highest with DT in the dry year and with ST in the humid year. In the humid year the winter wheat cultivars affect the yield significantly. The Gabi cultivar had the highest yield in the humid and the lowest in the dry year. In both years the grain yield was significantly higher with an increased amount of the nitrogen.

Waring &amp; Schlesinger (1985) found that plant litter decomposition provides 69-87 % of nutrients required for forest development. The global climate change caused local changes in Hungary (Várallyay, 2007), which can influence the litter production of the natural vegetation. In the frame of Síkfőkút DIRT (Detritus Input and Removal Treatments) project the effect of litter amount was studied on the activity of soil microbes (Fekete et al., 2007), and speed of organic matter decomposition applying different kind of wood, leaf, root and different amount of plant litter. In this paper we discuss the degree of decomposition of leaf litter and cellulose cotton wool placed in the soil in the respect of different litter treatment plots. Keywords: DIRT, litter bags, leaf litter and cellulose decomposition activity, Síkfőkút site Introduction Fungus, bacteria, plant exudates and soil animals are all together responsible for organic matter decay. Decomposition processes of leaf litter are determined by the resources available to decomposers (Takeda, 1994). Monosaccharide, hemicellulose, cellulose, pectin, wax, chitin, lignin and polyphenol are the main compounds available to them (Swift et al., 1979). The changes (for example leaching of dissoluble ions) in litter get on the soil surface and proceed very fast. The decomposition starts almost immediately and in a few days or weeks - under favourable temperature, moisture and other factors - it reaches its maximum level (Troeh &amp; Thompson, 2005). Decomposition processes take place in two phases (Melillo et al., 1989). In the first phase exponential leaf weigh loss occurs. The degree of decomposition is controlled by C and N availability and morphological character - mainly the decay resistance - of the litter. In the second phase, the decomposition slows down and is mainly influenced by the litter lignin content (Berg &amp; Ekbohm, 1991; Berg et al., 1982). Decomposers living in soil are adopted to the above mentioned changes. As a result of the selective substrate utilization, r and k-strategist microbes can be distinguished (Fountaine et al., 2003). After getting fresh organic matter into the soil, many specific microorganisms develop on the easily assimilable substrate. These fast developing microbes are simply considered to be r-strategist microbes. After the fresh organic matter supplies have run out, r-strategists die or get into dormancy because they are unable to utilize the remaining resources. Then k-strategists slowly start to decompose the remaining much more resistant compounds. These microbes develop slower. If they are supplied with large amount of easily decomposable homogenous substrates they get the worst of rstrategists in the competition for nutrients (Hamer &amp; Marschner, 2002; Fountaine et al., 2003). Decomposition of higher lignin content debris needs more time than mineralization of softer plant tissues (Szabó, 1986). Polysaccharides exist in wooden tissues and often</p><p id="Pg386">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1780 protect against microbial decomposition with lignification. 70-80 % of litter organic matter is based on lignocellulose matrices (Cook &amp; Rayner, 1984) and these should be delignified to become available for the microbes. The speed of these processes also depends on the availability of non-lignified carbon (Kirk et al., 1976). Materials and methods The experimental forest site of 64 ha is located in the south part of the Bükk Mountains in North Eastern Hungary at 325 m altitude. GPS coordinates N 47o90’ E 20o46’. This forest has belonged to the Bükk National Park since 1976. The annual precipitation amounts to 550 mm. The plot is an unfertilized forest soil with Quercetum petraeaecerris community. The type of the soil according to the FAO Soil Classification is Cambisols. Short description and sign of the applied treatrments are shown in Table 1. Each plot is 7m wide and 7m long (49 m2), and every treatment was set up in three replications. Table 1. The applied treatments in open-field experiment (Síkfőkút, Hungary) TREATMENTS DESCRIPTION OF THE METHOD CONTROL (C) Normal litter inputs. NO LITTER (NL) Aboveground inputs are excluded from plots. DOUBLE LITTER (DL) Aboveground leaf inputs are doubled by adding litter removed from NO LITTER plots. DOUBLE WOOD (DW) Aboveground wood debris inputs are doubled by adding wood to each plot. NO INPUTS (NI) This treatment is the combination of NR+NL plots. Litter decomposition activity was modelled by using Unger-test bags. Half of these test bags were filled with 5g air-dried leaf litter and the other half with 5g cellulose wool. In every test plot 9 of each bag was placed into the soil 15cm deep. 3 of each bag was taken out after 3, 6 and 12 months. The decomposed organic matter amount – which is actually the cellulose decomposition activity – was determined with the Szegi method (1979). The litter decomoposition activity was studied by litter bag method of Gosz et al. (1973). Statistical analysis was carried out by paired samples T test using SPSS 12.0 software. Results and discussion The litter decomposition activity was the highest in DW and the lowest in NI plots. The differences between the DW and NI plots in litter decomposition activity were 10.6, 13.5 and 46.3 % after 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively. The intensity of litter decomposition slowed down significantly in the second period of three-month (between 3 and 6 months) compared to the first one. Its average value was 20.9% but in the case of DL and NI it was 10.2 and 40.3%, respectively. Intensity values measured in the first 6 months period were higher than in the second one. In the case of NI is the biggest decline with 66%, in the case of NL the fall is 50%, in the case of C 42%, then DL 41% and DW 29%, in all cases less organic matter decomposed in the second (6 – 12 month) period than in the first one (0 – 6 month).</p><p id="Pg387">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1781 The faster decomposition in the first 3 month period could be caused by combined effects of several factors. Thus, this period lasting from the beginning of April to the beginning of July is characterized by a very intensive decomposition due to the rising temperature and higher soil moisture content. Temperature (Hobbie, 1996) as well as the soil moisture content (Batjes, 1998) are determinant factors of litter decomposition. Firstly, the fast decomposing parts of the litter are mineralized by propagating and very active r-strategist microorganisms. Later the k-strategist microorganisms colonize on the remaining very durable, slowly decomposing compounds and they later decompose the high lignin content debris. At the beginning, the degree of decomposition processes is mainly determined by microclimate, concentration of water-soluble litter compounds and of easily decaying structural carbohydrates. Later these processes are determined by the lignin concentration (Berg, 2000; Berg &amp; Ekbohm, 1991). The above mentioned facts account for why the decomposition rate of litter in the soil of NI and NL plots, which had been deprived from the litter reach in lignin for 4 years, lagged behind the decomposition rate of the 3 other treatments (DW, DL, C) better and better in the course of time. In the case of cellulose cotton wool this relation is not valid Lower decomposition intensity in the second 6 month period lasting from the beginning of September to the end of March can be explained by the fact that the activity of the decomposers is naturally lower during this period (Atlas, 1988). The most intensive decomposition was measured in DW plots. It is due to the fact that the microbial communities living there have adapted to the decomposition of higher lignin content parts. Decomposition of cellulose cotton wool due to its more homogenous structure than leaf litter shows a different pattern. Decomposition of cellulose cotton wool was much quicker than leaf litter decomposition in every treatment. Differences were significant (p&lt;0.05) with the value of 59 % after 3 months and 40 % after 6 months. Conclusions Although soil respiration is considered to be a more precise method to estimate the decomposition velocity (Clymo, 1983), but well characterized tendencies can be gathered from the activity values measured by Unger-test. Since our objective was to figure out differences and tendencies in decomposition activity between the different experimental plots and not to determine the exact value of those, the Unger-test was found to be a suitable method to examine the decomposition activity which bear Gosz et al., (1973) out. Our results show that the decomposition rate is influenced by litter quality (leaf, cellulose wool) that is to be decomposed and also by the applied litter treatments depending on the time allowed for decomposition.

Hungary kucsakmonika@citromail.hu Abstract: Zeolite is a well known mineral, it has huge cation exhange capacity (1,47 meq/g), has porous structure (7 – 10Å). Hungarian zeolite is an amazing natural mineral because of its extraordinary ability to absorb, hold, release, and exchange different chemicals, nutrients, toxins and ions according to need. Hungarian zeolite was formed from the glass component of volcanic ash millions of years ago. We can found zeolit mainly in Tokaj mountain, especially, inthe south part, there are occurences of zeolite in Cserhát mountain, in Nemti and a minor amount of zeolite are in Mecsek, too. The whole zeolite resources are 300 million tons (t) in Hungary (Dövényi Schweitzer, et al., 2004.) This kind of zeolite contains more than 50 % klinoptilolite, and mordenite. Zeolite is an inert material which can be used in many fields such as waste water treatment, agriculture, industry. Hungarian zeolite has a particularly affinity for ammonium (NH4 + ), potassium (K + ), calcium (Ca + ) magnesium (Mg + ) and trace elements which makes it particularly useful as a soil, compost and fertiliser additive to attract, retain and slowly release critical plant nutrients. Keywords: zeolite, cation exchange capacity, soil quality, nutrients, microclimate Introduction Hungarian zeolite has a unique internally porous atomic structure that provides a very open framework with a network of pores giving it a large surface area (up to 450m2 /g) and high porosity (up to 45%) for trapping and exchanging valuable cations, water and other molecules without any change in structure. Escott zeolite is a robust, insoluble and chemically stable natural mineral (part of a group of hydrated alumino silicates) and can be used as an organic agricultural and horticultural input (Polat, E., Karaca, M., Demir, H., Onus, A. N.: 2004). It carries a negative charge balanced by freely moving cations with positive charges. This provides an ideal trap for positive cations like nitrogen rich ammonium and potassium which are then released when demanded by plants. Materials and methods Zeolite has a proven ability of a natural slow release mechanism of nutrients to the root zone of new seedling thereby increasing the plants' strength and performance. Zeolite also provides the following attributes for agriculture applications which lead to improvements to overall crop yield, what several experiments are demonstrated (Li, 2003): • Captures and regulates the release of nutrients (compost and fertilizer) to the soil, • Absorbs and traps toxic contaminants, • Provides buffering capacity by balancing soil pH, • Reduces alkalinity effects, • Improves aeration, • Provides an excellent platform for microbiological activity, • Promotes alkali metal equilibrium, • Improved root development</p><p id="Pg390">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1784 • Retains moisture, • 100% natural for organic farming operations, • Breaks down clay clumping, and • Promotes germination and the sustained growth of grasses and grains. Many studies have shown that zeolite enhancement in contaminated soils promotes healthy germination and growth that even exceeds growth in the uncontaminated control soil. Zeolite contains no inherent nutrient value and is 100% organic. The only processing is simply sizing in order to suit your mesh requirements. Nutrients are provided to the root in a slow-release and plant root demand-driven fashion. The process is a combination of dissolution and ion exchange reactions. The absorption of nutrients from the soil solution by plant roots drives the dissolution and ion exchange reactions, pulling away nutrients as needed. The zeolite is then "recharged" by the addition of more dissolved nutrients (Noori, Zendehdel, Ahmadi, 2006). Zeolite improves soil structure by coupling high cation exchange capacity with a selective affinity for ammonium and potassium. Zeolite is very porous with an incredibly large surface area. The selectivity of zeolite for ammonium helps buffer the soil and prevents toxicity, which occurs when excess ammonium is applied. This property allows the grower to use this less costly form of nitrogen in larger and less frequent applications during the growing season. The retention and timely release of needed nutrients by zeolite improves overall crop yield (Dömsödi, 2006). The forigne and hungarian experiments also are shown the soil improving effect of zeolite it seems to be a good solution to upping capability of land conservation. Hungarian zeolite has good quality, the place where it can be found has a special microclimate. The following picture shows where are the places of zeolite occurances in Hungary: Figure 1.: Geological ma pof Tokaj mountain. In the middle there are andezit the zeolit is in the offset, shown by purple colour (Jámbor, 1982) (http://fold1.ftt.uni-miskolc.hu/~foldshe/telep05.htm ) Figure 2.: Zeolit occurance in Tokaj mountain in geological section. 1: soil, 2: yellow soil, clay, 3: riolit-tufa, 4: riolit-tufa with zeolite, 5: riolittufa (http://fold1.ftt.uni-miskolc.hu/~foldshe/telep05.htm )</p><p id="Pg391">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1785 Results and discussion As we mantioned zeolite attracts and retains ammonium, potassium, calcium and magnesium as well as many trace elements. It has the greatest affinity for ammonium and potassium but when a plant is taking up the ammonium or potassium off the zeolite, the zeolite attracts calcium from phosphorus mineral apatite such as rock phosphate or locked up phosphorus in soil to balance the zeolites negative charge. This reaction releases a free phosphorus. The plant extracts the ammonium, potassium and other nutrients by active uptake from roots. The phosphorus release reaction with ammoniated zeolite has been established by the United states Geologival Survey and the University of Colorado soil Science Dept. The nutrient release from the Zeolite is plant driven setting up a natural cycle of nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus release. The Zeolite will recharge when an ammonium or potassium source becomes available either naturally or applied (Filcheva; – Tsadilas, 2002). The zeolite prevents free nutrients from leaching. Figure 3.: zeolit cation-exchange in soil with plants Zeolit placed in the soil affects even the microclimate of the areas concerned by intervention both in direct and indirect way. Change of thermal physical properties of the soil means the direct effect and the changed soil as modified production site factor means the indirect effect. Considering the thermal physical properties of the soil, its air and water content is the determinative, its basic material is less important in this respect (Mikulec – Stehlová, 2006) The zeolit, with its porous structure and large internal surface area, modifies right the presence of these two materials important in thermal physical respect. The porous structure increases the air content of the soil and the resulted airy soil structure determines the conductivity of the soil. In case of high air content the conductivity is low. It means that the solar radiation energy absorbed by the soil heats up the upper layer of the soil. This energy concentration provides the high temnperature of the air space above the surface as a result of the heat energy received by conduct of the considerably heated upper surface. The large internal surface area serves as good water reservoire that is, in the same time, energy reservoire also (Gombos, 2007) Warming and cooling of the soil treated by zeolit is slower as comperd with non-treated soil since the water deposited due to the good water reservoire capacity of the soil makes the process of temperature change</p><p id="Pg392">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1786 balanced. This balanced condition appears also in case of the air condition above the surface. The airy soil structure and the good water endowment improves also the biological and physiological condition of the plant grown on the treated soil. The airy structure improves the living conditions of the aerob organisms that live in the soil. The sufficient water content serves well the continuous nutrient uptake and the needed transpiration generated by outside circumstances. In the long run, the healthy growth of the plant, the required vegetal productivity and the application of less pesticide in the course of the needed chemical control can be traced back mainly to this. It can be established, on the whole, that a balanced microclimate that helps the plant growing is stabilized above the soil treated by zeolit. Conclusions pt 10 Hungarian zeolite is appropriate to improve soil structure, because of it’s cationexchange capacity it can be use as a fertilizer, in the roots zone plants can take nutrients as much as those need. Zeolite has porous structure and enormous internal surface which influence microclimate in right way thus create more adequate condition for crop yield. Zeolite with sludge can be another alternative fertilizer in sustainable agricultural usage.

Analysis of variance only demonstrated the expected variety effect. No daily fluctuations in the water content could be observed, nor was the low grain moisture content recorded after physiological maturity found to be influenced by rain, by temperatures favourable for drying, or by plant organs with higher water contents. This indicates that the date of harvesting during this period had no major effect on the amount of energy required for drying. Keywords: water content, maize kernel, grain moisture, Introduction A wise choice of maize harvesting date is of importance for the energy costs of drying, which depend primarily on the water content of the kernels. Energy is required not only to reduce the water content of the kernels, but also to warm up the grain. Less energy is probably required for warming up dry grain, than when the grain is soaked. In addition the water content of the kernels may influence the daily course of drying. It is widely accepted that while water is able to pass through the black layer formed at the base of the kernels, sugar solution is not. It is possible that the water lost from the kernel surface by drying during the day may be replaced during the night from the higher water content of the cob, ear stalk, leaf and stalk. The grain moisture content may also increase due to swelling caused by natural rainfall or if air humidity is high over a long period (Daynard et al. 1971, Johnson and Tanner 1972, Hadi 1983, 2004, Hadi and Szundy 1985, 1988, 1990, Brooking 1990, Russell 1991, Rajcan and Tollenaar 1999, Berzsenyi and Lap 2006, Marton et al. 2007). In order to make a wise choice of harvesting date it is necessary to be familiar with the daily course of grain drying, and to know whether the water lost during drying is replaced from the stalk and cob at low grain moisture content, and whether dry or wet weather have any influence on the grain moisture content. Materials and methods In experiments carried out in Martonvásár in 2006, the grain moisture content, the water content of the cob and of the internode below the ear, and the thousand-kernel mass of the FAO 200 hybrids Mv 251 and Ipoly and of the FAO 400–500 hybrids Tisza and Mv 500 were measured three times a day (at 8 am, 12 noon and 4 pm) on five occasions, with the exception of the internode, which was only sampled on four occasions after observing the first evidence of damage due to frost and/or Fusarium. At each sampling point the values recorded for five plants were averaged for each variety. In each case</p><p id="Pg394">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1788 sampling was begun after the kernels had reached physiological maturity, i.e. during the harvesting period of grain maize. The samples were dried to constant weight at 105°C, and the dry thousand-kernel mass was recorded by weighing 5×2×100 kernels per variety at each sampling point. The data were evaluated using 3-factor analysis of variance. Results and discussion The F values obtained from analysis of variance are presented in Table 1. As expected, the effect of the variety was significant for all traits except the water content of the internode. None of the plant traits was significantly influenced, however, by the time of day (8 am, 12 noon, 4 pm), by the sampling date or by the variety × sampling date interaction. This indicates that at these sampling points the measurements depended only on natural deviation, and that neither an increase in thousand-kernel mass nor any drying or re-moistening could be detected. Data on grain moisture content, on the water content of the cob and the internode below the ear, and on thousand-kernel mass are presented in Table 2, averaged over the three sampling points for each day. A significantly higher value of grain moisture content and cob water content was recorded for the variety Ipoly on November 7. and the cob water content for Mv 500 on November 10.These discrepancies could have been due to the random sampling , but it is also possible that there was a slow, significant reduction in the moisture content.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1791 DRYING OF MAIZE AFTER PHYSIOLOGICAL MATURITY ON CHERNOZEM SOIL WITH FOREST RESIDUES Ferenc RÁCZ1 – Géza HADI1 – Szilárd KÁSA2 1 Agricultural Research Institute of the Hungarian Academy Of Sciences, 2 ZELLSEED, Horná poton, Slovakia, Abstract The grain moisture content, the water content of the cob and internode and the thousand-kernel mass were examined at very low grain moisture content for 22 hybrids in the FAO 200–500 maturity groups between 2 and 17 November 2006. It was found that no practically significant grain drying or change in thousand-kernel mass could be expected after the equilibrium grain moisture content was reached, either due to average weather conditions or to higher moisture content in other plant organs. As no further reduction in costs can be achieved, it is advisable to begin harvesting. Keywords: maize, grain moisture, drying of maize Introduction The conditions required for harvesting maize at low grain moisture content are a wise choice of harvesting date, weather conditions that promote natural drying and the use of hybrids suitable for harvesting at low grain moisture content, as reported by a number of authors (Hadi 1983, 2004, Hadi and Szundy 1985, 1988, 1990, etc.). The date at which the grains reach physiological maturity and the grain moisture content at which this occurs are particularly important aspects of the maturing of maize. In the 1970s physiological maturity was reached at a grain moisture content of 32–33% under natural conditions, while for the hybrids commonly grown today this figure is 22–23%. It is generally considered that the accumulation of dry matter in the grain continues until the development of the black layer, and that part of the moisture content of the stalk, ear stalk and cob is lost through the black layer from the surface of the kernels (Daynard et al. 1971, Johnson and Tanner 1972, Hadi and Szundy 1985, 1988, 1999, Brooking 1990, Hadi 2004, Várallyay 2006). According to this concept, late harvesting can be recommended for hybrids in any maturity group. The moisture content of living leaves, stalks and cobs is high (60–80%) and hardly changes. This high water content in the stalk, leaf, cob and ear stalk may influence drying, together with the favourable or unfavourable weather conditions (Hadi and Szundy 1990). However, little is known about the rate and volume of drying at low grain moisture content in the case of late harvesting. Material and methods The grain moisture content of 22 hybrids in the FAO 200–500 maturity groups, the water content of the cob and of the internode below the ear, and the thousand-kernel mass were examined on chernozem soil with forest residues in Martonvásár in six-row demonstration plots with no replications. At each sampling date one plant from each of five rows was harvested for each variety. After drying to constant weight at 105°C the dry thousand-kernel mass was measured for 2 × 100 kernels for each of five plants. At the start of the experiment practically all the plants of each variety were still green. Frost (–4°C) was recorded on Nov. 4th, and by Nov. 8th the drying off of the foliage,</p><p id="Pg398">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1792 induced by frost and/or Fusarium, could be clearly seen, to different extents for each variety Studies on the water content of the internodes were begun at this point. No lodging was observed at any point in the experiment. Measurable quantities of rainfall were recorded on 8 occasions between Nov. 2nd and 17th 2006, leading to high humidity. A maximum daily temperature of over 10°C was also observed on a total of 8 occasions, which may have promoted drying. Results and discussion Differences between the data recorded at the different sampling dates, averaged over the 22 varieties, can be seen in Table 1. No significant differences were recorded between the means of the sampling dates for any trait except cob moisture content. Cob drying of 1.1%–0.7% is acceptable and biologically justified, though it is not substantial from the practical point of view. Averaged over the sampling points, the differences between the 22 varieties for grain moisture content and other plant traits (Table 2) were in accordance with those expected as the result of natural biological variability. Cases of low moisture content at harvest were observed for both early and late-maturing varieties and could be attributed to the length of the vegetation period and to the genetically coded drying-down traits of the varieties. Under average weather conditions like those in 2006 the 22 varieties examined had equilibrium grain moisture contents of around 18%. The grain moisture content did not change or fluctuate significantly either in response to wet and/or dry weather or as a result of higher water content in the cob (25.4%) or the internode (39.1%). This indicates that after the equilibrium water content characteristic of individual varieties has been reached (at different times for each variety), no practically significant grain drying or change in thousand-kernel mass can be expected.

Representative leaf samples were collected three times during vegetation at 10 day intervals, and nitrate in the petiole sap was immediately measured with a Cardy ion meter. Approximately 30 leaf chlorophyll readings were also taken. At the same time petiole samples were collected, with a portable, hand held Hydro N-tester chlorophyll meter. Petiole sap nitrate concentration and chlorophyll content index (CCI) increased with increasing fertilization levels and decreased as the season progressed. Highest correlations between the amount of nitrate nitrogen and chlorophyll in leaves were observed at approximately 50 days after planting. Furthermore, the methods were highly correlated. Yield was not related to the amount of petiole sap nitrate and chlorophyll content index during the vegetation. Keywords: potato, nitrate nitrogen, chlorophyll content index, petiole sap analyses, nitrogen, yield Introduction Potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L) rate fourth in production volume among the world’s field crops, playing an important role in economy of many countries. Potatoes as shallow- rooted crops need a high level of nitrogen to ensure acceptable yield (Darwish et al., 2006). Nitrogen management, rate and timing of nitrogen application are critical factors in optimizing potato tuber yield and quality (Haase et al., 2006, Poljak et al., 2007). Different methodological approaches have been developed and introduced to improve N-recommendation systems (Olfs et al., 2005). The main idea of in-field methods like chlorophyll measurements and plant petiole sap test is that the plant itself is the best indicator for N supply from any source within growth period. Nitrogen is the most often the limiting factor to rapid growth, chlorophyll content and photosynthetic activity of crops (Wu et al., 2006, Varga, et. al., 2007). The correlation between foliar N status and fertilizer needs provides a diagnostic method in many cases (Chang and Robinson, 2003, Izsáki and Németh, 2007, Széles, 2007). The objective of this study was to estimate the feasibility of using chlorophyll measurements and petiole sap rapid tests to monitor the N status of potatoes. Materials and methods The field experiment was conducted on a private farm (at Slovinska Kovačica), which is a typical area for processing potato cultivation in Croatia. The potato cultivars (Victoria, Red Star and Remarka) with similar duration of growth were mechanically planted in May 2002. At the beginning of experiments, the soil characteristics were as follows: pH 5.7; humus content 14 mg g-1; extractable P2O5 108 and K2O 110 mg kg -1. Maize (Zea mays L.) was the previous crop. The experiment was arranged in a randomised split-plot</p><p id="Pg402">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1796 design with three replications including 3 genotypes of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) as main plots and five N rates (0, 100, 150, 200 and 250 kg ha-1) as sub-plots. The subplot size were 4.3x10.0 m, with 200 plants. Nitrogen was applied half at pre-planting and half before hilling, while standard doses of P2O5 (140 kg ha -1) and K2O (210 kg ha 1) were applied at pre-planting. The usual crop management was used for weed, pest and disease control. Potato leaf samples for petiole sap NO3–N and chlorophyll content determination were taken 47, 62 and 78 days after sowing (DAS) from June through July, 2002. Samples of 30 potato leaves (usually the 4th or 5th leaf from the apex) were collected at around 10 a.m. from second and fifth row of each plot. Chlorophyll content index (CCI) were made on same leaves by a portable Hydro N-tester chlorophyll meter just before collecting leaves for petiole sap analyses. Leaflets were removed, and fresh petiole samples were transported on ice, sliced to small pieces and mixed thoroughly into a pile. A portion of the petiole samples was pressured by a garlic press and petiole sap was immediately taken for NO3-N determination by Cardy ion meter. The results were used to assess the N status of the potato genotypes. Statistical data analyses were made according to GLM procedure by the SAS System (SAS Institute Inc., 1999-2001). Fresh tuber yield was calculated by harvesting two middle rows of each plot. Results and discussion The analysis of the variance showed that N dose and measurement date as indices of plant age as well as genotype considerably influence the chlorophyll content and NO3-N concentration in petiole sap. Under the specific conditions in which the experiment was conducted all parameters were significantly affected by the three factors under study, viz. the N rate, genotype, and plant age. The chlorophyll content increased linearly and significantly with increasing nitrogen rates, but decreased significantly with plant ageing (Table 1). Table 1 Mean chlorophyll content index (CCI) and petiole sap NO3-N concentrations for five fertilization rates during growing season in 2002.

Treatment differences between 0, 100 and 150 kg N ha-1 at 47 and 78 DAS were shown consistently. Similar results were found by Wu et al., 2007. It seems normal for potatoes, as Rodrigues et al., 2005 showed that N-use efficiency could be high between 10 to 48 days after emergency. Potato cultivars showed significant differences in CCI value at 62 and 78 DAS but not at 47 DAS. On average, Red star exhibited significantly less chlorophyll</p><p id="Pg403">VII.

No significant effect may have been caused by unusually low temperatures in May 2002. Nitrogen supply caused a significant increase in NO3-N concentration in respect to unfertilized plants, especially at 250 kg N ha-1 on all measurement dates (Table 1). Small and insignificant differences in NO3-N concentration were found between 150, 200 and 250 kg N ha-1 on all measurement dates. However, nitrate concentrations progressively decreased with plant ageing between 47 and 62 DAS, and slightly increased between 62 and 78 DAS. Usually petiole NO3-N concentration decreased as the season progressed, since the reduction and binding into organic compounds took place. However, such effects are probably a reflection of favourable environmental condition for a higher N mineralization in late growth period or a reflection on water stress. Regardless of that, chlorophyll content has shown no such effect. In each measurement interval the NO3-N petiole sap concentration in the unfertilized treatment was significantly lower and showed a progressively decreasing concentration with plant ageing. Wu et al., 2007 suggested a petiole sap NO3-N test as better method in detection of treatment differences later in season but we have not proved that. From these results it follows that under the ecological conditions of continental Croatia potatoes respond by an enhanced N uptake, as the fertilization rate increases. In this study, the increasing petiole sap NO3-N content and CCI values as a result of increasing N-fertilization rates illustrate this very well. However, the utilization of the nitrogen did not follow this trend. There was no clear difference between 150, 200 and 250 kg N ha-1 fertilization rates which confirms that plants take in only the amounts of nitrogen they</p><p id="Pg404">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1798 need, regardless of how much nitrogen they absorb from the soil. Hence, this would allow the potato producer to reduce N fertilization in such agro-environmental conditions. A very strong correlation between the methods was also recorded (Table 2). Yield was not related to the concentration of petiole sap NO3-N and CCI in leaf during vegetation season. Table 2.

However, growers should understand that the chlorophyll meter is only able to reveal deficiency situations. Sap tests are accurate enough to be used on a practical basis as a decision-making tool that can increase the efficiency of fertilizer use. Nitrogen utilization varies in different potato cultivars, and more detailed research over a wide range of soil and climate conditions needs to be conducted to determine the simplest, but most comprehensively reliable method for applying this technology to potato.

Field studies were conducted in two experimental years to examine the effect of low-, medium- and high input levels (models with increasing fertilization combined with fungicide treatments) on grain yield and flour quality traits of winter wheat. Elevating fertilization increased the grain yield; however, this was true at the highest rate (NPK 180+90+90 kg ha -1 ) only when growth-regulator was applied to avoid lodging. Among the tested quality traits, high-input models were generally favourable for the formation of wet gluten and the farinographic values but the Hagberg falling number and kernel hardness was hardly influenced by the applied technologies. Keywords: Triticum aestivum, fertilization, fungicides, yield, baking quality, Introduction Wheat production and the yearly income of wheat growers are basically influenced by the level of the applied agronomical and technological practice (Jolánkai and Németh 2006). Some factors (i.e. ways of the fertilization and harvest) have a direct-, while others such us the applied plant protection technologies or the sowing time have indirect effect on grain quality and quantity (Bertic, 2007; Matuz et al., 2007; Kristó et al., 2007). At a given agronomical level, using well adapted cultivar(s), climatic conditions and the location have also enormous influence on the yield (Pepó and Győri, 2005; Varga et al., 2005; Drezner et al., 2007). A moderately dry weather in the period of grain filling and ripening results high milling and baking quality, in general. Unfavourable climatic effects may be modified by application of adequate technological solutions (Kutcher et al., 2005). Therefore, we studied how the applied fertilizers and fungicides affect the grain yield and quality traits of winter wheat. Materials and methods Field experiments were conducted in Szeged, South-Hungary in 2006 and 2007. The soil at the Öthalom Agronomy Station was a meadow chernozem with salinity in depth, with 3% of humus, highly appropriate for wheat production. Typical annual precipitation in the area is 534 mm with 380 mm in the vegetation period (35 yearaverage). The crop year of 2006 provided optimum conditions for the wheat production with 413 mm precipitation in the vegetation period while 2007 was a dryer year with 311 mm. Four registered wheat cultivars were selected for applying four different NPK fertilization levels combined with various fungicide treatments (Table 1). The experiments and all the measurements were conducted in four replications. The grain samples were milled and processed by Brabender system for executing the farinograph test and gluten wash. For all other tests, whole meal samples were prepared using a</p><p id="Pg406">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1800 Perten 3100 Laboratory Mill.

The most intensive technology (model D5) performed the highest yield in the experiment (Figure 1). Models C3 and C4 furnished 1-1.2 t ha-1 extra yield which could be economically sound. However, extra yields of models D4, D5 will not be profitable for farmers (except at very high grain prices on the market). Beside, in model D4 most of the tested cultivars experienced severe lodging problems. Model D5 (D4 with regulator Moddus), due to the lodging-free stands, generated a 0.78 t/ha (11%) extra yield if compare to model D4. Flour quality Wet gluten content varied between 23.1 and 34.6% in the experiments (Figure 2). There were no significant differences among the treatments on the 60 kg N-level (models A1, A2, B2, B3). All the wheat varieties produced significant gluten benefit in models C3 and C4 (120 kg ha-1 N) and further increases were measured in models D4 and D5 at the 160 kg ha-1 N-level (Figure 2). These results (the higher N-rate, the higher protein/gluten content) are in high correspondence with our previous research and other recent announces (Thomason et al. 2007). We observed a similar trend in farinographic units (Figure 3): no significant differences among models A1, A2, B2, B3 but a large step appeared with significant differences starting at model C3, continuing with C4, D4, and D5. These observations are analogous to the results of Pepó (2003) and Al-Eid</p><p id="Pg407">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1801 (2006) when contents of protein and gluten increased with increase in fertilization level, which also improved the rheological properties of dough and baking quality.

Similarly, only slight differences were observed when assessing the effect of models on kernel hardness (models A1:72, D5:85). The fact that the applied technology had only a</p><p id="Pg408">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1802 moderate effect on kernel hardness (Figure 4) is in association with recent consequences. Testing the genetic and environmental influences on formation of this trait, Fox et al. (2007) found that the grain hardness was mainly determined by genetically but there were also environmental effects, possibly linked to the effect of protein on hardness, i.e. increasing protein resulted in harder grain. Conclusions Results suggest that use of technology model A1 may be useful in the marginal area preservation (soil conservation), or when higher level of models are preclude by water deficiency or other obstacles. Using this technology a poor grain and flour quality can be expected. All in the other cases, models with higher fertilizer rates (also with appropriate fungicide treatments in wet years) will provide excellent grain yield and quality. The highest input levels, however, may not always provide economical solutions for the growers due to high costs of the production. References Al-Eid, S. M.: 2006.

An application to concentration measurements obtained from a batch tests illustrates the applicability of the approach for a real situation. Objectives of the study were to characterize the adsorption proces of phosphorus for some types of soils . Keywords: soil solution, phosphate ions, adsorption Introduction Phosphorus occurs almost solely as phosphates classified as orthophosphates, condensed phosphates (pyro-, meta- and other polyphosphates) and organically bound phosphates. Phosphates can be removed by chemical precipitation, biological treatment, or a combination of both. In the case of chemical treatment, aluminum salts have been traditionally used as coagulants. Aluminum sulfate (alum) is the most widely used coagulant despite its complex aqueous chemistry. When added to water, aluminum ions are hydrated, producing amorphous aluminum hydroxide in the form of large, positively charged molecules (Georgantas 2007, Geisler et al. 2005). The principle of chemical phosphorus removal from wastewater is to transfer dissolved phosphates into particulate form by producing chemical precipitates of low solubility. These precipitates are further removed by a solids separation process. The mechanism of the interaction between alum and phosphates is according to (Aguilar et al. 2002). Soils are known to very widely in their P supply capacities, because only a small fraction of the total P in soil is in an available form, which determines chemical bounding and its transformation correlation with soil moisture and temperature ( Máthé et al. 2007, Sárdi et al. 2006). The yield experiments estimates of the isotherm describing the partitioning of the contaminant between the solid and liquid phases, and a concentration that might be expected under soil hydraulic conditions representative for the field situation (Iden et al. 2008, Burger 2007, Burger-Čelková 2007, Damodar et al. 2001). A variety of potentially hazardous materials pose a potential threat to our groundwater and soil resources, they require thorough and appropriate testing procedures prior to their application in order to assess their potential to release contaminants. These procedures are generally based on batch adsorption tests, batch extractions or column leaching experiments in the laboratory ( Kováčová 2006, Saavedra et al. 2005, Kováčová 2000, Wolf et al. 2005, Yong et al. 1992). Most of the sorption capacity was located in the B horizons at depths between 0.3 and 0.7 m. It increased dissolution of P at small P concentrations, sorption at large P concentrations, and the estimates for P buffering capacity. The effects of drying soil samples on the results and the imprecision of the parameters estimated with the</p><p id="Pg410">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1804 modified Freundlich equation should be taken into account when interpreting results of experiments ( Peltovouri 2007, Zhang et al. 2005). Materials and methods The mechanism of phosphates adsorption on soils is modeled according Langmuir and Freundlich equation. The Langmuir sorption isotherm considers homogeneous surface sites with no lateral interactions among binding sites and it is expressed by eL eLm e CK CKq q   1 (1) where qe is the amount of phosphate sorbed per unit weight of sorbent at equilibrium (kg kg−1), qm constant which is equal to the maximum value of qe (kg kg −1), Ce equilibrium concentration in solution (kg m−3), and KL constant (m 3 kg−1). The Freundlich isotherm, the earliest known empirical relationship, is expressed by N eFe CKq  (2) where KF, N are constants (m 3 kg−1)1/N and dimensionless. Finally the BET sorption isotherm , widely used in multilayer adsorption, is expressed by      sees me e CCBCC qBC q /11   (3) where Cs is saturation concentration (kg m −3), B constant (dimensionless). Results and discussion Were comparised the P contents between different sampling sites and periods. The mechanism of phosphates adsorption is modeled according Langmuir, Freundlich and finally-the BET sorption isotherm (Fig.1, 2). The present study aims the effect of parameters such as coagulant dose, pH, temperature, and various ions which may be present in soil solution. Phosphorus sorption characteristics of two types of soils S1loamy and S2-sandy soil from Danubian Dowland. Adsorption isotherms were measured varying phosphate concentration at a defined constant pH. The effect of pH on phosphate adsorption were examined in previous studies. The low phosphate uptakein alkaline pH range can be attributed to competition between hydroxide ions and phosphate ions for adsorption sites. The temperatures examined in the present work were 25, 40, 50 and 60°C. Effectiveness of adsorption increases with temperature, as seen in Fig.2. Five grams of soil were equilibrated with 50 ml of 0,01 M CaCl2 solution containing greded concentrations of P (0,1 – 900 mg P L-1 as KH2PO4) in plastic tubes for 48 hours. During the equilibration period the soil suspension were shaken every 1 hour. The suspensions were filtered through a filter paper and their equilibrium concentration analyzed using a spectrometer. The quantity of adsorbed phosphate was calculated from the decrease in phosphate concentration. The amount of P sorbed was calculated by the difference between P initially added and P remaining in solution. Finally adsorption isotherms were fitted to the experimental data and the relevant parameters were estimated (Tab.1).</p><p id="Pg411">VII.

The digestate was used at the rates of 0, 5 and 10 L m -2 , two times in the vegetation period for soybean test plant. We measured different yield components, oil and protein content and amino acid composition of soybean, collected from three square meters from each plots. We measured the general soil physico-chemical parameters and invertase, dehydrogenase, catalase activities as well as the number of different groups of soil microbes by modified plate dilution technique. Our results show, that digestate application has not caused drastic changes in soil properties, but it was very favourable as a nutrient source. It increased significantly the crop yield of treated soybean and also increased the protein and amino acid content of the test plant. Biogasdigestate could be become a very useful material for plant nutrition. Keywords: biogas-digestate, soybean, plant nutrition, soil quality Introduction Biogas plants are suitable for the manipulation of different organic material originated from farm. The by-product of this procedure is digestate which can be used for plant nutrition. Numerous papers deal with processes taking place in digestors, but there are only few information about the effect of digestate on plants and soils. Qi et al. (2005) examined in North China the effect of fermented waste as organic manure in cucumber and tomato production. They have found an increase in yield and vitamin C content of about 18 %. Banik and Nandi (2004) investigated the effect of digestate on the yield, protein and mineral contents of oyster mushroom. They also have found positive effect. The number of biogas plants is expected to increase drastically within some years in Hungary. Using digestate as plant nutrient source will be necessary but at the moment we have not enough information about its effect on plants and soils. The aim of our work was to demonstrate the effects of digestate application as a nutrient source on crop yield, on the content values of test plant and on soil physico-chemical and biological parameters. In this article we present our results with soybean on an acidic, humic sandy soil. Materials and methods Our fieldscale experiment was carried out in Nyírbátor city, the NE Hungary. One of the largest European biogas plant is working there. The basic materials of the biogas plant are livestock manure, plant residues and offal which go through a mesophylic and thermophylic digestor systems. The by-product of biogas production is the digestate. Main parameters of the digestate are the followings: pH 8.025, density 1025.75 kg m-3,</p><p id="Pg414">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1808 dry matter content 1.1824 %(m/m) (row matter), total-N 0.376 %(m/m) (r. m.), total-P 275 mg kg-1 (r.m.), K 736 mg kg-1 (r.m.), Mg 32.7 mg kg-1 (r.m.), Na 272.5 mg kg-1 (r.m.). Digestate is a complex nutrient source, but we used it on the bases of its totalnitrogen content. The applied doses were 0, 5 and 10 L m-2, treatments were done by a slurry-tanker. The experimental designe was random block in four repetition with soybean (Glycine max (L). Merr. ‘Otilia‘) test plant. The crops were harvested by harvesting equipment in October, 2007. For the detailed examination of soybean plants, we collected samples of one square meters in each plots. Soil samples were collected from the 0-20 cm layer of the soil after the harvest. Physico-chemical properties of the soil and the inside content values of test plants were measured according to the Hungarian Standard. Soil biological samples were analysed immediately after sampling or after freezing. The Hungarian Standard was used for measuring the activity of dehydrogenase and catalase activities. Invertase activity was estimated from the glucose formation as it was suggested by Mikanová et al. (2001). Colony forming units (CFU g-1 dry soil) of the heterotrophs (r-strategists), oligotrophs (K-strategists), the sporeforming bacteria (l-strategists) were estimated on Nutrient-, free-living N2-fixers on Ashby- and microscopic fungy on Martin-agar plates by a modified plate dilution technique of Angerer et al. (1998). Statistical analysis was done by SPSS program. Results and discussion Digestate effect on the soil properties. Subsequent delivery of nutrients should be done without causing damages in soil quality. When using artificial fertilizers, the decrease of soil pH is the main danger. About the biogas-digestate we have got only few experiences (Makádi et al., 2007), but the probable increase in the number of biogas plants in the future makes it important to investigate the possible effects. Our results show, that after a one-year application of digestate there was no drastic change in the soil quality. It is important to say, that we did not apply extra doses. The digestate was used according to the plant demands. We have found two negative, warning changes: a small increase in Na- and watersoluble salt content of treated soils. We recommended to the management to examine the water used in the biogas plant and in the cattle farm. Fortunately, there are more favourable changes, experienced in our study. We have found increasing NO3-N and decreasing NH4-N content in treated soil samples. Likewise increased the cohesion of soil, the AL-P, AL-K, AL-Mg contents of treated samples (Table 1.). Table 1.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1809 The direction of opposed changes in NO3-N and NH4-N content of samples indicate favourable conditions in the soil in which the speed of nitrification could be increased. Increasing in important nutrient contents for plants contribute to the better development of plants.

Changes in soil biological parameters could be good indicators of soil quality (Szeder et al., 2006). Measured soil biological parameters have not indicate drastic changes in soil quality after digestate treatment. In the treated plots with higher nutrient content we have found higher count of r-strategist and lower count of K-strategist bacteria which indicate favourable conditions for rapid reproduction in good conditions. Digestate effect on the test plant. Soybean is a good protein feed for animal breeding and it is also a good protein source for humans. Hungary is the northern boundary of its growing area. We can find data about the effect of artificial fertilizers on the quality and quantity of soybean yield (Kádár et al., 2004), but there is not any publication about the effect of digestate on soybean. In the future it will be an important question, because the number of biogas plants will increase and plants with high protein content are getting more and more important. Plant production is cheeper than animal breeding, therefore plant species with high protein content could replace the animal-originated protein. Measuring the plant samples, we have found that the heigh of treated plants were lower than control ones. Although these differences were not significant, it is worth to note that digestate treatments caused burning of test plants, but some days later they recovered and grew more, but lower sprouts. These sprouts were very productive, the number of pods were higher in treated samples. The effect of treatment is stronger on the weight of pods. Data show, that digestate treatment caused more than two times increase in weight of pods compared to the control plants. This increase can also be found in the results of seed and thousand seed weight (Table 3.). Therefore digestate seems to be a very effective nutrient source for soybean. Crop yield is very important economical parameter of plant production, but nowadays the quality of foods is becoming more and more important. Therefore we investigated the oil and protein content and amino acid composition of test plants. The oil content of the treated plants decreased significantly (p&lt;0.05), compared to the control. While oil and protein content usually change in opposite direction, and also, Banik and Nandi</p><p id="Pg416">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1810 (2004) have found increasing protein content in digestate-treated oyster mushroom, we expected an increase in protein and amino acid content of soybean after digestate treatment. The results of this investigation verified our hypothesis, because we have found 30.65±1.42 % protein in control plants, while these values were 34.83±1.50 % and 35.67±1.81 % for 5 and 10 L m-2 treatments, respectively. Changes in amino acid composition of test plants are very favourable, because almost every essential and nonessential amino acid quantity is increased significantly after digestate treatment.

Conclusions Studying the effect of digestate as a nutrient source is very important nowadays, because probably there will be operated a lot of biogas plants in Hungary within some years. Our results show, that digestate application increased the yield and improved the content value of soybean, increased the nutrient content of soil and have not caused any drastic changes in soil quality. Doing experiments with the digestate is important, because different plants react in different ways to it. Type of soils are very different which can be modified the effect of digestate. We can use the digestate in an environmentally sound way, if we know its effects as well as the plants and soils reactions on digestate application.

A rapid depletion of selenate was observed in mixed root-soil compartment, which correlated well with high phytoavailability of this Se form. In a root and root hair-free rhizosphere soil (0-3.5 mm), however, the Se was not mobilized. Neither 1 mg kg -1 selenite nor 1 mg kg -1 selenate have not influenced significantly the number of spore forming microbes or microscopic fungi in the soil, as compared to control. Keywords: fodder radish, rhizosphere, countable microbes, selenium accumulation, rhizobox experiment Introduction Surface soils of the world contains in average 0.33 mg kg-1 selenium (Se). The solubility of Se in most soils is rather low; therefore many agricultural areas of the world, including Hungary, produces crop plants and forage with low Se content. Most agricultural crops contain &lt;1 mg Se kg-1 dry weight, the mean Se contents of all food plants do not exceed 0.1 mg kg-1. In naturally Se-enriched soils, in poorly drained or calcareous soils, in soils of semiarid or arid zones, and also in soils amended with sewage sludges or fly ashes, however, Se may be accumulated in plants and this could be toxic to grazing animals. Generally selenates (Se6+) are well available for plants, while phytoavailability of selenites (Se4+) is low (Barceleoux, 1999; Kádár, 1999; Terry et al., 2000). This was confirmed in our preliminary pot experiments when one order of magnitude more Se was accumulated in fodder radish and Indian mustard grown in selenate than selenite contaminated soil (Simon et al., 2006ab). Rhizosphere is the narrow region of soil that is directly influenced by root secretions and associated soil microorganisms. It plays important role in the mineral nutrition of plants. Rhizosphere bacteria can enhance the accumulation of Se in plants (deSouza et al., 1999). Plants with microbes in their rhizosphere can convert inorganic Se to volatile forms, predominantly dimethylselenide during the process called phytovolatization (Terry et al., 2000; Simon, 2004). The aim of our work was to study the rhizosphere processes in the selenium accumulation of fodder radish test plant. Materials and methods A novel rhizobox was used for our experiment as described by Fitz et al. (2003). The rhizoboxes were made from acrylic material, and consists from 3 detachable compartments. All compartments were filled up with 750 grams of dried and sieved (&lt;2mm) Ramann’s brown forest soil (loamy sand with 15.8% clay+silt content; pHKCl 6.6; humus content 1.3%; CEC 18.1 cmolc kg -1). The soil was artificially contaminated</p><p id="Pg418">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1812 with 1 mg kg-1 of selenium in the form of sodium selenite or sodium selenate (Fluka, Germany) 2 weeks prior to the experiment. The control soil was treated with distilled water only. Seeds of fodder radish (Raphanus sativus L. convar. oleiformis Pers., cv. Leveles olajretek) were sown into the central compartment. Root growth was restricted to the central compartment by a 30-µm mesh size nylon net. After 8 weeks of plant growth in a growth chamber the rhizoboxes were dismantled, and with special soil slicing device various soil samples were taken (Figure 1). Selenium content of soil and plant samples was analysed by ICP-MS technique (X7 series, Thermo Elemental, UK). The pHKCl of the soil samples was determined with WTW pH320 equipment (Weilheim, Germany). Abundance of some countable microbes (total number of heterothrophs, spore forming bacillii, microscopic fungi, and fluorescent-type Pseudomonas sp. were determined in soil and in root samples as described by Simon et al. (2006a). The experiment was set up with 3 replicates. Figure 1. Scheme of rhizoboxes used in the experiment with places of soil sampling Results and discussion Figure 2 shows the rate of Se accumulation in fodder radish grown in rhizoboxes. Figure 2. Selenium accumulation of fodder radish grown in rhizoboxes (growth chamber rhizobox experiment, Nyíregyháza - Hungary 2007, n=3) The Se content of control plants was negligible.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1813 contaminated with selenite. This confirms that selenate is taken up metabolically by plants, whereas selenite is largely taken up by passive processes at low level. Selenate is taken up through the same binding sites in the plant roots as sulphate. Fodder radish similarly to other Brassicaceae is known to have an intensive sulphur metabolism (Barceleoux, 1999; Máthé-Gáspár et al., 2007; Terry et al., 2000). Figure 3 shows the Se concentrations in soils variously affected by roots. There were no significant changes in the Se contents of the control, uncontaminated soil. In the mixed soil-root compartment (central compartment where roots densely netted the soil) the rate of Se depletion was considerable higher in case of selenate than selenite treatment. This is in agreement with the considerable higher Se uptake of plants from selenate-treated soils (Figure 2). It was surprising, that in root and root hair free rhizosphere soil (0-3.5 mm) the Se was not mobilized, and the highest Se concentrations were detected there. This suggest that organic chelates or acids excreted by roots does not have a direct role in the uptake of Se. Figure 3. Selenium content in mixed soil-root compartment, in rhizosphere soil and in bulk soil (growth chamber rhizobox experiment, Nyíregyháza - Hungary 2007, n=3) Generally exudates excreted by roots lowers the pH in the rhizosphere soil, promoting this way the uptake of micronutrients. In our experiment the pHKCl was 7.76, 7.74 and 7.75 for mixed soil-root compartment, 7.75, 7.69 and 7.62 for 0-3.5 mm rhizosphere soil, 7.78, 7.54 and 7.62 for 3.5-7 mm rhizosphere soil, 7.74, 7.51 and 7.65 for bulk soil (at the end of the experiment) in case of control, selenite and selenate cultures, respectively. In soil richly netted by roots the pH is slightly higher than in bulk soil. According to Neumann and Römheld (2002) excess uptake of anions (in our case selenite, selenate, and presumably sulphate) over cations leads to net removal of protons in the rhizosphere and to increase in rhizosphere pH. For the rhizosphere higher microbial biomass and activity is characteristic than for bulk soil (Neumann and Römheld, 2002). Among investigated microbes (total countable heterotrophs, spore formers and microscopic fungi) the spore forming bacillii and micromycetes were dominant in the soil of rhizoboxes. Neither 1 mg kg-1 selenite nor 1 mg kg-1 selenate have not influenced significantly the number (colony forming units  CFU) of these microbes, as compared to control. Similar tendency was observed in case of Pseudomonas sp., which abundance was slightly lower in selenite than in selenatetreated soil (data not shown). Pseudomonas and Bacillus species are “plant-growth promoting rhizobacteria” (Biró, 2007), and it can be supposed that can stimulate the Se 227 344 231 1064 217 964 213 925 701 958 844 555 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 Control 1 mg/kg Na-selenite 1 mg/kg Na-selenate S el en iu m i n s o il (  g /k g ) Mixed soil -root compartment Rhizosphere soil (0-3.5 mm) Rhizosphere soi l (3.5-7.0 mm) Bulk soil</p><p id="Pg420">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

The abundance of spore forming Bacillus genus, fluorescent-type Pseudomonas sp., the total number of heterotrops and microscopic fungi were also determined in the soil of rhizoboxes, and in the roots of fodder radish. There were no statistically significant differences in CFU values in bulk soil, root and root hair free rhizosphere soil (3.5-7.0 mm; 0-3.5 mm), mixed soil-root compartment or in the surface of plant roots (data not shown). Conclusions Higher phytoavailability of selenate against selenite was verified in the rhizobox experiment, which was in agreement of rapid depletion of selenate in mixed soil-root compartment. The highest Se concentrations were detected in a root and root hair-free rhizosphere soil (0-3.5 mm), suggesting that exudates secreted by roots does not play direct role in Se mobilization. Countable microbes proved to be insensitive for 1 mg kg-1 selenite or 1 mg kg-1 selenate soil treatments. Acknowledgements This work was sponsored by Hungarian OTKA T43479 and T46610 projects.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1815 SOIL SALINIZATION IN DANUBE LOWLAND OWING TO SALT TOLERANCE OF CROPS Anežka ČELKOVÁ – František BURGER Slovak Academy of Sciences, Institute of Hydrology, Račianska 75, 831 02 Bratislava, Slovak Republic, e-mail: celkova@uh.savba.sk Abstract: A considerable part of the salt affected soils of Slovakia occurs in the Danube Lowland. Results of monitoring confirm that the formation of salt affected soils is also in progress at present, particularly both by accumulation of water-soluble salts within the profile - i.e. through the process of salinization, as well as through binding sodium in the colloidal soil complex - i.e. the process of alkalization. Potential danger of spreading of the salt affected soils is realistic here especially in the case of climatic changes towards warmer and drier conditions, but also due to antropogeneous effects. Especially crop varieties and species with a quite low salt resistance are grown here. Into the future, from mentioned results, the need of cropping pattern innovation from high sensitive crops to salinity of soil on more resistant crops on salts. Keywords: soil salinity, mineralised groundwater, crop`s salt tolerance, Danube Lowland Introduction The general characteristics and basic principles involved in the identification, reclamation and management of salt-affected soils are the same throughout the world for instance in Slovakia (Burger, Čelková, 2003, 2007; Kováčová, 2007) and in Hungary also (Kovács, Tóth, Marth, 2006, 2007; Várallyay, 1994). However, differences from place to place in soil characteristics, climate, water availability, farm management capability and financial resources lead to differences in method, extent and rapidity of soil reclamation (Blaskó, 2007; Farooq, Azam, 2007). Saline soils on the Danube Lowland are characterized by the fact that they do not constitute continuous areas; they emerge as “islands” between the surrounding carboncreating meadow and alluvial agricultural soils, with which they create soil complexes. The largest locations of saline soils are to be found in its lower part in the territory of the towns of Zlatná na Ostrove, Veľké Kosihy, Čalovec and Komárno. In the Danube alluvium, between Komárno and Štúrovo, they are to be found especially in the territory of the towns of Patince, Mužla, Obid and Štúrovo. Saline soils monitoring results, i.e. results of analyses of the saturated soil paste extract and results of soil water extract analyses confirm that saline soils are even currently being formed. In warm and dry periods with high evapotranspiration and intense evaporative water regime, accumutation of salts grows, while in climatically wetter periods soluble salts and fixed sodium are washed to deeper layers. Therefore altering dry and wet years is a significant regulator or an inhibitor of spreading and forming of salt affected soils within the given area. Materials and methods The following factors were monitored as part of soil monitoring on the Danube Plain:  salinization of soils by determining the electrical conductivity (ECe) of saturated soil paste extract and content of free salts soluble in the water contained in the soil (evaporation residue);  alkalization of soils by determining the exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP)in saturated soil paste extract;</p><p id="Pg422">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1816  salinization nature by determining the content of anions and cations in the soil water extract. The presence or accumulation of excessive amounts of dissolved salts in the soil root zone and its negative effect on the productivity of agricultural crops is a general problem. Generally, agricultural crops are relatively tolerant during germination, but they become more sensitive during sprouting and in the early growth stages of the seedlings; therefore, it is necessary to keep the salinity in the root zone low in this period. If the salinity levels reduce the crop, the potential yield will drop by far more than anticipated in the data on salt tolerance given in table 1 according to Maas and Hoffman (1977). Table 1.

Results and discussion The saline soil monitoring results, i.e. the results of analyses of the saturated soil paste extract (ECe, ESP) and the results of analyses of the soil water extract confirm that saline soils are being generated on Danube Lowland even currently, via the salinization and alkalization processes. The considerable variability of ECe and ESP values in the individual years points to their dependence on climatic conditions, especially on precipitation (figures 1, 2, 3) and precipitation and groundwater level (figure 4). The ECe values of 0.30-6.0 dS.m -1 and ESP values of 1-10% demonstrate a lower intensity of both processes, whereby the alkalization process is more marked and thus dominant. The considerable variability of ECe and ESP values in the past years indicates their dependence on climatic conditions, especially rainfall. This demonstrates mild or initial</p><p id="Pg423">VII.

The content of exchange sodium in the saturated soil paste extract complex over 5% constitutes the criterion for distinguishing the beginning of the soil alkalization process. This process is more considerable in the soils of the southern part of Danube s. Figure 1.

Cereal Research Communications 1818 Conclusions Saline soils on the Danube Lowland have all the potential conditions for expansion. These include very warm and dry climatic conditions, the evaporation type of the soil water regime, high potential evapotranspiration, excessive and continuously increasing groundwater mineralization with a shallow water table right below the ground surface. Especially crop varieties and species with a quite low salt resistance are grown here. The nature of the groundwater chemical composition and the alternation of dry and humid climatic periods, in which salts are accumulated and subsequently infiltrated into lower soil profile layers, invoke a relatively moderate intensity of occurrence and generation of saline soils. However, inspite of all this, a more significant expansion of these soils is realistic. This ensues from two factors: climatic changes leading to semiarid conditions, and human activities, which significantly affect the hydrological conditions in the territory. Into the future, from mentioned results the need of cropping pattern innovation from high sensitive crops to salinity of soils on resistant crops on salts. The salt tolerance classification according to soil salinity on the Danube Lowland is necessary for practical purposes.

The realisation of this genetically determined trait is greatly affected by environmental factors, principally the amount of water that can be taken up from the soil. Four maize non-related inbred lines and their hybrids were examined in diallel experiments for two years (2006-2007) in Martonvásár, Hungary in order to clarify the effect of water-supply on the genetically determined characteristics of grain filling. GCA values of the grain filling rate and thousand-seed weight proved that two lines transmitting favourable grain filling and thus suitable to be used as gene donors or parent lines in breeding programmes can be selected. Keywords: maize, grain filling, seed weight, water supply Introduction Wide-ranging utilisation of maize grain yield has become a significant factor since it is demanded not only as forage but also as a raw material for starch and bioethanol production. To make plant production competitive, highly adaptive, good yielding maize hybrids that are economical to produce can be bred by developing the optimal combination of parent lines with favourable traits. The beneficial genetic characteristics of maize hybrids can be completely exploited under particular environmental conditions. Grain yield and starch yield are influenced by the amount of assimilates accumulates in the grain during grain filling. The realisation of this genetically determined trait is greatly affected by environmental factors, principally the amount of water that can be taken up from the soil. The objective of our experiments was to clarify the effect of water-supply on the genetically determined characteristics of grain filling. Materials and methods Four maize non-related inbred lines - being parental lines of registered maize hybrids - and their hybrids were examined in diallel experiments for two years (2006-2007) in Martonvásár, Hungary. The experiment was carried out in 4 repetitions, in randomized complete block design layout, at the same location, using the same agrotechnical procedures. The soil of experimental plot was loamy chernozem with good water management. The flowering dates of genotypes examined were similar (78-80 days after sowing). Three cobs were collected from the parent lines and their hybrids respectively 40, 60 and 80 days after 50% silking. The grain of the sample cobs were mixed and dried in drying chamber at 105°C. Thousand grain weight was calculated from the weight of 100 dry grains measured. Grain filling rate (GFR) representing the daily increase in thousand grain weight (g day-1) between sampling dates was also calculated.

The values of Specific combining ability (SCA) were significant only in the stage of intensive grain filling (between the first and second samplings). Reciprocal effects do not play a statistically verifiable role in the inheriting of the trait.

The data reveal that parent lines MVE02 and MVE04 transmits fast grain filling. In the drier year, MVE02 responded to unfavourable water supply with fast grain filling. MVE04 behaved similarly under wet conditions. The good grain filling traits of MVE04 manifest less in its hybrids in drier years. The analyses were performed on the values of thousand grain weight as well, since it is important that – beside intensive material transport – the absolute value of dry matter accumulated in the grain is adequate. From the aspects of plant breeding, beside favourable grain weight and adequate grain filling rate, it is important that these traits manifest also in the hybrids and they are influenced by environmental conditions to a minimal extent, thus ensuring a suitable basis for good adaptability. In accordance with GCA results (Table 2.), the lines transmitting the less beneficial grain filling characteristics were selected. These lines were MVE01 and MVE03. The lines MVE02 és MVE04 showed positive general combining ability both years in all samplings. Table 2.

At this stage, 50-70% of the final thousand grain weight was realised. At this stage, the grain’s dry matter content is increased by as intensive grain filling as physiologically possible, therefore, GCA values of genotypes are similar and characterise an intermediate phase as the final thousand grain weight is not achieved. For some genotypes (such as MVE03), it can be demonstrated at this early stage that they cannot reach larger grain weight. The line MVE01 transmits favourable grain filling up to the date of first sampling (the first third of grain filling), while it falls behind the other parent lines examined at the second and third sampling dates. The data in Table 2. also reveal that the negative GCA values of MVE01 and MVE03 were similar both years, consequently, the difference in water supply did not have an effect on the data. Therefore, it can be stated that the lines unable to realise higher grain weight per se or in their hybrids make an effort to reach the germ’s minimum nutrient supply regardless of the unfavourable changes in environmental factors. However, to realise the advantageous performance of lines transmitting higher thousand grain weight, suitable transport of assimilates demanding good water supply is required. Conclusions On the basis of the diallel analysis of the four inbred lines and their hybrid combinations examined, the two lines transmitting favourable grain filling and thus suitable to be used as gene donors or parent lines in breeding programmes can be selected. Our results</p><p id="Pg428">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1822 showed that while different water supply levels have a pronounced effect on the grain filling performance of inbred lines and their hybrids with higher seed weight, the inbred lines and hybrids with lower seed weight are not as much dependable on it. It may be caused by that the development of the germ in the maize grain is more strictly protected genetically and beyond providing the minimal amount of reserved nutrients needed for germination and early development of young plants, the increase in reserved nutrient (starch) content supplies the germ with additional energy source thus this trait is controlled less strictly. Consequently, the rising of starch content which positively correlates with seed weight (Hegyi et al., 2007) requires good water supply. Maize yield varies greatly between years (Nagy, 2006) and in dry years, starch content can be raised by irrigation (Josipovic et al., 2007). In the years of our experiment the largest variation was found between GCA values of grain filling rate at inbred lines with better grain filling. This variation in GFR GCA values was observed between sampling dates: unfavourable water supply conditions force the genotypes to accelerate the grain filling process in order to obtain the minimal starch supply. Thus, the time between silking and physiological maturity decreased - consequently the generative phase shortened. This could be one of the reasons of the variability of generative phase described by Marton et al. (2005). The year with more precipitation lowered the intensity of grain filling during the periods observed, but it lasted longer, and the physiological maturity occurred at a higher grain moisture level - this could explain why higher water supply can increase the moisture content at harvest (Pók et al.,2004) References Hegyi, Z., Pók, I., Szőke, C., Pintér, J.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1823 EFFECT OF SOYBEAN CULTIVAR ON ENDOPARASITIC NEMATODES AND ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI RELATIONSHIP Ivana MAJIĆ 1 – Marija IVEZIĆ 1 – Emilija RASPUDIĆ 1 – Vesna GANTNER 2 1 Department of Plant Protection, Faculty of Agriculture, J. J. Strossmayer University of Osijek, Trg Sv. Trojstva 3, Osijek, Croatia, imajic@pfos.hr 2 Zootechnical Department, Faculty of Agriculture, J. J. Strossmayer University of Osijek Abstract: Endoparasitic nematodes (EPN) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are widespread in rhizosphere and roots and have opposite effects on plant health. Since, there is direct competition for space, the mutual antagonism between EPN and AMF has been observed. The objectives were to determine the effect of soybean cultivars on EPN in roots and root length colonization by AMF and their correlation. The cultivar effects and relationship between EPN and AMF colonization in soybean roots has been observed in roots of seven soybean cultivars, in randomized complete block design experiment. Significant differences were found between cultivars for the root infection by EPN and AMF colonization depending on the month of investigation. Relationship between the cultivars concerning interaction between EPN and AMF was found to be positive or negative depending on the cultivar and the month. Three cultivars (OS-1-0, OS-2-I, and OS-3-I) had strong negative correlation while the strength of correlation of other cultivars was weak. Our results suggest that mutual inhibition between EPN and AMF in soybean roots existed depending on the cultivar and the plant genotype as such affects their relationship. Keywords: soybean cultivar, endoparasitic nematodes, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, root colonization Introduction Plant parasitic nematodes (PPN) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are widespread in rhizosphere and roots. Both are biotrophic and share plant roots as resources of food and space. They have substantial but contrary effect on plant health (Brundrett, 1991). Often referred as “unseen enemies”, PPN are considered as the most damaging plant pests worldwide (Pinochet et al., 1996). Annual yield losses due to PPN damage are estimated to be over 20% and economic loss of US $ 77 billion on major crops around the world (Jung and Wyss, 1999). Depending on their feeding strategy, PPN may be ectoparasitic or endoparasitic with sedentary or migratory forms in each category. Unlike ectoparasitism, endoparasitism refers to the complete penetration of the nematode into plant tissue while feeding. The beneficial effects of AMF on plant health have been related to increased uptake of the nutrients, facilitated water absorption and tranclocation as well as other benefits for great variety of plant species (Harley and Smith, 1983; Bíró and Takács, 2006). Environmental factors, such as nutrient availability are considered to be of importance for mychorrhizal formation (Takács et al., 2006; Villányi et al, 2006.; Füzy et al., 2007). Since, there is direct competition for space, the mutual antagonism between endoparasitic nematodes (EPN) and AMF has been regarded as potential for AMF plants to provide tolerance or resistance to PPN and reduce the use of pesticides that is substantial for maintaining soil health and sustainable agricultural farming (Hol and Cook, 2005; Bencsik et al., 2007; Sudaric et al., 2007). Interactions between ectoparasitic nematodes and AMF are less strong if compared to those between EPN and AMF. Neverthless, contradictory results on PPN and AMF interactions are reviewed by Hol and Cook (2005). Migratory endoparasites, such as root-lesion (Pratylenchus spp.) nematode directly affect AMF by feeding on and killing cells that contribute to AMF nutrition. In addition, nematode population in presence of</p><p id="Pg430">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1824 AMF was reduced on average by 21% and AMF colonization in presence of nematodes on average by 9%. The same authors suggest that the net effect of their interaction depends on the environment, plant genotype, nematode species and fungal isolates. The objectives of this study were to study the potential effect of soybean cultivar on infection of roots by EPN and root length colonization by AMF as well as to determine correlation between EPN and AMF in roots of seven soybean cultivars. Materials and methods The research was carried out at the Agricultural Insitute Osijek, Croatia in 2006. The experiment was designed as a randomized complete block. The soil and roots samples of 7 soybean cultivars that originated from the soybean breeding program at the Institute Osijek (named OS-cultivars) were collected monthly in July, September and October in four replicates. Nematode extraction from soil followed the Erlenmeyer method (Seinhorst, 1955). In order to determine presence of EPN in soil, nematodes were determined to the genera according to the keys described by Bongers (1994). EPN in roots were determined according to the acid fuchsin root staining method (Byrd et al., 1983). To detect nematodes in roots a 0.30 g aliquot of stained roots were spread in Petri dish and observed under dissecting microscope. For AMF colonization root samples were taken from fresh roots and stained with acid fuchsin-lactic acid according to Kormanik and McGraw (1982) and assayed by grid-line intersection method by Giovannetti and Mosse (1980). Population data of EPN in roots were log10 transformed. The effect of soybean cultivars on EPN and AMF colonization relationship was tested by the analysis of variance using the GLM procedure of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., 2000). Duncan’s multiple range tests was used to test the significance of the difference between the tested soybean cultivars by each month (P &lt; 0.05 ). Results and discussion Nematode extraction from soil revealed presence of 3 genus of EPN. Since, the migratory endoparasitic genus Pratylenchus spp. (root lesion nematode) was the most dominant in all soil samples for all investigated soybean cultivars (other two genus of EPN were present in very low numbers in only few soil samples) presumably root lesion nematodes were found penetrated in soybean roots. Basic statistics of root infection by EPN and root colonization by AMF (%) by month are presented in Table 1.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1825 In September, the population of EPN (g root-1) reached the highest peak for all except one cultivar (OS-2-0) and percentage of root colonized by AMF decreased for all except 3 cultivars if compared to July (Tab. 2). In September, due to the larger root system compared to those in July, plants provide more infection sites for EPN and AMF to feed and reproduce (Pinochet et al., 1996). However, only 3 cultivars (OS-1-I, OS-2-I and OS-3-I) increased percentage of AMF colonization while nematodes increased numbers for the most of the cultivars that could indicate antagonism between EPN and AMF. For this reason, correlation was calculated between EPN and AMF by cultivars for data collected in September 2006.

Significant differences between the cultivars for AMF colonization were found in all months (Tab. 2). Positive correlation between EPN and AMF was found only in 2 soybean cultivars while 5 cultivars were negatively correlated (Tab. 2). Although it was positive, correlation between EPN and AMF in cultivars OS-1-00 (r= 0.190) and OS-3-0 (r= 0.367) was not strong and could be result of environmental and other influence. Relationship between EPN and AMF was strongly negatively correlated for cultivars OS-1-0, OS-2-I, and OS-3-I. The mechanisms indicating the suppresion of the EPN population or AMF colonization observed in our experiment remain speculative. Overall, the results reveal the diversity of soybean cultivars in terms of susceptibility of cultivars to EPN and AMF. Since the interaction between EPN and AMF was found in all investigated cultivars it implies that soybean cultivars could have effect on EPN and AMF relationship. Conclusion The data presented here confirm the interaction between EPN and AMF when they occur in the same root system. Since, EPN and AMF were found to be either positively or negatively correlated depending on the soybean cultivar it corresponds to the fact that plant genotype is one of the main factors influencing interaction between EPN and AMF. The soybean cultivars found to have negative correlation between EPN and AMF</p><p id="Pg432">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Such research will generate useful information that contributes to developing resistance and/or tolerance against EPN by AMF in soybean and could become promising alternative to environmentally detrimental use of pesticides.

Our aim was to point out the possible differences in the lipid composition in case of bacterium strains of certain bacterium species which are living in the four different and diversely polluted ecological habitats. The environment can change and affect the bacterial lipid composition. The diversity of microorganism in soil is a critical factor, regarding the maintenance of good soil health. Changes in fatty acid composition of bacteria can indicate the environmental load on soils. According to our results, we can establish that different soil pollutions induce qualitative and quantitative changes in the lipid composition of microorganisms. FAME (fatty acid methyl-ester)-analysis can be effectively used for demodulation of environmental stress factors. According to our results, we can establish that different soil pollutions induce qualitative and quantitative changes in FAME composition of Bacillus brevis strains, among others: 2-OH 10:0, C12:0, 2-OH 12:0, 3-OH 12:0, C14:1, C14:0 i-15:0, a-15:0 C15:1. Keywords: Fatty acid profile, Bacillus brevis, contaminated soil. Introduction As a result of human activities, previously cultivated and uncultivated lands can often get contaminated and easily become illegal dumpling sites, e.g. communal wastewater can be deposited on them. Accumulation of different pollutants in soil influences the composition of microbial communities and has an effect on certain strains of microorganisms (Birkás et al., 2006). The environment can change and affect the bacterial lipid composition. Kaur et al., 2005 examined the impact of environmental stress effects on PLFA-composition of soils. A set of certain specific PLFAs, viz. trans/cis ratio of monounsaturated fatty acids (16:1ω7, 18:1ω7), cyclopropyl (cy17:0 and cy19:0) fatty acids, were able to distinguish the stressed environmental conditions such as heavy metal addition, tillage, organic compound toxicity, starvation and increased soil temperature. According to Halbitter and Uzinger, 2005, examinations on soil microbiota on the basis of phospholipids, probably help to predict the changes in soils with complete certainty as well as to explore the changes of conditions inside the soil. Changes in bacterial fatty acid profile could generate a modification in function and virulence of the given bacteria species. These changes could be important for enabling the bacteria to partake in the transformation of inorganic and organic contaminants through utilizing new nutrient and/or energy sources and to adapt for the altered environmental conditions (Fouchard et al., 2005). When the areas become cultivated again, modified microflora of polluted areas may have an influence on the state of the soil (Tarnawa and Klupács, 2006). The diversity of microorganisms in soil is a critical factor, regarding the maintenance of good soil health because microorganisms are involved in many important soil functions such as carbon and nitrogen cycling, and organic-matter transformation (Parkinson, Coleman, 1991). Our aim was to reveal the changes in fatty acid composition of microorganisms which occur as a result of different environmental effects. Bacillus strains were selected from</p><p id="Pg434">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1828 the soil of sampling sites. During our investigations, fatty acid composition of Bacillus brevis strains was compared after methylation, with the help of gas chromatography. Materials and methods Sampling sites Our sampling sites were pointed out near Beregdaróc and Beregsurány (villages east part of Hungary), on two previously cultivated areas which have been recently used as illegal dumpling sites. Samples were collected from a legal dumpling site in Gelénes (village east part of Hungary) for comparison, and an unpolluted area was chosen as a control site (forest near to the Hungarian-Ukrainian border). Sample preparation Soil samples were taken from three different points of the contaminated landfill and of the control sites. Samples were homogenized and 1 g soil sample was weighed out, shaken with 100 ml distilled water. Cells were developed on Nutrient culture media and then genus were isolated by using Gram dying and spore dying as usual. The determination of species were done by gas chromatography (Hewlet Packard 7890A), and peaks were identified using bacterial fatty acid standards and MIDI peak identification software (MIDI, Inc., Newark, DE). Fatty Acid Methyl Ester Analysis 40 mg bacteria cells from the pure culture were weighed out in teflon srew-cap tube to 0.01 mg accuracy. Cells were lysed and saponified with 1 ml of 3 M sodium hydroxide methanol solution. Tube was vortexed and placed into ultrasonic bath for 5 min and heated at 100 oC for 30 min and then the tube was left to cool to room temperature. 5 ml of deionised water and 5 ml of diethylether were added to the tube. The tube was shaken gently for 1-2 minutes and after the separation the top phase was pipetted into round bottom flask. 1-2 drops of cc HCl was added to the bottom aqueous phase and the partitioning was repeated twice more with 5 ml of diethyl ether, the top phases were collected into the round bottom flask. Methylation procedure was carried out as follows: 2 ml of boron trifluoride methanol solution and a piece of boiling stone were added to the sample and it was refluxed for 30 min. Methylated solution was placed into separatory funnel. The round bottom flask was washed with diethyl ether and this solution was also added into separatory funnel. 5 ml of saturated sodium chloride solution was added. After the separation the bottom aqueous phase was discarded. Then the partitioning was repeated twice more with 10 ml of deionised water. The bottom phase was discarded. The top phase was dried on anhydrous sodium sulphate and evaporated in heater box at 40 oC under air stream. The residue was redissolved in 1 ml of n-hexane and was applied for GC runs. Results and discussion According to our results (Table 1) we can establish that the following fatty acid methylesters can not be found in Bacillus brevis strains which were collected from the various sampling sites: C6:0, C8:0, C10:0, C11:0, C13:0, C21:0, C20:4n6.</p><p id="Pg435">VII.

Percentage of i-15:0 FAME is significantly higher in the samples of Gelénes and Beregsurány than it is on the control site, however, an inverse tendency can be observed in case of a-15:0 isomer, which occurs in significantly higher quantities on the control area than on the other sites. Percentages of C16:1 as well as of C19:2 FAME are significantly different on every sampling sites. In comparison with the control samples, percentage of C18:2(9,12) is significantly higher in the samples of the other sampling sites. Conclusions Microbial state of the soil plays an important role in sustainable cultivation, and as an indicating signal of preliminary changes, it can be used for detecting the ecological status of the soil. Changes in fatty acid composition of bacteria can indicate the environmental load on soils such as heavy metal contamination, waste deposition, organic pollutants. According to our results, we can establish that different soil pollutions induce qualitative and quantitative changes in the lipid composition of microorganisms. FAME (fatty acid methyl-ester)-analysis can be effectively used for demodulation of environmental stress factors. References Birkás, M. – Dexter, A. R. – Kalmár, T. – Bottlik, L.: 2006.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1831 CORRELATION OF NUTRIENT CONTENTS AND BIOFERTILIZATION Szilvia VERES 1 – László LÉVAI 1 – Éva GAJDOS 1 – Nóra BÁKONYI 1 1 Institute of Plant Science, Faculty of Agricultural Science, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Böszörményi Street 138., H-4032 Abstract: These research has aimed to study how biofertilization as an option for environmentally friendly supply of nutrients influences plant production as a function of different nutrient supply; what effects the application of biofertilizers exercise on the parameters characterizing photosynthetic efficiency, and consequently what quantitative growth they result in. According to our results, the application of biofertilizers could increase the amount of dry matter production both in a root and shoot of maize. The biofertilizer intensified root growth and increased the relative amount of chlorophyll molecules. The effectiveness of biofertilizaton was the highest in presence of half amount of complete nutrient solution. The absence and normal amount of nutrients reduce positive effect of biofertilization. Keywords: biofertilizer, nutrient contents, spad-index, photosynthetic efficiency Introduction The quantitative growth of dry matters, the sufficient extent of plant production are essential factors with respect to the efficiency of agricultural production. It is an important issue whether the replacement of organic fertilizers and chemical fertilizers with biofertilizers causes a beneficial increase in dry weight (Lévai et al., 2006). Biofertilizers containing less artificial compounds and plant growth promoting bacteria are proper means to reduce or prevent environmental damages. Moreover, in view to plant production similarly important considerations include the quality and condition of soil (Birkás et al., 2006; Várallyay, 2007), climatic conditions (Várallyay, 2007), crop year (Hunyadi Borbély, 2007), existent nutrient level (Tóth et al., 1997; Kádár, 2007), adaptable genotype (Pepó, 2007) and other biotic and abiotic factors. However, the application of biofertilizers under different soil fertility conditions raises some important question. In favour of suitable fertilization, it is very important to know whether biofertilization is effective with the existing nutrient contents or not. Materials and methods Corn seeds (Zea mays, L cv. Norma sc.) were germinated for three days, and thereafter were grown on different nutrient solutions under controlled laboratory conditions. Three different nutrient contents were applied. First of all, a complete nutrient solution (totals) containing 2.0 mM Ca(NO3)2, 0.7 mM K2SO4, 0.5 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM KH2PO4, 0.1 mM KCl, 1 µM H3BO3, 1 µM MnSO4, 1 µM ZnSO4, 0.25 µM CuSO4, 0,01 µM (NH4)6Mo7O24, 10 -4 M FeEDTA was added. The second nutrient solution (1/2ns) applied was a 50% diluted variant of the complete nutrient solution. Thirdly, only distilled water (dw) was used. Concurrently with these treatments, bacteria promoting plant growth and containing a biofertilizer (Phylazonit MC®) was added to the solutions (1ml/l) on the 1st day of the experiments. Phylazonit MC® is a viscous solution containing Azotobacter chroococcum and Bacillus megatherium; these</p><p id="Pg438">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1832 microorganisms help the uptake of nitrogen and other elements, as well as the mobilization in the rhizosphere. The actual amount of the dry matter for shoots and roots was determined with thermal-gravimetric analysis. Relative chlorophyll contents (Spad-index) were detected with SPAD-501 chlorophyll meter (Minolta, Japan).The parameters of in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence were studied with a PAM-2001 (Walz, Germany) modulated light fluorometer as described by Schreiber et al. (1986). Samples were dark-adapted for 30 minutes. After dark adaptation, the initial fluorescence (Fo) was excited by weak light. The maximal fluorescence (Fm) was induced by white saturating flash. Ratio of Fv/Fm was used for characteristics potential photochemical efficiency of PSII. For the evaluation of the results and statistical tests, Microsoft Excel 2003 and SigmaPlot 2001 7.0 applications were used. Results and discussion The applied biofertilizer increased the dry weight contents of both the shoots and roots. In the case of shoots, this impact was more pronounced (Veres et al., 2007). As our results show in Figure 1, the highest dry matter production was found, when the nutrient content was half of the amount of the complete nutrient solution. Under these circumstances, the biofertilizer supplementation caused 30% increased dry weight in the roots and shoots. When nutrient deprivation and normal nutrient supply was applied in parallel with the addition of the biofertilizer, no additionally positive effects of biofertilization could be measured. Figure 1 Dry weight of shoots and roots of maize growing under different nutrient contents and biofertilizer supplementation. n=10 ±s.e., p&lt;0.05* (dw=distilled water, 1/2ns=half of the amount of the complete nutrient solution, totals=complete nutrient solution) In view to the growth of the dry matter, an essential condition is the existence of sufficiently active photosynthesis. A basis of intensive photosynthesis is the presence of photosynthetic pigments in appropriate quantities and qualities. Chlorophyll molecules as the main photosynthetic pigments have a crucial role in the process of the production of organic matters, while changes in their quantities are deemed as indicators with respect to the growth of organic matters (Mészáros, 1984).

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1833 photosynthetic pigments was determined as a Spad-index, as this parameter characterizes the relative total chlorophyll content (Figure 2). Figure 2. Relative chlorophyll contents (SPAD-index) of maize leaves when applying different nutrient contents and treatment with biofertilizer (Phyl). Measurements were made on the second leaf, n=50±s.e., p&lt;0.05* (dw=distilled water, 1/2ns=half of the amount of complete nutrient solution, totalns=complete nutrient solution) The relative chlorophyll contents were higher, when the different nutrient solutions were completed with the biofertilizer. Similarly to the changes of dry weight of maize, the addition of the biofertilizer rose the value of the Spad-index. The extent of the increase was the largest (15%), when half of the amount of the nutrient solution was added alongside with the biofertilizer. The chlorophyll fluorescence induction method is widely used for the examination of the physiological conditions of plants under various stress circumstances. This method excellently characterizes photosynthetic efficiency. The fast and slow phases of chlorophyll fluorescence induction were examined with a PAM-2001 fluorometer (WALZ Gmbh, Germany). The parameters established with the use of the induction curve are properly applicable to the description of photosynthetic efficiency. Thus, from the fast phase of chlorophyll fluorescence induction the optimal photochemical efficiency of PSII can be determined, and it is then quantified as Fv/Fm.

When, however, 50% reduced nutrient contents (1/2ns) were added with the biofertilizer, higher potential photochemical activities could measured. The value of F0 and Fm parameters did not change significantly under different nutrient contents and biofertilizer treatments. Additional measurements of the low phase of chlorophyll fluorescence induction are proposed, which can produce useable information on photochemical efficiencies under these circumstances. Conclusions In view to plant production, inter alia soil–root interactions are basically determinant (Précsényi and Mészáros, 1999). The applied biofertilizer contains beneficial, bacteria (PGPB) promoting plant growth that affect the physiological processes in the roots and consequently in the shoots. Apart from reducing environmental pollutions, biofertilization intensifies root processes, thereby inducing higher dry matter production. The amount of accessible nutrient content can operate these processes, and modify the results of biofertilization. As our results reflected, biofertilization has a positive effect on dry matter production via the increasing content of photosynthetic pigments. Nevertheless, the contents of available nutrient influence the effect of the biofertilizer via the activities of their microorganisms. Biofertilizaton came to be the most effective in presence of half of the amount of complete nutrient solution. The absence and normal amount of nutrients suppress the positive effects of the biofertilizer. References Birkás, M., Dexter, A. R., Kalmár, T. Bottlik, L. 2006.

The comminuting has a lot of form, from the grind by hand to modern roll milling. My first aim was to determine the milling of hard and soft wheat varieties, and measure the particle repartition. The samples were two different kernel hardness of wheat from two different year. The GK Mérő has a soft; the Gk Öthalom and Jubilejnaja 50 have hard kernel hardness. I got two good define results, which can use in practice. Keywords: wheat, kernel hardness, mill Introduction In the last few years, the researches tried to find the method, which is near to the roll milling. The milling parameters will be better, if the aim of the plant breeding is this. The indirect methods aren’t good to characterization the milling. So milling test shows the real milling conditions. The widespread method is, when the kernel interferes with the buffer surface and bandy. There are diverse methods to milling and the different bread-stuffs have a different grinding drift. I examine the different wheat varieties with different disciple methods. BÖLÖNI and CSERMELY (1991) made test with different wheat varieties and grinders, VEHA (1994) measured the efficiency of grinders, VEHA and GYIMES (1999) analyzed the kernel hardness, SZABÓ (2006) also, and BÖLÖNI and BELLUS searched the mathematics model of milling. Materials and methods The Perten 3303 milling machines (Figure 1.) is a disc grinder, the grinding is between a serrulate moving disc and serrulate standing disc. The grinding controls with the distance of disc. There are six positions (0-6), I choose the 0,3,6 positions. The Foss Cyclotec grinder (Figure 2.) is a different method, centrifugal principle, and it is airy. I examine the particle with the Malvern Mastersizer 2000 machine (Figure 3.), it use the Fourier optical methods in the 100-300 μm, but the Malvern firm worked out a new “converse Fourier optical” method. The three samples were the GK Mérő, GK Öthalom and Jubilejnaja 50. The years were: 2003, 2004. The samples were stored. Figure 1. Perten 3303 mill Figure 2.

Cereal Research Communications 1838 The Cyclotec needs more grinding energy, than the Perten mill. The reason is the different operational precept. The energy demand is the same in the three samples even though the kernel hardness is difference. The energy demand is less when I measure with Perten mill, and it shows the different kernel hardness. I determined the useful energy demand in the three positions. The energy demand was triple in the 0 position, than in the 6 position. Conclusions The two machines gave different results in the different year sample and the results of Perten weren’t significant. I used the laser diffraction machine to determine the particle curve. The curves of Perten mill (0 and 3 position) and Cyclotec show two modus. I got two good define results, which can use in practice. So the hard wheat varieties and the soft wheat varieties have different grinding drift and the grinders don’t distort the results, but the energy demand depends on the machine.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1839 LIMING INFLUENCES ON MAIZE AND SUGAR BEET YIELD AND NUTRITIONAL STATUS Manda ANTUNOVIĆ University J. J. Strossmayer, Faculty of Agriculture, Trg Sv. Trojstva 3, HR-31000 Osijek, Croatia; e-mail: mantun@pfos.hr Abstract: The field trial with increased rates of air-dried carbocalk (waste of Osijek Sugar Factory; 39% CaO) was conducted in autumn of 2000 on planosol in the amounts 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 t ha -1 . Liming considerably influenced on maize yields by increases up to 26% (4-year mean) with variation these effects among the years from 7% to even 50%. Yields of sugar beet were increased due to liming up to 43% (30 and 43 t ha -1 , for 0 and 30 t ha -1 of lime, respectively). However, liming was closely related to lower sugar beet root quality (sucrose = 14.6% and 13.4%, amino-N = 2.62 and 4.58 mmol 100 g -1 , for 0 and 60 t lime ha -1 , respectively). By using 60 t carbocalk ha -1 significantly increased maize leaf P (+45%), Ca (+35%), Mg (+57%) and decreased K (-7%), Zn (-54%) and Mn (-71%) compared to the control treatment (3-year means). Analogical comparison for sugar beet leaf (the 2004 growing season only) resulted by differences as follows: P (+57%), Ca (-18%), Zn (-53%), Mn (-90%), B (-36%), and non-significant differences for K, Mg and Na. Mean concentrations of the nutrients in maize leaves found by our study were as follows: 0.344 % P, 2.42% K, 0.812% Ca, 0.332, mg Mg kg -1 , 33.2 mg Zn kg -1 and 130.3 mg Mn kg -1 , respectively. Adequate concentrations of these elements were found in maize leaves with emphasis that by using 60 t of lime ha -1 concentrations of Zn were close to inadeaquate concentration of 20 mg Zn kg -1 . Also, adequate ranges of sugar beet leaf P (mean 0.374% P), K (mean 3.99% K), Ca (1.23% Ca) and Zn (mean 24.5 mg Zn kg -1 ) were found. The levels of leaf B, Mg and Mn were out the adequate ranges (deficit of B: mean 7.4 mg B kg -1 ; oversupplies of Mg and Mn: means 1.18% Mg and 160 mg Mn kg -1 , respectively). Keywords: carbocalk, liming, maize, sugarbeet, nutritional status, yield Introduction Soil degradation processes are oft restricting factors of sustainable development (Varallyay, 2006; Kadar, 2007). Soil acidity is certainly one of the most damaging soil conditions affecting the growth of most crops in Croatia (Kovačević et al., 2006). In general, liming of these soils is a usual recommendation for their improvement. Naturally occuring minerals which are commonly used to raise soil pH are limestone and dolomite. Also, waste products from manufacturing processes using limestone or similar raw materials can be used for neutralising soil acidity (for example, waste from sugar factories). Aim of this study was testing response of maize and sugar beet to liming with carbocalk. Material and methods The field experiment and sample collections Field experiment with increased rates of air-dried carbocalk (waste of Osijek Sugar Factory, about 15% H2O, 39% CaO) was conducted at the beginning of November 2000 on Sopje (Virovitica-Podravina County) planosol (pH in 1n KCl = 3.42) in the amounts as follows: 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 t ha-1. The treatments were distributed in four blocks, each of 350 m2 area. Four replicates were used for each block for maize (basic plot 14 m2 = two 10-m rows) and sugar beet (5 m2) yield determinations. Crop rotation for the</p><p id="Pg446">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1840 2001-2005 period on the experimental field was as follows: maize (2001-2002-2003) – sugar beet (2004) – maize (2005). Ear-leaf of maize were collected at flowering stage (25 leaves in mean sample). Middle leaves of sugar beet from central part of rosete (40 leaves in mean sample) were taken in stage of maximal development of leaf area = the first decade of July). Soil samples were taken to 30 cm of depth in autumn of 2002 after maize harvesting. Mobile fraction of the individual elements in the soil was extracted with NH4 Acetate + EDTA (pH 4.65) according Lakanen and Ervio (1971). Leaf samples were digested by concentrated HNO3+H2O2.The amount of individual elements in the soil and leaf samples was measured by the ICP-AES. Maize (the hybrid OsSK 552 developed in Osijek Agricultural Institute, Croatia) was sown at end of April / beginning of May at planned (theoretical) plant density (TPD) 51020 plants ha-1. Sugar beet (cultivar KW Ramona) was sown at the end of March on planned density 80000 plants ha-1. Maize and sugar beet were harvested manualy at middle of October. Yields of maize were calculated on realized plant density (RPD) and 14% grain moisture basis. RPD was calculated from sum of plant number from four replicates and its multiplication to hectar area. Sugar beet root samples for yield and quality determination were collected from each basic plot (4 x 5m2). Weather characteristics With exception of 2003 (drought and the higher air-temperature stresses) weather for the 2001-2005 period was favorable for maize and sugar beet growing (Table 1). Table 1.

At the same time mobile form of Zn was reduced up to 77% compared to the control (Table 2). Liming considerably influenced on maize yields by increases up to 26% (4-year mean) with variation these effects among the years from 7% to even 50%. The low yields in 2003 were in connection with water shortage and plant density reduction due to unfavorable conditions during emergency stage (Table 3). Sugar beet yields were low (mean 36 t ha-1) and by using 30 t ha-1 of lime they were increased for 43%. However, by lime application of 60 t ha-1 yields were decreased to level of the control (Table 4). Also, liming was closely related to root quality decreasing (lower sucrose contents and the higher contents of amino-N).</p><p id="Pg447">VII.

Conclusions Liming with carbocalk was useful soil management practice for maize and sugar beet yield increases, but its effects were considerably influenced by specific environmental characteristic of individual growing season.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1843 RAPESEED FOR BIODISEL PRODUCTION AND ITS IMPORTANCE FOR ISTRIA RURAL ECONOMY DEVELOPMEMT Ružić PAVLO 1 – Juraković LINDA 2 – Poropat AMORINO 3 1 Department of Tourism, Institute of Agriculture and Tourism, K. Hugues 8, Porec, pavlo@iptpo.hr 2 Department of Tourism , Institute of Agriculture and Tourism 3 Department of Economics and Rural Development, Institute of Agriculture and Tourism Abstract: In this paper we discuss about possibilities of rapeseed production as a base for biodiesel production and its economic effects in rural economy in Istria. Therefore authors examined possibilities for rapeseed production and its possible transverse to oil-biodiesel. Effects of such a production chain could affect rural economy in positive ways. Authors question following effects: what are the natural resources for rapeseed production; is there sufficient rapeseed production as base for oil; how the production chain can affect rural economy. Further authors argue the hypothesis that biodiesel reproduction has possibilities for improvements in agricultural land use, employment and rural economy development. Keywords: rapeseed production, biodiesel, rural economy, Istria Introduction Four agricultural species are dominant for oil production, the first place belongs to rapeseed (according to Mustapić et al. 2006., 85% of all oleiferous plants production), other species like sunflower soya, palm, olive oil are less used in domestic and industrial purpose. The idea of biodiesel production from plants came from Rudolf Diesel which in 1900. on world exhibition in Paris presented the use of diesel motors on plant (peanut) oil production. Because of low crude oil (petroleum) production price, plant oil was not interesting for that time. Nowadays plant oil became more in focus of interest because of price rise of crude oil and lack of new natural wells, therefore regulations of several countries demanded enlarged use of biodiesel. For example in EU by directive 2003/30/EC, all member states were obliged to substitute 2% of crude oil sue with biodiesel until 31. December 2005., and up to 5,75% till 31. December 2010. Till 2020. predictions propose 20% of biodiesel, bioetanol, biogas and biocarbone use. In Croatia possibilities of rapeseed production for biodiesel occur through use of agricultural soils, crop rotations (beside wheat and corn), extra farm income and less use of crude oil. Materials and methods Metodology of research in this paper is based on estimations for rapeseed production possibilities and its impacton production chain and finnaly in effects on rural economy in Istria. We used statistical data by which we used production statistics on World, European and Croatian level. Further, we used methods of comparation and analytics. Using these methods and using literature we have confirmed our hypothesis.</p><p id="Pg450">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1844 Results and discussion On world level four cultures dominate for oil and biodiesel production. The most important is rapeseed, but soya, sunflower and palm trees are also interesting for such use. Rapeseed biodiesel is most similar to crude oil chemical features (table 1). Table 1.

The similarity of rapeseed oil and crude oil (petrol) is widely recognized; therefore rapeseed production is growing each year (table 2). Each five years rapeseed production grows for 10 millions of hectares. Table 2. Land use and production of rapeseed in the world Year Land in 000 ha Yield in 000 t 1990. 17.610 24.428 1995. 23.816 34.185 2000. 25.833 39.515 2005. 26.950 46.409 Source: Ružić P., 2004. Largest producers are China 26,8 % (7220 thousand hectares), and India 25,2 % (6800 thousand hectares) of world production. Europe has 23,2% of world production (6800 thousand hectares), with largest producers Germany and France. In Croatia rapeseed production shares 0,3% of total agricultural land, and 8,7 % of all oil plant production. Agricultural production as a basic economy branch can propose future development in food and industry use of agricultural products and raw materials that reply’s also to production of biodiesel from rapeseed. Market possibilities for biodiesel are not used in sufficient ways of production and sales. Therefore most biodiesel is marketed from import. In Croatia there is only one factory for biodiesel which produces 20 thousand tons per year (Krička et al., 2001). These quantities are not sufficient for Croatian market needs. In 2004. Croatian production was 1.080.000 hectares of rapeseed, what refers to 8,7% of all oil plants. Although production facilities allow much bigger biodiesel production, rapeseed production is not following such needs. From other agricultural cultures, sunflower, soya and corn are less likely to be used for industry, and biodiesel as these are used for human – food use.</p><p id="Pg451">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1845 In production structure of Croatia in 2003. from 94.290 hectares - rapeseed had 15.891 ha(16,85% of total oil plants production), - soya had 50.286 ha (53,33%) - sunflower 28.113 ha (29,82%). In production structure 2004. from 79.811 hectares - rapeseed had 14.299 ha(17,52% of total oil plants production), - soya had 37.131 ha (46,52%) - sunflower 28.381 ha (35,56%). Possibilities of oil plants production in Istria are mainly in river valleys of Mirna river and Raša river. From total land surface in Istria (281.900 thousand hectares), agricultural land has 171.500 hectares from which 98.600 is in active use. From the 72.900 hectares presently not in use (pastures, not ploughed land, and abandoned land) a part could be used for profitable rapeseed production. Climatic conditions of Istria are analyzed and reviewed in literature (Legović, 1997) as Mediterranean climate with temperature variations from 10 C below zero to middle annually temperature as 15 degreeC, and average winter temperature of 7 C. in central parts of Istria there is an influence of continental climate in which the temperature can fall to 20C below zero, average annual temperature is 11 C, a average winter temperature 3,5 C. In climate conditions of Mediterranean climate 65% of agricultural land is present, while 31% is in continental climate conditions. The other 4% is under influence of mountainous climate influence mixed with continental climate. Beside climate conditions Istria differs also in precipitation conditions that are in coastal parts about 823 mm annually in central Istria 1060 mm, and in mountain Učka 3000 mm annually. Most rains fall in spring and autumn. In average coastal parts have 101 days of rain and central parts 132 days of rain. These circumstances allow rapeseed production, especially in river valleys with influence of Mediterranean conditions. Basic reasons of rapeseed production implementation in Istria economy are: ecological reasons of space preservation, production of energy sources which are scarce in Croatia, improvement in income sources of family farms, employment possibilities and finally enlargement in agricultural land use. Conclusions Concluding our discussion about biodiesel production and its chain from rapeseed to biodiesel and its effects on economy we conclude that:  Istria has solid basis for rural economy development which are created by agricultural land, climatic and pedology circumstances.  Istria has possibilities of different ways to develop rural economy in primary production, processing of agricultural raw materials, and other non agricultural activities.</p><p id="Pg452">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1846  Effects of production chains of biodiesel on Istria rural economy are in better agricultural land use, enlargement of agricultural outputs, employment and retaining young people in rural spaces and ecological effects.  Rural economy with improved economy structure implies possibilities for better economical financial effects. All stated connotations confirm our hypothesis that biodiesel can improve agricultural land use and affect positively on Istria rural economy.

Introduction Sweet corn (Zea mays var. saccharata) is a culture with a large number of varieties. Seed companies apply each year a great number of new varieties on variety lists. Selection is forwarded to enlarging harvest in ways to prolongation time of sugar converting into starch (Marton et al. 2007; Nagy, 2007) in order to maintain its quality longer in time. Exact optimal harvesting time considering quality was examined by several authors (Davis, 1997; Diver et al. 2001; Klonsky et al. 1994). However, quality increase has no direct effect on economic value. Therefore it is necessary to determine varieties economic value before wide production use. Marketing aspects like sweet corn consumption was reported by and Wei-fei (2006) for conventional production and by Dickerson (2006) for organic production. Sweet corn as a farm product sells quite well at farmers' markets and other direct-to-consumer venues, and a good-quality product is easily and rapidly sold out in most communities (USDA 2001). The objective of research was to determine profitability of sweet corn varieties in given climate and soil conditions. Materials and methods Field trials were carried out on two locations: Murska Sobota in northeast and Ljubljana in north Slovenia during 2006 and 2007. In experiment we used ten sweet corn varieties: Tasty Sweet Trophy F1, RS 2, RS 15, RX 11 F, Tasty Gold, Sweet Nuget, VMS, Gold Cup, Lj-1/96 Su and Zuckergold. Technological measures and material costs were equal for all varieties. Production and economic results were showed upon average for two years data. Economic analysis of each variety was done with costbenefit method. Direct costs were determined by calculation. Marketing and management fees were 7% of direct costs while operating capital interest was 5%. Ears heavier than 200 g were used for fresh consumption (0.14 EUR piece-1) and lighter for processing (0.24 EUR kg-1, FAOSTAT, 2007). The results were subjected to sensitivity analysis (Kelly et al. 1995) for expected and pessimistic yields which were 20% and 40% lower than optimistic (on experimental plots).</p><p id="Pg454">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

With average quantities 8.73 piece m-2 in Ljubljana and 7.78 piece m-2 in Murska Sobota highest number of ears (fresh ears and processed) were evident for variety Lj-1/96, while lowest ear quantities were observed for Gold Cup; 4.21 piece m-2 in Murska Sobota and 4.60 piece m-2 in Ljubljana (data not showed). It is important to point out that all varieties, except of Tasty Sweet Thropy F1 had larger quantities of ears in Ljubljana. The difference rated less than 13%, only for Zuckergold it was 20%. An important variety feature was piecemeal ear mass because it relies to consumption. Highest ear mass was observed for variety RS 2, in Ljubljana, 311 g piece-1 and Murska Sobota, 231 g piece-1.

Although it didn’t stand out with total ear number (5.56 piece m-2) largest number of ears for fresh sales were harvested by RS 2 (3.45 piece m-2) in both years and locations. Tasty Gold follows with 3.14 piece m-2, than Tasty Sweet Thropy F1 with 3.08 piece m -2 and RS 15 with 3.01 pieces m-2 (both years and locations). Lowest ear numbers for fresh sales were evident for VMS (1.47 piece m2). All varieties had smaller ear number in Murska Sobota comparing to Ljubljana, it rated from 11% for VMS up to 74% for Zuckergold, what proves that this variety is very sensitive to pedology and climate variations.

By monitoring we determined that gross returns depended in first line on ear yield for fresh state, therefore higher quantities of production were achieved in Ljubljana. Gross return higher than 5.500 EUR ha-1 was achieved for varieties where 51% ears were sold in fresh state. In costs structure highest share (cca. 50%) reply’s to human labour costs, respectively to work operations of harvesting and un-husking. Costs level depend on total ear number was lowest for Gold Cup and highest for Lj-1/96 Su. Highest average profit of 3.504 EUR ha-1 was achieved in Ljubljana with RS 2 while in Murska Sobota for Tasty Sweet Throphy F1 with 2.013 EUR ha -1. All cultivars achieved larger profits in Ljubljana because of production results. Loss in sweet corn production of 320 EUR ha-1 was determined only for Zuckergold in Murska Sobota.

Correlation analysis determined that profits were strongly correlated by number of ear for fresh sales (r=0,99, P=0,05) while total ear number wasn’t correlated to profit levels (r=-0,09, P=0,05) (data not show). Profit per work our rated from 11.66 EUR by RS 2 up to 1.49 EUR for VMS. By simulation (Figure 1.) we diminished yield for 20% and determined that losses were gained for VMS production, while by diminishment of 40% profit losses were evident also for Lj-1/96 Su, Gold cup, RX 11 F1and Sweet Nuget. Conclusions Highest profits for sweet corn production were gained for RS 2, Tasty Gold, RS 15 and Tasty Sweet Throphy F1 which reached two criteria: total yield was higher than 5.56 piece m-2 and ear share for fresh sales above 51% of total ear mass. Correlation analysis determined that profits were strongly correlated by number of ear for fresh sales while total ear number wasn’t correlated to profit levels. On changeable agro-ecological circumstances most sensitive was Zuckergold which was characterized by high deviation in financial sense on both locations. Highest sensitivity to yield diminishment showed VMS for which 20% lower yield resulted with production losses. References Davis J.: 1997. Organic Sweet Corn Production.

LONG-TERM FIELD EXPERIMENT Zoltán IZSÁKI Faculty of Agricultural Water and Environmental Management, Tessedik Sámuel College, P. O. Box 3, H-5541 Szarvas, Hungary e-mail: izsaki.zoltan@mvk.tsf.hu Abstract: Long-term chemical fertilisation field experiment was carried out with maize to study the effect of soil P supply on the P-Zn interactions. On chernozem meadow soil at 120-360 mg kg -1 AL-P2O5 and 2.0-3.5 mg kg -1 EDTA-Zn content of cultivated layer the increasing P supplies increased the P and reduced the Zn concentration in the maize leaves at the beginning of tasselling as well as the P/Zn ratio became wider but the higher P supplies did not resulted in Zn deficiency. Keywords: P-Zn interactions, maize, soil P supply Introduction A large number of the former investigations (Csathó et al. 1994, Kádár and Turán 2002, Turán 2003, Banaj et al. 2006, Izsáki 2007) reported that maize is especially sensitive to Zn deficiency. The most frequent causes of Zn deficiency in maize are: low total Zn concentrations in soils (especially sandy, calcareous and sodic soils), low availability (high pH of soils), high level of soil P status and restricted root zones due to soil compaction or high water table (Bergmann and Neubert 1976, Bukvic et al. 2003). Kádár and Turán (2002) considered the optimum AL-soluble P2O5 content in the ploughed layer of calcareous chernozem soil for the maize was 100-150 mg kg-1, while the optimum Zn content determined by KCI+EDTA method was 2-3 mg kg-1. The adequate P concentration in the leaf at tasselling of maize amounts to 0,25-0,45%, while the Zn concentration ranges from 15 to 25 mg kg-1 (Bergmann and Neubert 1976, Reuter and Robinson 1997, Kádár and Turán (2002). The aim of this paper is to discuss the effect of P supplies on the P and Zn concentrations in maize leaves and on grain yield as well as on interactions, based on the result of long-term field experiments. Materials and methods Long-term mineral fertilisation experiments were set up at the Experimental Station of the Crop Production Department, Faculty of Agricultural Water and Environmental Management, Tessedik Sámuel College, Szarvas, in 1989. The soil of the experimental area had the following parameters: chernozem meadow soil, calcareous in the deeper layers, 85–100 cm humus layer, pH(KCl) 5.0–5.2, humus content 3.0–3.2 %, upper limit of plasticity according to Arany (KA) 50, clay content 32 %. During the investigated period (2001-2005) the soil contained the following nutrient supplies in the cultivated layer: AL-Na 60-80 mg kg-1, KCI-Mg 550-650 mg kg-1, EDTA-Mn 280-300 mg kg-1, EDTA-Cu 5-7 mg kg-1 and EDTA-Zn 2,0-3,5 mg kg-1. Fertilisation was carried out in all possible combinations of four levels each of N, P and K, giving a total of 64 treatments, set up in a split-split plot design with three replications, with K fertilisation as the “A” factor, P fertilisation as the “B” factor and N fertilisation as the “C” factor. The following fertiliser rates were applied: nitrogen: N0 = 0, N1 = 80, N2 = 160, N3 = 240 kg N ha –1 year–1; phosphorus (P2O5): P0 = 0, P1 = 100 kg</p><p id="Pg458">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1852 ha–1 year–1, P2 = 500 kg ha –1 in 1989, 1993 and 2001, P3 = 1000 kg ha –1 in 1989, 1993 and 2001; potassium (K2O): K0 = 0, K1 = 300 kg ha –1 year–1 between 1989 and 1992, 100 kg ha–1 year–1 from 1993, K2 = 600 kg ha –1 in 1989 and 2001, 1000 kg ha–1 in 1993, K3 = 1200 kg ha –1 in 1989 and 2001, 1500 kg ha–1 in 1993. The high rates of P and K replenishment fertilisation were used to create clearly distinct supply levels in the soil in order to investigate plant responses to nutrient status. To determine the nutrient status of maize, the leaf opposite the ear was collected from 15 plants per plot at the beginning of tasselling. The leaf samples were analysed in five experimental years (2001–2005) for the following nutrients: N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu. Results and discussion When the long-term experiment was set up in 1989 the AL-P2O5 content of the ploughed soil layer was 156 mg kg-1. During the five years analysed, respresenting years 12-16 of the experimental cycle, the P supply level of the P0 control ranged to 120-143 mg kg-1, indicative of the good P capacity of the soil. Significant yield increases due to the higher P supplies provided by P fertilisation could be observed in four of the five experimental years. Correlation analysis indicated that in years with a significant P effect the maximum grain yield could be achieved at an AL-P2O5 supply level of 160-220 mg kg-1, while 130-170 mg kg-1 was required for the economic yield level (95% of maximum grain yield) (Table 1.). Studies on the effect of P supplies on the nutrient concentrations releaved that with increasing P supplies the P content of maize leaves significantly rose only in two of the five years. The relationship between the leaf P concentration at the beginning of tasselling and the maize grain yield showed that the satisfactory P concentration limit value at 95% of maximum yield was 0,25-0,40% on the basis of five experimental years (Fig. 1). The satisfactory Zn concentration limit value at economic yield level was 1035 mg kg-1. The increasing soil P status between 175-365 mg kg-1 AL-P2O5 significantly reduced the Zn content in the leaves, but the Zn concentration remained above the critical bottom limit (10 mg kg-1). Significant negative correlation between the leaves P and Zn concentrations was observed only one years. The optimum value of the P/Zn ratio in the leaves at 95% of maximum yield changed wide interval, from 75 to 300 (Table 1, Fig. 1-3). Conclusions On chernozem meadow soil at 120-360 mg kg-1 AL-P2O5 and 2.0-3.5 mg kg -1 EDTA-Zn content of cultivated layer the increasing P supplies increased the P and reduced the Zn concentration in the maize leaves at the beginning of tasselling as well as the P/Zn ratio became wider but the higher P supplies did not resulted in Zn deficiency.</p><p id="Pg459">VII.

YIELD Ildikó IVÁNYI- Zoltán IZSÁKI Faculty of Agricultural Water and Environmental Management, Tessedik Sámuel College, P. O. Box 3, H-5541 Szarvas, Hungary e-mail: gergely.ildiko@mvk.tsf.hu Abstract: We investigated the agronomic factors how could influence the yield of hemp. The effects of nutrient supply in soil four N,P,K levels, influence of plant density 360 and 240 germs ha -1 , effect of harvest times at full floering and seed ripening time were determined in different field experiments between 1990 and 2006 on chernozem meadow soil. The main effect of N, P, K (on the average of other two treatments) consequently were N 18-26 %, P 1%, K 2-5 %, with 80-160 kg ha -1 N, at soil phosphate P1 level (AL-P2O5 110-130 mg kg -1 ) and at potassium K1 (AL K2O 300-360 mg kg -1 ) level, with 100 kg ha1 phosphate fertilisation and with 300 kg ha -1 potassium fertilisation. Density effect on the yield was 20 % at higher, 360 germs m 2-1 treatment on the average of three genotypes. Stem yield increased with 80 % from flowering time to seed ripening. Keywords: nutrient supply, plant density, harvest time, hemp Introduction A large number of the investigations (Blazenka et al.2007, Hunyadi et al. 2007, Izsáki 2007, Nagy 2007, Berzsenyi and Lap 2006, Kovačević et al. 2006) reported about effects of agronomic factors on different crops. Effects of those factors differ a range of soil, climate and management conditions. In the literature nutrient supply and density effects of hemp yield on different climate conditions are contrast. In The Netherland nitrogen effect on the yield only slightly. A relative small amount of fertiliser cover the crop’s needs (Struik et al. 2000). In Italy (Bologna) where 100 kg ha-1 nitrogen was the natural availability in the soil, each additional kg of nitrogen supply increased stem dry matter production by 20 kg (Amaducci et al. 2002.). Hemp nutrient requirement for 10 t ha-1 stem yield is on the basis of data in the literature and Hungarian analyses required 100 kg N, 40 kg P2O5 and 180-200 K2O (Iványi and Izsáki 1996, Kádár 2004). In The Netherland effect of increased seeding rates led high self-thinning and the stem yield at final harvest was not affected by seeding rate. From 86-823 m 2-1 number of living plants at emergence 38-102 m 2-1 remaind at final harvest (Meijer et al. 1995).In Hungary in the long-term fertilisation trial hemp self-thinning was investigated in 1996 and 1997, when from 450 sowen germs m 2 -1 remained 100-200 at full flowering time. In 2001 year from the planted 2.2 million germs ha-1 1.34 million plant remained, averaged over the fertilisation treatments by May 17. The average plant density increased slightly until June 13, when it reached a maximum of 1.52 million ha-1, after which it declined to 1.00–1.15 million ha-1 by harvest, depending on the N supplies. The higher value being recorded in the control. Averaged over the treatment, 1 million plants per hectare remained at harvest, the average plant height of which was 231 cm, with a stem diameter of 8.28 mm. Nitrogen fertilisation caused a slight reduction in the number of harvested plants and slightly (or occasionally significantly) increased the plant height and stem diameter, but in all cases the values conformed with the quality requirements laid down in the MSZ 17631-85 Hungarian quality standard for Grade I hemp stem.(Iványi and Izsáki 2004).</p><p id="Pg462">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1856 Relatively few research are about effect of harvest time from hemp flowering to seed ripening. Hemp harvest for textile purpose happens at flowering time. The earlier data about hemp productivity are at flowering time. The new utilization of hemp (biocomposit, thermal insulation material, energy) requires determine the new harvest time and new quantity and quality parameters. Materials and methods Long-term mineral fertilisation experiments were set up at the Experimental Station of the Crop Production Department, Faculty of Agricultural Water and Environmental Management, Tessedik Sámuel College, Szarvas, in 1989. The soil of the experimental area had the following parameters: chernozem meadow soil, calcareous in the deeper layers, 85–100 cm humus layer, pH(KCl) 5.0–5.2, humus content 3.0–3.2 %, upper limit of plasticity according to Arany (KA) 50, clay content 32 %. During the fertilisation investigated period (1990-1992) the soil contained the following nutrient supplies in the cultivated layer: N0: 50-70-, N80: 74-102-, N160: 71-125-, N240: 79-119 NO3 N kg ha -1; phosphate content of P0-P1 levels 111-120-, P2-P3 levels 140-210 AL-P2O5; potassium content of K0-K1 levels 260-333-, K2-K3 levels were 290-390 AL- K2O Fertilisation was carried out in all possible combinations of four levels each of N, P and K, giving a total of 64 treatments, set up in a split-split plot design with three replications, with K fertilisation as the “A” factor, P fertilisation as the “B” factor and N fertilisation as the “C” factor. The following fertiliser rates were applied: nitrogen: N0 = 0, N1 = 80, N2 = 160, N3 = 240 kg N ha –1 year–1; phosphorus (P2O5): P0 = 0, P1 = 100 kg ha–1 year–1, P2 = 500 kg ha –1 in 1989, P3 = 1000 kg ha –1 in 1989, potassium (K2O): K0 = 0, K1 = 300 kg ha –1 year–1 in 1989, K2 = 600 kg ha –1 in 1989, K3 = 1200 kg ha –1 in 1989. The high rates of P and K replenishment fertilisation were used to create clearly distinct supply levels in the soil in order to investigate plant responses to nutrient status. To get more details about the potencial productivity of hemp and the optimal seeding rate- consideration of selfthinnig -for new utilisation task of hemp, in 2006 we carried out density and harvest time and genotype experiment, where the seeding rate was 360 and 240 germs m2-1 , , harvest times at folwering time and seed ripening on Kompolti, Szarvasi and Tiborszállási genotypes. Results and discussion On the base of the the long-term experiment three representing years indicate, on the hemp stem yield from three main nutrient elements the N effect (on the average of other two treatments) was higher, 18-26 %, than P and K effect compared to N0 treatment, with N 80-N 160 kg ha -1 year -1 nitrogen fertiliser (Table 1).The P main effect was 1% at soil P1 phosphate level (AL-P2O5 110-130 mg kg -1) with 100 kg ha-1 year -1 phosphorus (P2O5) fertilization. The main K effect was 2-5 % at K1 (300-360 mg kg -1 AL K2O level) and with 300 kg ha-1 year -1 potassium fertilisation. In the 2006 year the hemp yield on the average of genotypes and seeding rates at first harvest was 11,0 t ha-1 which significantly increased to seed ripening time to 19.8 t ha-1. At last time from 240 and 360 m2-1 sowed germs remaind 105 and 158 alive plants m 2-1 (Figure 1).Studies on the effect of density on the yield at first harvest there was no difference at Kompolti and Szarvasi genotypes, but the yield of earlier Tiborszállási variety decraised to late</p><p id="Pg463">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1857 harvest. At second harvest the higher (360) density resulted in 20 %significant yield increase on the averaga of genotypes compare to lower (240) sowed germs m 2-1 (Figure 1.). Conclusions On chernozem meadow soil on 110-130 mg kg-1 AL-P2O5 and 300-360 mg kg -1 AL K2O levels from the three macronutriens the main N effect was 18-26 % with 80-160 kg ha-1 year-1 nitrogen fertilisation. The density effect was positive 20 % at the end of seed ripening time at higher, 360 sowed germs m 2—1. With late harvest time, after seed ripening hemp yield can increase with 80 % compare to the flowering harvest time .

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1859 LIMITING FACTORS OF PRECISION FARMING - SOIL COMPACTION AND PRECIPITATION Miklós NEMÉNYI1 – Viliam NAGY2 – Vlasta STEKAEUROVÁ2 1 University of West Hungary, Faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences, Institute of Biosystems Engineering, 9200, Mosonmagyaróvár, Vár 2., Hungary, nemenyim@mtk.nyme.hu 2 Institute of Hydrology, Slovakian Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia Abstract: The aim of site-specific or in other world precision farming is to collect data and perform applications using the most up-to-date technology within field. Generally speaking site specific data collection of soil parameters – such as compaction or soil moisture content – can be carried out by on-line measurement techniques and can also be mapped, in order to provide soil compaction of moisture content maps for the decision makers (farmers). According to these maps the farmers can decide the best treating method for different areas within field. With precision soil cultivation input energy can be saved as well as environmental tasks such as avoiding unnecessary tillage and/or loosening can be solved. With the help of available technology i.e. application of GPS, remote sensing, GIS, sensor applications etc. the problems caused by soil compaction can be solved or rather treated. Precipitation on the other hand can not be influenced, therefore in soil plant interaction it can be a real limiting factor. In this article role of soil compaction on within field varieties and role of precipitation in different years on precision farming is reported. Keywords: precision farming, soil compaction, precipitation Introduction One of the missions of the Institute of Biosystems Engineering of the University of West-Hungary, Faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences is to investigate the engineering background of precision farming. Through our research, our aim was to work out a soil draught monitoring system, which makes possible the objective, sitespecific inspection of soil compaction by means of a large number of measured values. Soil compaction is one of the most typical soil problems (Várallyay, 2006; Várallyay, 2007; Gombos, 2007), which is caused in the majority of cases by technological – tillage errors. Despite its well recognizable signs (water stagnation, cracking) it is observed generally too late, after plant symptoms appear. Knowledge of location and degree of compaction is required for its elimination and to realize precision soil tillage. Inhomogenity of the agricultural soils are investigated by various researchers (Prokisch et al., 2007; Hegyi et al., 2006) other inhomogeneous characteristics are evaluated be other authors (Nagy., 2007; Kádár, 2007; Berzsenyi and Dang, 2006). Cone penetrometer measurement is the most widely applied survey method of soil compaction at the present. However, the dynamic forces act on the surface of the tillage tools differ from the static ones measured by a (vertical) penetrometer. Further disadvantage of the latter manner is its point type habit since, in this way the accuracy is significantly influenced by the number and location of sample points. Large labor and time demand should be mentioned in this concern as well. Barriers of penetrometer based soil compaction measurement are discussed by several scientists. Our aim was to realize the continuous measurement of this parameter in the practice and investigate the role of soil compaction on yield. In the second part of the research work role of precipitation on yield in various years were investigated. In order to be able to compare data performance of the same plant – in our case maize – were investigated. Plant and atmosphere interaction was investigated from the view of CO2 concentration as well (Anda and Lőke, 2006). Earlier</p><p id="Pg466">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1860 results are reported in different articles (Nagy et al., 2007; Neményi et al., 2003; Neményi et al., 2005; Neményi et al., 2006). Materials and methods To obtain site-specific information about soil compaction, the penetrometer measurement was completed with GPS – positioning at the first step. Measurements were carried out using a 3T vertical penetrometer. Two experimental areas were involved. In case of the 1 ha study field belonging to the Institute of Biosystems Engineering a 20 x 20 m measurement grid was followed. Penetrometer resistance was measured till 40 cm, in three repetitions. The on-line system was employed together with a cultivator with a working depth of 25 cm. the area was an often cultivated (ploughing, harrowing) stubble with intensive field traffic. The other field (no. 80/1) belonging to the study farm of the above mentioned Faculty is a normally cultivated 15.3 ha area. Here, soil draught was measured using a subsoiler at a depth of 41 cm. Simultaneous penetrometer measurement in 20 points in 20 repetitions was done. Significant statistical correlation was not found between the two datasets. The difference is caused undoubtedly by the different natures of the measured forces (static vs. dynamic) or rather the continuous and point type measurements. The created soil draught map showed however a very similar pattern concerning to the PIA map was generated previously. Comparing these maps, a negative correlation can be seen – higher soil draught was measured on the areas where lower PIA was present. The relation of yield and soil draught was also analyzed. Statistically justifiable relationship was neither found in this case. The patterns of the maps show however such clear accordance on the basis of which it can be declared that soil draught influenced the yield significantly in case of each three investigated year (2001 – 2003). In order to investigate effects of precipitation on yield meteorological data had to be collected (Table 1.) and yield maps had to be created. Yield maps were created using measurement data collected during harvest as input to a GIS software, followed by interpolation to the grid of 1 meter precise resolution. Table 1.

Results and discussion Based on our experiences it can be declared that information about soil compaction can be gathered by measuring the forces act on the surfaces of tillage tools. Site-specific mapping of this parameter is possible using the developed system. The heterogeneity of this soil property may be such high level that cannot be reliable measured with point-</p><p id="Pg467">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1861 type method. Therefore, application of the continuous manner is requested. At the same time, it is not available in many cases (e.g. soil supply), and cannot be expected in the near future. Consequently, such process should be elaborated, which ensures objective survey with less sample point and defines the location of them as well. Effect of precipitation during the vegetation period of various years can be shown by comparing the data for each year with the yield maps. According to the data available from the years 2001, 2002 and 2005, precision farming improved the quantity of yield between 2001 and 2002 in spite of less available water in the later year (Fig 1 and 2). 2001 Maize 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 V VI VII VIII IX Month w a te r n e e d /p re c ip it a ti o n ( m m ) -80 -60 -40 -20 0 20 40 60 80 D if fe re n c e ( m m ) Water need Precipitation Difference Figure 1.

Cereal Research Communications 1862 Conclusions Some limiting factors of precision agriculture – such as soil compaction – can be detected and taken care of by knowing the location of the negative feature. Precision crop production has the technology to apply the best tools (loosening for instance) for such treatments, at the same time not to treat areas where it is not needed. Other factors, like meteorological effects i.e. precipitation can not be influenced. Application of site specific management technologies on the other hand can improve the yield in spite of less favourable meteorological circumstances.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1863 PRE-HARVEST PREDICTION OF SPRING BARLEY NITROGEN CONTENT USING HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGING Gábor MILICS 1 – Péter BURAI 2 – Csaba LÉNÁRT 2 1 University of West Hungary, Faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences, Institute of Biosystems Engineering, 9200, Mosonmagyaróvár, Vár 2., Hungary, milics@mtk.nyme.hu 2 University of Debrecen, Centre for Agricultural Sciences and Engineering, Department of Water and Environmental Management, Böszörményi út 138, Debrecen, 4032, Hungary Abstract: Pre-harvest prediction of various conditions – such as nitrogen content – of plants can provide information about soil-plant interaction as well as data for the harvest. With the help of multispectral satellite imaging yield and nitrogen content of various plants can be predicted well before harvest. Authors aim was to investigate the usability of geometrically and spectrally more precise hyperspectral imaging for early prediction of quality and quantity parameters of spring barley. Results showed that prediction of grain quality compared to prediction quantity was achievable with higher confidence based on hyperspectral imaging. Correlation of spring barley grain nitrogen content – based on field sample collection and data analysis in laboratory, interpolated to the same resolution as the hyperspectral image by GIS software – with multiply regression analysis of the best 10 spectral channel between 400 and 2450 nm hyperspectral image was relatively strong (R 2 = 0.5927, n=155350). Applying some filter on the database could give higher correlation, however due to the fact that this application of hyperspectral imaging was a pilot project; such filter is not available yet. Keywords: pre-harvest prediction of nitrogen content, hyperspectral imaging, spring barley Introduction Hyperspectral imaging is a promising tool for many different land cover analysis applications. The very first time hyperspectral imaging was applied in Hungary on commercial base is dated to 2002. At that year various possible applications were investigated, such as determination of different forest types (Hargitai et al., 2006), investigation of plants under stress in towns (Jung, 2005), heavy metal and oil pollution detection based on earlier experiments (Mucsi et al., 2000). Hyperspectral imaging was evaluated from the point of view of ragweed detection (Kardeván et al., 2004), soil protection (Pechmann et al., 2004) and different soil properties determination (Kardeván et al., 2003). Tamás et al. (2005) reported the possible determination of non-vegetated areas by hyperspectral imaging using Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI). From agricultural point of view Papp and Fenyvesi (2007) published a summarizing article. Beginning with the year 2007 hyperspectral imaging instrument (AISA Dual, Spectral Imaging Ltd.) is available in Hungary. Based on earlier experiments, measurements were carried out with different aims. Technical background of the measurements are reported by Deákvári et al. (2008), a possible application for precision farming is reported in this article. Prediction of grain quantity (yield) by multispectral imaging has been carried out since remote sensing is applied for non military applications (1972). Due to the distance of satellite carriers from the surface of Earth (700 km) resolution of multispectral imaging (25 m) is less satisfactory than airborne photography resolution (1 m). Spectral resolution differences (multispectral image = 7 bands, hyperspectral image = 359 bands in this particular case) also explain the reason why hyperspectral image can be a better solution for quality prediction of grains. The role of nitrogen in the soil-plant system has been reported by Németh (2006). Nitrogen content of the soil is influenced by the soil water regime (Stekauerová</p><p id="Pg470">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1864 V.-Nagy V. 2007). In the year 2008 usability of hyperspectral images in nitrogen content prediction of spring barley was in focus of the research activity in our institute. Materials and methods In order to investigate the possibility of hyperspectral image analysis application for predicting grain quality – such as nitrogen content – before harvest, airborne hyperspectral image was taken 2 weeks prior to harvest, and 40 samples were collected by hand in the 15.3 ha experimental field (Fig. 1a) belonging to the University of West Hungary (no. 80/1). Figure 1. Hyperspectral image (a) and grain nitrogen content map (b) of the experimental field Hand collected samples were analyzed in the Central Laboratory of the University of West Hungary for protein content. Data received from the laboratory was used as input data for a protein content map. Grain protein content map was created by means of GIS kriging (Fig. 1b) and inverse distance weighting interpolation techniques. Hyperspectral image was collected by AISA Dual (Spectral Imaging Ltd. Finland) sensor. This particular sensor contains two different sensor heads: AISA Eagle has 2.3 nm bandwidth in the spectral range between 400 and 970 nm. AISA Hawk has 5.8 nm bandwidth in the spectral range between 970 and 2450 nm. AISA Dual is a sensor which contains both Eagle and Hawk, therefore images in the 400-2450 nm range are available in 359 bands. Based on the nitrogen-content map created according to the laboratory provided data, from different grain nitrogen content areas spectral signatures were collected with the help of ENVI image analyzer software. Bands where the largest differences appeared between high and low nitrogen content values were chosen by visual analysis. Regression analysis between grain nitrogen content map and the applicable hyperspectral based bands were carried out in order to choose the best ten bands for investigation the correlation of different data by multiply regression analysis.</p><p id="Pg471">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1865 Results and discussion Correlation between separate narrow hyperspectral bands and laboratory analysis based grain nitrogen content map was week. In the visible and Near Infrared (NIR) range correlation coefficient has not reach R2 = 0.4 at either bands. At 1237, 2037 and 2138 nm bands correlation was R2 = 0.55 n=155350. Multiply regression analysis based output map gave large correlation (R2 = 0.5920 n=155350), however noisiness of the regression image was relatively high (Fig. 2). Figure 2. Regression paramethers for multiply regressiaon analysis of hyperspectral bands vs. grain nitrogen content. Conclusions Prediction of grain nitrogen (protein) content by hyperspectral imaging can be carried out before harvest. By knowing the attributes of the investigated plant through the vegetation period, more precise timing of the imaging can be carried out. It that case pre-harvest grain nitrogen content prediction can be carried out by hyperspectral (airborne) imaging. Application of this technology can improve the performance and cost effectiveness of precision farming. In order to make sure data collection by this technology is reliable different plants research work has to be continued.</p><p id="Pg472">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Thus, tillage force mapping can be an effective tool for site-specific management. This information should be provided in the most simple, labor-effective and low-priced way. The cost of the tool or rather the measurement should be commensurate with the value of the information provided. Soil resistance measurement with penetrometer provides only discontinuous field information. To receive proper amount of data we need to measure with an on-line method. According to earlier developments that were carried out in our institute the authors are presenting new results. The system is based on the electro-hydraulic system (EHS) of a tractor. Load cells are installed in the EHS, which provide electric signals with the ratio of the forces affecting the hydraulic system. The induced voltages from the load cells using an RS232-ADC module were fed to the DellAxim x50v PDA throughout Quatech DSCF-100 two ports RS232 serial Compact Flash Card. A software developed at the institute records and displays the digitized summarized signals of the load cells and writes to the main memory of the PDA together with the position (GPS) information in *.txt format. Keywords: tillage force, soil strength, site specific tillage, continuous measurements Introduction The main goal of today’s agricultural production is to fulfill the highly growing food request of population on the Earth. The rapidly decreasing land and the growing population make it more difficult. The aim of sustainable development is to preserve the land, water, plant and animal genetic variability, which is technically implementing, economically viable and socially acceptable. To reach this we need to know the soil – as one of the main renewable energy resource (Várallyay, 2007) – detailed parameters. With improving of soil sampling techniques we can get useable information from fewer samples (Prokisch et al., 2007). Sustainability from soil tillage viewpoint can evolve towards great efficiency of resource use, and can develop and maintain a harmony between crop production technologies and soil environment (Birkás et al., 2007). Within precision agriculture the precision tillage plays much bigger role than ever. Several authors (Desboilles et al., 1998, Szőllősi, 2003) discuss the measuring methods to determine cone index using a penetrometer, because this process is the most common measuring method to determinate soil strength. According to Neményi et al. (2006) the biggest problem of a vertical penetrometer is, that the measured values are available only from the measured point, and areas among these points are described with calculated data. Adamchuck et al. (2004) lists several on to go soil sensors for precision agriculture. His statement is that several sensors are under development, but only electrical and electromagnetic sensors have been used in precision agriculture. These sensors give valuable information about soil differences and similarities which make it possible to divide the field into relatively homogeneous management zones. One of the main aims of a good farm management is to prepare the soil for planting in the shortest possible speed (Onwualu and Watts, 1998). According to their statement the relationship between tillage force and speed must be known. Therefore, knowing tractors speed is a key factor in precision tillage management. Velocity measurements</p><p id="Pg474">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1868 are important to convert the specific draught data to a standard velocity in order to compare data sets from different years or from different fields (Bergejik et al., 2001). Al-Jahil et al. (2001) and Kheiralla et al. (2003) are presenting results, measured by a three-point hitch dynamometer. Their development can measure the horizontal and vertical forces affecting the tillage tool. Despite of all no position recording is mentioned, the recorded data can not be used to determine the spatial heterogeneity. Sirjabos et al. (2001) presents a dynamometer with a whole measurement chain. With his tool he can record a site-specific data what is a promising perspective for an on-line characterization of a soil physical state. This new information for precision agriculture may be used for the real time regulation of soil tillage or sowing functional parameters according to the site specific soil physical state. Accurate tillage depth measurement is also an essential parameter for site-specific draught calculations. Mouazen et al. (2005) also highlights on an importance of depth control system. It is a useful parameter for controlling the depth of the tillage tool during online measurement of soil compaction indicated a dry bulk density. However, Mouazen (2006) concluded that there is no clear correlation between soil properties and measured draught, and therefore the field measurement is not the best procedure to correlate draught with the other influencing parameters (depth, water content, bulk density) and theoretical modeling is still an alternative option, Neményi et al. (2006) founded a significant impact between high tillage force and yield. After the listing of the scientific references it is still an outstanding question, how to solve the on-line soil draft measurement for practical use, because no acceptable solution exits, however soil draft is one of the key parameter for site specific soil tillage. The aim of this study was to evaluate the soil strength continuosly in a modern, cost effective way, what can be used easily in everyday practice. Materials and methods The system is based on the electro-hydraulic system (EHS) of a Steyer 9078/A tractor. Load cells are installed in the EHS, which provide electric signals with the ratio of the force affecting the hydraulic system. The hydraulic system was loaded with different forces exerted by a hydraulic lever. For reference values we used a max. 10 kN chargeable load cell, combined with an Almemo universal measuring unit. The induced voltages from the load cells were fed to the DellAxim x50v PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) using an RS232-ADC module throughout a Quatech DSCF-100 two port RS232 serial Compact Flash Card. Software developed at the institute – with a simple programming environment Zeus - records and displays the digitized summarized signals of the load cells and writes to the main memory of the PDA together with the position (GPS) information – recorded by CSI Wireless DGPS Max - in *.txt format. This file format is available for every GIS software for later processes, so the results can be displayed spatially. The working speed is obtained from a GPRMC - recommended minimum specific GPS/Transit data - line of the GPS data. $GPRMC,101337.00,A,4753.48819,N,01716.29480,E,0.17,335.72,131207,,,A*56</p><p id="Pg475">VII.

The conversion is: 1 knot = 0.5144 m sec-1. To set up the appropriate working depth we used the hydraulic controlling switch of the tractor. However the speed and the working depth can be an influencig parameter, all our foregoing investigatios were carried out beyond field conditions, so the mentioned parameters were inert. A 3 sec alleviation was applied (with a condenser built in to the contolling panel) in order to moderate or even eliminate the fluctuation which may be caused by the not perfectly constant working depth and the direction of load. The statistical examinations were 9 times repeated (at least 8 meaured points per examination). For the post process of the measured data we used Microsoft Excel 2003 (Microsoft Corp.) and Arc View 9.1 to demonstrate the spatial distribution. Results and discussion Figure 1. represents the correlation between the draft force and the EHS voltage change. The high R2 values shows that there is a strong connection between the listed parameters, so we can declare that the draft force can be determinate continuously with the voltage change of EHS. Figure 1. The combined signals of the load cells corresponding to different loads Using the PDA with an in-house software we can easily display the actual draft force with the coordinates and we are also able to record them. These raw data after a post process are capable to provide valuable site-specific informations for precision agricultural management. Conclusions Based on the presented results, we can declare that the load cells provide electric signals with the ratio of the forces affecting the hydraulic system, what we can convert to online force using above mentioned system.

VÉGH1 - Tibor SZILI-KOVÁCS1 - Imre CSERNI2 1 Research Institute for Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Herman Ottó u. 15, 1022 Budapest, Hungary krvegh@rissac.hu 2 Institute of Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Horticulture, Kecskemét College 6000 Erdei F. 1-3. Kecskemét, Hungary Abstract: The effects of mineral nitrogen fertilization on the total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), soil microbial biomass C and N (MBC, MBN), root length density and carbon input and the rate of cellulose decomposition were studied in soils with different physical properties and fertility in intensive, high productive tomato culture. Plant C and N accumulation as well as fruit yield were depended on soil type and N rate. N fertilization significantly affected on the carbon input by the root biomass of the crop. Significant effects of N fertilization rates neither on soil MBC nor on MBN were shown at harvest; by that time the inorganic N content of the soils became depleted by crops and only the effects of the soil type could be detected. Stimulating effect of N fertilization on the rate of cellulose decomposition during crop growth indicates the inorganic N demand of MB competing with crop roots for the nutrients. Keywords: three soil textures, nitrogen supply, organic carbon, soil microbial biomass C and N, tomato, root length density, decomposition rate Introduction Mineral nitrogen fertilizers enhance crop growth and C inputs to the soil due to the increased production of roots and other organic residues. The decomposition of organic residues is influenced by numerous physical, chemical and biological factors that control the activity of microorganisms in soil. Since soil moisture content and nutrient availability are particularly important environmental factors in the dynamics of microbial activity (Kátai, 2006; Takács et al., 2006), intensive irrigation and high fertilizer use markedly affects carbon and nitrogen flows in vegetable farming. In 2006 a research project was started aiming the description of the main C and N flows in the soil and crop in vegetable culture, both in terms of the decomposition rates of organic matter and the fate of the actual decomposition products. In this paper we focus on the carbon budget and flows in different soil types under tomato crop. The effects of mineral nitrogen fertilization on the total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), soil microbial biomass C and N (MBC, MBN), carbon input as root biomass and the rate of cellulose decomposition were studied in soils with contrasting texture, thus different physical properties and fertility in intensive, high productive tomato culture. Materials and methods The soils studied were coarse texture sandy soil (S1: Kecskemét), alluvial loam soil (S2: Dunaszentbenedek) and clay loam (S3: medow chernozem, Szentes) filled in lysimeters with 0.6 m height and diameter in 1993. In 2006 four nitrogen levels were created: 0, 60, 120 and 180 kg.ha-1 of N. 60 kg of N was applied before planting as slow release fertilizer (Cropcare: N:P:K=10:10:20), the additional amounts were added 3 and 6 weeks after planting as ammonium-nitrate top dressing. Experimental design of the lysimeters was random block with six replications. Two tomato plants (Lycopersicon</p><p id="Pg478">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1872 esculentum Mill. cv. K-549) were grown per lysimeter in the settled soil and watered with a drip irrigation system to ensure sufficient soil water to the crop. TDR CS615 Campbell moisture sensors buried in soil with data loggers were used to monitor the moisture content in every hour. Cellulose tests were used in course of the experiment for measuring biological activity in 0-20 cm soil layer. 30 days after planting 300 mm long, 50 mm diameter undisturbed soil cores were taken vertically out from the top layer, then as ingrowth cores in mesh bags were replaced into the soil for root studies (do Rosário et al. 2000). Soil MBC and MBN (Szili-Kovács and Tóth, 2006), the C and N content of tomato shoots, fruits and roots were determined at final harvest as well as cellulose tests (Török et al, 2000) were analyzed. At final harvest roots and soil from the ingrowth cores were recovered and analyzed. Root length were analyzed by using DeltaT image analysis system. Results and discussion Soil physical properties, total organic C (TOC) and total N (TN), as well as inorganic N (Ni) contents greatly differed for the three soil textures (Table 1). Table 1. Selected physical and chemical properties of the experimental soils.

Similarly, sandy soil had less TN and Ni than loam and clay loam soils (p&lt;0.001). Tomato yield was comparable to field data reported in the literature and ranged from 64 to 178 t.ha-1 in S1, 87-233 t.ha-1 in S2, and 129-241 t.ha-1 in S3 soils depending significantly on soil type and N rate (p&lt;0.001). Crops recovered nitrogen added as fertilizer completely by the end of growing season in S1 and S2 soils (Végh et al, 2007). Root length density (RLD) differed in the different soil textures significantly (p&lt;0.001) whereas no significant effect of N fertilization was observed on this trait at final harvest. The crop had a proliferated, fine root system in the coarse texture sandy soil and grew much shorter roots in the loam and clay loam soils (Fig. 1.). S1 soil contained a dense root mat as a consequence of the high rate of root growth stimulated by the high rate movement of nutrients – as it is usual particularly for nitrate (Németh, 2006; Setia et al, 2006) with the irrigation water. Both in S2 and S3 soils root length density was more or less reduced under the conditions of the highest nitrogen fertilization treatment, whereas no such effect was detected in S1 soil.</p><p id="Pg479">VII.

Root length (L) in 0-30 cm soil (left) and the rate constant of decomposition (right) as affected by soil type and N fertilization Before cropping the soil microbial biomass C (MBC) in S2 and S3 soils was more than three times larger than in S1 soil. The initial values for MBC were low, 1.1-1.7 % of TOC in the 0-20 cm layer of the soils. By harvest date soil MBC became greater by 241 % in the N treatments for S1 soil, whereas it decreased by 33-53 % and 12-55 % in S2 and S3 soils related to its initial values. Soil microbial biomass N (MBN) values ranged between the 1.4-1.8 % of TN and were also positively influenced by the favorable soil physical properties and organic matter content of S2 and S3 soils (Table 1.) where the amounts of MBN were more than twice of that in S1. At harvest a 16-90 % increase in soil MBN was found compared to the MBN detected before cropping in sand. Whereas S2 and S3 soils MBN decreased by 8-17% in loam soil and by 10-35 % in clay loam. C:N ratio in the microbial biomass decreased from the initial 8 to 5 by harvest time. Carbon input into the soil by the roots of the tomato crop (estimated on the basis of root mass at final harvest) ranged between 75-280 g.m-2 depending significantly on N fertilization (p&lt;0.001) and soil type (p&lt;0.05), with estimated values of 30 - 210 mg.kg-1 of soil for root derived C in the 0-20 cm soil layer. The decomposition process is often seen as a series of first order reactions for the studied C fractions, each with its own size and decomposition rate. The kinetic rate constants of decomposition determined for four periods of the growing season and presented as k values (k, day-1) of cellulose decomposition have been averaged for the period of the whole life cycle of tomato crop and used to characterize total microbial activity in the various soil conditions of contrasting textures and fertility. Decomposition rate was affected by soil type and N supply (soil Ni + fertilizer N) as shown in Fig. 2. k values were low in sand related to the other soil types. The highest rates were detected in the 120 kg.ha-1 N treatments and succeeded by a marked depression of k on the highest N fertilizer rate in the loam and clay loam soils. In the end of the experiment decomposition rate significantly reduced related to that observed in the early growing cycle. In sandy and loamy soils k ranged around five</p><p id="Pg480">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1874 times lower values at harvest than earlier. In the clay loam decomposition process continued with half-rate in the last two months of crop growth. In the 0-20 cm layer the different levels of inorganic N content that had been created by fertilization was leveled off by the uptake of crops as was reflected in Ni data of the soil samples taken at harvest (Végh et al, 2007). Beside the decreasing temperature the low N supply could be responsible for the slower cellulose decomposition in the soils during the last period of the growing season. Conclusions Soil type and N rate significantly affected plant C and N accumulation, fruit yield, consequently C input into the soil by roots. Significant effects of N fertilization rates neither on soil MBC nor on MBN were shown in samples taken at harvest. However, by that time the inorganic N content of the soils became depleted by crops and only the effects of the soil type could be detected. Stimulating effect of N fertilization on the rate of cellulose decomposition during crop growth reflects the competition for inorganic nitrogen between the decomposer microbial population and crop roots. Experimental data on MBC and MBN as well as the slight decrease in C:N ratio suggest a regression of the microbial population due to N deficit since fertilizer N recovered by crops completely by the end of growing season. Furthermore microbial C:N ratio decrease may be resulted from the shift of microbial community composition from fungal to bacterial dominance.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1875 EVALUATION OF THE SOIL EXAMINATION RESULTS OF BÉKÉS AND HAJDÚSÁG CROP LANDS Attila DOBOS 1 – Robert VÍG 2 1 Institute for Land Utilisation, Technology and Regional Development, Center of Agricultural Sciences and Engineering, University of Debrecen, 138 Böszörményi street, Debrecen 4032, Hungary, e-mail: dobosa@agr.unideb.hu 2 Institute for Land Utilisation, Technology and Regional Development, Center of Agricultural Sciences and Engineering, University of Debrecen Abstract: In 2006 we sampled 900 ha of sowing seed production area in the Hajdúság and Békés production zones. During our examinations we justified that there are significant differences between the degree of nutritive supply of the examined production zones. The humus and nitrogen content of the soils is more favourable in the Hajdúság region, whereas their potassium content is more favourable in the Békés region. The proportion of soils not sufficiently provided with humus, nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium is high in both production zones. A more intensive organic fertilizer treatment and a locally adjusted fertilization is needed with higher doses in order to maintain the fertility of soil. Keywords: maize sowing seed production areas, degree of nutritive supply, comparative statistical evaluation Introduction The usage os soil does not necessarily lead to the deterioration of the conditions of our soils. Despite the strengthening unfavourable impacts, the quality and fertility of our soils is can be sustained (Várallyay, 2001). The fundamental condition of sustainable plant growing is to sustain soil fertility that makes it necessary to apply an environmentally sound nutritive management that is adjusted to the production site conditions (Láng and Csete, 1992). The reasonable nutritive supplementation requires the knowledge of production site conditions and the physical and chemical characters of soil (Németh and Várallyay, 1998; Nagy, 2004; Kádár, 2007). The application of organic and inorganic nutritives is neccessary in order to reach high average yields and good quality, whereas the unreasonable nutritive supplementation can harm our environment (Szabó, 1999). The most important plant growing factors like fertilization, tillage, plant number and irrigation have to be optimal to reach the highest yield increase (Nagy, 2005, 2007; Izsáki, 2007). Reasonable fertilization does not necessarily pollutes the environment, as we apply the same amount of fertilizers as the quantity that is needed by the crop for its undisturbed development within given conditions, minimizing fertilizer loss (Kádár, 1992; Nagy and Jászberényi, 2002). From the environmental production point of view it is important to adjust nutritive supplementation to the needs of the crop, nutritive intake dynamics and production site conditions (Csathó et al., 2007). We have to switch from mechanical fertilization practice to the dynamic one, that has the following essential components: optimal utilization of available nutritive sources, consideration of nutritive cycle, increased consideration of the long-term impacts of fertilization, avoidance of unwanted sideeffects of fertilization (Németh and Várallyay, 1998).</p><p id="Pg482">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1876 Material and methods In 2006 we sampled 900 ha of sowing seed production area in the Hajdúság and Békés production zones. The soil sampling was based on a digitalized genetic soil map, using GPS navigation and in pre-marked sampling places, in every 5 hectares in 0-30 can and 30-60 cm deep soil layers. The samples were taken between 20/05/2006 and 12/06/2006, and between 19/09/2006 and 02/10/2006. The GIS database was developed using ArcView 3.3 and ArcGis 9.1 software. Soil analyses were carried out in the Agrochemistry and Soil Science Department of the University of Debrecen, using the methods describes by Filep (1995b). The determination of nutritive supply categories was done based on the end values outlined by Filep (1995b). The evaluation of the results for the upper 30 cm layer of the soil was done by the statistical software package SPSS for Windows 14.0. The distribution of observed data was evaluated by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, variance was evaluated by Levene test. In the case of humus and nitrogen content, the residual values had normal distribution, but the standard deviation of the measured results differed significantly, therefore we carried out the statistical evaluation by meand of a paired t-test. We have chosen a significance level of 5%. Results and discussion 54% of the Hajdúság sample area is meadow chernozem soil, 26.2% of it is chernozem soil with lime deposits, 11.9% is chernozem meadow soil, whereas 7.9% of the sample are is meadow solonetz and solonchak meadow soil. 66.4% of the Békés sample area is meadow chernozem soil, 29.9% of it is typical meadow soil, whereas 3.7% of the sample area is chernozem meadow and leached chernozem soil. The average pH level of these two production zone is similar (7.7 and 7.8). There are also slightly acidic, neutral, slightly alkaline and alkaline soils in both examined zones, but the dominating soils are slightly alkaline (68.3% and 79.1%). The proportion of neutral soils in Békés is 14.2%, whereas it is 11.9% in Hajdúság. Slightly acidic soils can be found in a higher proportion (17.5%) in the Hajdúság area than in Békés (6.0%). Average lime content is low in both production zones (1.2% and 2.5%). More than half of the examined areas are poorly provided with lime (56.3% in Hajdúság, 66.4 % in Békés). The average humus content of the soils is 3.00% in the Hajdúság area, whereas it is by 0.22% lower in Békés. The proportion of areas well and rather well provided with humus is similar in both production zones (22.2% and 22.3%). The proportion of soils sufficiently provided with humus is high (51.6% in Hajdúság, 31.3% in Békés) as is the proportion of soils moderately provided with humus (23.0% in Hajdúság, 30.6% in Békés). The proportion of soils poorly and rather poorly provided with humus is 15.7% in Békés and 3.2% in Hajdúság. The average nitrogen content is 1744 ppm in Hajdúság, whereas it is 1618 ppm in Békés. The proportion of areas moderately provided with nitrogen is high in both areas (95.5% and 99.2%). The proportion of soils poor in nitrogen is low, it is 0.8% in Hajdúság and 4.5% in Békés. The average AL-soluble phosphorous content is 287 ppm in Békés, whereas it is by 65 ppm lower in Hajdúság. The degree of phosphorous supply of the examined areas is various, there are soils rather poorly, poorly, moderately, sufficiently, well and rather well provided with phosphorous. The proportion of soils well and rather well provided</p><p id="Pg483">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1877 with phosphorous is nearly the same (27.6% and 28.6%). The proportion of areas moderately and sufficiently provided with phosphorous is 35.1% in Békés and 46.8% in Hajdúság. The proportion of soils poorly and rather poorly provided with phosphorous is high in both production zones (37.3% in Békés, 24.6% in Hajdúság). The average AL-soluble potassium content is higher in Békés (470 ppm) and lower in Hajdúság (337 ppm). The degree of potassium supply is various, similarly to that of phosphorous. The proportion of soils well and rather well provided with potassium is 60.4% in Békés, whereas it is much lower in Hajdúság (27.8%). The proportion of areas sufficiently provided with potassium is nearly the same (17.7% and 20.6%). The proportion of soils poorly and rather poorly provided with potassium is high (15.1%) in Hajdúság, whereas this value for soils moderately provided with potassium is 36,5%. These values in Békés are lower (1.4% and 19.4%, respectively) (Figure 1). Figure 1. The distribution of soils differently provided with potassium and phosphorous in the examined production zones The average zinc content is low in both production zones (1.61 and 1.84 ppm). The proportion of areas poorly provided with zinc is high (91.8% in Békés, 96.8% in Hajdúság), and there are few soils with the sufficient zinc content (3.2% and 8.2%). According to the Mann-Whitney test, there is no statistically justifiable difference between the examined production zones concerning AL-soluble phosphorous and zinc content. The AL-soluble potassium content of Békés soils is significantly higher than that of Hajdúság soils, still, it has to be considered that Mann-Whitney test does not give a reliable result in the justification of difference (Table 1).

Conclusions During our examinations we justified that there are significant differences between the degrees of nutritive supply of the examined production zones. The humus and nitrogen content of the soils is more favourable in the Hajdúság region, whereas their potassium content is more favourable in the Békés region. The proportion of soils not sufficiently provided with humus, nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium is high in both production zones. A more intensive organic fertilizer treatment and a locally adjusted fertilization is needed with higher doses in order to maintain the fertility of soil. Bigger emphasis has to be put on nitrogen supplementation in the Békés area, whereas phosphorous and potassium fertilization has to be stressed more in Hajdúság.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1879 CHANGES IN DOLOMITE ROCKY GRASSLANDS CAUSED BY ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCES, WITH SPECIAL RESPECT TO GRAZING Viktória VONA1 - Szilvia SÜLE1 - Irén SILLER2 –Ákos POTTYONDY1 1 Szent István University, Department of Nature Conservation and Landscape Protection, Gödöllő 2 Szent István University, Faculty of Veterinary Sciences, Budapest Abstract: The vegetation of dolomite grasslands used as sheep pastures in the Transdanubian part of Hungary was investigated. Besides grazing, the sampling sites were loaded with some anthropogenic influences (trampling, artillary activity, abandonment) as well. Parallel with the grazed pastures, some abandoned grassland areas were also investigated. 2×2 m sampling quadrats were used in open and closed grasslands alike. In addition to the phytosociological records, including the abundances of the species present, coenotaxa and nature conservation values, which are all good indicators of the state of naturalness of the grasslands, the soil characteristics of the areas were also evaluated. Our results suggest that the vegetation of open grasslands resists better to the strong anthropogenic impacts (grazing, artillary activity). As a result of similar influences, closed grasslands get completely degraded: several weed and poisonous species increase their abundances, the dominant graminoid species get exchanged, the nature conservation value of the area decreases, and, at last, the grassland almost disappears. In these areas grazing has to be diminished. Although with decreased abundances, the constituent plant species of the open grasslands survive even the impacts of intensive grazing and artillary activity. Overgrazing of grasslands results in more significant degradation in the natural state of the area than its regular burning down as a result of artillary activity. The total abandonment of the area results in strong shrubification and homogenization of the species composition. Key words: anthropogenic impact, grazing, artillary activity, dolomite rock grassland, sloping steppe on dolomite rock Introduction In Hungary, virgin grasslands are mostly grazed. Considering the relatively good natural conditions and the more or less extensive economy of the country, as well as the expectations of the EU, the agricultural utilization and the goals of nature conservation goals have to be harmonized on these areas (Várallyay 2006, Birkás et al. 2006). Although the investigated grasslands are not under protection, their plant communities are rare (Borhidi és Sántha 1999) and include several protected and relict (e.g. Seseli leucospermum) plant species. In addition, the land use has to be adjusted to the appraisal of the agroecological potential of the Hungarian agricultural areas (Várallyay 2007). In terms of economy, important aspects are the share of grasses (Gramineae) and legumes (Fabaceae) within the species composition of the investigated pastures (Vinczeffy 2001, Nagy 2006), and their changes under the impacts of different disturbances. In respect of the quality of grasslands, it is important to reveal changes in the ratio of species tolerant to grazing and trampling (Barcsák et al. 1978, Penksza et al 2004). Furthermore, one has to establish how much is the chance of rocky grassland communities to sustain (Szentes et al. 2007). The soils of these instable habitats are able to buffer the environmental impacts (Barczi and Centeri 2005, Kertész and Centeri 2006). In the last years, our team has carried out several phytocoenological (Penksza et al. 2005) and soil (Centeri 2002) investigations in grasslands on dolomite basic rocks. In the frames of this work, areas under intensive anthropogenic impacts (grazing, military activities, trampling, burning) were investigated as well. The aim of our present</p><p id="Pg486">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1880 investigation was to reveal how the impacts of different means of use and anthropogenic interventions manifest themselves in dolomite vegetations. Materials and methods Our investigations were carried out at the boundary of the village of Sóly, on the Eperjes Mountain of the village of Olaszfalu, and on the area of the Central Practice and Shooting Range of the Hungarian Army near Várpalota. The sampling sites in Várpalota and Sóly have been loaded with significant anthropogenic impacts for a long time: nearby Sóly the signs of trampling caused by former military activities and all the more the later and also in our days continuing impacts of intensive grazing upon the composition of the vegetation can be observed. Nearby the disturbed patches undisturbed ones also occur, which make comparisons possible. In Várpalota the impacts of continuing artillary activities at present can also be investigated. the Eperjes Mountain, the former woody pasture used to be abandoned, as a consequence of which, significant shrubification took place here in the last decades. Anyhow, some parts of this area are suitable for control. For phytocoenological investigations, 2×2 m sampling quadrats were used (BraunBlanquet 1964). Close to natural and anthropogenicly influenced communities were investigated respectively. Soil sampling was carried out in patches where the vegetation was different from that of the surroundings, in spite of the similarly looking soil conditions. Analyses of the soil samples were carried out following the instructions of Buzás (1988, 1993). The investigated parameters were pH/H2O, pH/KCl, humus percentage (by the method of Tyurin), total organic matter percentage (with ignition loss), CaCO3 %, Al-P2O5, Al-K2O. Results and discussion In the grazed grasslands at Sóly and Várpalota, several new species appeared, whereas those characteristic of the original community were forced back or disappeared. The species composition of the needlegrass dolomite rocky grassland was modified by grazing to a lesser extent. The occurrence of the constituent species of the community became accidental in the sampling sites of both Sóly and Várpalota, whereas Festuca pseudovina became constant. In every case, a decrease of the abundances of the species characteristic of natural conditions, whereas an increase of the abundances of the species indicating degradation was experienced. In grazed areas the withdrawal of protected species was accompanied by the spread of incidental species. Under the impact of grazing, especially in closed grasslands, the abundance of plants characteristic of moderately oligotrophic habitats was increased. The vegetation of the Eperjes Mountain, which can be classified into the group of sloping steppes and sloping rocky grasslands, is under strong anthropogenic impacts. At the sampling site number 1 Festuca rupicola is dominant, and the grass is totally closed. the ratio of weeds was the least, and the most forest species occurred here. Sampling site number 2 is in a transitional area between forest and grassland. The area has shallow soil layer. This sampling area was the most degraded, characterized by the mass presence of Elymus repens and Arrhenatherum elatius. This vegetation can be considered as a considerably changed sloping steppe. The occurrence of nitrophilous</p><p id="Pg487">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1881 species in the highest abundances in the area can be only interpreted as being the result of degradation caused by anthropogenic impacts, since the chemical analyses did not give an explanation for the phenomenon. Sampling site number 3 is situated on an abandoned pasture with some scattered trees. This area was found to be the least disturbed. Dominant grass species was Festuca valesiaca. On the basis of the NB values, this area proved to be the poorest in nitrogen. Nevertheless, considering the amount of organic matter and the ratio of humus within the soil, this site can not be considered as poor in nitrogen. The availability of nitrogen for the plants may be strongly dependent on the amount of storage water, which might be the least here among all the sampling sites. In the sampling site number 4 the original vegetation cannot be found any more, as a consequence of grazing and trampling, only a secondary vegetation is present. In the grass Poa angustifolia is dominant. Among both the dominant and the low-abundance species of the community, the indifferent ones are typical, which do not have any indicator value in respect of the type of habitat. The habitat proved to be deficient in available nitrogen, as indicated by the high abundance value of Poa angustifolia and the shallow soil layer. In the sampling sites numbers 1 and 4 the relative water demand of the plants refers to dry habitats. This is caused first of all by the high abundance value of Festuca rupicola. On the other hand, on the basis of the species composition, empirical observations as to the collecting precipitation at the foot of the slopes and the soil parameters, the sampling site number 1 can be considered as the most fresh habitat, which, however, is not supported by the relative ecological indicator values of the dominant Festuca rupicola. Skeleton soils and rock influenced soils are generally characterized by a high (6–18%) humus content, however, the availabilty of nitrogen for the plants is primarily determined by the depth of the surface soil layer and, consequently, the available amount of water. The real lime content of the investigated soils might be higher than our results suggest, since the carbonates of the dolomite can be detected to a lesser extent by the method of Scheibler. This seems to be the reason for why our results partly differ from the high values usual in the case of rendzinas. The chemical reaction of the soils was neutral or slightly alkaline (pH(H2O) 6,58-7,62; pH(KCl)5,41-7,12), which corresponds with the similar parameters characteristic of rendzinas and rock influenced soils. Significant difference can be detected between the amounts of available nutrients in the soils of the different investigated areas. The K2O content (450–700 ppm) of the sampling sites in Várpalota and Sóly, grazed formerly or at present as well, is high presumably as a result of the nutrient load caused by the periodical or continuous presence of animals in the area. On the contrary, in the control areas of the Eperjes Mountain rather law (110–180 ppm) K2O contents were measured. The P2O5 contents with values of 30–70 ppm in all sampling sites were rather law. Conclusions On the basis of our former and present investigations, it was established that it is hard to draw a parallel between the relative ecological indicator values of the plant species</p><p id="Pg488">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1882 based on empirical experiences and the measured soil parameters, since in many cases they show contrasts or lack any relationships. We are fully aware of the fact that complicated systems of interrelationships exist among the abiotic environmental conditions and the plants, to the clearing up of which a complex statistical analysis may be required. The measured data may be influenced by several further factors, including exposure, the angle of slope, the system of interrelationships among the microclimate, the depth of the surface soil layer, the soil moisture content and the nutrient supplying capacity of the soil, and, in many cases, the impacts of anthropogenic influences. It seems to be reasonable to take into consideration the available soil data bases and the results of recent measurements and investigations of interrelationships, if relative ecological indicator values of plants are reviewed.

GUPTA3 1 Department for Plant Nutrition, Research Institute for Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest, Hungary, krvegh@rissac.hu 2 Agricultural Research Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Martonvásár, Hungary, 3 AICRP on Chickpea, J.N.K.V.V., RAK College, Sehore, MP India Abstract: Potassium bioavailability was studied in a loamy sand soil in the root environment of maize, red clover, spinach and curled lettuce crops differed in root acquisition efficiencies. Spinach and lettuce had the longest roots, while maize crop accumulated the highest amount of biomass in its root system. Bioavailability increased differently to the crops with increasing K supply. Both crop species and increasing K fertilization markedly affected on root acquisition efficiency (KRE: mg shoot K per unit root mass). Significant differences were detected among the crops affecting on NH4-acetate exchangeable soil K. Efficiency in K acquisition was associated with either a proliferated root system or a high rate of net K influx per unit root length. Both increased root length density and high influx rate were strategies involved in efficient K acquisition of the high K demanding lettuce crop. Keywords: K bioavailability, four crop species, root parameters, K influx, acquisition efficiency Introduction Soil potassium supply may be one of the limiting factors of field crop yields, especially for maize (Kovacevic et al. 2007). Soil-root interactions are of special interest in soil K supply and plant K nutrition. Potassium requirement by plant, the activity and distribution of roots in soil and the transport of K to roots, K exchange between soil solution and solid phase, and the release and fixation of soil potassium are the main processes controlling K bioavailability. Moreover, plant roots promote K release to soil solution also by altering physical and chemical properties of the root environment (Pártay et al. 2006). Crop efficiency in the utilization of soil K resources is deeply depends on the acquisition efficiency of the root system. Substantial differences have been observed among crops in the utilization of belowground resources (Rastija et al. 2006) that indicate different root morphology and activity (Bohn et al. 2006). The object was to study the potassium supply of a loamy sand soil in the root environment of crops with various root acquisition efficiencies. Materials and methods The experimental soil was a loamy sand soil classified as Luvisol in Somogysárd, Hungary. Selected properties of the soil are shown in Table 1. Three K levels were set up adding 0, 50 and 200 mg K. kg-1 of soil. We choose the highest K rate added to be less than expected plant withdrawal so that plant should uptake from non-exchangeable K pool. All K sources and N and P fertilizers were mixed into 0.9 kg of air-dried soil in each pot before sowing. Maize (2 seeds), red clover (1 g), spinach (20 seeds) and curled lettuce (0.5 g) were sown in the pots and grown in controlled environment. Potassium free macro- and micronutrient solution was given to the pots regularly („Long Ashton formula”, Sutcliff, 1981). Pots were watered daily, moisture content was checked twice</p><p id="Pg490">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1884 a week by weighting the pots. Three harvests for red clover shoots and two for lettuce leaves were done during the three-month growing period. At the end of the Kexhaustive experiment the whole root system was separated from the soil, the biomass and K content of shoots and roots were measured. Root length was determined by root image analysis (DeltaT). K content in the plant materials was determined by using ICPAES after digestion the sample with 65% HNO3 -30% H2O2 mixture. Cumulative K uptake was calculated for the three clover and two lettuce cuts. Soil readily available K (= sum of soil solution K and exchangeable K) has been characterized by extraction with 1.0 M ammonium-acetate (pH=7.0) solution with 1:25 soil:extractant ratio. The amount of 1 M HNO3 extractable K was taken as the sum of fixed and NH4-acetate soluble K fractions. Table 1. Selected properties of the experimental soil Results and discussion Plant dry mass varied in a range from 14.7 g per pot (for Spinach) to 35.9 g per pot (for maize). Shoot dry mass (SDM) as well as root length (L) differed for the crops significantly (p&lt;0.001) whereas no significant effect of K levels was observed on SDM and L (Table 2.). Figure 1. Root length (left) and specific density (right) for the crops and standard deviations. Spinach and lettuce had the longest roots, while maize had the shortest root system.

Crop species as well as K level affected significantly the specific density of root system (p&lt;0.001 and p&lt;0.05) respectively). The amount of K taken up by shoots varied between 178 to 440 mg for maize, 403 to 564 mg for clover, 300 to 472 mg for spinach, and, 294 to 437 mg per pot for lettuce and was controlled by crop species and K availability (p&lt;0.001). NH4-ac.Kr (NH4acetate K detected in soil after cropping) was 40, 88, 123, and 67 to 90 mg kg-1 for maize, clover, spinach, and lettuce respectively; crop effects differed significantly (p&lt;0.001). No significant differences were obsereved on NH4-ac.Kr as influenced by K fertilization with an only exception of the lettuce soils (p&lt;0.05). The bioavailability of K for a crop mobilized from the slowly available pools by the crop and transported to the root surface was characterized by using the parameter “potassium root acquisition efficiency” (KRE, mg shoot K per unit root mass).

High K content in tissues was associated with longer root system with lower specific root density that indicated a more economic carbon – or energy – use related to maize and curled lettuce crops. Figure 3. K net influx (In) for the crops Higher root densities reduce transport distances to the root surface in soil as well as uptake requirement per unit root length. K requirement for lettuce was higher than for spinach, thus both the increased root length density and high K influx were strategies involved in its efficient K acquisition. Conclusions Bioavailability of K proved to be different for the crops in the increasing K rates. A response of crop K uptake to added K was observed for all crops. K uptake by the crops induced replenishment from the non-exchangeable pool to the available pool of potassium. Efficiency in K acquisition was associated with either the proliferation of root length or the maintenance of a high net K influx rate per unit root length.

The two leafy vegetables with their high K demand showed different features of acquisition efficiency: a proliferated, fine root system with low influx rate for spinach and a similarly long root system with more dry matter allocated (Fig.2) for the lettuce with higher rates of influx especially on the K fertilized soil. 0 2 4 6 8 1 0 1 2 M a i z e C lo v e r S p i n a c h L e tt u c e In (  g .m -1 .s -1 )* 1 0 -3 K 1 K 2 K 3</p><p id="Pg493">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1887 COMPARATIVE EXAMINATION OF MEADOW AND CHERNOZEM SOILS ON THE HAJDÚSÁG LOESS RIDGE Robert VÍG 1 – Attila DOBOS 2 1 Institute for Land Utilisation, Technology and Regional Development, Center of Agricultural Sciences and Engineering, 138 Böszörményi street, Debrecen 4032, Hungary, e-mail: vr.esox@vipmail.hu 2 Institute for Land Utilisation, Technology and Regional Development, Center of Agricultural Sciences and Engineering, University of Debrecen Abstract: In 2006 we examined the differences between chernozem and meadow soils on 580 ha plough-land in the area of Hajdúszoboszló. The soils examined are moderately boundy, slightly limy, they have a low salt content and they are poorly supplied with zinc. The examined chernozem soil with lime deposits is neutral, its humus, nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium content is moderate. Chernozem meadow soil is slightly alkaline, its humus, phosphorous and potassium content is satisfactory, its nitrogen content is moderate. During the comparative evaluation of these two soils we observed statistically proven differences regarding every soil feature, excluding salt content. During our examinations we managed to prove that even between soils belonging to the same soil class there can be significant differences that essentially affect the method and quantity of nutritive supplementing. Currently we do not take the soil types of the plot into consideration in every case when preparing fertilizer application maps for precision nutritive supplementing. Our research results prove that the precision fertilizing advice needs to be completed on the basis of the soil types that can be found in the area. Keywords: Hajduság loess ridge, chernozem and meadow soils, comparative statistical evaluation Introduction The industry-like, strongly chemicalized farming method that disregards production site conditions and the one-sided land utilization has started harmful processes in the soil that led to the decrease of soil fertility (Ángyán and Menyhért, 1988). The fertilization disregarding organic matter supplementing results in the significant decrease of humus content (Füleky and Kovács, 1993; Kismányoky et al., 1993; Kádár, 2007 ), whose extent is significantly influenced by tillage, fertilization and crop rotation (Győrffy, 1975). The maintenance of soil fertility can be reached and excessive N fertilization and environmental pollution can be avoided by calculating the fertilizer N dose needed to keep humus balance in equilibrium (Nagy J., 2007). According to the data resulting from the National Fertilization Long-term Experiments (OMTK), 67-115 kg/ha/year fertilizer N is needed to sustain the humus balance, depending on the soil type examined (Debreczeniné and Győri, 1997). The quantity of the available nitrogen content of the soil depends on the activity of soil microbes that is affected by the moisture content and temperature of the soil, therefore the quantity of inorganic nitrogen changes in every period (Filep, 1995a; Nagy and Jászberényi, 2002; Nagy P. T., 2004). Nitrate ions (NO3 -) are not significantly bound on the surface of soil colloids, therefore they can easily be undermined (Rutkoviene, 2007; Sebin, 2007). The extraction of nitrate depends on the quantity and quality of nitrogen fertilizers applied, the date of nitrogen supplementing, the activity of nitrifying bacteria, climatic conditions, the water balance of the soil and the plants grown (Németh, 2006). Nitrate extraction was measured at a level of 3-7 kg/ha in the case of grass culture, whereas this value was 12-28 kg/ha for cereals, and 18-42 kg/ha for root crops (Zsigrai, 2006).</p><p id="Pg494">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1888 The principles of sustainable development has to be enforced in nutritive management, too, that is we have to synchronize the production and environmental needs, we have to apply the principles of environmentally sound nutritive supplementation that is adjusted to production site conditions (Láng and Csete, 1992). Material and methods In 2006, we sampled 580 ha plough-land in the area of Mátészalka. The soil sampling was based on a digitalized genetic soil map, using GPS navigation and in pre-marked sampling places, in every 5 hectares in 0-30 can and 30-60 cm deep soil layers. The samples were taken between 20/05/2006 and 12/06/2006, and between 19/09/2006 and 02/10/2006. The GIS database was developed using ArcView 3.3 and ArcGis 9.1 software. Soil analyses were carried out in the Agrochemistry and Soil Science Department of the University of Debrecen, using the methods describes by Filep (1995b). The determination of nutritive supply categories was done based on the end values outlined by Filep (1995b). We considered production site categories, pH, ”Arany” bound value and lime content. We considered production site categories and ”Arany” bound value when examining the degree of humus supply; production site categories, pH(KCL) and lime content when examining the available phosphorous content; production site categories and ”Arany” bound value when examining the degree of potassium supply and the ”Arany” bound value when evaluating the degree of zinc supply. The evaluation of the results was done by the statistical software package SPSS for Windows 14.0. The distribution of observed data was evaluated by KolmogorovSmirnov test, variance was evaluated by Levene test. In the case of lime, salt and potassium content, the residual values did not have normal distribution, therefore we applied a non-parametric test for their statistical evaluation (Mann-Whitney test). The residual values of bound level, pH, humus, nitrogen, phosphorous and zinc content had a normal distribution, but their variances were not the same in all cases of the two soil types, therefore we used an independent paired samples t-test for their statistical evaluation. Statistical evaluation was always carried out with a confidence interval of 95%. Results and discussion 59,6% (345,7 ha) of the examined area is meadow chernozem soil, 29,2% (169,6 ha) is chernozem soil with lime deposits, 10,5% (61,2 ha) is chernozem meadow soil. Meadow solonetz soil (2,6 ha) and solonetz meadow soil (1,6 ha) accounts for 0,7% of the sample area. There are three production site categories in the production zone of Hajdúszoboszló: I, III and V. Category I is characteristic of 88,8% of the sample area (meadow chernozem and chernozem soil with lime deposits), category III can be found on 10,8% of the area (chernozem meadow soil and solonetz meadow soil) and only 0,7% of the area represents category V (meadow solonetz soil). We have evaluated the results of soil analyis for chernozem soil with lime deposits and chernozem meadow soil. We examined the upper 30 cm layer. The results are as</p><p id="Pg495">VII.

The chernozem soil with lime deposits is neutral (pH = 6,8), its humus (2,62%), nitrogen (1531 ppm), phosphorous (145 ppm) and potassium content (287 ppm) is moderate. Chernozem meadow soil is slightly alkaline (pH = 8,2), its humus (3,17%), phosphorous (192 ppm) and potassium supply (311 ppm) is satisfactory, whereas its nitrogen content (1807 ppm) is moderate.

Lime- and AL-soluble potassium content is significantly higher in chernozem meadow soil, still, it has to be considered that Mann-Whitney test does not give a reliable result in the justification of difference (Table 1). The standard deviation of measured results differs significantly between the two soil types only in the case of AL-soluble phosphorous and nitrogen. Based on the t-test, the pH, humus-, nitrogen-, phosphorous content of chernozem meadow soil is significantly higher, whereas its zinc content is significantly lower than those measured in the case of chernozem soil with lime deposits (Table 2).

P.O.Box 16., Hungary, e-mail: bancz@office.mta.hu 2 National Institute of Neurosurgery, Budapest 3 Department of Physiology and Neurobiology, Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest Abstract: Effects of prenatal exposition to fumonisin B1 (FB1) on in vitro brain slice bioelectric activity was investigated in the first generation offspring of FB1 treated pregnant rats. This is the first study to use in vitro rat cortex slices as biosensors monitoring pathologic bioelectric activity changes (an epilepsy model) in offspring after FB1 exposition of pregnant rats, and providing evidence for functional anomalies of neurodevelopmental origin. Keywords: fumonisin B1 mycotoxin, epilepsy model, in vitro biotests, rat cortex slice, developmental toxicity Introduction Soil-borne diseases are a major source of mycotoxins, particularly in rural agricultural communities. A high percentage of people have measurable levels of mycotoxins in their blood and tissues (Dutton 1996). Fusarium infections of agricultural plants have accounted for a continuous presence of mycotoxins in the environment that cause animal and human health problems and major economic losses. Fusarium mycotoxins are significant risk factors as the whole population is involved. The fumonisins as natural mycotoxins mainly contaminate corn-based food and feed. Fumonisin B1 (FB1) is the most toxic and most abundant in naturally contaminated foods. Although it has been proved that FB1 exposition of rats may cause adverse effects in bioelectric parameters of the nervous system in vivo and in vitro (Banczerowski-Pelyhe et al., 2002a, b), there are no data concerning developmental neurotoxicity related to the functional anomalies of brain activity. More recent data reveal that FB1 exposure increases the risk of neural tube defects (NTD) in humans. NTDs include spina bifida, hydrocephalus and anencephaly (Mitchell et al., 2004). A relationship between maternal ingestion of FB1-contaminated corn during early pregnancy and increased risk for neural tube defects (NTDs) has recently been proposed in human populations around the world where corn is a dietary staple. FB1 causes NTD and craniofacial defects in mouse embryos (Marasas et al., 2004). FB1 exposition of pregnant rats may cause foetal toxicity as increased incidence of hydrocephalus (Collins et al., 1998). These results call for studies that can more directly measure and assess neurodevelopmental effects. In this study prenatal exposition to FB1 was investigated in young adults of rat offspring. The functional changes of neocortical brain biopotentials were monitored in in vitro cortex slices after prenatal FB1 exposition. Alterations in synaptic excitability and seizure susceptibility in a 4-aminopyridine epilepsy model were analyzed. Materials and methods Pregnant rats were exposed to 6.2 mg/kg body weight/day FB1 by gavage from the 8 th gestation day to the parturition. 400 μm thick transverse slices were prepared from the somatosensory cortex of the offspring 4 weeks after birth.</p><p id="Pg498">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1892 Standard brain slice method was used for electrophysiological recording in vitro. Slices were placed into an interface type recording chamber perfused continuously (1,5 ml/min) with a standard artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). Electrophysiological data were obtained from 9 somatosensory cortex slices of 5 pups of 2 FB1 treated dams at the age of 4 weeks after birth. Electrophysiological measurements were performed at 33±0.5 ºC. Extracellular glass recording electrodes (5-10M) filled with 1M NaCl were positioned into layer III of the neocortex. Glass-insulated, bipolar tungsten electrodes were used for stimulation, and were positioned below the recording electrode at the border of the white-gray matter. Square impulses of 100 μs duration were applied. Signals were amplified by an Axoclamp 2B amplifier (Axon Instruments Inc., Union City, CA), and were displayed on a digital oscilloscope (Gould DSO 420, Gould Electronics, Cleveland, Ohio). Data were also stored on a VHS tape recorder for further analysis. Recorded signals were digitized with an A/D converter (VR-10, Instrutech Corp., Great Neck, New York) and analyzed by using a personal computer. After recording the control values the standard perfusion solution was changed to an ACSF solution containing 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 50µM) for 60 min to induce seizure activity as an epilepsy model. Recorded signals were analyzed by a built-in program of the digital oscilloscope (Gould DSO 420, Gould Electronics, Cleveland, Ohio). Averaged latency and peak-to-peak amplitude of each component of the response was determined. ANOVA (p &lt; 0.05) was used for statistical analysis. Data are presented as mean ± SE. Results and discussion Functional changes of evoked neocortical potentials were detected in in vitro cortex slices of the offpring, the amplitude values were higher than in control slices. Multitoxic anomalies were revealed in the first generation of rat offspring, caused by prenatal exposition of FB1 in a 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) epilepsy model. Modification of 4-AP-induced seizure activity after prenatal FB1 exposition Cortex slices showed an enhanced excitability and stronger epileptic activation. Longlasting ictal seizure activity pattern was characteristic in 4-AP-induced epilepsy model that never appeared in control slices, where an interictal pattern was revealed. FB1 exposition may modify not only physiological but also pathological processes. Figure 1.

Characteristic ictal type of seizure activity recorded from the in vitro somatosensory cortex slices of of the prenatally FB1-exposed rat offspring in the presence of 50 µM 4-aminopyridine in the bathing medium Cortex slices of the control animals showed a characteristic interictal type of spontaneous seizure activity after application of 50µM 4-AP containing ACSF (Figure 1.). In slices from the offspring of FB1 treated pregnant rats a characteristic, longer duration, ictal type of epileptiform seizure activity was revealed after 4-AP perfusion (Figure 2.). Figure 3. Changes of latency, frequency and amplitude of seizure activity in 4-aminopyridine-induced epilepsy model after prenatal exposition of rats to FB1 The latency and the amplitude of the spontaneous seizures in 50µM 4-AP containing solution were significantly increased, and the frequency was decreased in slices of prenatally FB1 exposed rats (Figure 3.). The latency increased from 6.50±0.80 min to 12.00±1.29 min, the frequency decreased from 4.57±0.86 min-1 to 0.35±0.15 min-1, and the amplitude increased from 2.50±0.66 mV to 6.35±0.58 mV (Table 1.). Although the latency increased, the sensibility of the slices increased, that is clearly visible from the data. Because of its similarity to sphinganine, FB1 is a natural inhibitor of de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis. FB1 inhibits ceramide synthase activity, and the main toxic effect is related to accumulation of bioactive intermediates of sphingolipid metabolism (sphinganine and other sphingoid bases and derivatives) as well as depletion of complex sphingolipids.

Sphingolipids are abundant in the nervous system, especially in membranes, and they play a significant role in signal transmission. Modifying the structural components and the cellular pathways, FB1 interferes with the membrane functions. Table 1.

It has been proved that in vitro brain slice biopotential monitoring approach to developmental neurotoxicity is a useful and sensitive biotesting method, that with other in vitro methods (Varró et al. 2007) can reveal quantified functional changes of bioelectric parameters and underlying mechanisms. Modification of bioelectric properties and parameters as biomarkers may characterize adverse effects of long-lasting low-dose prenatal FB1 exposition, modelling food-borne agrotoxic poisoning (Banczerowski-Pelyhe et al. 2006).

Keywords: harvesting , husking, seminal maize hybrid, cob, germination, cold test Introduction In Croatia maize hybrid seed production ranks first per importance. Average years are characterized by approx. 8000 t of seed production. The production itself is followed by a great number of factors affecting adversely maintenance of germination and its power from harvesting to complete seed commodity storage (Airy, 1962; Burris, 1989; Berzy et al., 1994; Pucaric, 1986; Pepo, 2006; Izsáki, 2007; Nagy 2007; Marton et al., 2007). The machinery and seed maize production increase brought about improvement in a harvest tehnology and seed final processing. Sometimes tehnology development is not in accordance with seed quality preservation needs and ways of seed maize harvesting, its transport and final needs and requirements such as germination power, germinabilitiy, cold test and seriesof other indication that mainly depend on the ways of seed maize harvesting, its transport and processing. For the seminal maize production need to avoid soils with easier mehanical structure ( less water, especially at drought) as well as siols with heavier (argillaceous) mechanical structure and colder soils. Besides this, chemical properties must be satisfied. Need to avoid soils with low pH (below 5.5) ans soils with low concentration of nutrients.

Testing of germination was made by two methods (laboratory germination under optimal tempareture conditions and field germination testing by cold test under laboratopry conditions). Results and discussion Hand harvest (HH) seed dropping of the hybrid Bc 492 was 1.26 and with hybrid Bc 462 an average of 1.13 seed per cob. After field machinery (FM) harvesting it was determined that the highest average loss was recorded with hybrid Bc 462 (10.9 seed cob-1) followed by hybrid Bc 492 (10.0) and hybrid Mutin (3.73). By taking samples from the final process picker line it was found out that hybrid Mutin lost 10,3 seeds on an average. The highest seed loss (21.31) was determined with hybrid Bc 492 and 11.32 seeds was recorded with hybrid Bc 462. The greatest loss was again determined with hybrid Bc 492, 24.47 seeds per cob i.e. 68.17% higher compared to hybrid Mutin. By taking samples from the maize picker tank it was determined that the highest losses of the seed dropping were at hybrid Bc 492 of the average value of 17.91 seeds per cob whereas the lowest ones being 7.9 dropped seeds was recorded with hybrid Mutin. Redirection of the husked cobs toward one additional husking section (HS) brought about significant results.The lowest average number of the dropped seeds was again found out at hybrid Mutin, 14.25 seeds per cob. The highest average number of the dropped seeds was recorded at hybrid Bc 462 (22.33 seeds per cob). In second HS we had that hybrid Mutin was characterized by an average seed dropping of 18.61 seeds per cob.The highest number of dropped seeds was recorded with hybrid Bc 492 being 26.98 seeds per cob. Hybrid Bc 492 seed damage after HH amounted to 1.12 damaged seed per harvested cob. Machine FH without field husking led to increase average number of damaged seeds to 1.18 seed. If harvested cobs are directed over the two HS then damage was 2.12 seeds per cob. On field sampling it was determined that an average number of damaged seeds was 1.75 seeds per cob. An average damage ranged from 2.00 to 2.37 seeds per cob was obtained when the cobs passed over one or two HS. Cob HH of the hybrid Mutin resulted in damage of 2 seeds per cob on an average.An average loss of 2.43-3.18 seeds per cob were achieved when husked cobs were in the final process unit. Final process of the husked hybrid Mutin cobs increased seed damage to 4.37 seeds per cob. Field HH resulted in damages of 1.56 seeds per cob on an average at hybrid Bc 462. Cobs harvested by a picker without husking had final process</p><p id="Pg503">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1897 damages ranged from 2.12 to 3.12 seeds per cob. An average seed damage of 3.5 seeds per cob was recorded on cobs transporting into a final process followed by their shaking into a receiving basket.Damage level was increased to 7.93 seeds per cob on its passing over the two husking decks.

An average germination determined by a cold test method during HH was 98.5% with hybrid Bc 492 , 93.50% with Bc 462 and 95.50% with Mutin. As some phases of the harvesting and final processing were gradually wearing on germination level recorded by a cold test was gradually decreasing.HH seed germination amounted to 99.12% with hybrid Bc 492 and 96.37% with Bc 462. Average seed germination with Mutin was 98.75% If unhusked cobs were rederected toward one HS germination reduction was by 0.25% on the average compared to hand harvesting. However, when cobs passed over two HS germination level was reduced by 0.75% .When cobs were directed to an additional husking germination level dropped by 0.75%. Hybrid Mutin harvested by a maize picker without field husking was not known for significant difference compared to a HH. Germination level drop by 0.89% occured after rederection and passing over the first husking deck. Also, germination reduction of 1.01% compared to HH occured after passing over two husking sections. Germination being lower by 0.26% compared to HH was recorded with hybrid Bc 462 harvested by a machine without field husking during the harvesting period. Further average germination drop of 0.38% was determined after the cobs had been delivered into a final processing and shaked into a receiving basket.The sampling of the cobs passed by the final process technology over one husking section was followed by determination of an average germination drop of 0.64%. Average germination drop by</p><p id="Pg504">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1898 1.03% was determined when mother's component cobs of the hybrid Bc462 passed over the two HS. Field cobs reload followed by a transport and shaking into a receiving basket resulted in germination level reduction of 1.39%. When husked cobs passed one or two husking sections germination reduction from 1.65 to 1.77% occured.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1899 INFLUENCE OF NUTRIENT SUPPLY ON TUBER AND SUGAR YIELD OF JERUSALEM ARTICHOKE (HELIANTHUS TUBEROSUS L.) Gabriella K. NÉMETH-Zoltán IZSÁKI-Tamás K. NÉMETH Faculty of Agricultural Water and Environmental Management, Tessedik Samuel College H-5540 Szarvas, P.O.B. 3, Hungary; e-mail: kadi.gabriella@mvk.tsf.hu Abstract Nutrient supply experiments of Jerusalem artichoke were started in 2002 in Galambos Experimental Farm of Agricultural Sciences Institut of Faculty of Agricultural, Water and Environmental Management of Tessedik Samuel College with two varieties, 15 treatments in split-split plot experiment in four repetitions, on chernoziem meadow soil The height of plants, the number of main and side shoots, the green and dry matter yield as well as the tuber yield were analyzed monthly during the growing season. The aim of this presentation is to demonstrate the influence of nutrient supply on energetically utilizable components of the Jerusalem artichoke variety Tápiói korai, namely on the tuber yield, sugar content of tuber and sugar yield. Introduction The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus L.) comes from North America, where the native people consumed its tuber (Láng 1976). It was brought to Europe by the French. At present the biggest growing area of Jerusalem artichoke is in France where the tuber and the stem are produced mainly for animal feeding purposes. In Siberia it is utilized as a green fodder and bulk fodder (Jakuskin, 1950). Experiments were carried out to increase the fructose (inuline) content of the tuber. In these experiments the inuline content of hybrids was over 20 % (Davidovics, 1951; Marcsenkó, 1952 ). In Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Holland its tuber is used mainly as a human food, while the stem is used for fodder. The stem of Jerusalem artichoke is tender and in leafy form it is as good for fodder as the alfalfa. It can be produced as a perennial plant very well on the poor sandy soils, and it can serve for the protection against deflation and erosion. The utilization of tuber of artichoke is very wide range. It can be used for making soups, sauces, salads and pickles. The dishes made of artichoke are very healthy and can be used to treat the obese people and the patients suffering from diabetes and vascular system diseases. It can be used for production of sweeteners (high fructose content), high inuline content flour products and ethyl-alcohol. The plant is undemanding to soil and climate. It is not sensitive to drought and can be utilized as an alternative plant (Molnár 2001). The importance of Jerusalem artichoke as an alternative plant might be increased by its absolute suitability for the sustainable agriculture as the significance of sustainability has been emphasized by several authors recently (Birkás et al. 2007; Balogh et al. 2007; Husti 2006; József et al. 2007). In Hungary Lippay (1664) wrote about its positive features and indifferent character towards the soil in his work titled Posoni kert. From point of view of development of agrotechnology it is very important to identify the possibilities of environment friendly nutrient supply, and to analyze the influence of fertilization on its yield and quality. It was found that the green yield and the dry matter produce as well as the tuber yield of the different artichoke varieties might be very different, thus the specific nutrient demand might be different for each variety. The aim of our experiment is to identify the</p><p id="Pg506">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1900 relationships of nutrient supply, yield and quality of Jerusalem artichoke. This presentation demonstrates the nutrient content of the early artichoke variety Tápiói as well as the changes in its nutrient uptake during the growing season and finally gives information on the specific nutrient demand of the studied variety. Materials and methods Nutrient supply experiments of Jerusalem artichoke were started in 2002 in Galambos Experimental Farm of Plant Cultivation and Ecological farming Department of Faculty of Agricultural, Water and Environmental Management of Tessedik Samuel College with two varieties, 15 treatments in split-split plot experiment in four repetitions, on chernoziem meadow soil. The height of plants, the number of main and side shoots, the green and dry matter yield as well as the tuber yield were analyzed monthly during the growing season. Before the starting of the experiment the NO3-N content of the 0-60 cm soil layer was 71 kgha-1, while its AL-P2O5 content was 121 mgkg -1 and AL-K2O content was 278 mgkg-1. The planting was carried on 20 March manually. The production area was 0.75m x 0.6m= 0.45m2 while the planting depth was 10 cm. The size of plot was 4.5m7.2m32.4m2 and the number plants was 22,200 ind ha-1. The weather of 2002 was dry and hot. The total rain fall was 392.5 mm, however its distribution was uneven. The germination was very slow because of lack of rain, and in the period of intensive growing and tuber development there was also very little rain. The nutrient uptake of artichoke is shown as an average of nutrient treatments. Results and conclusions The influence of nutrient supply on tuber yield of Jerusalem artichoke is shown in Table 1. The tuber yield of the studied variety was 45.43 t ha-1 in the control plots which were not fertilized, while in the plots treated with 100 kgha-1 nitrogen the yield increase was statistically proven (49.02 tha-1). However the further increase of N dose resulted in yield decrease. The tuber yield did not increase in the studied year by improvement of phosphorus and potassium supply.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1903 DETERMINATION OF FREE AMINO ACIDS IN HONEY BY GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY Éva SZÉLES - Mónika LUCA - Nikolett CZIPA - József PROKISCH Institute of Food Science, Quality Assurance and Microbiology, Centre of Agricultural Sciences, University of Debrecen, 4032 Debrecen Böszörményi út 138. Hungary e-mail: jprokisch@agr.unideb.hu Abstract: The purpose of this study was to develop a simple analytical method to determine free amino acids in honey samples by gas chromatography – mass spectrometry. After dilution of honey samples (1:10, with pH=9 boric acid buffer, 2 ml) chloroform (2 ml), methanol:pyridine solution (4:1, 1 ml), trifluoro acetic acid (500 µl) and ethylchloroformate (100 µl) were added. 2 µl from the organic phase was injected to the GC/MS. Applying this method 12 amino acid (histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, valine, alanine, glutamic, acid, glycine, proline, tyrosine) concentration can be determined from honey samples. This method was applied for determination of amino aids in 14 honey samples from different origins. Keywords: amino acid, honey, GC/MS Introduction Amino acids have important role in the diet and the free amino acid supplementation has positive effect on different health problems. Lysine can cure the herpes simplex infection, methyionine is a strong antioxidant, proline improves the skin texture by aiding the production of collagen, and with vitamin C it can promote healthy connective tissues. The amino acid composition has relation with the type and the origin of honey therefore it can be used for implementation of a traceability system (Kádár 2007, Várallyai 2006 a,b). In Honey the proline is unique, because this amino acid come mainly from the honeybee during the conversion of nectar into honey. The amount of proline in honey has been proposed as an indicator of honey ripeness, together with other determinations also related to honeybee, such as sacharase and glucose oxidase activities. Proline in honey must account for more than 200 mg/kg, and at least 66% of the total free amino acids (usually 80–90%). Since some amino acids are precursors of volatile compounds, attempts to find useful relationships between amino acid composition and characteristic aromas for eucalyptus and lavender honeys, have been made. Eucalyptus honey could be characterized by means of 7 volatile compounds, whereas lavender honey had only 5 characteristic volatile compounds, the amounts of phenylalanine and tyrosine found in these honeys being much higher than other amino acids. Proline was always the main amino acid in eucalyptus honey, but not lavender honey. Namera, et al. (2002) published a direct extract derivatization method for determination of amino acids in human urine by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. This method was changed and developed for honey samples. The aim of this work was, to develop, study and validate a simple method for measurement of free amino acid composition of honey and contribute to the scarce knowledge about the free amino acid composition of different Hungarian honeys. Materials and methods After dilution of honey samples (1:10, with pH=9 boric acid buffer, 2 ml) chloroform (2 ml), methanol:pyridine solution (4:1, 1 ml), trifluoro acetic acid (500 µl) and</p><p id="Pg510">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Applying this method 12 amino acid (histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, valine, alanine, glutamic acid, glycine, proline, tyrosine) concentration can be determined from honey samples. The GC was a Varian 4000 Ion Trap GC/MS with a Combi-PAL autosampler. 3 µl samles were injected, WCOT Fused Silica 30 m CP WAX 52CB column was used, starting temperature was 50 oC and the end point 270 oC with 15 oC/min ramp. The origin of studied honey samples was in Hungary and the type of honeys were the following: acacia (4), common milkweed (3), goldenrod (2), rape (3), chestnut (2), mixed flower (4), lime, coriander (3) and pine (3). Results and discussion The pH have significant effect on the derivatization procedure. An amino acid mix standard sample was prepared on different pH. We obtained the maximum signal with the GC/MS for the proline at pH=9. This signal was ten times higher than the signal at pH=2, therefore the honey samples were diluted by ten times with a pH=9 boricacid/borax buffer (2,8 g boric acid and 18 g borax →1000 ml).

Cereal Research Communications 1906 Conclusions The developed and applied method require a short sample preparation time, relatively simple and easily applicable for measuring of free amino acid content of honey. It is one of the most selective and most sensitive method for the measurement of proline content of honey, what could help in the identification of origin. The proline concentration provides information on honey ripeness and can be used to prove honey adulteration. A guideline value for an unadulterated, mature honey is 180 mg/kg. Lower values are indicative of a honey adulterated by sugar-feeding or sugar addition. An exception is acacia honey, for which proline levels may perfectly well be below 180 mg/kg. Among the studied 24 honeys two samples were suspicious for the adulteration according to the proline content. Acknowledgements This work was supported by Bolyai János Scholarship.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1907 COMPLEX EVALUATION OF THE QUALITY OF WINTER WHEAT VARIETIES Zoltán GYŐRI Institute of Food Science, Quality Assurance and Microbiology, Faculty of Agronomy, University of Debrecen, 138 Böszörményi Street, Debrecen, H-4032 Hungary, gyori@agr.unideb.hu Abstract: For the complex evaluation of quality of winter wheat varieties we have elaborated a quality index for winter wheat samples called Z-index. This index could be a good complex quality indicator both for variety and environment comparisons and the graphical representation gives helpful information about the quality performance of different samples rapidly. In this study I present its application by the examination of the effect of applied variety and mineral fertilization on flour quality. Keywords: winter wheat, flour quality, complex evaluation Introduction The study of winter wheat quality and the interpretation of the results have been in the focus of the researchers and the specialists in this century, because every participant of the product-path is highly interested in good quality, but in different ways (Pepó et al., 2006, Sipos et al., 2007; Tanács, 2007, Varga et al., 2007). This is very well illustrated by N. L. Kent’s book “Technology of Cereals” (1990). As a result of these various demands a new approach to the concept of quality has developed, consisting of multiple analyses. The geographical spreading, the applicability of these (in research, producer’s and consumer’s practice) is different, but the tendency to analyse more and more properties is general. This remains true even when we are making efforts to develop simpler, faster, easily interpretable methods of analyses. The collective interpretation of the quality parameters of the winter wheat can be imagined in multiple ways in spite of its difficulty. Furthermore, several researchers developed complex quality indexes. In Hungary Pollhamerné (1967) has developed the Complex Quality Number, accounting for 10 quality parameters. The research team lead by Miklós Szabó presented in 1973 the combined quality index which accounted for less loaf quality parameters than the previous one, the rarely determined crust content was also omitted, but the Hagberg’s falling number was included. The so called „baking index” (indice boulanger) developed in Belgium accounts for only five parameters, omitting the gluten characteristics and the Farinographic kneading test but including the Alveographic parameters (Bollen et al., 1986). There were started similar initiative in Germany taking into consideration protein content, Zeleny’s volume, Hagberg falling number, water absorbtion, Farinograph value, extensograph value, rapid mix test and the properties of test loaf (Oberforster and Werteker, 1995). Taking into account the domestic traditions that imply the wet gluten content, the gluten expansiveness and the Farinographic kneading test, I tried to improve these indexes based on the experience gained during my study-trips. So I developed a complex scoring system based on multiple quality parameters. The details are presented on the Table 1. It can be seen that I have taken into account the most commonly used Hungarian quality parameters and some parameters of the Alveographic test. Scoring every parameter individually I have created the so-called Z-index. It can be represented in two forms, the numerical and the graphical representation. In my opinion both forms are suitable to give an overall picture about the quality in the daily practice. The</p><p id="Pg514">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1909 Materials and methods Analysed samples for the presentation of Z-index are from year 2006. Samples are from the University of Debrecen Centre of Agricultural Sciences Látókép Experimental Farm, and we have analysed the GK Öthalom, Mv Emese, GK Kapos and Saturnus varietes at two fertilizer level (30 kg ha-1 N, 22.5 kg ha-1 P2O5, 26.5 kg ha -1 K2O (1 st dose) and 150 kg ha-1 N, 112.5 kg ha-1 P2O5 and 132.5 kg ha -1 K2O (4 th dose)). By these samples we can characterize the role of mineral fertilization on the Z-index on several varieties. Analytic examinations were made in the University of Debrecen Centre of Agricultural Sciences, Institute of Food Science, Quality Assurance and Microbiology by the current Hungarian, ISO standards and AACC methods. Because of the limited amount of samples, examination of test loaf was omitted by all samples and the diagrams and Zindex values do not contain these parameters. Results and discussion The results of quality analysis can be found in Table 2. It is visible that there are diverse quality parameters were measured, e.g. the valorigraph value ranged from 47.7 to 72.2 BU, protein content ranged from 12.8 to 17.9%, wet gluten content ranged from 28,4 to 43.2. It gives the possibility to examine the formation of Z-index with flours with different quality. The most stable parameters were the water absorbtion and the falling number. Table 2.: Quality parameters of different winter wheat samples (2006) The changes in quality are clearly visible in the formation of Z-index in the Figure 1. In 2006 we have experienced major variety effect than fertilizer effect; fertilization caused only a small increase in Z-index; in the case of GK Öthalom this increase was 19,6, but the other examined varieties the changes was between – 4,6 to 12 (Z-index of Saturnus variety decreased by fertilization).

According to our previous investigations it is suitable for the assessment and representation of the differences among varieties and the effect of fertilisation or the cropping year on the quality as well.

We studied effects of lignite on immobilization of toxic metals under laboratory conditions. A soil incubation experiment was carried out in a complex experimental system with Cr, Pb, Zn salts with respect to the normalized matrix-plan. After incubation there were assayed the metal fractions with different mobility: nitrohydrochloric acid soluble (“total”) metal concentration, and distilled water, acetate buffer, Lakanen-Erviö buffer soluble metal concentration for mobile fractions. The strongest stabilisation effect of lignite can be seen in case of Cr while the weakest in case of Zn. It is confirmed that the lignite is a suitable additive for chemical stabilisation during combined chemical- and phytostabilisation of contaminated soils. Keywords: heavy metal, lignite, chemical stabilisation Introduction Pollution of the Biosphere with toxic metals and other chemicals may pose remarkable environmental and human health risk (Várallyay, 2006). Usually the most efficient in situ technology for cleaning the toxic metal contaminated soil is combined physicochemical and phytoremediation technologies (Bíro, 2007, Feigl et al., 2006). There are many inorganic and organic stabilising amendments (Carmona et al. 2005; Maurice and Kumpiene 2005, Terzano et al., 2005, Gaast et al., 2003, Weigand et al., 2003) but only a few are tested under laboratory conditions. Lignite is a potential chemical stabilising agent for a chemical stabilization remediation technology. We studied effects of lignite on immobilization of toxic metals under laboratory conditions. Materials and methods A soil incubation experiment was carried out in a complex experimental system. DISITOBI model assures information about experimental object characterized by multidimensional response-function (Biczók et al. 1994, Anton et al. 1994). There were 4 treatments (lignite, Pb, Cr, Zn as Pb(NO3)2; Cr(NO3)3.9H2O; ZnSO4.7H2O.) in 3 replications. 5-5 levels of the 4 studied factors were combined in an orthogonal way by means of the program with respect to the normalized matrix-plan. Temperature and soil moisture were constant during the incubation period (4 weeks). The parameters of the model acidic sandy soil are: pH(H 2 O) 4,9; OM 0,9%; CaCO 3 0%; salt &lt;0,02%; total N,P,K (mg/kg): 610, 329, 1770, respectively. After incubation there were assayed the metal fractions with different mobility: nitrohydrochloric acid soluble (“total”) metal concentration, and distilled water, acetate buffer, Lakanen-Erviö buffer soluble metal concentration for mobile fractions.

Cereal Research Communications 1912 Results and discussion The distilled water and acetate buffer extracts are modeling the migration-infiltration risk of pollutants, while concentrations in Lakanen Erviö buffer gives information about of possibility of plant uptake. According to the experimental model (Table 1.), lignite had a significant negative effect on mobility of Cr and Zn in each extracts and of Pb in distilled water and acetate buffer extracts. The strongest stabilisation effect of lignite can be seen in case of Cr while the weakest in case of Zn. The Cr concentration of mobile fractions were reduced by 96%; 92%; 77% in distilled water, acetate buffer and Lakanen Erviö extracts respectively under the effect of 10 mass % lignite. The 10 mass % lignite concentration reduced the Zn mobility by more than 61% in distilled water and by 56 % and 38 % in acetate buffer and Lakanen Erviö extract (Figure 1-3.).

Its biological role is very important, especially in enzyme activity in order that plants receive sufficient copper supply. Therefore their replacement is essential. Foliar treatments were launched with copper-tetrammine complex on winter wheat in small plot trials. Treatments were applied at phenological state of flowering, on alluvial Danube soil in Darnózseli in 2007. Copper treatments resulted in significant yield increase. Raw protein and gluten content increased as well. Keywords: copper, winter wheat, yield, raw protein, gluten Introduction The composition of soils and the climate conditions, varieties and compaction in Hungary are favourable for growing quality wheat. Besides several parameters organic matter and macro-element content play an outstanding role in quality wheat growing (Mezei et.al.2007; Birkas et.al. 2007). Application of fertilizers and the steady increase of yields weakened the soil’s nutrient supply ability, which resulted in qualitative and quantitative decrease in wheat growing (Pepó, 2007; Kádár 2007). Microelement supply of soils decreases together with the decrease of the organic matter content at a considerable rate. Qualitative and quantitative plant growing is only possible through controlled nutrient management (Szakal et.al 2007). Plants can take up nutrients necessary for their growth from the environment. So they can take them up from the air through the leaves (leaf fertilizer, rainfall) and from the soil through the roots. Prior to the nutrient uptake there is a certain sorting activity, which is connected to building and decay processes (Pecznik, 1976). Nutrient requirements due to interrelationship between nutrient elements are not independent from each other, so the plant’s needs of a nutrient element can only be provided together with the relevant nutrient requirements (Kádár, 1999). The primary role of plant leaves is photosynthesis and controlled transpiration. Leaves are only restricted and only under certain conditions able to uptake nutrients because of their structure. In case of nutrient uptake through the leaves the nutrients get quickly to the place of usage namely to the leaf cells. After passing through the cell wall nutrient ions will be bound adsorptive and get into the protoplasm. This process is mainly influenced by the pH value. Only a small proportion of copper is available due to its complex building ability and higher adsorption energy. Copper is available in compounds and chemical processes in two oxidation forms as Cu2 + and Cu+ ions. Copper ions (I) are instable and are likely to disproportion, which happens in two steps resulting in a Cu(s) + Cu+ system (Gergely et.al 2001). Nutrient uptake of complex compounds is more favourable and the size and chemical composition of ligandum is of grater importance. The stability coefficient of complex compounds has also an important role in nutrient uptake. As wheat shows a strong reaction to copper deficiency we applied foliar treatments using copper-tetrammine complexes.</p><p id="Pg522">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

E-mail: schmidtr@mtk.nyme.hu Abstract: Plants react on zinc deficiency sensitively. Soils in Hungary show a considerable zinc deficiency so it must be replaced. Different compounds, complex compounds can be used for that purpose. Because of high costs of zinc fertilisation, leaf fertilisation seemed to be appropriate. In our experiments zinc and zinctetrammine-ion were put into zeolite by ion exchange. This zinc-ion-exchanged-synthesised-zeolite was applied on the plant foliage at the fenological state of flowering. Keywords: zinc, wheat, zeolite, yield, protein, gluten Introduction In plant growing the resolute nutrient supply and the ability of optimal supply is essential for the sake of fulfilling the requirements of the varieties. Greater efficiency, environment protection and cost saving have priority (Balogh et. al. 2007, Jolánkai et. al.2007). These efforts led to the development of nutrient supplying products with retard effect. Soils in Hungary show considerable zinc deficiency. Crop grown on soils with a fairly good zinc supply often show zinc deficiency (Barkóczi et. al. 2002; Schmidt and Szakál 2007). Zinc as a microelement is of great importance, e.g. it is inevitable because of its role in plant growth, in forming indole acetic acid and in enzyme activity (Biró et.al. 2007). In lack of it plant growth is weak, the leaves are small in size and the foliage is poor. Most of our cultivated plants are sensitive to zinc deficiency. In recent times more and more research works deal with the role of Zn in plant production, its effect on yield and crop quality (Szakal et.al. 2003). The elimination of deficiency symptoms should be carefully considered. They should be replaced. Considering the above- mentioned aspects the retard effect was produced by putting zinc into synthesised zeolite by ion exchange as well as by surface absorption (Lesny et.al. 2005). The xenoliths of natural zeolites are less suitable for this purpose due to their ion-exchange capacity (Mumpton, 1978). Zeolites are crystal alkali- or alkali-earth metal-aluminium-hydro-silicates. According to their three-dimensional structure they are silicon-centred SiO4 tetrahedrons, which can isomorphic be replaced by e.g. AlO4 forming tetrahedrons in the grid. The trivalent Al containing tetrahedrons have one negative charge, therefore they can be neutralised by cations. The rate of Si/Al, an important feature of zeolites, can range from one to infinity. The rate of 1:1 is theoretically the lowest limit, as in zeolites AlO4 tetrahedrons cannot connect with each other directly but through SiO4 tetrahedrons. Zeolites, which are synthesised with the use of ionic or neutral organic compounds, mostly amines or quaternary ammonium salts having a leading role in structure-forming because of their structure controlling effect, contain generally less aluminium. The inner surface of zeolites, i.e. the canal and the pore system is much higher than its outer surface (Nagy et. al. 1998).</p><p id="Pg526">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1920 The cation exchange can happen either in the pores or in the canal or on the surface of zeolites. Cations compensating the negative charge of the grid can be changed for other ions usually reversibly. Moisture content, water-soluble compounds and gas components of the air (e.g. CO2, NH3) can contribute to further ion exchange. The process leading to ion exchange balance can be described with ion exchange isotherms (Lesny, 2005). If the sodium ions in a zeolite that got into it through synthesis are exchanged by other ions, the pore size can change. The size and solvation of entering and leaving ions determine the ion exchange of zeolite of a certain pore size. Further more the geometry of the canal or the pore system, the position of the charges in the pore and the temperature at ion exchange are determining factors. Materials and methods In our trials we used Zeolon-P4A synthesised zeolite. The sodium ion was exchanged by zinc or zinc-tetrammine ion in the canals and on the surface of zeolite. The zinc content of this type Zn-synthesised zeolite was 4.1 w/w %. Experiments on winter wheat were launched in four repetitions randomised blocks design on plots of 10m2 in Darnózseli in 2002. Ion exchanged zeolites were applied in the form of watersuspension in the foliar treatments at flowering. Table 1 contains the average soil composition. Plots were harvested with plot-combine harvester.

Significant yield increase could be reached with a zinc-doses of 2.0 kg/ha. According to calculations SZD5% value was 0.25.

E-mail: schmidtr@mtk.nyme.hu Abstract: The organic matter of soils is an important element of soil fertility. In our experiment by administration of compost we tried to improve the physical properties and the nitrogen supply of the soil We composted sewage-sludge in the two chamber ripening compost equipment of Kommunális Szolgáltató Kft., Győr (Communal Services and Sewage Farm Ltd.). The sewage sludge was used for the production of biogas. Due to the fermentation a part of the organic matter content was microbiologically decomposed. After a ripening period of six months the compost was brought out to the fields and incorporated into the soil by ploughing. Different doses of compost was applied. To compare the effect of the compost NPK fertiliser was also applied. Maize was the test plant. As a result of the treatments yields rapidly increased, and zinc and copper accumulation was to be detected among toxic elements. Keywords: compost, maize, yield, copper, zinc Introduction Applying fertilizers and the steady increase of yields drastically decreased the quantity of biomass – plant residues and manure − returned into the soil and resulted in the degradation of both genetic soil types followed by a decreasing micro element supply (Kádár 2007). Sewage-sludge compost is one of the possible ways of supplying soils with organic materials and nutrients (Németh et. al. 1998). Composted nutrients can be put more slowly available than those of fertilizers therefore their application is much favourable for retard nutrient supply and environment protection (Petróczki et. al. 2005). Sewagesludge has a beneficial effect on the physical, chemical and biological features of the soils. While treating sewage-water toxic compounds and harmful micro-organisms can concentrate in the sewage-sludge (Sándor et.al 2007). The quantity of toxic elements is mostly of industrial origin. The heavy metal content of communal sewage-sludge is very low in Hungary, but its agricultural application at higher rates could have an unfavourable effect because of the accumulation of toxic elements. The quantity of sewage-sludge is expected to reach 1.5 million tons in 2008. The disposal of sewage-sludge in agricultural use undergoes strict environmental and public health control. Only communal sewage-sludge can be disposed on fields, industrial sewage-sludge cannot be applied because of its heavy metal content. The disposal of sewage-sludge on fields is bound to epidemic hygienic control, which is well done by composting (Barna, 1998). Communal sewage-sludge compost generally contain much less potassium than nitrogen and phosphor (Bunting 1963). The potassium content remains under 0.5 w/w % in dry matter, therefore a supplement doses of potassium is necessary (Bruce-Davis 1982).

After the disposal compost was evenly spread and accurately ploughed in. The experiments were carried out on a sandy soil with low organic matter content. The test plant was maize. The control plot was not fertilized at all (absolute control), but the next plot received a fertilizer treatment by 120 kg/ha dose with N,P,K content of 15-15-15 % respectively. We analysed the yield and toxic elements of maize. Results and discussion Analysis of yield Compared to the absolute control every treatment increased the yield.

After a ripening period of six months compost was brought to the fields before sowing. Soils with and without fertilisation and with compost treatment were involved into the trials. We tested the yield and chemical composition of maize plants. As a result of the treatments we measured the highest significant increase of yield and raw protein content after compost treatment of 50 and 100 tha-1 dose respectively. A significantly growing accumulation of toxic copper and zinc elements could also be measured after compost treatments. References Bruce, A.M. – Davis, R.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1927 ELEMENT CONTENT OF YOUNG CANOLA GROWN ON DIFFERENT NITROGEN SUPPLY LEVELS Tamás NÉMETH – Gabriella MÁTHÉ-GÁSPÁR Research Institute for Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, H1022 Budapest, Herman Ottó St. 15., Hungary, E-mail: nemeth@rissac.hu, ggabi@rissac.hu Abstract: N fertilization has a considerable effect on the quantity and quality of canola (Brassica napus L. subsp. napus) yield. The N supply of crop, which is in relationship with the uptake of N and other elements, is determined by ecological factors (soil and weather conditions) and fertilization. The aim of present work was to investigate the influence of N fertilization on the element content of young canola grown on calcareous chernozem soil in 2003 autumn. There was a significant increase in the nitrogen content of plant samples collected in early October from N fertilized plots as compared to the control, while no changes occurred in the content of other elements. On the second sampling, in November notable changes could be observed in the shoot element content. As a response to N fertilization not only the N content, but P, K, Mg, Cu and Sr contents of young canola were higher and the Mo content lower as compared to control plants. The higher N supply level significantly increased the ratio of nitrogen to other elements (namely P, S, Ca and Mg), which indicates a lower rate of increase in the content of later elements. In addition to N fertilizer responses, changes in element contents were also due to the autumn growth of shoot mass. The K, S, Ca, Mg and Sr contents of samples taken on the second sampling date were lower in all treatments, while only control plants had lower N, P and Cu contents. The gained results underline the decisive role of N fertilization in the adequate nutrient supply of young canola. Key words: canola, autumn, N fertilization, element content, element ratio Introduction The decisive role of N supply on yield quantity and quality has been widely reported for all crops (Lehoczky et al., 2006; Izsáki, 2007; Kádár, 2007). It is similarly well-known that canola (Brassica napus L. subsp. napus) is characterized by a high N requirement (Németh, 1987-1988; Kádár, 2002; Németh et al., 2007). Numerous studies have established relationships between N supply or the plants’ development stage and plant element content (N and other nutrient elements as well). The majority of available data refer to spring or summer plant development stages, namely from budding to ripening. Kádár et al. (2002) found that N fertilization raised the concentration of other elements (i.e. Ca, Mg and Na) in shoot, while significant changes in Zn and Cu contents were only induced by P fertilization. Our previously reported data indicated that N treatment had a different effect on S and C contents (Máthé-Gáspár et al., 2007/a; Németh et al., 2007). The aim of present work was to investigate the effect of N fertilization on the element content of canola plant shoots in the autumn period. Material and methods The canola experiment was carried out on calcareous chernozem soil in Nagyhörcsök (Hungary) in 2003–2004, as part of the long-term N fertilization field trial. The N rates applied in autumn were: 0 (control), 75, 150 and 225 kg N·ha-1. Uniformly all treatments received 100 kg ha-1 P2O5 and K2O fertilizers. The previous crop was spring barley. The main soil characteristics of the 0–25 cm layer of the control plots were: humus content: 2.95%, pHKCl: 7.41, CaCO3: 9.46%, plasticity index (AK): 40, salt: &lt;0.02%, N content (total): 0.191%. At the start of the canola</p><p id="Pg534">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1928 experiment the NO3-N of the upper (0–40 cm) soil layers differed substantially due to the effect of long-term treatments. In the control and N-treated plots these were as follows: 4.8, 16.9, 26.9, 43.4, mg NO3-N·kg -1, respectively. The total content of the studied 14 other elements in the upper soil layer – extracted with aqua regia (HCl/HNO3) and analysed by ICP spectrometry – were as follows (in mg·kg-1): Al: 26941, B: 12.9, Ca: 33302, Cu: 14.2, Fe: 23381, K: 5129, Mg: 11255, Mn: 605, Mo: below determination limit, Na: 200, Ni: 25.3, P: 1048, S: 300 and Zn: 49.6, respectively. The summer period of 2003 was dry, so in spite of the rainy October, the annual precipitation indicated about 90 mm deficiency in comparison to long-term data. Canola cv. GK-Gabriella was grown in four replications (sowing time: 8 September 2003). 20 plants per treatment were collected twice (on 1 October and 11 November 2003). Fresh and air-dried shoot mass were measured. N content was analysed after standard preparation and digestion with H2SO4 by the Kjeldahl method. ICP spectrometry was used to determine the content of the studied 15 elements (extracted by HNO3). The statistical evaluation was carried out by variance analysis and Fisher’s t-test. Results and discussion Dry shoot mass, as previously reported (Máthé-Gáspár et al., 2007/b), was similar in the control and N treatments at both autumn sampling dates (in October and November). This was due to the dry weather at sowing, increased inhibition of earlier plant development in N treatments as compared to the control, so there was no differences in the dry shoot mass of samples. Figure 1. Effect of N doses on the N and K contents (A), and P and S contents (B) of canola shoots sampled on two autumn dates The element content and element ratios of canola differed significantly as a response to N treatment. Sampling time and plant growth development stage also influenced the changes (Table 1, Figure 1). In early October in N-treated plants only the nitrogen content increased significantly, the content of other studied elements was similar to that of the control and were characteristically high. P, K, S, Ca and Mg contents were as follows: &gt;0.5%, &gt; 4%, &gt; 1.3%, &gt; 3.2% and &gt; 0.46%. Young plants at 3–4 leaf stage had high N content (4.6 %) even in case they were grown without N fertilizer. The N content increased (5.2%) in plants collected from the 75 kg N ha-1 treatment, which indicated unambiguously high N uptake. Higher N doses had no further enhancing effect (Figure 1). 0 2 4 6 0 75 150 225 N doses, kg ha-1 e le m e n t co n te n t, % N oct N nov K oct K nov A 0 0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6 0 75 150 225 N doses, kg ha-1 el e m e n t c o n te n t, % P oct P nov S oct S nov B</p><p id="Pg535">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1929 Shoot element content changed with the development and growth of canola, which indicates the effect of N fertilizers and aging. The shoot element content of plant samples collected in November showed numerous differences in element uptake. N fertilizer application resulted changes in the content of a number of elements (Table 1). Table 1. Meso- and microelement content of canola shoot sampled in November, mg kg-1 d.w.

This registered N deficiency was also visual by the end of autumn (Máthé-Gáspár et al., 2007/b). Naturally, N treatment significantly increased not only the N content, but with the exception of S, the content of all macroelements, so that of P and K, and resulted many differences in the meso and microelement contents of shoot (Table 1), too. These results were conform with previous data gained in respect to changes in N, P and Mg content, but do not fall in line with data on Ca, Na or Cu reported by Kádár et al. (2002). In comparison to control plants, N fertilization increased the Mg, Cu and Sr content of shoots, but decreased their Mo content. The later might have been caused by the very low (&lt; dl) Mo content of soil. Comparing the results of the two sampling dates, it was found that as an effect of autumnal growth, the K, Ca and S contents of shoot samples decreased significantly in all treatments, while their Zn content increased. The later may be the consequence of some factors not investigated in the present study, among others root growth to deeper soil layer, pH decline in the rhizosphere. Significantly lower N, P and Cu contents only occurred in control plants on the second sampling date. The content of mentioned elements was invariably high in plants grown on N fertilized plots, which indicated the stimulating effect of N treatment on nutrient uptake. The enhanced N content of N-treated plants increased the ratio of N to P and S contents at both sampling dates, while the N per Ca ratio only increased in the samples collected</p><p id="Pg536">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1930 in November. Comparing the two sampling dates, it was found that the element ratios generally increased, as in the case of N to K, Ca, S and Mg, while the ratio of N to P or N to Zn decreased in all treatments. As characteristic for the calcareous soil, the K per Ca ratio was low (control: 1.25, N treatments: 1.43). This is conforming with the findings of Kádár et al. (2002) for canola of later development stage. Conclusion Higher nitrogen supply did not result in significantly greater biomass due to the dry emergence period, but changed the content of numerous elements. It was found that elevated N supply stimulated not only the uptake of N, but that of other nutrient elements, such as P, K, Mg and Cu too. Remarkable differences occurred with plant age as well, e.g. decrease in K, S, Ca and Mg contents, or increase in Zn content of canola shoots. The gained results underline the decisive role of N fertilization in the adequate nutrient supply of young canola.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1931 EFFECTS OF ECOLOGICAL SOIL APTITUDE ON GRASS STAND PLANNING Marietta HARCSA - Márta BAJNOK – Balázs KULIN – László SZEMÁN – János PRUTKAY Department of Grassland Management, Szent Istvan University Gödöllő, H-2103 Gödöllő, Páter K. u. 1. E-mail: hmarietta@citromail.hu Abstract: The aim of the research was to analyze a grassland stand based on its ecological demands. In this case we studied the botanical stand cover of ten-year-old extensively managed grassland, which was established using high species-diversity mixtures. Our testing field was located in the Botanist Garden of the Szent István University, in Gödöllő. We arranged three kinds of mixtures in three replications. Following its establishment, no nutrient supplies or irrigation was applied to the field. We used cover assessment for the survey. By the end of the research, nine residual species remained from the established twenty six in the grassland. The residual plants were: Festuca ovina L., Agrostis capillaries L., Lotus corniculatus L., Achillea millefolium L., Dianthus carthusianorum L., Plantago lanceolata L., Salvia pratensis L., Sanguisorba minor Scop., Thymus pulagioides L.. We concluded that all residual species had equal temperature-, water balance- and soil- demands. Keywords: extensive grassland management, ecological soil aptitude, TWR- values Introduction The botanical stand of a grassland can be established by the ecological aptitude of the habitat, by grassland management practices (Prokisch et al., 2007; Tasi, 2007), can be formed by natural plant associations, such as a natural grassland (Szemán, 2007), and from schemed plant association in compliance with the aim of grassland development (Magyar, et al., 2004) such as a seeded meadow (Jolánkai, et al., 2006; Ligetvári, et al., 2006). The most important role in the evolution of Hungarian grasslands is played by the characteristics of base rock and soil aptitudes. The majority of agriculturally used grasslands are on unfavourable areas with bad soil conditions and slight aquosity. Therefore, seventy percent of Hungarian grasslands have low yields (Szentes et al. 2007). The botanical composition of grasslands on equal ecological habitats may differ, depending on the established sowing-seed density (Herczeg et al. 2006). Different soil characteristics can also cause differences in the botanical composition (Szombati et al. 2007). The ecological features of grasslands are best recognized from the indication of their constituting plant species (Simon 2004). In this case temperature (T)-, water balance (W) and reaction of soil (R) values were used for this. Materials and methods Our test field is in the Botanist Garden of Szent István University, in Gödöllő. The climate in Gödöllő is transitional between that of the Hungarian Great Plain’s and the North Hungarian Mountains’. The amount of precipitation is 564 mm. The average temperature per a year is 9, 4 centigrade. The relative humidity is 75 per cent. The duration of sunshine is 1960 hours per year in average. The soil of the research area is sandy brown earth. The laboratory analysis of the soil core showed that the soil is characterized by pH 5-6 values, has low humus content and there is no calciumcarbonate in it (Table 1). The experiment was started in May 1998. in the Botanist Garden of Szent István University, and was controlled by the Department for Grassland</p><p id="Pg538">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1932 Management. Before establishing the grassland, organic manure was applied to the field in the autumn ploughing. No nutrient supplies or irrigation were applied following the establishment. Three kinds of mixtures were arranged in three replications (Table 2). The size of patches was 6x5 meter, with a 0.5 meter disjunctive area. We used cover assessment for the survey. The assessments were carried out monthly in the year of establishment, twice a year in the following year, and once a year afterwards. The aim of our research was to analyze the effects of soil ecological aptitudes on the botanical stand of an established meadow. Therefore we established naturally growing wild dicotyledonous plants, and grass varieties, which may be cultivated in intensive management. The only cultivation practice we used was mowing once a year. Therefore the aptitudes of soil and habitat were able to pre-dominate the development of the plant society. Table 1.

In the latest 4-5 years, wildflowers were showing the biggest changes, as their covered area increased largely. By the end of the research nine species remained out of the twenty-six originally established ones. The residual species were: Festuca ovina L., Agrostis capillaries L., Lotus corniculatus L., Achillea millefolium L., Dianthus carthusianorum L., Plantago lanceolata L., Salvia pratensis L., Sanguisorba minor Scop., Thymus pulagioides L. The question was what kind of ecological demands these plants had, because it was the climate- and soil aptitudes that must have influenced the development of this plant association.</p><p id="Pg539">VII.

(Simon 1992), we concluded that residual species preferred a leafy forest climate. Considering W-values, the water balance demands of plants ranged from moderately dry to damp. The R-values are shown correctly, when they are calculated by weighting it with botanical cover rates. The residual plant stand indicates an acid pH. As a summary, it can be concluded that residual species had equal temperature-, water balance- and soil demands. Wildflowers are less sensitive to soil pH. Based on W– values, we can anticipate that the grassland consisted of more species if it was irrigated. It is advised to compare the ecological demands (TWR-values) of the planned plant species with the ecological aptitude of the habitat, already when creating the seed mixture, to be able to perform all agricultural practices in line with their needs.</p><p id="Pg540">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1935 THE EFFECT OF SOIL NUTRIENTS AND ANIMAL EXCRETA ON GRASSLAND BIODIVERSITY IMPROVEMENT László SZEMÁN 1 – Márta BAJNOK – Marietta HARCSA – János PRUTKAY – Gábor ZSIGÓ 1 Department of Grassland Mangement, Institute for Crop Production, Faculty of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, St. István University, SzIE. Gödöllő, Páter K. u 1. H-2103 Hungary, szeman.laszlo@mkk.szie.hu Abstract: The topsoil is one of the most important components in grassland and sustains the sward physically, chemically and biologically. Farmers often refer to the soil-sward-animal complex or interrelations to underline the fact that the proper functionings of all three are inextricably linked. Grazing has a favourable effect on animals – however, grazing also has a major effect on the plant stock of pastured grasslands. Sheep do not feed plants from urine patches, which may result in a change in the diversity of plants on the pasture. One of the aims of our research was to examine the effect of animal excreta coverage on grassland biodiversity improvement. The research took place on nature conservation grassland areas, pasturing ewes. We analyzed the effect of urine induced lush patches on sustaining the diversity of plant species. Results showed that lush patches were grazed unevenly. The outer circle, app. 15% of the patches has been grazed, a further 15-20% has been somewhat grazed, while the middle of the patch, 60-70% remained ungrazed. In the first growth, grass species in the middle of the lush patch seed heads (40-150 patch -1 ) while on the outer edge of the patch, rhizomatous plants advanced.. The diversity of species on grasslands can be sustained by grazing. Nongrazed area and generative tiller number indicate that grazed nature conservation pastures are able to renew themselves through a generative way, as an indirect effect of grazing. Keywords: grassland, biodiversity improvement, soil, animal excreta, sheep, urine patch Introduction The analysis of grazing is important to maintain the plant diversity of pastures on nature conservation areas. (Malatinszki et.al., 2004, Penksza et.al.,2005, Centeri et.al. 2007, Szabó et.al.,2007,Tasi 2005, 2007,) Between 75 and 90 per cent of the N in the herbage consumed by cattle and sheep is excreted, the proportion depending upon the type and class of animal. (Herczeg et.al.,206, Várallyay 2006a,2006b, Ligetvári et.al.2006) According to Frame (1992), dump excretion is about 1-1.5 kg/sheep, as a total of 0.1-0.2 kg of dump defecated 6-8 times/day. This amount, when added up for the whole grazing period, is app. 300-700 kg (app. 200 - 400 kg dry matter). The expected dump coverage of the pasture is about 0.05-0.07 m2/animal. The amount of urine is 1-2 litre/sheep/day as a total of 15-20 excretions. A sheep’s urination covers an area of 0.03-0.05m2 (Haynes and Williams 1993). According to Bristow et.al (2006) in the sheep urine, total N ranged from 3.0 to 13.7 g litre-1 of which an average of 83% was present as urea. Herbage species vary in their tolerance to or recovery from urine scorch or dung smother.(Nagy,J,2006) Clovers are more susceptible to urine scorch than grasses. Herbage growth rates in and around the patch are stimulated. Herbage response to urine has been attributed to its N concentration and can last for 2 to 3 months (Ledgard et. al., 1982., Magyar et.al., 2005, Németh 2006, Jolánkai et.al.2006).</p><p id="Pg542">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1936 Materials and methods Our grazing experiment was conducted with ewes on alkaline soil nature conservation grassland in 2005/2006, using a pastoral grazing method. The aim of the experiment was to analyse the effects of ewe’s dump on the change of the diversity of plant species on the pasture after a spring grazing period. We also examined the effects of urine patches on yield growth, and the feeding behaviour of ewes, by analysing the yields of grazed and partially grazed parts of urine patches. We monitored the number of generative tillers on the non-grazed parts, in order to sustain biodiversity and nature conservation effect. We monitored the change of the ratio of plant species, and examined the effect of grazing on the change of botanical cover of different species. (Szemán, 2007, Szemán et.al 2007., Opitz von Boberfeld et.al., 2006) Grazing was started in early spring to ensure that sheep graze a large area due to the small amount of grass available. Urine scorch patches were marked. The effect of dump on the decay and regeneration of plants, on the grazing of the next growth, and on the generative phase of grasses were monitored. While grazing the primary growth, sheep consumed only parts of the urine induced lush patches. Plants not grazed could reach generative phase, which supports grassland biodiversity. We also measured the area of urine induced lush patches and the weight of grazed and un-grazed herbage. The grasses turned dark green on dumped patches therefore they were easy to separate. Based on the grazing effect, patches were divided into three parts: the grazed outer border, where both the shoots and the stems of the grass were grazed; the mildly grazed area, where only the top of the shoots were grazed, resulting in the prevention of flowering; and the un-grazed inner circle, where grasses and other species generated reproductive structures and seed. Generative shoots of the ungrazed plants were collected and counted by species. Each time an analysis of the botanical composition was conducted. Plant coverage and the change of size of uncovered area was also determined. Results and discussion In grazed pasture systems, grazing animals deposit urine and dung causing high nutrient loading to relatively small proportion of the total grazed area. Grazing was started in early spring. Urine scorch patches were marked. The height of grass enabled the sheep to graze on a certain area only for one day; grazing was repeated on the same area 30 days later. Grazed grasses started flowering. Sheep fully grazed grasses on areas not dumped, while urine patches were only partially grazed. We analyzed the effect of urine induced lush patches on the diversity of plant species. Results showed that lush patches were unevenly grazed. The outer circle, app. 15% of the patches has been grazed, a further 15-20% has been somewhat grazed, while the middle of the patch, 60-70% remained ungrazed. Based on the darker green colour of grass, we measured the size of patches and the weight of the ungrazed herbage after grazing. Urine induced lush patches were divided into four groups based of their size. We assumed that the smaller the patch, the greater the ungrazed yield is. We found that this assumption was true only for the biggest areas,</p><p id="Pg543">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1937 while there was no significant difference between the remaining yields. That can be explained by the heterogenity of grass species’ coverage. The grazing of leguminous plants showed that sheep left more plants on smaller size patches. Plants grazed on the borders of the patches could have grown outside the urine covered area, with only their roots reaching into richer soil, therefore the lack of odour enabled their intense grazing similar to not dumped areas. The generative tiller number was determined at grasses flowering on the lush patches. Only the species Alopecurus pratensis, Festuca pseudovína and Poa pratensis have grown flowering stems. Flowering Festuca pseudovina was found only in some of the lush patches. We assumed that generative stems were eaten by the early grazing, which may have resulted in a lack of flowering. Table 1.

Conclusions Grazing has an effect on the diversity of plants - not only through the pasturing itself, but also through the dumping of sheep. Sheep do not eat plants from urine patches, which may affect the diversity of plants on the pasture. Sheep fully grazed grasses on areas not dumped, while urine patches were only partially grazed. The outer circle, app. 15% of the patches has been grazed, a further 15-20% has been somewhat grazed, while the middle of the patch, 60-70% remained ungrazed. We assumed that the smaller the patch, the greater the ungrazed yield is. We found that this assumption was true only for the biggest areas, while there was no significant difference between the remaining yields. That can be explained by the heterogenity of grass species’ coverage. The grazing of leguminous plants showed that sheep left more plants on smaller size patches. Plants not grazed could reach generative phase, which supports grassland biodiversity. There is no explainable difference between the number of shoots and the size of lush patches. Alopecurus pratensis had the least (32) shoots on the biggest area, outnumbered by the number of shoots (82) on a smaller area. In the first growth, grass species in the middle of the lush patch seed heads (40-150 patch-1 ) while on the outer edge of the patch, rhizomatous plants advanced.</p><p id="Pg544">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1939 AFTER-USE OF DISUSED QUARRIES IN THE FIELD OF AGRICULTURE AND WATER MANAGEMENT Lóránt DÁVID1 1Department of Tourism and Regional Development, Faculty of Economics, Károly Róbert College, 3200 Gyöngyös, Mátrai út 36, e-mail: davidlo@karolyrobert.hu Abstract: The aim of my paper is, to present the problems produced by terrain forming (anthropogenic geomorphologic) effects of quarrying. A further aim is to present the restoration/reclamation theory and practical work for the deserted/disused quarries, give an account of opportunities for after-use, and definition of project proposals. There are many cases when an area can be used in several ways at the same time or considering the purposes its use can be successful by subsequent methods. Keywords: quarry, agriculture, water management Introduction Obviously, the questions arising in connection with the opening of a new quarry can involve a series of problems, however to examine how deserted quarries play a part in environmental management is such an exiting task as well. There are many cases when an area can be used in several ways at the same time or considering the purposes its use can be successful by subsequent methods. Materials and methods The agriculture (except for grazing) can’t be connected with other kind of use. On the basis of the international experiences the possibilities of after-use of deserted quarry can be classified as follows. Agriculture Certain types of agricultural use can occur on areas of former quarry, which are extensive or situated directly on the border of a cultivated area, supposing that the soil and relief conditions are sufficient. In the case of a fairly short time extraction, where the arable soil was stored and replaced to the place of extraction (which can be filled and unfilled as well) it is possible to return to the cultivation almost every time. In other cases when it was not possible to protect the upper layer of the soil the agricultural activity becomes hard. There is an exception when it is possible to obtain the upper layer of the soil in the course of further progressive cultivation, possibly from another quarry or there is an alternative plant that can live under these conditions. From the cultivation to the milking cow or beef cattle and sheep farming, series of possibilities present themselves. Apart from the features of the area, the only condition is to connect with the local customs in management in a kind of way. For example the grazing animal husbandry took possession of several deserted quarries in Great Britain. The possible way of after-use of the place of extraction submerged under water is the fish management. For the fish breeding, water well supplied with oxygen, which is chemically and biologically clear as well, is required. A use of this kind will rise sooner or later, practically, in the case of every deserted quarry, where water can be found.</p><p id="Pg546">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1940 Sylviculture On areas, where soils of poor quality can be found, the afforestation of extractional purpose can be an alternative of the tilling of arable land. This provides valuable resource, and utilizes an area which otherwise would have little value. Even in the case, when the quality of cut of timber is not pretty good, with forming of a forest the area can be suitable for resting and relaxing and recreational-oriented use. We can find several examples, when an area is simply planted by vegetation after the landscaping. For example, the same happened to the rehabilitation of Nesher Quarry in Israel, in 1970-71, which was interpreted as an experimental program for selecting of the proper vegetation (Naveh, Z. – Valero, R. – Shadmi A. 1983.). The afforestation of deserted quarries is really popular in Canada where modern practice in sylviculture is widely used (Bauer, A. M. 1970.). Nature protection and teaching of wildlife communities The stocking of several deserted quarries (especially chalk and limestone quarries) by different species, lead to the developing of various communities of plant, animals and insects which are rich in species. The appearance of uniquely rare or local species can increase the value of old quarries. This process rather occurs accidentally than planned and it takes place without human-agency after abandoning of the quarry. However the designed introduction of these unclaimed areas for protection of animal living in the state of nature is another chance (Davis, B. N. K. 1979. This kind of areas can be used in education, we can examine the natural ecosystems that include the relationships between the flora, fauna and geology (Usher, M. B. 1979.). The biologically most valuable areas usually developed in quarries surrounded by areas also valuable in this kind of view. For example, natural parks marked out the margin of Trowbarrow Quarry and Warton Crag Quarry on the border of Lancashire and Cumbria, North-west England (Dávid L. – Patric, C. 1999., Dávid L. 2000.). In Hungary, besides Celldömölk, the volcanic crater of Ság hill explored by quarrying provides an excellent example. Water storage and water management The deep quarries, in which water can be found, are suitable for water storage, canalization or directly water extraction. The increasing difficulties of forming of water basins including the costs of earthwork made the authorities of water conservancy focus, more and more, to the greater or smaller lakes of this kind. The shallow queries are less useable only for water storage but they can be combined with other utilize for the purpose of recreation that is why the use of multi purpose is a feasible arrangement in this kind of situation. We can find examples in the centre-west part of the United States, Illinois, where former queries were submerged under water and developed into attractive hunting-ground and fishing-place (Rosenbery, J. L. – Klimstra, W. D. 1965., Nir, D. 1983.). Filling and dumping of waste Cities and industrial centres produce a huge amount of rubbish and waste. The close places for dumping of waste are really valuable but only a few of them are available. The fact if quarry are appropriate for filling and dumping of waste depends on the geological conditions, of course, the fact that there are enough waste. The filled areas</p><p id="Pg547">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1941 can be used for other purposes as well, but the work plans of filling have to take this fact into consideration outlining the final state so that it can be equivalent with the expectations of after-use. Related to the filling and the dumping of waste, to face opposition of inhabitance during the work of filling is a problem arising frequently, as gases and bad smell can be produced inside of the dumping material. (Bennett, M. R. – Doyle, P. 1999.) Results and discussions In this paper I presented the possibilities for after-use of deserted quarries, on the basis of international and Hungarian experience and examples. These can be divided into the following categories: ­ Agriculture, ­ Forestry, ­ Nature protection and teaching of wildlife communities, ­ Water storage and management, ­ Landfill and waste disposal, ­ After using of quarry waste. I discussed in detail the restoration and land reclamation questions on deserted quarries, I demonstrated the present forms of after use, and the evolving nature and environment protection problems. The most frequent source of danger is the illegal disposal of waste. Among the positive examples I would pick out the utilisation for storage purposes and the experiments made to develop tourist sites for recreational purposes. Conclusions Within the system of natural environment, the transformation of any elements, such as relief has an impact on the operation of the whole system, and can trigger several, mostly unfavourable transformations. Although, the extent of the impacts on environment, and within this on relief, related to recreation activities, compared to that of other sectors (e.g. industry, agriculture) is rather small. However because of the continuously growing popularity of these sectors, more attention should be paid to the planning taking the complicated relations of environment and activities into account, due to the discovering new destinations. In case, those looking for leisure and still intend to enjoy the natural environment, they will also have to become environmentally sound users. The impact of recreation activities on relief can come into force in many ways. Whether we talk about a study carried out at a given area or a comprehensive one also using previous results, the demand for a multidisciplinary approach resultant from the characteristics of this topic represents a great challenge to the experts. Quarrying activities entail significant visual impacts and degradation problems as a result of soil depletion and deep alteration to the original morphology and topography. These areas are at high risk of erosion due to removal of vegetation and the lack of available soil on steep slopes. In addition, the common method of quarry exploitation in platforms increases drainage and the physical and chemical erosion of the substrate, hindering natural germination and establishment of young plants, and thus delaying recolonisation. In the past, quarries were simply abandoned after extraction. However, natural colonisation of disused limestone quarries is slow (Correia, O. - Clemente, A.S.</p><p id="Pg548">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1942 - Correia, A.I. - Máguas, C. - Carolino, M. – Afonso, A.C. - Martins-Loução, M.A. 2006). A system of this kind provides better flexibility and adaptability for the case when circumstances change but an after-use specialized considerably can satisfy a unique function much more efficiently. At the same time various uses have to be planned when neither of them would be realizable alone. The ways of use below can be combined with each other successfully, for example the agriculture, the sylviculture, the water storage and management or the nature protection. The agriculture (except for grazing) can’t be connected with other kind of use. On the basis of the international experiences the possibilities of after-use of deserted quarry can be classified as above. References Bauer, A.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1943 ASSESSMENT OF PHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS USEFUL IN SCREENING FOR TOLERANCE TO SOIL DROUGHT IN WINTER WHEAT (TRITICUM AESTIVUM L.) GENOTYPES Marek ZIVCAK – Marian BRESTIC – Katarina OLSOVSKA Department of Plant Physiology, Faculty of Agrobiology and Food Resources, Slovak University of Agriculture, Tr. A. Hlinku 2, 949 76, Nitra, Slovakia, e-mail: marek.zivcak@uniag.sk Abstract: Application of physiological methods in selection process may help considerably to improve wheat breeding efficiency. In vegetation pot experiments with a collection of winter bread wheat genotypes of different provenance the drought tolerance screening methods were applied. Evaluation of drought effect in selected genotypes by chlorophyll fluorescence was based on the performance index (PI), the most sensitive fluorescence parameter characterizing better the drought susceptibility of plants. The genotypes differed in sensitivity of stomatal closure, and hence in the CO2 assimilation rate. In drought conditions the delayed stomatal closure caused mainly by higher osmotic adjustment led to higher net assimilation rate and higher production of assimilates. Similarly, transpiration efficiency of non-stressed plants was also related to their better drought tolerance. We identified several parameters well-correlated with relative grain yield decrease in drought stress conditions. Results were statistically significant for phenology and stomatal conductance of non-stressed plants, but we identified as promising also measurements of transpiration efficiency, osmotic adjustment and fast fluorescence kinetics using performance index as the most sensitive parameter. Keywords: winter wheat, soil drought, photosynthesis, osmotic adjustment, transpiration efficiency Introduction Tolerance to abiotic stresses is of high importance for sustainable wheat production (Balla et al. 2006; Czövek et al. 2006). However, plant breeding for abiotic stress tolerance, especially drought, is still a very complicated and time-consuming. Identification of limiting factors is needful for using the traits as indirect selection criteria (Araus et al 2002). There are at least three groups of such criteria: The first group involves physiological parameters monitoring main physiological processes participating in yield formation. In the second group there are parameters describing mechanisms of stress tolerance. The third group is represented by methods detecting decrease of plant vitality or damage caused by stress. In our experiments with 7 winter wheat genotypes we assessed several physiological criteria of all three groups. Gas exchange measurements of photosynthesis are directly related to the plant production. Parameters related to osmotic adjustment represent important mechanism of plant tolerance to water deficit (Blum et al. 1999). Finally, the parameters of chlorophyll fluorescence are considered to be good indicators of stress induced impairment of plant (Strasser et al. 2000). The objective of our work was to compare drought tolerance of observed genotypes expressed at the level of grain yield with the tolerance estimated on the basis of measured parameters. Materials and methods Plants of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), genotypes Viginta (abbr. VIG), Ilona (ILO), Arida (ARI), Eva (EVA) originating from Slovakia; Pobeda (POB) from Serbia; Stephens (STE) from USA and Amerigo (AME) from France, were cultivated in the pot experiments in three years. After anthesis some plants were exposed to slowly developing water stress induced by restricted irrigation.</p><p id="Pg550">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1944 Gas exchange measurements were performed using portable open gasometric system Ciras-2 (PP Systems, UK) in wheat flag leaves on the main stem of randomly selected plants were measured using a portable IRGA (CIRAS-II, PP Systems, UK), using an artificial light source (PP Systems, PPFD 800 μmol m-2 s-1. We assessed the main parameters, Pn – net assimilation rate and E – transpiration from leaf. From values of Pn and E we calculated leaf transpiration efficiency (TEL) as TEL = Pn / E. Stomatal conductance was measured by a porometer Delta T AP4 (Delta-T Dev., UK). Water status in leaves was calculated as relative water content (RWC), using formula RWC (%) = (W – WD) / (WFT – WD) * 100, where W is fresh weight of leaf segment, WFT – weight of leaf segment after saturation by water, WD – dry mass of leaf segment. Osmotic potential (Ψs) was measured by psychrometric method using microvoltmeter Wescor HR-33 with measuring chamber C-52 (Wescor, USA) after freezing in liquid nitrogen and subsequent thawing. Osmotic adjustment (OA) was calculated using values of RWC and osmotic potential. Free proline content in leaves was determined using spectrophotometric method (Bates et al. 1973) at wavelength of 520 nm. Absorbance measured using spectrophotometer Spekol. The chlorophyll a fluorescence emitted by leaves after excitation with red light was measured in the dark adapted plants (30 min.) using a fluorometer Handy PEA (Hansatech, UK). Collected data were analyzed by the JIP-test (Strasser et al. 2000). The spikes from non-stressed and stressed variants were collected in the phase of full ripening, the grain yield per plant was established for each genotypes. For comparison of effect of drought stress for selected parameters we used the relative values of the drought susceptibility index (SIX) calculated according to Fischer and Maurer (1978) for each genotype as: SIX = (1-Yds/Yno) / (1-Xds/Xno), where Yds is the value of parameter under drought, Yno is the value of parameter under near optimum conditions, Xds is Xno is the average value of parameter of all genotypes under drought and the average value of parameter of all genotypes under near optimum conditions. The relations between parameters and relative grain yield decrease were assessed by correlation analysis with analysis of variance (SigmaPlot 9.0 software). Results and discussion Soil water deficit induced by withholding of irrigation caused significant decrease of grain yield in stressed plants compared to well-watered plants (10 to 50 %). Despite of same conditions we observed differences in relative decrease of grain yield as shown by values of susceptibility index (table 1). The most tolerant in three-year trial was genotype Ilona, in contrary, genotype Eva showed the highest yield decrease. As some parameters can not be expressed by single measurement, we calculated susceptibility indices by integration of data collecting during drought stress and we used it for genotype comparison. Performance index as the most sensitive parameter of fast fluorescence kinetics measurements (Strasser et al. 2000) enabled easy detection of impairment of photosynthetic apparatus and differences among genotypes in its sensitivity during drought stress. Stomatal closure was one of the most rapid reactions induced by water deficit. Wheat genotypes differed in measured stomatal conductance (table 1); however, the differences were distinct mainly during moderate drought stress. A similar trend was observed from the measurements of CO2 assimilation. We recorded that the trend of susceptibility index values was similar to that observed for</p><p id="Pg551">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1945 grain yield with Ilona as the most tolerant genotype. The delay in stomatal closure supports continuing growth and CO2 assimilation in case if it is accompanied with cell osmotic adjustment and turgor maintenance (Blum et al. 1999). Table 1.

Lower non-stressed values of stomatal conductance (table 2) of observed varieties were a suitable character correlated with lover relative yield decrease during drought stress. This trait was associated with leaf transpiration efficiency (TEL), what was confirmed by gasometry measurements.

Prenatal exposition to FB1 caused marked and significant alterations and anomalies in in vitro brain slice bioelectric activity. This is the first study to use in vitro rat cortex slices as biosensors monitoring LTP changes in offspring after FB1 exposition of pregnant rats, and providing evidence for brain functional bioelectric anomalies of neurodevelopmental origin caused by mycotoxin FB1. Keywords: fumonisin B1, developmental risks, rat cortex slice, LTP, developmental toxicity, in vitro biotests Introduction Processes of fungal diseases are highly affected by soil-plant interrelations (Várallyay, 2006). The endemic outbreaks of fusarioses account for animal and human health problems. Laws deal mainly with health hazard created by chemical residues of pesticides or food additives. Biohazards naturally associated with food are not considered. Any food on which molds have grown can potentially contain mycotoxins sometimes without any visible evidence of mold. Group of fumonisins as natural mycotoxins produced primarily by Fusarium verticillioides mainly contaminate cornbased food and feed. Fumonisin B1 (FB1) is an important mycotoxin contaminant in terms of human exposure (ApSimon and Miller, 1996). Leucoencephalomalacia, a nervous system disorder in equids led to identification of FB1 (Gelderblom et al., 1988), and the neurotoxicity was evident. FB1 exposition of rats may cause adverse effects in bioelectric parameters of the nervous system (Banczerowski-Pelyhe et al., 2002a, b). The neurodevelopmental risks of the toxin accumulating in humans and animals during the long term consumption of the FB1 containing food even in small doses have not been fully evaluated. As far as no data is obtained concerning the functional plasticity anomalies of brain bioelectric parameters in the offspring of FB1 exposed pregnant rats, in the present study alterations in induction, expression and properties of long term potentiation (LTP) as an elementary learning model were analyzed in somatosensory cortex slices of animals that received prenatal FB1 exposure. Materials and methods Pregnant rats were gavaged of 6.2 mg/kg body weight/day FB1 by from the 8 th gestation day to the parturition (Figure 1.). 400 μm thick transverse slices were prepared from the somatosensory cortex of the offspring 4 weeks after birth. Standard brain slice method was used for electrophysiological recording in vitro. Slices were placed into an interface type recording chamber perfused continuously (1,5 ml/min) with a standard artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Electrophysiological data were obtained from 9 somatosensory cortex slices of 5 offpring of 2 FB1 treated dams at the age of 4 weeks.</p><p id="Pg554">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1948 Electrophysiological measurements were performed at 33±0.5 ºC. Extracellular glass recording electrodes (5-10M) filled with 1M NaCl were positioned into layer III of the neocortex. Glass-insulated, bipolar tungsten electrodes were used for stimulation, and were positioned below the recording electrode at the border of the white-gray matter. Square impulses of 100 μs duration were applied. The stimulus intensity varied between threshold and supramaximal values. Signals were amplified by an Axoclamp 2B amplifier (Axon Instruments Inc., Union City, CA), and were displayed on a digital oscilloscope (Gould DSO 420, Gould Electronics, Cleveland, Ohio). Data were also stored on a VHS tape recorder for further analysis. Recorded signals were digitized with an A/D converter (VR-10, Instrutech Corp., Great Neck, New York) and analyzed by using a personal computer. Applying single shock stimulation evoked field responses were recorded. The stimulus threshold (T) was determined, and a stimulus strengthevoked response curve (input-output, I-O curve) was recorded by gradually increasing stimulus intensity (from 1T to 4T in six steps ), until the maximal stimulus strength was reached. The mean value was calculated from three evoked responses at each stimulus intensity. Long-term potentiation (LTP) was induced when responses to low frequency stimulation had stabilized. LTP was induced by high frequency stimulation at 2T stimulus intensity (100 Hz, 4x 5 s, with 15 s intervals). Evoked responses were tested with single stimuli of 2T intensity before and 30 min after tetanic stimulation, and I-O curves were determined. Recorded signals were analyzed by a built-in program of the digital oscilloscope (Gould DSO 420, Gould Electronics, Cleveland, Ohio). Averaged latency and peak-to-peak amplitude of each component of the evoked response was determined. ANOVA (p &lt; 0.05) was used for statistical analysis. Figure 1.

Results and discussion After prenatal FB1 exposition functional changes of evoked neocortical field potentials were detected in in vitro cortex slices of the offpring.

Cpretet, CPosttet). The value of the amplitude of evoked field potentials in cortex slices of the offspring of FB1 treated dams was significantly higher before LTP induction than in the control at the same experimental paradigm (Table 1.). The mean value of the evoked field potentials at 2T stimulation was 0.85 mV (Figure 2. Fpretet). Figure 2.

Changes of amplitude of evoked field potentials are shown in millivolts. It was also possible to induce LTP in cortex slices of the offpring of FB1 treated pregnant rats. In these slices the increase of field potential amplitude after LTP induction was markedly and significantly greater in comparison to the control. Tetanic stimulation increased the evoked response from 0.85 mV to 1.59 mV (Figure 2. Posttet). In cortex slices of the offspring of FB1 treated pregnant rats the increase of the amplitude of evoked field potentials after LTP induction was strongly enhanced. It was as high as 89% compared to the control, where that increase was considerably smaller, 20%. Table 1.

The offspring might be prenatally directly or indirectly (via toxicity of the FB1 treated dams) exposed to hamful effects of FB1 that blocks the biosynthesis of sphingolipids, compounds that are essential to membrane and lipoprotein structure and that also play a role, via cell signaling, in regulating cell growth, apoptosis, and other functions. Oxidative stress and apoptosis may be involved in the neurotoxicity induced by FB1 (Stockmann-Juvala et al. 2004, 2006). The altered plasticity, described in the in vitro model, may be due to the disturbances in cortical processing and alterations in learning and memory in offspring of FB1 treated pregnant rats. Conclusions Our study provides evidence that prenatal FB1 exposure during cortical development may cause an impaired synaptic plasticity that may underlie modification of learning and memory processes. In in vitro experiments FB1 caused an increased basic neuronal excitability. Results suggest that FB1 do have some functional effects on the nervous system of the offspring of pregnant rats exposed to FB1. Our study is the first one to use in vitro rat cortex slices as biosensors monitoring changes of LTP in offspring after FB1 exposition of dams, and thus providing evidence for functional anomalies of neurodevelopmental origin. It has been proved that in vitro brain slice biopotential monitoring approach to developmental neurotoxicity is a useful and sensitive biotesting method that can reveal quantified changes of LTP and characterise the underlying mechanisms. The full significance of fumonisins as soil borne mycotoxins for humans and animal health still remains to be determined. References ApSimon, J.W. - Miller, J.D.: 1996. Editorial. Nat Toxins 4:1-2.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1951 INFLUENCE OF Pb AND Cu TOXICITY ON LETTUCE PHOTOSYNTETIC PIGMENTS AND DRY MATTER ACCUMULATION Boris ĐURĐEVIĆ - Miroslav LISJAK - Miro STOŠIĆ - Meri ENGLER - Brigita POPOVIĆ University of J. J. Strossmayer in Osijek, Faculty of Agriculture, Trg Svetog Trojstva 3, HR-31000 Osijek, Croatia; e-mail: bdurdevic@pfos.hr Abstract The uptake of copper and lead supplied in nutrient solution (500 μM) and their detrimental impact on photosynthetic pigments concentration and dry matter accumulation in three lettuce cultivars were investigated. The concentration of copper and lead in lettuce leaf ranged from 8.62 to 14.20 mg kg -1 leaf dry weight for copper, and from 1.97 to 4.05 mg kg -1 leaf dry weight for lead, after two days of exposure. In copper and lead treated plants significant differences in leaf and root dry weight accumulation were not established, but concentrations of chlorophyll b and carotenoids showed significant reduction in cultivar Triatlon. In other words, tolerant genotype (cultivar Nadine) accumulated less copper and lead in leaves, the edible parts of lettuce, therefore such genotypes could be recommended for planting on potentially polluted soils. Keywords: copper, dry matter content, lead, heavy metal stress, lettuce, photosynthetic pigments Introduction Vegetables are very important source of beneficial organic compounds and minerals in human diet. When they are planted on urban and suburban contaminated soils, they can be potentially dangerous carriers of heavy metals, like cooper and lead, in to the food chain. In the research of Hibben et al. (1984), lettuce planted in contaminated soils accumulated more lead than other vegetables. High heavy metals uptake causes oxidative stress in plants which is manifested through induction of peroxidases (POX or POD; EC 1.11.1.7, Singh et al., 1997). In the research of El-Tayeb (2006), oxidative stress can also cause decrease of photosynthetic pigments concentration (chl a, chl b, carotenoids) in wheat under drought conditions. Toxicity of heavy metals in plant organism can cause damage of photosynthetic pigments that according to Veres et al. (2007) induce remission of dry matter production, which is very important in agronomy. Kisić et al. (2007), reported that air and water pollution have been broadly addressed and included in teaching curriculum and science researches, while the heavy metal soil contamination has been highly neglected. Bálint et al. (2007) stated that it would be recommendable to avoid planting on heavy metal contaminated soils. The aim of the research presented here is to evaluate short term copper and lead toxicity in lettuce using photosynthetic pigments concentration as well as dry matter accumulation as stress parameters. Material and methods Seeds of three lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) cultivars were planted for three weeks in glasshouse conditions in commercial substrate, till the four to five leaf stages. After washing thoroughly with running deionised water they were fixed on perforated polystyrene fasteners of glass pots containing nutrient solution for leafy vegetables after Lee and Park (2001). The nutrient medium was renewed every 3 days and aerated for</p><p id="Pg558">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1952 one hour each day. The experiment was settled in four replicates and each replicate contained four plantlets. The pots were kept for three weeks in a growth chamber at 20oC, with 70% relative humidity and 12-h photoperiod. The fluorescent lamps were used to provide the photosynthetic photon flux density 120 μmol/m2/s at the leaf level. Subsequently, the plantlets were treated with 500 µM Cu(SO4) or Pb(NO3)2 (final concentration) in nutrient solution for 2 days. Thereafter, plantlets were divided in roots and leaves. The amount of tissue dry weight was determined by drying at 70oC for 24 h. Dry samples of leaves were subtracted to wet digestion using of 4% HClO4 acid in concentrated H2SO4, with addition of H2O2. Copper and lead concentration was measured by ICP-AAS. Leaf chloroplast pigments were extracted from the most developed leaf using 100% acetone. The absorbance of the extracts was measured spectrophotometrycally (Wettstein, 1957). The individual levels of chlorophyll a (Chl a), chlorophyll b (Chl b), total chlorophylls (Chl a+b) and total carotenoids (Car) were calculated. The results of plant analysis were statistically analysed using ANOVA with F-test and LSD test for the evaluation of significance of the applied treatments, as well as t-test in single regression analyses for the evaluation of the significance of established correlations among tested parameters (* P≤0.05; ** P≤0.01). Results and discussion The chlorophyll content of the leaves can influence on dry matter incorporation, which affects on yield factors (Széles, 2007). Higher chlorophyll contents may enhance photosynthesis and result in higher amount of dry matter (Veres et al., 2007). As stated by Vassilev et al. (2007) at low degree of metal contamination the visible symptoms, such as chlorosis, necrosis of leaf tips, etc. are less pronounced or even could be absent, although some reduction of plant quality as well as biomass inhibition persist. Here, copper treatment slightly reduced fresh weight and dry weight of the leaf in all three tested cultivars (Table 1) while plantlets treated with lead showed appreciable higher values concerning control plants. The influence of heavy metals on root dry weight was diverse, regarding cultivars. Significant decline in root dry weight was observed in cooper treated Marcord, whereas root dry weight was higher in copper-treated Nadine and lead-treated Triatlon (P≤0.05). The applied copper and lead concentration in nutrient solution, although the exposure lasted only two days, resulted with their mostly significant accumulation in the leaves of lettuce. Heavy metal content was in the range from 12.77 (Nadine) to 15.22 mg kg-1 DW leaf (Triatlon) for copper and from 1.97 (Nadine) to 4.58 mg kg-1 DW leaf (Triatlon) for lead (Table 1.). The results showed significant remission of chlorophyll a (data not shown) and b under treatment with 500 μM Pb in cultivar Triatlon. Treatment with copper had not been statistically justified for chlorophyll a, carotenoids and total chlorophylls, but chlorophyll b was notably reduced in all cultivars. Regarding the ratios of chl a/chl b as well as chl/car, the influence of the applied heavy metal stress was not significant, except in chl a/chl b in cultivar Triatlon, where it was lowered by copper treatment (P≤0.05).</p><p id="Pg559">VII.

Excessive lead supply also gave high correlation between chlorophyll and carotenoids content in lettuce leaves (r = 0.785**, y3), while in copper stressed plants the lowest significant correlation was obtained (r = 0.634*, y2), that started from lowest level of photosynthetic pigments concentration. Conclusions The accumulation of Cu and Pb in lettuce was accompanied with the reduction of photosynthetic pigments concentration in general. A short term treatment with high concentration of the applied heavy metals in nutrient solution resulted with non significant differences between cultivars in accumulation of dry weight, though some genotypes showed higher tolerance on particular heavy metal accumulation in leaves. The observed diversity of lettuce genotypes regarding their tolerance to heavy metal stress and accumulation in leaves, imply the possibility to grow particular genotypes in areas like urban gardens, roadsides and potentially polluted agricultural areas.

We investigated the total cover of vegetation, species richness, Shannon diversity and evenness, dominance structure, constancy of relative cover of species, relative ratio of monocots, dicots and the Borhidi social behaviour types. As a consequence of the effect of N treatments in 1999 the proportion of monocots is much higher, compared with that in the initial state. On the contrary, in the CO2-treated plots the relative cover of monocots decreased to the advantage of several dicots. The relative percentage cover of monocots is about 15% higher in 1999 than 1 year ago. The patterns of dominance sequence and relative cover changes of dicots and monocots seem to be also a very good indicator of structural changes caused by disturbances. Keywords: loess grassland, elevated CO2, N fertilization, botanical composition Introduction The aim of the research project was to assess the long-term impacts of elevated air CO2 concentration and different nitrogen status on continental temperate xeric semi-natural loess grasslands, representative of the European temperate xeric grassland vegetation. The current CO2 concentration (about 380 µmol mol -1) is a limit for photosynthesis process of the plants and plant communities (Haszpra et al., 2005). The plants will have to adapt to the current and coming changes within a never experienced, short period of time scale. While relatively much is known on responses of the plants and their stands (Tuba et al., 2005; Bencze et al., 2007), however we have little information on response of natural vegetation especially grasslands (Tuba et al., 2003; Fóti et al., 2005; Szerdahelyi and Nagy, 2007; Ürmös et al., 2007). Nitrogen status has been chosen as a secondary experimental factor since this nutrient is limiting the production of grasslands in most of the cases. Materials and methods The investigated grassland community is Salvio Festucetum rupicolae on loess grassland. In agricultural aspect it is one of the most valuable Pannon grassland communities, rich in species, well structured vertically, strongly closed. The mini FACE experimental system was set up at the “Global Climate Change and Plants” Experimental Ecological Station is located at the Botanical Garden of SZIU, Institute of Botany and Ecophysiology, where other CO2 experiment are running (e.g. Tuba et al., 1998a) The mini FACE exposure system consists of twelve 1.6x1.6m square plots. Air supply rings (diameter of 1.5m) have been put into the squares providing six control rings and six rings with elevated air CO2 concentration. The sample area is a 0.8x0.8m square plot in the middle of each ring consisting of four 0.4x0.4m monolith replicates. Treatments: Two treatments with two levels each, 3 replicates, 4 monoliths/in situ core batches per replicate is included in the experimental setup (treatment/levels) as follows: CO2 Treatment: ambient and elevated (setpoint 600 μmol.mol -1) air CO2 concentration.</p><p id="Pg562">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Presence-absence and percentage cover of each species, visually estimated, were recorded in a set of contagious subquadrats (48 in total per treatment). Recordings were made after a recovering period at the end of October of 1998, and twice a year later, in June and in September in 1999. Coenological responses to CO2 and N treatments were assessed by a) total cover of vegetation, b) species richness (S), Shannon diversity (H) and evenness (E), diversity phase curves, c) dominance structure, constancy of relative cover of species, d) relative ratio of monocots, dicots and e) Borhidi social behaviour types. Results and discussion These results suggest that floristic compositional changes of the quadrats were mainly influenced by the differences between years. Seasonal dynamic in a year of the control plots was rather strong, such as in the intact natural loess vegetation. Structural changes in the differently treated quadrats (vegetation cover %, S, H and E): The values of community attributes, their average and standard deviation in the quadrats and the CV% are given in Table 1. The data are referred to 0.16 sq.m plots of the treatments. The experimental CO2 and N treatments did not cause significant differences in the average H and E values at none of the sample points of time, but there were significant increases in their average values from 1998 to 1999. We studied the changes of structural attributes induced by treatments at 2 plot sizes. It was not surprising that the average of all attributes, except the average E, was always lower at the smaller quadrats than the larger ones. The E values increased as the sampled area decreased. The changes of CV% at small versus larger sizes of quadrats depended on the changes in spatial micro-heterogeneity and species abundance hierarchy in a plot caused by the treatments. Our results also indicated that the trends of changes with time and the differences between the treatments were slightly influenced by the plot size regardless the type of attributes studied.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1957 Diversity phase curves: The trend of changes and the differences in diversity phase curves (the 2 diversity components: E, S) between treatments and their deviation from the control were very similar at the larger (80x80 cm) and smaller (40x40 cm) quadrats, only the region outlined by E and S were different. Dominance structure): It can be stated that in the quadrats a large number of species coexisted (total species number/year is 52, 66 and 72), but very few species (5-7 species with relative cover &gt; 5%) made up most of the vegetation cover and many rare and poorly represented species could be found. The plots were dominated by perennial longlived species. The most abundant species were Festuca rupicola, Dactylis glomerata, Achillea collina, Filipendula vulgaris and Salvia nemorosa. It was concluded that the annual variation in the relative importance of the species was very high in each treatment. In the control plots and in the CO2-treated ones only Festuca rupicola and Dactylis glomerata had maintained their predominance being ranked first in every year. Although the position of the first 5-7 species (the most abundant ones) in the dominance relations was very similar in the 2 subsequent each year, but strong fluctuation or relatively great temporal changes in the relative cover changes of many codominant species could be detected. In the plots treated by N and N+CO2 several monocots became more abundant than they were at the beginning of the field experiments. Many dicots became rare and some species newly appeared in the vegetation. Fluctuation in the number of species with relative cover &gt; 1% was the most considerable in the quadrats exposed to the combined effects of N and CO2. 1998 autumn 0.00 10.00 20.00 30.00 40.00 50.00 60.00 70.00 80.00 Control CO2 N CO2+N type of treatment c o v e r v a lu e ( % ) Monocots Dicots 1999 autumn 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Control CO2 N CO2+N type of treatment c o v e r v a lu e ( % ) Monocots Dicots Figure 1.: Relative percentage cover of monocots and dicots Relative proportion of monocots and dicots (Fig. 1): The monocots account for 60-67% of the total cover in the control plots. This proportion between monocots and dicots is about the same within the 2 years studied, showing a slight decreasing tendency with time. As a consequence of the effect of N treatments in 1999 the proportion of monocots is much higher, compared with that in the initial state. On the contrary, in the CO2treated plots the relative cover of monocots decreased to the advantage of several dicots. The relative percentage cover of monocots is about 15% higher in 1999 than 1 year ago. Based on Borhidi’s social behaviour type system (Borhidi, 1993), it can be concluded the ruderals were dominant in 1998, both in the CO2 enriched and in the control plots. In the plots treated by N and N+CO2 the competitors and the stress tolerants were dominant in the first year. Cover value of ruderal species in these plots reached 57-64% in autumn of 1999. This group was dominant in the all plots. The cover value of the competitor and the stress tolerant species was low 13-22% in the all treated plots and the control fields in autumn of 1999.</p><p id="Pg564">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1958 Conclusions Changes in botanical composition due to elevated air CO2 concentration was characterized by the increasing relative cover of the dicots and decreasing cover of monocots. Nitrogen addition had reversed this situation favoring the monocots, as known from grassland management practices. The above shift in the relative cover of monocots vs. dicots are paralleled with differing ecophysiological behaviour of these two main functional groups and it seems reasonable to argue that the measured physiological acclimations are at least in part responsible for the observed cover changes (Tuba et al., 1996; Tuba et al.,1998b). In our opinion, the impact of CO2, N and their combined effects on the coenological changes can be appropriately described by the rank order changes of some ‘important’ species. The patterns of dominance sequence and relative cover changes of dicots and monocots seem to be also a very good indicator of structural changes caused by disturbances. It is also clear that species, owing to their various biological properties, are different in their responses to different treatments over time.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1959 COMPARISON OF COST OF NUTRIENT SUPPLY IN ORGANIC AND CONVENTIONAL FARMING Sándor KIS Department of Business Management, Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences, Szent István University kissandor@fibermail.hu Abstract Due to strengthening of environment-conscious way of thinking and increased social demands on foods free from chemical residues, organic farming comes more and more into prominence. In organic production, instead of fertilization, important role is obtained by different organic manures, compost and also green manure in nutrient supply. The modification of the production technology, it influences the utility of other inputs and the costs of production too. In this study the relation between fertilization and profitability in winter wheat sector is examined. Keywords: organic farming, cost of nutrient, comparison analysis Introduction During the period of enhancement of fertilizer use, the nutrient balance was positive, the state of supply of soils with nutrients improved and yield averages increased. Hungarian soils under agricultural utilization showed the most positive N-balance (+ 47 kg N ha-1) during the space of time of intensive fertilization (1970-1989). The balance of phosphorus - similarly to that of the nitrogen - was positive during the period of intensive fertilization (1970: + 22, 1980: + 40 kg P2O5 ha -1). Then, however, overfertilization meant a potential danger. In the following years (1990-1991) in consequence of the slackened fertilizer use, the balance diminished to a significant extent (- 28 kg N ha-1), subsequently, from the next years on to our days moved generally between 0 and + 10 kg N ha-1 values, the P-balance was 0 kg P2O5 ha -1, later on, between 1991 and 200l - since practically P-fertilization did not occur - balances became considerably negative (-l0 and -20 kg P2O5 ha -1) [Environmental pressure indicators of Hungary 2003]. Parallel with the decline of fertilization, the nutrient balance took a negative turn, the degree of supply of soils with nutrients worsened, their productivity and also yields decreased. In the second half of the nineties, average N-balance in the EU-15 amounted to + 52-55 kg N ha-1. According to the estimation of the Soil Bureau of Europe, the degree of supply of the soil with NP is unfavourably high on 17 million hectares (on 12% of the agricultural area), increasing the danger of NP burden to surface- and subsoil waters. [Environmental pressure indicators of Hungary 2003]. In organic production, instead of fertilization, important role is obtained by different organic manures, compost and also green manure in nutrient supply. Effect of this was investigated by several research workers and the results of analyses of soil samples originating from conventional and organic farming, were compared. [Oláh, 2007, Marinari et al 2005]. By means of leguminous plants approximately the same amount of organic material and nitrogen gets into the soil, than with 14 t ha-1 of livestock manure. At the same time, organic nutrient content of the green manure decomposes far easier, therefore its effect persists for shorter time in tae soil. According to the data of Kemenesy (1972), soil is enriched by leguminous plants depending on the plant species and soil potentialities by 50-140 kg ha-1 of nitrogen every year. In organic farming,</p><p id="Pg566">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1960 substitution of fertilizers for natural materials results not only in decreased environmental burden, but also through modification of the production technology, it influences the utility of other inputs and the costs of production too. [Takács-György, 2007] In the winter wheat sector, the relation between fertilization and profitability was earlier even by several researchers studied. [Loncaric et al, 2006; Loncaric et al. 2007]. Material and Methods In the course of the present study it was investigated, that how will the cost of nutrient supply to plants, produced by means of organic farming change as opposed to conventional production. For the reason of demonstration of this, technological plans were compiled relating both to conventional and organic production and also comparative analyses were made. In another part of the study, data were gathered by the aid of questionnaire survey on the kinds and frequencies of practices, applied by Hungarian organic producers in nutrient supply. The survey was carried out in 2006 and it covered the whole country, extended to 110 organic farms - and may be regarded as territorially representative. [Kis, 2007] Results and discussion Comparison of the costs of nutrient supply will be demonstrated by example of the winter wheat sector. As starting point, conventional technological plan was compiled for winter wheat on 94 ha of plot size, where the expectable yield was 4,4 t ha-1. The necessary amount of fertilizer was adjusted to the demands of the plant and to the expected yield. Demand on nutritive materials of the winter wheat was determined on the basis of the method of Radics (1994). Table 1. Planning of nutrient supply for conventional production of winter wheat Active ingredient For 1 t of yield (kg) For planned yield (kg) Active ingredient content (%) Amount of fertilizer (kg ha -1 ) Fertilizer total (for 94 ha) Price of fertilizers (HUF kg -1 ) Total cost of fertilizers (HUF) N 27 x 118,8 34 349 32 845 63,60 2 088 923 P 11 x 48,4 18 269 25 276 43,92 1 110 018 K 18 x 79,2 60 132 12 408 73,57 912 815 Total: - - - - - - 4 111 757 Source: xRadics, 1994, http://mek.oszk.hu/01200/01216/01216.htm and own calculation In addition to nutrient cost, also costs of forwarding; and dispersion must be taken into account, which are split in two parts (in autumn basic fertilization, in spring supplementary N-fertilization) and they mean a cost amounting to approximately 270.000 HUF for the plot on the basis of the settlements of shift hours. It was planned to realize nutrient supply in organic farming by dispersion of organic manure. In case of organic manuring it must be considered that dispersed active ingredients can furnish nutrients for a longer time, thus a part of the amount applied will be utilized in the following year too (Antal, 1987.) On the basis of the above data, total demand on nutrient elements to be satisfied may be calculated, 66 t ha-1 of organic manure must be dispersed in the first year. This amount of manure would assure suitable nutrient for the yield of the second year from K and P elements, only the demand on N can not be satisfied in this way, this necessitates in the</p><p id="Pg567">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1961 second year a further dose of 22 t ha-1. Considering both the cost of material and the cost of dispersion in organic farming, it can be stated, that the cost of nutrient supply is higher in the first year, than in conventional production. (Table 2.) At the same time, however, due to the longer persistence, far less manure must be dispersed in the second year (one-third of the original amount) thus also costs will be significantly lower. In conventional production, using fertilizers, such persistence can not be taken into account. Table 2. Cost of nutrient supply in winter wheat (HUF) in organic production 1. year 2. year Cost of material 4 032 600 1 344 200 Loading 540 967 180 322 Dispersion 1 780 770 593 590 Total 6 354 336 2 118 112 Source: own calculation On the whole, when two years arc investigated, it can be stated, that between the two methods of production significant difference can not be demonstrated. The cost of nutrient supply in organic farming, however, greatly depends on the fact, whether organic manure originates from own source or from purchase and on the actual transport distances and possibilities of manure dispersion. Organic manuring - although does not result in direct cost saving - has at the sane time favourable effect on physical, chemical and biological condition of the soil and inherent risk of environmental pollution and food safety hazard are lower, than in case of fertilization and helps the spread of organic farming till market can accept it (Takács, 2007). According to the questionnaire survey, 56% of the questioned used organic manure on its plots in conventional production already before the beginning with organic production. 37% of the respondents used no kind of chemicals, neither fertilizers nor plant protecting agents or other yield increasing additives previous to organic farming. In investigating the nutrient supply, 93 evaluable answers were obtained. It was asked, that which are the methods and proportions of nutrient supply used of those, listed in the questionnaire by the given farm and whether other methods, not included in the questionnaire were used. Table 3 contains the distribution of the answers. Table 3.

By averaging the above data, the proportion of materials used for nutrient supply was determined relating to an average farm (Fig. 1.) The most frequently applied method in nutrient supply is organic manuring and ploughing in of green manure plants.</p><p id="Pg568">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1962 organic manure 50% mulch 6% other 9% compost 11% green manure 24% Figure 1. Average results of nutrient supply Source: Own survey Conclusions In organic farming, natural materials are applied instead of fertilizer use in nutrient supply. According both to the professional literature and own surveys, most frequently organic manuring, ploughing in of green manure plants are chosen by organic farmers as the method of nutrient supply. In comparing the costs of nutrient supply with those of conventional production, it may be stated, that significant difference can not be demonstrated between the two methods on the average of several years. Yearly difference, however, may be significant, due to the fact, that organic manuring has the ability to exert favourable effect even for several years, but at the same time, costs of organic manure dispersion are significantly higher, than the costs of fertilization. This might mean a problem mainly in financing and (seasonal) cyclic of work organization. It is the advantage of organic manuring, that it preserves the quality of arable soils for a long time, even ameliorates it, as well as also general quality characteristics of the yield may be more favourable and even environment is less burdened than by the use of artificial fertilizers.

The C content of the biomass changed to a small extent independently from the land use type. Shoot and root N content of the grazing excluded and irrigated stands have exceeded the control values. Soil total C content of all plots significantly increased, while Soil total N content decreased in all loess stands but significantly increased in sandy areas during the studied period. Keywords: grasslands, irrigation, fertilization, grazing exclusion, carbon, nitrogen, biomass, soil layers Introduction Temperate grasslands account for ca. 20 % of the land area in Europe and their Hungarian extension (see e.g. Szirmai &amp; Czóbel, 2006) also significant. Carbon accumulation in grassland ecosystems occurs mostly below ground. Grasslands also contribute to the biosphere – atmosphere exchange of non CO2 radiatively active trace gases, with fluxes intimately linked to management practices. Decline in shoots N content followed by increasing N uptake of roots from the soil in grasslands stands under elevated CO2 (Campbell et al., 2000; Tuba, 2005). In addition, N-demand increased allocation from above-ground shoots to roots (Soussana &amp; Hartwig, 1996). promotes temporary N-immobilization which might, in turn, reduce the availability of soil nitrogen. Other studies (e.g. Spehn et al., 2002) also supported the strong and complex interactions between C- and N-cycling in grassland ecosystems. Variation in C content across grassland types is largely a function of climatic and edaphic factors. Organic C tends to increase with soil clay content (Bauer et al., 1987) and annual precipitation (Burke et al., 1989). Soil organic matter can be strongly influenced by management (Eynard et al., 2005). A worldwide study found, that soil C content and concentration increased with improved management in 74% of the studies, as a result of increasing carbon fixation. Carbon sequestration rates tended to be greatest in the top 10 cm of soil. Conversion from cultivation (including abandonment of grazing) and irrigation resulted the largest increases in grassland biomes (Conant et al., 2001). Reeder &amp; Schuman (2002) evaluated the effects of livestock grazing on C content of the plant–soil system (to 60 cm) of two semi-arid grasslands: a mixed-grass prairie (grazed 12 years), and a short-grass steppe (grazed 56 years). Grazing treatments included season-long grazing at heavy and light stocking rates, and non-grazed exclosures. Significantly higher soil C (0–30cm) was measured in grazed pastures compared to non-grazed exclosures, although for the short-grass steppe higher soil C was observed with the heavy grazing treatment only. The main objective of this paper is to determine the short-term effect of different land use changes (grazing exclusion, fertilization and irrigation) on the carbon and nitrogen</p><p id="Pg570">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Materials and methods Sites description and experimental plots The grazing exclusion site is situated at Bugacpuszta (46041’30’’N, 19036’E, 114 m a.m.s.l.) in the Great Hungarian Plain. The climate of the region is temperate continental, and the soil is a chernozem type sandy soil. The vegetation is semi-arid sandy grassland. The area is part of the Kiskunság National Park and has been under extensive management for the last 40 years. Electric fence was applied to exclude Hungarian Grey Cattle grazing from an area of 6 ha. Fertilization was carried out in xeric, species rich, tall temperate loess grassland /SalvioFestucetum rupicolae/. The site is situated at the centre of Gödöllő Hills (47042’N, 19024’E, 255m a.m.s.l) near Isaszeg, and the soil is a moderately eroded limeimpregnated chernozem. Mineral fertilizers applied in spring. Mixed fertilizer with different content ratios in nitrogen (100 kg N/ha), phosphor (50 kg P/ha) and potassium (50 kg K/ha), and various compounds /ammonium-nitrate, P2O5 &amp; K2O / was used in the treatment. Vegetation covered loess monoliths were transplanted from Gödöllő Hills (near Isaszeg) to the Botanical Garden of Szent István University, Gödöllő (47036’N, 19026’E, 220 m a.m.s.l.) as described before (Tuba et al., 1996). Experiments were started in spring 2002. Plots were positioned along two transects (5 treated, 5 control) and arranged in small vegetation patches in both loess treatments (1m x 1m in fertilized, and 0.8m x 0.8m in irrigated stand). Irrigation was scheduled to maintain a near steady state soil water content during the growing season (April-October). Top spray irrigation operated at night was used for the water supply. Soil water cc. was kept below but near 0.35m3/m3 in treated plots. Biomass sampling The above-ground biomass was cut either at ground level (Bugac) or 5 cm above ground (Isaszeg and Gödöllő) twice per year at peak biomass after the first and second growing period in early June and November. Simultaneously with above-ground biomass removal minimum six below-ground biomass samples were collected at three locations in each site by coring. The roots (both coarse and fine) were separated by sieving soil through a 2 mm sieve. Total C and N content of biomass components were quantified by Eurovector EA 3000 instrument. Soil sampling At least 15 (Bugac) or 10 (Isaszeg and Gödöllő) soil samples were collected from minimum 5 soil cores, and twice per year (late spring and autumn) during the studied period. Soil from three (0–10, 10–30, 30–50 cm at Bugac site) or two (0-20, 20-40 cm at Isaszeg and Gödöllő site) soil layers was sampled, with at least five repetitions, using a 6 cm diameter soil auger. Total C and N contents of soil samples were determined using an Eurovector EA 3000 elemental analyser.</p><p id="Pg571">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1965 Results and discussion During our in situ field experiments the interannual and intraannual variability of biomass carbon and nitrogen contents and soil carbon and nitrogen pools of a sandy pasture and loess grassland were determined. The year of 2003 was much drier, while 2004 was more humid than the standard normal period, based on the comparison of our and long-term meteorological data. The amount and distribution difference in the precipitation of the studied years affected significantly the physiological activity and biomass production as well as have an influence on the carbon and nitrogen accumulations, especially in below-ground components.

Changes in Carbon and Nitrogen ratio of above- and below-ground biomass under different manipulations The C content of the biomass changed to a small extent independently from the land use type (Figure 1). Out of the manipulated stands it slightly increased only in the fertilized plots both in the above and below ground components. Shoot and root N content of the grazing excluded and irrigated stands have exceeded the control values, but in case of above ground biomass in both stands it declined compared with the beginning (Figure 1). Soil total C content of all plots significantly increased during the studied period, especially in „B” layer of loess grasslands and „A” layer in sandy pasture. Soil total N content decreased in all loess stands but significantly increased in sandy areas with lower magnitude (similarly to soil carbon) at the grazing excluded plot (Figure 2). Conclusions The results provide further information on the role of two Hungarian plant communities in carbon and nitrogen cycles. The amount and distribution difference in the precipitation of the studied years allowed us to study the effects of climatic anomalies (e.g. severe drought stress), which will presumably become more frequent as a result of the Global Climate Change on the biogeochemical processes. The soil carbon accumulation rate of non-grazed stand was lower in each layer and it could influence the physiological activity in the long-term. Soil and biomass data can be used for modelling carbon and nitrogen dynamics of loess grassland and sandy pasture as well as other plant communities characterized by similar dynamics.</p><p id="Pg572">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Soil respiration was measured in 5 permanent plots (both litter covered and bare) with closed chamber technique. Most important abiotic factors (Tsoil, SWC, PPFD) were continuously recorded, and their correlation to soil CO2 efflux were demonstrated in this paper. It was proved that transitional periods have a significant role both in the magnitude and temporal dynamics of soil carbon flux. The results can also be used for modelling the soil respiration in temperate forests characterized by contrasting climatic seasons. Keywords: soil respiration, deciduous forest, temperature dependence, moisture dependence Introduction Changes in Earth's surface temperatures caused by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are expected to affect global and regional precipitation regimes (Weltzin et al., 2003). Soil respiration may be particularly vulnerable to current and predicted changes in precipitation, and ecosystem responses to potential effects of water are not well understood, especially in certain areas (e.g. in forest steppe /see Szirmai &amp; Czóbel, 2006/) and associations as well as during the transition periods. Soil water and temperature can strongly limit soil CO2 efflux (e.g. Fang &amp; Moncrieff, 2000, Qi and Xu, 2004) and can affect carbon balance of temperate deciduous forest communities. Soil respiration is an important part of the global carbon balance, because soil is an important carbon reservoir both in forested and non-arborescent terrestrial associations. Out of the many factors control its dynamic the most important abiotic factors are soil temperature and soil water content. Temperature and moisture together explained 89% of the total temporal variations in soil CO2 efflux (Qi and Xu, 2004). A related study showed, that even 1oC increase in temperature could lead to more than 10% loss of soil organic content in those regions where the mean temperature is 5oC (Kirschbaum, 1995). The effect of climatic variation on soil respiration has also been well studied. However, little is known about how variable climate, may influence soil CO2 efflux, during the transition periods, like from snowmelt until peak leafing. Furthermore the flux results are rarely linked to litter cover, despite the fact that the latter play an important role in the magnitude of soil carbon dynamics. The objective of this paper is to present the functional ecological responses as well as the soil CO2 efflux and their interactions of a rare and relict Hungarian field maple-oak forest to the initial 3 months of growing season.</p><p id="Pg574">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1968 Materials and methods Site description The investigation was carried out in a natural forest stand of the Botanical Garden of Szent István University /47°36’N, 19°26’E; 220 m amsl/. The ca. 2 ha sized forest patch is part of the Gödöllői Hills, cover with Aceri campestri-Quercetum roboris community. This rare and relict association can be mainly found in slightly exposed hills sides and loess plateaus between 240 and 300 m amsl. The annual mean precipitation is 500-600 mm with irregular distribution. In general, the majority of precipitation falling in April-May, followed by summer drought. The site characterized by extreme temperature fluctuations (mean lowest temperature in January is only -16oC, while mean maximum temperature in July is 32.8oC), and abundant sunshine (yearly average 2000 hours). The brown forest soil was slighty acidic and sandy in texture. The deeper layers had aggregated alluvial structures and clay. Micrometeorological measurements The study contained both periodical and continuous measurements. The micrometeorological data measuring system (HOBO MicroStation; Massachusetts, USA) consists of Photosynthetically Active Photon Flux Density (PPFD), soil temperature (Tsoil) and soil moisture (SWC) sensors. The continuously operating micromet set-up (with a 5 minutes sampling frequency) was placed in the centre of the measured plots. The PPFD sensor was set-up at about 40cm above the ground surface, while the Tsoil) and SWC sensors at 5cm depth in the soil. Soil respiration measurements Soil CO2-flux measurement was carried out in weekly interval from March 23 (snowmelt), 2006 through May 18 (peak leafing), 2006 using closed-chamber technique (Gál et al. 2007, differing from Czóbel et al., 2005) and LiCor-6400 (Lincoln, Nebrasca, USA) infrared gas-analyser (IRGA). Soil CO2 efflux was measured in 5 permanent plots out of them in three the litter was removed constantly and in the other two was naturally covered by litter. The soil temperature data of IRGA was used to determine the correlation between Tsoil and soil respiration. The figures were done with SigmaPlot 8.0 program. The significance level of the correlation values was proved with ANOVA and T-test. Results and discussion Correlation between micrometeorological parameters and soil respiration The observed negative correlation between soil respiration and PPFD was indirect, because rising soil and air temperature in parallel with plant growth processes (leafing of trees and shrubs) caused a decline in photosynthetically active photon flux density reaching the surface. Thus the mentioned correlation refers actually to the temperature dependence of soil respiration.</p><p id="Pg575">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1969 The correlation between soil temperature and soil respiration in litter covered plots was much lower, than in bare plots. Litter cover decreased the temperature dependence on soil respiration, due to the buffering effect on key abiotic factors. Based on our data a significant difference was found between deciduous and spruce forests concerning the effect of litter on soil carbon flux. In the latter type the litter increased significantly the soil CO2 efflux and its removal resulted 10-40% decline in soil respiration in Picea abies stands (Buchmann, 2000). Statistically significant (Figure 1, r2=0,31) exponential rise to max regression was found between soil temperature and soil respiration unlike in other forest studies (Fang &amp; Moncrieff, 2000). Unlike soil temperature, soil water content and soil respiration showed a small, but not significant positive correlation. Despite the lack of strong correlation a more intensive soil respiration was found after rainfall events, like in other literature data (e.g. Lee et al., 2001, Rey et al., 2002.).

Rising soil temperature in spring decreased the soil water content (Figure 2), generated a weaker regression compared with literature data (e.g. Kirschbaum, 1995). Litter cover among others can eliminate the short-term effects of rainfall events on soil respiration and has a buffering effect on abiotic factors, thus play an important role in temperate deciduous forests. Our results furthermore can be used for modelling the soil respiration in temperate forests characterized by contrasting climatic seasons.

Histories of changing land use and vegetation of a 31 km 2 forest steppe area in North East Hungary (part of Tardona Hills) were reconstructed using GIS to investigate the vegetation response to different (e.g. agricultural practice, logging activity) land-use factors. During the investigated period of the last 225 years the highest expansion of natural vegetation was observed at the end of 18th century, but it decreased to the least extent between 1950 and 1960. The ratio of cultivated area has decreased steadily since 1970s, hence it has the smallest rate nowadays. Patches of semi natural vegetation mainly dominated by Calamagrostis epigeios and Brachypodium pinnatum in contrary with cultivated land has been increasing since 1970s. Keywords: long-term, vegetation dynamics, digital mapping, landscape history, forest steppe, soil types Introduction Study of landscape pattern changes is necessary to understand the major vegetation dynamics of an area. Knowledge of landscape history is essential to recognize and understand the current vegetation dynamics, and furthermore to predict their traits (Pickett, 1991; Whitney, 1994; Biró, 2006). Broader temporal and spatial extent is needed in studies, especially to determine phenomena and patterns that occur at landscape or even larger scales (Pickett, 1991). Archaeological records show that cultivation has been practiced since Iron Age in the studied area (Hellebrandt, 2002). For the investigation of the landscape pattern changes the use of historical maps is widespread nowadays. Since the first Military Survey Map the ratio of different habitat types in parallel with land use and land cover changes can be spatially detected. Since the mid 19th century vegetation mapping and thus land use recording has became more frequent. In this paper changing land use and vegetation of the past 225 years are studied in a longitudinal ridge of Tardona Hills based on historical and current vegetation maps. Materials and methods Site description The survey was carried out on a 30 km2 area of southwest-northeast ridge of Tardona Hills, near the Bükk Mountains, in North East Hungary. It is bordered by the Nyögő and Harica Stream Valley on the north, Sajó Valley on the east, Bábony Stream, and Barossakna Lyukóbánya Road on the south, the narrow gauge railway line on the southwest, and Mahóca Varbó Road on the west. Micrometeorological characteristics (annual mean temperature is 9C, annual mean precipitation is around 600 mm) show similar pattern along the ridge, the site is dominated by brown forest soils covering pannonsand, clay and loess sediments. Altitude range between 200-320 m, above mean sea level. The vegetation of the ridge consists of a mosaic of grasslands, woodlands and</p><p id="Pg578">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1972 forest patches. It shows transition from the plain to the mountain and part of the foreststeppe zone (Szirmai &amp; Czóbel, 2005, 2006). The natural forest associations were Aceri tatarico-Quercetum, Quercetum petreae-cerris and Querco petraeae-Carpinetum (Zólyomi 1967). Methods Long term vegetation dynamics, as well as land use and land cover data based on historical records /(Györffy, 1963; Fényes, 1851; Military Survey Map I. (1782-85); II. (1857); III. (revised in 1924); Military Map of People Republic of Hungary (1959, 1976), topographical maps of Tardona Hills (1984)/ and current vegetation map (Szirmai &amp; Czóbel, 2008). The area of different vegetation patches and land use types were calculated by Arc View 3.1 software after digitalizing the above mentioned maps. In order to georeference and digitalize these maps several papers /Kun &amp; Molnár (1999), Belényesi et al. (2002a, 2002b), Skutai (2002)/ and softwares (Erdas, ArcView) were used. Results and discussion Data showed that the highest expansion of forests was observed at the end of 18th century. In the next century its ratio declined by 50% (Table I.). The minimal expansion of forested area was in 1950s, but it has increased steadily since 1960s. Recently its rate has reached the half of the first record (1782-85). Most of these forest patches has developed on brown forest soils with significant clay fractions. The expansion of grasslands, contrary to forests was the least during the 18th and 19th centuries. After the phyloxera disease the ratio of grasslands has significantly increased. By the 1970’s the ratio of grasslands reached the double, moreover in 2007 the threefold of the initial expansion (1782-85). Grasslands have the highest rate nowadays, in contrary to the cultivated areas. Mesophilous types has evolved on brown forest soils, while the majority of xerophilous grasslands stands have occurred on skeletal, nutrient poor soils. The ratio of vineyards significantly increased from 1924 to 1970s. The former vineyards were planted in each of the mentioned soil types. Since the end of 1980s their ratio has showed a declining trend. The expansion of vineyards has the smallest rate nowadays since the 18th century. Abandoned vineyards mainly occupied by grasslands characterized by different secondary successional stages. Data show (Table I.) that from the beginning to the present day the most extensive change occurred in the cover of grasslands among the land use types. Plough-lands – in inverse ratio to grasslands – expanded significantly till 1960, when its ratio was the five hold of the initially recorded (1782-85). Since 1960s their area has been declining continuously in parallel with vineyards. Orchards had increased till 1971, but since then an opposite trend has occurred.</p><p id="Pg579">VII.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1975 CONCENTRATION OF LEAD AND CADMIUM IN SOIL, FORAGE, ORGAN AND MUSCLE SAMPLES OF SHEEP IN HUNGARY Péter PÓTI1 - Ákos BODNÁR2 - Edina LÁCZÓ1 - Ferenc PAJOR1 - Tibor KISPÁL2 1 Department of Cattle and Sheep Breeding,, Institute of Animal Husbandry, Faculty of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Szent Istvan University, H-2100 Godollo, Pater Karoly 1. poti.peter@mkk.szie.hu 2 Iternational Development and Tropical Department, Institute of Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Szent Istvan University University Abstract: The accumulation of different heavy metals (lead and cadmium) in soils, forages, organs and muscle was investigated in a mixed sheep flock (Suffolk and Ile de France). It was part of a long-term scientific program focusing to elaborate a well-applicable quality management system in sheep husbandry. Soils, grass, forage and organ samples of ewes and lambs were taken and the heavy metal content was measured. It was found that the contents of Pb and Cd in organs and meat taken from lambs were lower compared to the same samples of ewes. The main concentration of cadmium content was accumulated in kidneys and livers. One can see that even if the heavy metal contents of forages meet the limits of regulations, this is not necessarily a guarantee for the maximum acceptable heavy metal content of primary products (meat). Keywords: heavy metals, soils, forage, sheep organs, food safety Introduction Different products of lamb and sheep meat play an increasingly important role in modern human nutrition even in the European Union countries. Food safety becomes more important criteria for the consumers because of the novel requirements of foods as tools for disease prevention and health. That is a very important point to keep the unwholesome and accumulated components of the elementary food commodity under control, using effectively applicable quality safety systems (Tasi al., 1998). Sustainable agriculture is one that produces abundant food without depleting the earth’s resources or polluting its environment. The concept of sustainability has been integrated into manufacturing industry and food production in recent years. Into food production, mainly focuses on agricultural production process and the conversion of agricultural products into final food products (Husti, 2006). To elaborate a whole food chain, including breeding, keeping and nutrition technologies in sheep husbandry is one of the main criteria of the safe primary food products (Mézes and Füleky, 2003). Accumulation of non-essential heavy metals (e.g. Pb, Cd) in the environment could be useful indicators of the possible toxic effects for the consumers (Liu, 2003; Tasi 2004; Tasi, 2005; Phillips et al., 2005). Industrial developments, intensive use of raw materials and novel agricultural technologies have all somehow improved our lifestyle while simultaneously polluting the natural environment. According to the above mentioned findings, in present current study the amount of accumulated heavy metals (Pb and Cd) in soils, forage and organs of a grazed sheep flock was investigated. Materials and methods Experimental animals were selected from a traditionally pastured mixed sheep flock of Suffolk and Ile de France (n=10, average age 1.93 years) genotypes kept on a farm in Szendrő (Northeast part of Hungary). Ewes were kept on pasture during the vegetation period and they were fed exclusively with pasturing from April to July and 2.5-3.0</p><p id="Pg582">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1976 kg/day good quality hay and silage and additionally 600-700 grams concentrate during out of grazing period. The lambs were fed fattening lamb concentrate ad libitum until weaning. Representative samples of concentrate and representative samples of grazed grass (3 m2 sample area) were taken. The lambs (n=10) and ewes (n=10) were slaughtered after the weaning and the contents of Pb and Cd, in their organs (brain, liver, spleen, kidneys and lung), meat were estimated. Heavy metal content had been determined after drying (50-60 °C, 48 hours) and ashing (550 oC) of air-dried forage and mutton samples. All sample amounts was 0.5000 g. Preparations of the samples were made in Milestone Microwave Acid Digestion apparatus using 65 % (v/v) nitric acid and 30 % (v/v) hydrogen-peroxide according to the instrument manual. A Jobin Yvon JY24 ICP-OES indicatively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer was used to measure Pb and Cd concentrations. Standard solutions for lead and cadmium were provided by Merck (Darmstadt). Data were statistically evaluated by SPSS 14.0 program package. Results and discussion The mean concentrations of lead and cadmium in soils are presented in Table 1. Table 1. Lead and cadmium content of the soils (mg/kg±SD) Depth (cm) pH Cd Pb 0-20 6.81 19.78 0.25 20-40 6.61 17.25 0.12 40-60 6.61 19.00 0.10 The amount of the lead in soil samples was lower, but the cadmium was higher than the acceptable limits according the regulations (10/2000) where the maximum concentration in soil has been proposed as 100 mg/kg for lead, and 1 mg/kg for cadmium, respectively. The mean concentrations of lead and cadmium in grass (in four months), forage, hay and silage are shown in Table 2. Table 2.

The cadmium level increased under the vegetation time. The amount of the heavy metals in grass samples were lower than the highest acceptable limits according the regulations (2005/87/EC) where the maximum concentration in green forage has been proposed as 30 mg/kg and in other forages as 10 mg/kg for lead, and 1 mg/kg for cadmium</p><p id="Pg583">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1977 (moisture content of 12 %), respectively. Amount of heavy metals found in the soil is higher than found in forage, it was similar with Bálint et al (2007). Concentrations of Pb and Cd in tissues of ewes and their lambs are shown in Table 3.

The highest concentration of cadmium was detected in kidney and liver. The amounts of the heavy metals investigated were compared to the maximum acceptable limits in meat and edible tissues of farm animals according to the EU regulation (466/2001). The maximum lead concentration in meat is 0.1 mg/kg, while in liver and kidney it is 0.5 mg/kg. With regard to these limits, the Pb concentration of meat and liver tissues were higher than the acceptable limits. The Pb concentration in sheep organs was also higher than was found by Liu (2003) and Abou-Arab (2001) as reported from rural areas, but it was lower as compared to values of samples from industrial areas. The mean concentration of lead (mg/kg) in meat was 0.59. However, Massadeh et al, (2006) reported the mean concentration of lead (mg/kg) in Australian, Jordanian (local) and Chinese muttons were 4.30, 3.15 and 2.17, respectively. On the basis of the samples lead level, 85, 92 and 87.5% of Jordanian, Australian and Chinese mutton respectively, exceeded the international safe permissible limit of 1.0 mg/kg. The safe permissible limit of Pb in meat and meat products was stipulated to be 1.0 mg/kg by Codex Alimentarius Commission (Massadeh et al., 2006). The maximum cadmium concentration of the EU regulation (466/2001) in meat is 0.05 mg/kg, in liver 0.5 mg/kg, and in kidneys 1.0 mg/kg. Regarding to these limits, the Cd concentration of meat and edible tissues were within the limits. The cadmium content showed similar results in rural area, except kidneys (Abou-Arab, 2001). The high concentration of cadmium in sheep kidney (compared to the other organs) was due largely to the binding of cadmium to sulfhydryl groups in the protein metallothionein in the kidney and liver organs (Husain et al., 1996). The contents of cadmium and lead in edible organs and meat taken from lambs were lower compared to the same organs and tissues of ewes. According to Hecht (1983) the cadmium content of the kidney increases with the age of the animal, and the concentration in liver depends on the concentration of cadmium in the feed as well as on the species of the animals (Abou-Arab, 2001). The dependence of age was evident in the cadmium contents of liver and kidneys of cattle (Frank et al.,</p><p id="Pg584">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1978 1989). The accumulation of cadmium in sheep was similar to the results of the previous studies (Abou-Arab, 2001; Liu, 2003). Conclusions The main concentration of Cd content was accumulated in kidneys and livers of sheep. Accumulation of heavy metals was higher in all of the ewe samples compared to the lamb tissues. According to this, meat products from adult animals may less safety for the consumers than the same products from lambs. However, the amount of the heavy metals in grass samples were lower than the highest acceptable limits, concentration of Pb and Cd in meat samples were higher than the maximum acceptable limits of the EU regulation. Based on the results, it can be stated that even if the heavy metal contents of forages meet the maximum acceptable limits of regulations, this is not necessarily a guarantee for the low heavy metal content of primary food products. There are also other factors which could influence the quality and microelement content of the meat. References Abou-Arab, A.A.K.

This paper focuse on influence of grassland management on plant composition with special regard to herbs. Extensive management leads to an increase in herbs. The main reason is an open sward, leading to many gaps. Fodder quality is medium in these speciespoor stands. Intensive management practices leads to an increases in the proportion of grasses and several herbs which are adapted to increased management intensity. Fodder quality increases, except of a high degree of coverage by Poa trivialis. Highest plant species richness is related to moderately management practice. Species richness will decreases both extensive and intensive management in a long-term. Keywords: soil, fertilization, grassland, management, herbs Introduction The cutting frequency and the nutrient management effect to the plant composition (Németh, 2006; Vida et al., 2007; Szabó et. al., 2007; Szemán, 2007) especially in a permanent grassland. The intensity of farming effect to the quality of fodder and yield of grasslands too (Klapp, 1971; Baskay-Tóth, 1966; Bánszki, 1986, 1993; Buchgraber and Pötsch, 1994; Tasi, 2007). The aim of this research was: how does the manuring and farming to the plant composition effect after 50 years especially to the covering of herbs. Among the manuring and intensity of farming was examinated the meadow in the mountain region fitted into the landscape in all their grade in order to the interest of fodder together the protecting of environment and species to connect. Materials and methods The experiment and examinations to which this paper relate, finding and running for 50 years in the Alps region Austria, the exact experiment was established by institute HBLFA Raumberg–Gumpenstein.

The grass cover degree was between 23 and 38 % with PK-manure, but grasses were between 45-53 % with NPK-treatment. Cover of Leguminosae was 18-24 % by PK-manure. A N-manure decreased the Leguminosae cover to 2-7 %. Grass proportion increased by the added N-manure more significant than the forbs. Here show also a changing effect between the grouped species. Grass structure grew stronger by the nutrient added. When the grass proportion declines in the stand so nitrogen added support the occuring forbs. By higher N-manuring especially in form of easily soluble N-manure get in the Leguminosae clearly. Nagy and Vinczeffy (1993) could establish this changing effect for the Hungarian meadow too.

If this three species were of 6 % in extensive meadow, so they could appear with a proportion of 11 % in the meadow mowing three times, 20 % with four times mowing and 27 % in the simulated pasture. By more intensive fertilization and grassland management increasing cover proportion of undergrasses to 38 %. Expansion of species Poa trivialis is not expected, because it has got in the fodder a typical after-taste, which isn’t preferred by animals. By this strong grass structure by PK-manure across the undergrasses can not optimally develop the species Leontodon hispidus and Taraxacum officinale. The species Achillea millefolium was developed to 13 % cover degree on the two times cutting plots however with a higher cutting frequency it decreased to a cover degree of 1-2 % (Table 3). By a nitrogen manure with a more intensive utilization increased the species Leontodon hispidus and Taraxacum officinale to 29 % cover degree on the plots mowed three times, such on a plot has got also Taraxacum officinale the biggest expansion. With an effect of different utilization and PK-manure showed species Achillea millefolium a</p><p id="Pg588">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1982 significant expansion, however by permanently increase of nitrogen manure could not influence significantly the utilization forms the appear of species Achillea millefolium. Conclusions If the aim is to reach a species rich respectively forb rich stand, it demand to apply the extensive hayfarming with two mowing pro year, because this utilization lead to an increase in herbs. Such a plant developing dominantly by extensive farming if in the stand are robust dicotyledons. We could establish this in the case of species Achillea millefolium too. This doesn’t effect the fodder quality negative but the biodiversity too. This plant stands riched in forbs show in generally a lot of gaps in the grassland, which is by Poa trivialis especially in the case of a good nutrient circulation. While the cover degree of grasses is increased strongly by N-fertilization and a higher cutting frequency, it will be expected lower cover of forbs particularly by intensive utilization. From the aspect of biodiversity show sites limited in nutrient show a higher proportion of forbs and this extensive flowering meadow contribute to the beauty of culture landscape.

For these reasons applied research based on high level may lay foundations. The utilization of the result of basic research may mean a lasting economic benefit. For this the country has to be well-founded and suitable for R+D activities, which is needed to be continued. Currently in the countries of the world R+D activities and their intensity are changing, R+D proportions of expenditures to GDP are between 0,8-5,0%. The low research intensity is typical of the poorer countries, generally. Big efforts are put onto the increase on the efficiency of research and development in the European Union. The documents of the Lissabon meeting set the most important tasks. The task is to achieve the targeting R+D expenditures for 3% of the EU GDP. It is suggested that the European Union research budget should be increased. Keywords: research results, technological development, profit, innovation process, export-import of research results Introduction The agricultural development has always been forming part of the general development. Its main objective is to supply the world’s population with food. Within the European Union one of the concrete objectives of agricultural production is to rise the productivity (by means of increased technical development, rationalization of the production, as well as by making use in best possible way of production factors, first of all of labour), or to guarantee the safety of food provision, to make possible that basic agricultural products for the Community could be produced within the member states, exempted from the world market’s fluctuations and meeting the consumers’ demands on equitable prices. In Hungary it was in the recent years when the research works aiming at scientific definition of optimum utilization of natural resources – among others of the soil – have begun. These research works in several points are connected with the efforts toward scientifically based consideration of biosphere, taking into account all obligations arising from reasonable exploitation of natural resources. These research works require a new approach in the field of penology, plant breeding and modernization, in close relationship with the requirements of sustainable development. Materials and methods For measurement of the efficiency of research and development, based on multivariate functions, we worked out such a method, which examines in a closed system the factors of production processes (the engaged labour, the amount of expended capital, or the land, as well as the the proportion of money used for research and development, the time required to the introduction of research’s results and the result of production). In such a way our study has a primary methodological character.</p><p id="Pg590">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1984 Results and discussion Interdependences between economic and technical development From the elements determining the economic development, it is the intensity of R&amp;D expenditure, we want to outline. Examining the development stage and R&amp;D activity of different countries, we can set down that there is a close exponential relation (I = 0,91) between the per capita GDP and the proportion of R&amp;D expenditure to GDP (Figure 1). y = 0,35*1,05x I = 0.91 0 0,5 1 1,5 2 2,5 3 3,5 4 4,5 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Expenditure for research and development GDP (thousand USD) Figure 1. Development of expenditure used for research and development as a function of per capita GDP (thousand USD) in case of OECD countries (expect Norway and Luxemburg) According to the parameters of this function, the proportion of R&amp;D expenditure to GDP is higher by 5,2 % in those countries, where the per capita GDP, i.e. the relative number indicating the development stage of the country is above 1000 USD. It is important to emphasize the significance of scientific research in order the actual economic policy could treat the designation of priorities and their financement and to do so, it is necessary to be able to prove the utility of research’s results and there importance in economic growth. For the measurement of technical development, we worked out a – relatively simple – computation method which can be suitable to measure the production factors, as well as the results of research and development activity directed towards certain elements of production process. The production function, expressing among others the technical development, can be defined as follows:  FTMfy ,,</p><p id="Pg591">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1985 If we take into consideration also the effect of scientific results, the function will be modified as follows:  tHFTMfyk ,,,, , where: y = profit obtainable by the production of the given product, M = labour necessary to produce the given product, T = capital engagement necessary to produce the given product, F = land necessary to produce the given product, H = proportion of R and D expenditure to total GDP of the branch, t = average time period necessary to introduce new scientific results (month, year). Let the modified function be:  tHFTMayk  , where the factors’ exponents express their volume returns.

For the measurement of weights of factors expressing the effects of soil quality and of technical progress, as well as for their quantification, we suggest the fitting of following function: Y1 = f(p; x1; x2; x3; x4) where: Y1 = presumptive value of net income from crop production, Ft/hectare p = an indicator number expressing the soil quality, gold crown/ha, point/ha x1, or x2 = means embodying the technical progress, or manpower-supply, Ft/ha, or employees/100 ha x3 = transport distance (distances to direct market, to processing industries, to commercial delivery places and to other realization points)</p><p id="Pg592">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1986 x4 = market conditions, geographical situation (Purchasing-power capacity for food and consumer’s goods in the region of land-estate to be evaluated, Ft/year) In the formula, the exponent of “p” expresses the proportion of income attributable to soil quality. The computations were made on the basis of the data for 1995-2005 of 170 agricultural companies. The obtained function is as follows: Y = 7,93 . p1,001. x1 0,038 . x2 0,317 . x3 -0,061 . x4 0,219 Remarks to the results: a) According to elasticity coefficients, it is the soil quality expressed in point values, to which the highest volume-returns belong on national level. b) Generally, the less developed the degree of infrastructural supply of given region, the greater is the role of soil quality in the income generation. c) Although the elasticity indicators expressing the technical progress have a strong effect, but they don’t reach the role of soil quality in the income generation. Conclusions  The larger the difference between the efficiency of production technologies, and the larger the extra profit arising in consequence of technical development, the more urgent the promotion (encouragement or enforcement) of introduction of new technologies.  The stronger the economy of a certain country, the more will be devoted to main tan or develop the technical development stage.  The scientific research, the technological development and innovation are key factors of economic growth, facilitating the permanent technical-economical renewal. According to our calculations, the minimum target is that the proportion of R&amp;D expenditure should reach 3 % within the GDP in order to be successful.  Encouraging and enforcing elements can be the following ones:  Tax allowances for the new technologies and tax increase for the old ones.  Creation of strict and refined evaluation methods for new technologies, being able to economically justify the introduction of new processes. Such encouraging and enforcing elements should be built into the regulation system, which can stimulate the entrepreneurs to maintain the requirements of sustainable development. The protection of patent and copyrights, as well as the application of better licence-agreements and international co-operation forms are very important.

Strossmayer, Trg Sv. Trojstva 3, 31000 Osijek, Croatia: E-mail: bpopovic@pfos.hr Abstract: The aim of this paper was to determine organic and total P in soils of continental part of Croatia. All soil samples (n = 40) were grouped according to soil reaction into two groups: acid soils ranged from pHKCl 3,80 to 6,62 and calcareous soils ranged from pHKCl 6,70 to 7,83. there was strong multiple regression realtionship (r= 0,88) between humus content, organic P, total P resulting with equations: organic P = -20,1364 x humus + 0,070563 x total P for acid soils and organic P = 32,71208 x humus + 0,119117 x total P for calcareous soils. Keywords: organic P, total P, ratio, prediction Introduction In the soil phosphorus largely exists as P adsorbed on iron and aluminum oxides or in association with calcium. In comparison to other plant nutrients the mobility of P in soil is low becouse of the generally low solubility of phosphate compounds and the strong P-binding capacity of soil components (Kadar, 2007). Soil pH has a great influence on phosphorus availability and at low pH values Al, Fe and Mn as at high pH values Ca and Mg can react with available phosphorus forming insoluble and unavailable phosphorus compounds. Phosphorus also occurs in organic forms and may be released by microbial activity. Evidence already presented suggests that organic P should be looked upon more as a reservoir whose level rises under some conditions and falls under others (Anderson, 1980). Moderate supplies of soil with phosphorus and potassium, alone or in their combination are limiting factors of field crop yields (Kovačević et all, 2007). In general, ameliorative phosphorus fertilization had different effects on the yield of field crops (Ćupić et all, 2007). As the problems and levels of organic and total phosphorus in Croatian soils are relatively poorly researched, the aim of this paper was to determine organic and total P in soils of continental part of Croatia. Also, interactions beetwen inorganic, organic and total phosphorus were observed. Materials and methods Soil samples were collected from all over the continental part of Croatia beginning in 2003. Field trials were also conducted on four different sites in eastern Croatia: Donji Miholjac, Rakitovica, Zelčin and Dalj Planina. The phosphorus fertilization and liming trials were set up as a randomized block design with the following treatments: no fertilization, NPK and NPK fertilization + liming. Applied mineral fertilization rate were N:P2O5:K2O 200:150:300 kg ha -1 at Rakitovica, Donji Miholjac and Zelčin and soil was limed with 0, 10 or 20 t ha-1 of carbocalc (total Ca content 344 g kg-1). Mineral fertilization at Dalj Planina site was conducted with N:P2O5:K2O 100:200:300 kg ha -1 and lime material was added in two rates: 7,5 and 15 t/ha of lime (65 % CaO). The purpose of these trials was to collect soil samples. Field experiments soil samples were</p><p id="Pg594">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1988 sampled to a depth of 30 cm and prepared for laboratory analysis. At the same time, soils from continental part of Croatia where also sampled for the same laboratory analysis. All soil samples (n = 40) were grouped according to soil reaction into two groups: acid soils ranged from pHKCl 3,80 to 6,62 and calcareous soils ranged from pHKCl 6,70 to 7,83. Soil analyses included methods commonly used for soil fertility assessment in Croatia: soil pHH2O and pHKCl (ISO 10390), humus by sulfocromic oxidation (ISO 14235), plant available P and K by ammonium-lactate extraction (AL-P, AL-K) (Egner et al., 1960), carbonate content by volumetric method (ISO 10693). Organic P and total P was determined in all soil samples as aditional soil phosphorus analysis. Total organic P in soils was determined using 0,5 M sulphuric acid (Saunders and Williams, 1955; Walker and Adams, 1958). Ignited and unignited soil samples were exctracted with acid and the difference in the amounts of inorganic P in the extracts was taken as a measure of organic P. The statistic analyses for all data were done by analyses of variance using PC applications Microsoft Excel and StatSoft Statistica. Results and discussion The range of soil properties in analyzed acid samples were: pHKCl 3,80-6,62, humus content ranged 0,56-2,65 %, AL-P 33,0-248,0 mg kg-1, organic P 10,0-237,5 mg kg-1 and total P 1477,5-2362,5 mg kg-1. In analyzed calcareous samples the range of soil properties were: pHKCl 6,70-7,56, humus content ranged 0,98-2,23 %, carbonate content ranged 0,84-40,9 % CaCO3, AL-P 23,0-328,0 mg kg -1, organic P 22,5-640,0 mg kg-1 and total P 507,5-2537,5 mg kg-1. Total P represents sulphuric acid exctractable phosphorus in 0,5 M H2SO4. Borie (1981) reported that 17 to 85 % of Fe phytate and Al phytate were hydrolised when 0,5 M H2SO4 was applied to alkaline soils. Although, the total P was similar in both group of soils, acid and calcareous, the distribution of samples in ranges according to soil analysis shows that determinated level of organic P in calcareous soils was higher than in acid soils what could be considered as results of microbiological activity (figure 1.). 0 400 800 1200 1600 2000 AL-P total H2SO4 P organic P mg kg-1 acid soils calcareous soils Figure 1. Mean values of AL-P, organic P and sulphuric acid extractable (total) P in acid and calcareous soils</p><p id="Pg595">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1989 In very acid soils the activity of microorganisms is suppressed and such soils usually contain more organic matter in their surface horisons then comparable soils of higher pH. Liming acid soils decreases organic P by creating more favorable environment for microbial attacck and probably also by increasing the solubility and thus the accessibility of some diesters. In soils that are only slightly acid liming has no signifficant effect and in some calcerous soils organic P rises with calcium carbonate content (Anderson, 1980). AL-P level also was higher in calcareous soils though it is generally accepted that acid extractants are more appropriate for acid soils. The simillar results were reported by Lončarić (2007) and Kovačević (1992) who found that in such cases fertilization effects could fail. Significant correlations in acid soils were determined between AL-P and total P(r=0,774; n=20) (figure 2). Also, significant correlations between the same soil properties were determined in calcareous soils, (r=0,765; n=20). acid soils R2 = 0,6003 (n=40) 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 1400 1600 1800 2000 2200 2400 2600 total H2SO4 P (mg/kg) A L -P ( m g /k g ) Figure 2. AL-P and sulphuric acid extractable (total) P correlation in acid soils Furthermore determinated portion of organic P in total P was higher in calcareous soils (mean 17,89 %) than the portion of AL-P (mean 9,39 %) but opposite results were determined in acid soils (the portion of AL-P in total P was 8,04 %, the portion of organic P was 5,82 %). Avalilability of the forms of P in soils has come largely from chemical fractionation based on the ability of selective chemical reagens to solubilize discrete types of inorganic P compounds. However, major disadvantage is that some of inorganic P is derived form the soil organic P (Borie and Rubio, 2003). Regession analyses using organic P as dependent variable and humus content and total P as independent varibles confirmed statistically very significant soil properties impact on organic P level (r= 0,88). Therefore, describing the relationships between the soil P forms and soil properties developed equations were: organic P (mg kg-1) = -20,1364 x humus + 0,070563 x total P for acid soils and organic P (mg kg-1) = 32,71208 x humus + 0,119117 x total P for calcareous soils. Using these equations the organic P prediction error was 9,68 % in acid soils and 15,22 % in calcareous soils.</p><p id="Pg596">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1990 Conclusions The total P was similar in acid and calcareous soils, but determinated level of organic P in calcareous soils was higher (280,54 mg kg-1 in average) than in acid soils (97,88 mg kg-1 in average) because of different conditions for microbiological activity. Significant correlations were determined between AL-P and total P (r=0,774) in acid soils and in calcerous soils (r=0,765). Furthermore, there was strong multiple regression realtionship (r= 0,88) between humus content, organic P, total P resulting with equations: organic P = -20,1364 x humus + 0,070563 x total P for acid soils and organic P = 32,71208 x humus + 0,119117 x total P for calcareous soils. Using these equations the organic P prediction error was 9,68 % in acid soils and 15,22 % in calcareous soils. Analitycal determination of total P in order to predict organic P can be usefull as additional soil data for decreasing rate of phosphorus fertilizers and low fertilization rates lead to decreased hazards of ground water pollution.

Abstract: The objective of our research was to examine the volume of the private capital and the differences between the combinations of the private capital according to regions, to enterprising models and to production trends between 2002 and 2004. Also our aim was to examine the relationship between the private capital and the profit and within that in differently sized models (SGM and agricultural land) in the examined period of time. We analysed the problem with a regression analysis. On making the calculations we have used the database of the agricultural test unit’s information system run by the Agricultural Research Institute. Keywords: self-financed, agricultural enterprise, own capital Introduction The performance of the Hungarian agriculture has significantly dropped after the change of regime and market orientation and its current performance on most areas stays also below the potential level that could be reached due to Hungary’s favorable natural conditions. One tool of increasing the performance is to provide the proper level of financial resources, which is important for all business establishment for the continuous running. Providing the sector with an appropriate level of capital and credit is an essential condition for the Hungarian agriculture to be competitive and market oriented. Those factors that determine the agricultural financing have specific characteristics. Most of the capital required in the agriculture is locked for a long run and used not only in one period of time. The equity capital is a part of the company’s capital, which is not to be repaid. It can come both from external and internal resources: from the registered capital, from the retained profit, from state support, and it can be increased by issuing new shares, increasing the registered capital, fusing with another company or by an acquisition. The bigger the rate of the company’s equity capital is, the bigger financial independence it has. A significant rate of the equity capital makes the company more resistant to a crisis. As it is the private property which is reduced in case of a loss, the company can more easily cope with temporary difficulties if the rate of the equity capital is high. The primary private resource is the called-up share (that can be increased with additional external capital or with other financial contribution), which is increased in every year by the retained profit. The agricultural enterprises are established with a low level of capital and usually they are not able to raise this level considerably. Self-financing means that the company’s developments are financed from the company’s own (private) resources. Due to the characteristics of rural economy, the ability of self financing is very low among the agricultural enterprises. The objective of our research was to examine the volume of the private capital and the differences between the combinations of the private capital according to regions and to enterprising models between 2002 and 2004. On making the calculations we have used the database</p><p id="Pg598">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1992 of the agricultural test unit’s information system run by the Agricultural Research Institute. Materials and methods On analysing the financial circumstances and the credit structure of the agricultural enterprises based on the partnership tax returns collected by the State Tax Authority (APEH), we worked using the database created the Agricultural Research Institute (ARI), the facts and figures of the Hungarian National Bank and also the financial data of several enterprises processed by the CSO. We based our analysis on the test farm system data collected by the ARI (Agricultural Research Institute) and within that we used the figures of three years. The combination of the sample’s elements according to years and types of enterprising models can be found in Table 1. Currently the test farm system represents more than 90000 farms. The figures of the farms in the sample we used had been weighted before we made the analysis.

The number of organizations operating in the agriculture, game economy, sylviculture, and in the fishery between 1995 and 2003 increased by more than 50 percent, and within that there is an increase of 57 percent among the joint ventures and an increase of 50 percent among the individual enterprises. The highest increase was experienced among those joint ventures without a legal personality; an increase of 70 percent was registered. On examining the ratio of the joint enterprises operating in the agriculture, game economy, sylviculture, and in the fishery it turns out that they have a proportion of 3-3,5 percent within the national economy. On examining the specific types of the enterprising models one by one, it can be said that the proportion of the limited liability companies is 3,4-3,7 percent, the proportion of the share companies increased from 6,2 to 8,5 percent, the rate of the deposit companies decreased from 2,3 to 2,2 percent and the rate of the co-operatives decreased from 31 to 28,3 percent between 1999 and 2004. The influx of the foreign capital increased in the 90’s, but even today it is not significant in the agriculture. If we take the foreign capital flowed in, it can be said that in 2001 and 2002 the 3,2-3,3 percent of the foreign enterprises in the national economy operated in the agriculture. The income conditions of the agricultural enterprises It is the characteristic of agriculture that it has a smaller profitability than other sectors, and the return of the capital is slower and due to the natural conditions it is more risky.</p><p id="Pg599">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1993 From 1994 to 2003 the rate of the equity capital within the total capital decreased from 70 to 50 percent. On the other part of the Figure 1 we can see the volume of the equity capital in the recent years and also its combination.

The profitability of the equity capital improved until 1995, that of the total capital improved until 1997. From 1997 the profitability shows a decreasing tendency and the operation of the equity capital has also showed a deficit until 1999, this improved from 2000. A tendency similar to the profitability of the total capital can be seen. In 2002 a value of 4-5 percent was registered, which is a significant improvement comparing to the value of –2 percent in 1999, but according to my calculations the profitability of the equity capital will be also negative by 2003 with a value of –2,1 percent. –3,00 –2,00 –1,00 0,00 1,00 2,00 3,00 4,00 5,00 6,00 1999 2000 2001 2002 Years % Agriculture , game economy Agriculture, game economy, sylviculture, fis hery Together Figure 2: The profitability of the equity capital in the enterprises having double-entry book-keeping Source: Own edition based on the figures of the financial figures of the companies from 1999 to 2000 (2004) Budapest, CSO</p><p id="Pg600">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

The WesternTransdanubia was in the first position with 578,65 thousand HUF per hectares and the Central-Transdanubia was on the seventh position. The difference between the first and the last region is 254 thousand HUF per hectares in 2002. I examined, these differents are in 2003 and 2004. The results are 234 thousand HUF per hectare in 2003 and 345 thousand HUF per hectare in 2004. A change was observed in the ranking between 2002 and 2004. It means, in the first was Western-Transdanubia with 811.94 thousand HUF per hectare own capital in 2004, too and the Central-Hungary was pushed back to the second position. In the last positions are North-Hungary and Central-Hungary. The biggest increasing has happened in the own capital per hectare at the Central-Hungary individual enterprises (90.2%). We examined, own capital per hectares at the joint enterprises, but the result was deformed because of low number of the sample. 0 200 400 600 800 1000 2002 2003 2004 Years O w n c a p it a l p e r h e c ta re s (T h o u sa n d H U F /h a ) Central-Hungary Central-Transdanubia Western-Transdanubia South-Transdanubia North-Hungary North Great Plain South Great Plain Total Figure 3: Own capital per hectare at the individual enterprises. Source: Own calculation Conclusions We examined the enterprises not only according to the type of enterprising model but also according to size category and field of activity. The average value of the equity capital’s profitability was the lowest in 2003, as that was the worst year of the near past in the agricultural production. About 2004 we could draw a clear conclusion, that in parallel with the increase of the size categories the profitability of the equity capital shows also an increasing tendency. In the other two years (2002 and 2003) the individual enterprises having less than 15 hectares reached a higher level of profitability, than the one belonging to the group one higher. All in all it can be said that 2003 was an outstandingly bad year, as the individual enterprises reached only the half of the equity capital’s profitability, but in 2002 and 2004 this examined value was about 5 percent. We can also conclude – based on the figures and facts from the FADN – that the profitability of the agricultural enterprises does not depend on the rate of the own capital but the type of activity is determining rather the profit generating capabilities.

The amount of savings is largely influenced by the aggressive marketing activities of the banks and by governmental regulations like the interest tax since September 2006. We started our research with the concept of savings that have been analysed by many well-known economists during the last decades. In the 80’s the net financial savings of the households were practically zero and at the end of the 80’s it became negative. Nowadays 14 percent of the households have their savings in short term debits and this is still the most popular form in Hungary. The interest towards other instruments of investments –shares, shares based investment funds, other funds and bonds – is still lower and the rate of the ones using pension funds is 8 percent. Keywords: saving, household, investment Introduction „If one splends less than his/her income it is a saving, on the other hand if he/she spends more it is over spending.” [Kohn, 1998] Savings can occure in several ways while from the banks point of view they are crucially needed for being support for credits. Why are credits important? Why cannot we shight credits as an outside source? What kind of relation does it show with the trends of the savings? Materials and methods In one’s life there are different aims for distributing income. This is the target of many saving theories of economics. According to Keynes (1936) the consumption is depended on the current income and there is not over spending and consumption in advance. The analysis of consumption and saving is inseparable while the saving is nothing else but retained future consumption. [Tóth –Árvai, 2001] According to the TÁRKI survey in 1998 40-50% of the households had savings and 2840% had debts. What does the saving willingness and debt taking depend on? [Samuelson-Nordhaus, 1993]  Income conditions  Future income conditions  What motivating influences the future consumption brought to present mean for the person According to the survey made by Tóth I. János and Árvai Zsuzsanna in September 2000 if the people got 1 million HUF 53,4% of them would spend it on making their homes</p><p id="Pg602">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1996 better, 37.5% would save the unexpected income and only 17.4% would think about paying their debt back. The saving willingness nowadays does not only depend on the above mentioned factors, but it is also influenced by the level of the financial culture. The chairman of the Az Öngondoskodás Alapítvány (Self-care Foundation) is on the opinion that this level in Hungary is low. According to the statement of Ottó Gecser most of us live for today. We care only a little about our future safety, many times we do not plan the ahead and the future oriented aspect is missing. Based on the survey of the Foundation only 6% of the Hungarians understand the information in the media about the economy, 41% has got a hint and 28% hardly anything. Most of them knows the concept of shares and state bonds (44-47%) and the investment funds are known only by 27%. [Világgazdaság, 2006.okt.] Results and discussion Analysing the net financial assets on Figure 1 we can see that in 2001-2002 this factor has slightly increased compared to the previous years. From 2001 to 2002 the net financial asset has increased by 8.5% and from 2002 to 2003 it increased by 2.6% compared to the previous year, which is caused by the high debt ratio. From 2001 to 2002 the debt ratio of the households has increased by 67.8% and it was growing remarkably the next year (62.3%) as well, meanwhile the asset ratio has not increased that much. The debt ratio growth was the highest between 1999 and 2003. The net financial asset growth got below 10% from 2005 to 2006 caused by the strict changes in the regulations. 0 5 000 10 000 15 000 20 000 25 000 19 90 19 91 1 99 2 1 993 19 94 199 5 1 996 19 97 199 8 1 99 9 2 000 20 01 200 2 2 003 20 04 200 5 2 006 20 07 I .

The correlation coefficient is 0.964, so that we can state that the function interlocation is close and the same can be stated about the HUF and foreign currency debits trend line. The yearly growth of the HUF debits is 100,02 million HUF, while in case of the foreign currency debits it is 43,214 million HUF. Popular investment forms The majority has trust continuously in the low-risk investments. The ratio of those who invest in short-term debits has decreased in West-Europe from 47% to 39% which is the lowest for years. As the opposite the ratio of ones holding their savings in bonds has increased from 7% to 13%. In Hungary the ratio of people using none of the forms analysed in the research is 76% which is higher than the average in the CEE-countries. (They might have no financial savings or keep it in cash) We have to remark that this ratio is lower than the one observed in 2006 (81%).</p><p id="Pg604">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1998 The ratio of ones having their saving sin short-term debits is 14% and it is the most popular in Hungary. The ratio of the life insurance investments is the same as the previous time period (11%) The ratio of the other investment forms – shares, sharebased investment funds, other funds and bonds – is still low, and the pension-funds comprise unchanged 8%. In Hungary the ratio of investment kept in shares is not too high, caused partly by the decreasing exchange rates and by the fact that the Hungarian investors prefer the shortterm investment forms. The lack of financial knowledge and the level of the financial culture also strengthen this trend. Time needs to change the approach. Conclusions By analysing the saving forms we can observe huge differences in different years. In the 80s the savings showed low level that was connected to the increasing inflation and the deterioration state of the economy. The domestic inhabitants wanted to have real assets rather than bank investments. In 1998 40-50% of the households had savings. The cash ratio in the analysed time period was the highest in 1990 comprising 19.3% of the total assets that decreased to 8.4% by now. The HUF deposit ratio in 1992 (35.6%), the foreign currency ratio in 1995 (13.5%) was the highest. We can observe continuous decrease in HUF debits. In 2007 it did not reach 24%. In the first quarter of 2007 the savings of the households comprised 35.1% in shares, business shares and investment coupons, 23.6% in HUF debits and 18.6% in insurance safety reserves. The linear trend of the cash balance reserve at households in the analysed time period shows that it has been increased by 318,99 million HUF annually between 1990 and 2007. The yearly growth of the HUF debits is 100,02 million HUF, while in case of the foreign currency debits it is 43,214 million HUF. References Paul A. Samelson, William D.

With the aid of these two factors and their ratio we clustered the member states based on their deviation’s degree and direction from EU standards. Keywords: subsidies, economic size, income, FADN, European Union Introduction Agricultural production belongs under a common European Union regulation within the CAP frameworks, the Common Agricultural Policy. Currently the main ongoing aim of the CAP is the common and comprehensive regulation of the agricultural markets. The following methods are used in order to regulate and influence production, incomes and markets: protection against competition, set prices, subsidies on exports, intervention, subsidies for processing, subsidies for production, direct subsidies for producers, encouraging self-regulation, direct interventions for decreasing production, indirect interventions for decreasing production.(Borszéki, 2003; Borszéki, 2007; Belovecz, M. – Czárl, A., 2006) It must be examined the role of subsidies in connection with the level of mechanisation and farm sizes, it can be stated that the efficiency of technical development in medium sized farms is higher than in small size farms. (Baranyai – Takács, 2007b) The type and volume of the subsidies was continuously evolving over the years. Differences are noticeable in the volume of subsidies adjusted to economic size, which varies by member states. Materials and methods The research was based on secondary statistic data that stemmed from the database of the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). The research focused on the subsidies and income data of the specialist filed crops of the EU 25 (without Luxemburg) for the year 2005 in six size categories. [(1) 0 - &lt;4 ESU, (2) 4 - &lt;8 ESU, (3) 8 - &lt;16 ESU, (4) 16 - &lt;40 ESU, (5) 40 - &lt;100 ESU, (6) &gt;= 100 ESU, Total (Ec Size cl (6))]. We used the European Size Unit (ESU) scale in order to define economic size. 1 ESU is €1200 based on the Standard Gross Margin an economy can achieve. (Keszthelyi, 2003). The subsidization data of the sector was calculated without counting investment (Total subsidies - excluding on investments), because that type of subsidy has no direct effect on the yearly outcome. When using income data, we used the Gross Farm Income that includes the value of amortization. Results and discussion The volume of subsidy per one hectare shows variation depending on economic size and member state. It can be observed generally that the bigger the economic size the bigger the subsidy per hectare is. The smallest size category (&lt;4 ESU) does not exist in most member states</p><p id="Pg606">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 2000 and does not receive subsidies. This indicates well the EU concentrations plans regarding economic size, which is the abolishment of small ESU farms. The ESU size is the most common between the ranges of 8 to 100 ESU. In the case of the newly joint states, subsidies per hectare are lower than in the case of Hungary (especially in large ESU categories).

We calculated this index as the quotient of subsidy per one hectare and gross income per one hectare. If the index is bigger than one it means that the whole of the income is generated by the subsidy. The smaller index, the smaller ratio of the income is generated by the subsidy. We observed it based on these data that in spite of most of the other newly joint states receive smaller subsidies per hectare than Hungary, the utilization of those subsidies is more efficient, because their income comprises subsidies at a lower ratio compared to Hungary.</p><p id="Pg607">VII.

In the countries of the second quarter (CZE, ESP, EST, FRE, HUN, LTU, LVA, SUO, SVE, SVK, POR, UKI) income is below EU standard however subsidy ratio in the income exceeds EU standards. It is only Poland in the third quarter with both income and subsidy ratio below EU average.

This is the case for cohesion states and for the newly admitted middle-east European countries. The previous subsidies that were incentives to enhance production will give place to subsidies that enhance the financial status of the farmers. As a consequence of this, soil quality will cease to have a significance influence on the volume of subsidy awarded to the farmers. It is the long term interests of the European agriculture to simultaneously increase income whilst decreasing the weight of subsidies. This highlights the vitality of concentration and projects the general predominance of size efficiency.

All these changes have influenced the agriculture as well. During these fifteen years the role of traditional agriculture within national economy has shown a downward tendency. Changes, experienced in the field of the economic structure resulted in the reduction of the rate of agricultural employees; a tendency that is equivalent with the process experienced within the European Union. The aim of maintaining the development put emphasis on the increase of agricultural intensity, which yields the decline of agricultural employment. Given the fact that agricultural employment has an important role not just in agricultural commodity production but in the local maintenance of the population as well, the decrease of agricultural employment seriously affected rural inhabitants. In some regions, agriculture is the sole possible source of employment. In the presentation I examine agricultural employment in the Hungarian regions, the divergences between the regions and finally, with the consideration of regional migration potentials, I study the tendencies in the agriculture of the European Union. Keywords: regional policy, European Union, urbanization, sustainability, rural areas Introduction The economic-social changes of the 1990ies have introduced a series of changes in the structure of the agricultural employment. The regional dimension and role of the largescale structure, which had dominated the period before the change of the regime, decreased to a great extent, while numerous smoothly working integration relationships between small- scale farmings ended. (Baranyai, Takács 2007) The numbers of agricultural employees employed by the remaining and transformed economic organisations are decreasing annually. On the other side of the agricultural production, the individual small farms – the number of which also lessen – have gained determining importance. These individual estates, on which many people from the rural areas depended, formed the basis of the labour market of the sector. (Tóth 2000; TakácsGyörgy 1994) Therefore, rural areas together with rural inhabitants arrived at a disadvantaged situation. The weakening national- economic role of Hungarian agriculture is to a large extent similar to the tendencies within the European Union. In the 1950ies agriculture was considered to be a significant sector in Western Europe. After the World War II governments supported the increase of agricultural production. Due to diverse reforms introduced by the common agricultural policy in the 1990ies the sector provided a secure job for the farmers. On the other hand, the agricultural sector experienced a series of changes. Though the European Union was continuously growing, as a consequence of the renewal, the number of farms decreased within three decades. (Takács 2005) While the number of farms below 5 hectares considerably diminished, that of the farms with a territory of 50 hectares or above was gradually increasing. Nearly all member- states of the Union went through the decrease containing countries with the most significant agricultural sectors like Greece and Portugal as well. (Rómától Athénig 2004) The ten joining countries joined this tendency. The decreasing</p><p id="Pg610">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 2004 ratio of agricultural employees also indicates the weakening role of agriculture. Due to the economic modernization introduced within the EU labour first flew to the industrial then to the service sector. By the end of the 20th century maintenance became an essential goal in agriculture, (Várallyay 2007; Husti 2006) though its social aspect, concerning agricultural employment, gained minor importance. The aim of the research is to analyze the changing of the agricultural population in the Hungarian regions. Materials and methods For data collection I have used the database of the Central Statistical Office (in Hungary) and that of the Ministry of Employment, as well as other publications about the topic. I make a chronological research about peculiar indexes of agriculture such as the ratio of agricultural employees within the national economy, the changes concerning provided land and labour density between 1990 and 2006, calculating division ratio. Results and discussion Economic activity of the population varies in different regions of the country. In 2006 Central Hungary and Central and Western Transdanubia had the highest employment rate regarding the population between the 15 to 74 age groups, while the ratio in other regions left well behind the national rate. This type of difference in the economic activity develops during the course of a longer period. Employment has seen significant changes since the change of the regime. Economic recession yields a decrease in employment as well, but it started again a growing tendency after the recovery of the economy. Together with these changes, employment structure also went through a changing process which resulted in the appearance of regional differences. While the number of people working in the industrial and service sectors increased, that of agricultural employees diminished. In 2006 more than half of the Hungarian employees worked in the service sector, whereas, one quarter was employed by the industry. The rate of agricultural employees was the highest in South Transdanubia and in the Northern and Southern part of the Hungarian Great Plain. In the period of the change of the regime agricultural employment rate was well over 14%, which number is continuously decreasing even today. Although this process corresponds to tendencies going on in countries with developed market economy, in Hungary, given the central role of agricultural employment in rural economy, it resulted in serious social tension. The proportion of agricultural employees show significant regional differences, where the higher employment rate is provided mainly by the Southern areas. The population is dependent on agricultural production since 20% of people of the active age do some kind of agricultural activity. Regional diversities are highly significant in this respect. The population is much dependent on agriculture like in counties Bács-Kiskun in the Southern and in Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg in the Northern part of the Hungarian Great Plain as well as in Somogy in the Transdanubia. The extent to which the change in the employment structure influences the regions is very different. The territory per capita is much larger in the case of major agricultural factories than in the case of smaller farms. Therefore, further employees would be discharged as a result of the prospective</p><p id="Pg611">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 2005 industrial concentration. (Kapronczai 2002) Besides the decrease of the nationaleconomic role of agriculture other factors also played an important role in the lessen number of agricultural employees. The number of registered full-time employees diminished, whereas previously registered employees continued their agricultural activity as a secondary occupation. Given the fact that black economy is present in agriculture as well, a distinction has to be made between the number and ratio of agricultural employees with agricultural income, working in agricultural farms and that of agricultural employees indicated by labour employment statistics. For the description of agricultural employment I have used data gained from regional and county indexes regarding the percentage of agricultural employment, provided land and labour density. I have realized the most significant differences in the percentage of agricultural employment in view of both regional and county level. In spite of the decrease of agricultural employment, South-Transdanubia and the Southern and Northern part of the Hungarian Great Plain remained significant regions, whereas, the latter mentioned areas produced the highest rate of people moving to the city since agriculture was continuously becoming a less secure means of subsistence. The index of provided land and labour density demonstrate a moderate difference as opposed to agricultural employment. We can establish that due to the decrease in the percentage of the agricultural employment the index of the provided land increase and the agricultural territory per capita is the largest in the North-Hungarian region.

Conclusions Agriculture plays a determinant role not just in the Southern part of the country, which is more suitable for agricultural cultivation, but also in the social life of more peripheral backward areas, where it is the single means of subsistence. The reason behind this fact is that agriculture offers a significant source of supplementary income and provides the only financial solution to undereducated social classes. In these regions the social function of agriculture prevails. Even today agricultural activity plays an important role</p><p id="Pg612">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 2006 in employment. In the Hungarian agricultural employment there exists a significant relationship between living- labour and exacting work, which helps to improve the maintenance of rural inhabitants. At the same time, employment differences highly influence the migration of the population who are looking for better opportunities to work, higher average wages and better living conditions. For this purpose people might change their original job as well. Inland migration has recently shown a moderately growing tendency in Hungary. The main destination of the migration is the central area of the country and the Northern and Western territories of the Transdanubia, where the industrial and the service sectors are the most saturated. Central-Hungary and the Northern- and Western regions of the Transdanubia have gained a migration profit while a removal migration was characteristic to the other regions. Although, the mobility of workforce is essential for the economic competitively, it is restricted by the regional differences appearing in the wages and property prizes. On the other hand, it is necessary to prevent the population from migration so as to avoid the depopulation of the settlements and to preserve provincial land as well as natural values.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 2007 QUANTIFICATION OF SOIL ORGANIC MATTER DEGRADATION BY ROCK-EVAL PYROLYSIS Tünde NYILAS 1 – Tivadar M. TÓTH 1 – Magdolna HETÉNYI 1 1 Department of Mineralogy Geochemistry and Petrology, University of Szeged, P.O.Box 651, Hungary e-mail: nyilas@gmail.com Abstract: Rock-Eval (RE) pyrolysis was designed for petroleum exploration to determine the type and quality of organic matter in rock samples. It is a quick and effective tool for evaluating the amount and properties of the organic matter. Nevertheless, this technique can be used for bulk characterization of the immature organic matter in soil samples and recent sediments. The aim of our work was to present new fields of application of the RE pyrolysis for assessing the proportion of the organic components of different thermal stabilities, and also to apply this method for characterization of organic matter dynamics in soil profiles. Keywords: soil organic matter (SOM), Rock-Eval program, soil-plant interrelations Introduction The geological organic matter is present in the atmosphere, in the water, in the soil, in the recent sediments and in the rocks equally. Organic matter of sediment rocks ( is studied comprehensively, but we have less knowledge from geochemical of organic matter in soils and recent sediment, although it should be justified because of mass and the important role in the global carbon cycle. SOM plays a significant role in the CO2 content of atmosphere and in controling of global earth temperature (Várallyay, 2007). Wearing-away of rocks and pedogenesis processes are influenced by SOM. Adsorption characteristic of organic matter in soils and recent sediments determine the mobility of organic and inorganic pollution thus effects the quality of water in surface and groundwater. (Velisková, 2006, Štekauerová et al., 2006). SOM is not homogenous but is a mixture of many organic matters with different chemical compositions and physical qualities. This chemically and kinetically heterogeneous material comprises a mixture of plant and microbial residues of various compositions and with different decomposition rates, as well as their transformation products, in addition to refractory, long-residence-time macromolecular organic substances (kerogen, black carbon). Humification of biopolymers is determined by those environmental parameters (relief, climatic conditions), which define soil types too (Madari et al., 1997, 1998). Materials and methods Samples were collected from the A and B horizons of chernozem soils, covered with different vegetation, from West-Hungary: soil developed under turkey oak forest and a cultivated (corn) soil and intermittently water-covered gleysols from East-Hungary. We analyzed buried paleosoil samples from North-Eastern Hungary as well. Rock Eval pyrolysis The Rock Eval data of the soil samples were determined with Delsi Oil Show Analyzer (Hetényi et al., 2005). The following parameters can be obtained from one single measurement: S1 amount of thermovaporized free hydrocarbons - present in the rock as</p><p id="Pg614">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 2008 free or adsorbed compounds - expressed in mg HC/g of rock. S2 the current potential of a rock sample, represents the total amount of oil and gas a source rock can still produce during subsequent complete thermal maturation in an open system. (expressed in mg HC/g of rock). Tmax the temperature ( oC) which is recorded for the maximum of the S2 peak varies as a function of the thermal maturity of the organic matter. TOC (total organic carbon) content (expressed in weight %) is defined as the sum of the pyrolysed organic carbon content and organic carbon residue content. HI (hydrogen index) is defined as carbon normalized S2 and expressed in mg HC/gTOC. PI (production index) S1/S1+S2. The experimental conditions of Rock-Eval pyrolysis were chosen that all of the hydrocarbonaceous compounds yielded by soil organic matter are recorded as one single peak. Mathematical deconvolution In an immature organic matter, like soil, a wide range of components may be present simultaneously and each of them is represented by a Gaussian curve on the pyrogram (S2 peak) with characteristic mean (M) and standard deviation () values. Each pyrogram is a complicated overlap of several normal distributions curves. In order to define discrete components of the multicomponent mixture, the pyrogram has to be decomposed mathematically. The well-known normal distribution curve is symmetric to the mean having one inflexion point on each side. A composite curve, may exhibit complicated shape with several inflexion points along it. It can be assumed, that in case of this special class of composite curves a mean value of at least one component falls within the interval of the two smallest inflexion points. This feature was utilized during the recursive decomposition algorithm applied in the project. The first step is smoothing the originally rough pyrogram using moving average method. Moving the window and calculating the means over the whole temperature range result in a smooth data distribution of equal density. After several loops a 5ºC interval was found large enough to get pyrogram without unrealistic peaks and ditches. In the second step of the procedure numerical derivation was fulfilled twice to get the inflexion points of the smoothed composite curve. Without using an effective smoothing algorithm, there is no chance to get inflexions of real meaning. Afterwards, the two smallest inflexion points (Ti,1, Ti,2) were chosen, which surround the mean (Mi) in question. In the next step a two-dimensional search of (Mi, i) was carried out using a Monte Carlo type simulation by computing numerous data pairs so that Mi  (Ti,1, Ti,2), and (1) i  (1/(S2Ti,1 )2 ,), (1/(S2Ti,2 )2 ,), (2) where S2Ti,j denotes S2 values at Ti,j temperatures. Finally, each (Mi, i) pair was used for calculating model S2 curves, and a least square best-fit algorithm is applied to get the best Mi and i among them. Best model curve is determined when ε is minimized so that ε=Σ(S2observed – S2calculated) 2, (3) where summation goes from 180C up to Ti,1 in each case.</p><p id="Pg615">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 2009 After subtracting the model curve from the original S2 composite curve, the process was repeated recursively to the residuum from the second step (numerical derivation) (Hetényi et al., 2005). Pyrograms of our samples can be described by a combination of four elementary Gaussian components: F1, F2, F3 and F4. These four components are related to major classes of organic constituents differing in origin and their resistance to pyrolysis: labile biological constituents (F1), resistant biological constituents (F2), immature non-biotic constituents (F3) and a mature refractory fraction (F4). F1/F2 ratio illustrate the relative evolution of the two ’”bio-macromolecule” classes. The log[(F1+F2)/F3] index quantify the degradation of immature OM (Disnar et al., 2003). We use a modified application of Rock-Eval pyrolysis approach for estimating the proportion of the components with different thermal stability and the measure of humification. On a pyrogram each unique organic matter is represented by a normal distribution curve with characteristic mean and standard deviation. As a consequence, a pyrogram is a sum of numerous single Gauss curves what can be decomposed using a proper algorithm. In order to calculate possible composite curves, first the uncertainty of mean and standard deviation of RE measurement was determined by 20 independent runs. On this basis using a Monte Carlo type simulation 1000 different realizations were calculated. The envelope of all these curves defines the stripe what is the typical “fingerprint” of the SOM in question. Results and discussion Tmax values of approximated Gauss curves belong three category: original biopolymers (180-340oC), partially docomposed biopolymers (340-420oC), humic substances (420600oC). Calculated values are in accord with measured series of stepwise Rock-Eval analyses. Consequently, we can estimating the poportion of original biopolymers well. a) b) Figure 1. a) Steps of SOM “fingerprint” analysis. b) RE curves in a paleosoil profile</p><p id="Pg616">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

We accepted that the unknown sample belongs into the specified soil type if it’s pyrogram concide 90% with the soil type's envelope (Fig.1 a). This method should be suitable for define soil type of „unknown” samples. Rock-Eval pyrolysis is useable new method for determination paleosoil type, supplements the routinish classical measurement methods. In the course of known type paleosoil pyrolysis can provide new details according to the former details. Rock-Eval pyrolysis is capable define parameters, which help determination of unknown paleosoil type and allow identify minor occurences within genetical horizons (Fig.1 b). Statistical evaluation of details assists the complex explanation of the measured values, accordingly determination of paleosoil type. Conclusions Rock-Eval pirolysys proved to be suitable for efficient examination of soil organic matter and estimation the measurement of humification. Further advantages, slight sample need to measure (0.1g), doesn’t require preparation (if the sample is carbonatefree), fast measure (25min.), and we can detect six parameters from one single measurement (S1, S2, TPI , TOC, Tmax, HI) which we can use perfectly in evaluations. We can escape the lengthy and many chemicals requiring laboratory separates. The above-mentioned method give us excess-informations compared to traditional organic matter measure. The method is suitable to detect minor episodes within genetical horizons and usable to examination of recent and paleosoil samples.

PÉLI 1 – Edit ÖTVÖS 2 – Anita JUHÁSZ 2 – Zsuzsanna BENKŐ 2 1 Plant Ecology Research Group of Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Szent István University, H-2103 Gödöllő Páter u. 1. e-mail: Peli.Evelin@mkk.szie.hu 2 Institute of Botany and Ecophysiology, Faculty of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Szent István University Abstract : In this paper we present results of heavy metal content investigation of mosses growing under elevated air CO2 level in Open Top Chambers (OTC) and around natural CO2 vents. Five moss species were collected near to natural CO2 source (about 700-1000 ppm) in “Slovenske gorice” (Slovenia), in Laiatico (Italy) and from control sites, where CO2 concentration was measured 350 ppm. The moss species were transplanted in OTC chambers, where CO2 concentration was maintained at 700 ppm. Control moss species were grown under 360 ppm CO2 level. As the production increased, heavy metal concentration decreased in eleven moss species. As a consequence it can be concluded that in the future, the increased air CO2 concentrations can strongly influence the element contents in mosses, as heavy metal concentrations can be relatively decreased and “diluted” because of the increased dry matter production. Keywords: heavy metals, C and N content, elevated air CO2 concentration Introduction: Atmospheric CO2 concentration is estimated to double by the middle of the next century. The CO2, being the key substrate of photosynthesis, most of the research targets assimilation and primary production under the predicted circumtances (Drake et al., 1997). The increasing concentrations of air CO2 might be expected to have substantial impacts on plants and vegetation through changes caused to photosynthesis and other physiological processes leading to an increased dry matter production (Kimball, 1983). The dry matter accumulation is strongly influenced by the accumulation of carbohydrates (soluble sugars and starch), which display various pattern both at present day and elevated air CO2 concentrations (Maróti et al., 1984; Tuba et al, 1996). In flower plants under elevated air CO2 concentrations the mean concentrations of elements tend to be lower than at the present day air CO2 concentrations (Overdick, 1993). Terricolous (soil covering) mosses and lichens buffer and preserve the soil moisture and element content (Pócs et al., 1987). Although bryophytes and lichens are used to biomonitor aerial dispersion of heavy metals (Rühling et al., 1987; Ötvös et al., 2003; Tuba and Csintalan, 1993) and other environmental factors, like lack of water water supply, UV-B radiation etc. (Sass et al., 1996; Takács et al., 1999) there is very little information about effects of elevated CO2 concentration on heavy metal accumulation in mosses and lichens (Tuba et al., 1999). Therefore the question arises whether the future elevated air CO2 concentrations can influence the heavy metal bioindication value and role of the mosses. Materials and Methods Three moss species were collected near to natural CO2 spring (about 700-1000 ppm) in “Slovenske gorice” (Slovenia), and from control sites (around 350 ppm). Alnus glutinosa, Quercus robur and Picea abies were dominant at this sampling site (similar</p><p id="Pg618">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 2012 site as described by Kaligaric, 2001). In Italy two moss species were sampled near to natural CO2 vent (about 700 ppm) in Laiatico and the control plants were collected at the site with about 350 ppm CO2 concentration (Raschi et al., 1997). Tortula ruralis was collected in Festuca vaginata temperate semidesert grassland near Fülöpháza, Hungary. Species of Polytrichum formosum with its substrat was sampled in Picea abies forest, at an atlantic site near to Vielsalm, Belgium. Eight moss species were collected in Black Forest region of Germany, at Bad Herrenalb in mixed decious and evergreen forests. The elevated CO2 exposure experiments of Hungarian and German samples were carried out in the Global Climate Change and Plant Experimental Station at Gödöllő (Botanical Garden of the Inst. of Botany and Ecophysiology, Szent István University of Gödöllő), 28 km east of Budapest. Moss cushions and lichen thalli with their original soil substrates were transplanted into boxes placed in two special open top chambers (OTCs) (see Tuba et al., 2001). The chambers used and the air CO2 concentrations in the elevated CO2 OTC (700 ppm) and present-day CO2 (360 ppm) chambers were maintained as described by Tuba et al. 2001. Mosses were sprayed every morning with deionised water. Sensors recorded essentially identical irradiance and temperature conditions in the two OTCs. Exposure of material to ambient and elevated CO2 concentrations was 2-5,5 months. Polytrichum sample in Belgium was transplanted in OTC chambers in Vielsalm and was exposed for 10 months, in similar condition to Gödöllő, as mentioned above. To determine 8 (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, V, Zn) heavy metal concentrations, the photosynthetically active, upper green parts of the moss shoots were used for the analysis without washing. After drying at 70 C, 0.2 g of moss was digested with 2 ml of concentrated nitric acid and with 2 ml of concentrated hydrogen peroxide under pressure in Teflon bombs for 45 min at 130 C. The clear solution was diluted to 10 ml with bi-distilled water and analyzed by ICP-AES (Thermo Jarrel Ash, ICAP 9000, Franklin, MA, USA) (Ötvös et al., 2003). Carbon and nitrogen determination was made according to Dumas combustion method (NA 155 analyser). All measurements were done in 3 independent repetitions. Result and discussion Table 1.

In most mosses measured at elevated CO2 level in OTCs, the heavy metal content decreased compared to controls in cases of Cd (in 10 samples among 10 species), Cr (in 8 samples among 10 species), Cu (in 7 samples), Fe (in 10 samples), Ni (in 9 samples), Pb (in 8 samples), V (in 9 samples) and Zn (in 8 samples). The C content increased in 8 cases among 13 mosses growing at elevated CO2 level; the N content increased in 7 samples. Pleurozium schreberi was collected at natural CO2 vent and was grown in OTC’s, as well. While its heavy metal and C contents decreased in plants growing at natural spring compared to the control plants, in the plants growing in OTC’s the heavy metal and carbon content were increased. The pattern of the changes of heavy metal and carbon concentrations was similar in the case of Polytrichum formosum species grown in OTC’s and at natural CO2 springs. Heavy metal and carbon contents decreased in all 3 samples of species Polytrichum formosum. Conclusions In general, it can be stated, that mosses growing in OTCs at elevated air CO2 concentration have higher carbon content than their controls. It indicates that CO2 assimilation rate increased in mosses growing at elevated CO2 concentration compared to controls. This is directly confirmed by the net CO2 assimilation rate measurements</p><p id="Pg620">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 2014 (Csintalan et al., 2005). As a consequence the total dry matter mass will also be increased, which in turn will enhance the moss and lichen soil cover and this will increase the soil water and element content preservation by mosses and lichens. Considering the heavy metal concentrations, the enhanced photosynthetic CO2 assimilation capacity results in “dilution” effect of the element content because of higher dry matter production. This dilution phenomenon is known in flower plants, in which the carbohydrate, nitrogen or element content were decreased under long-term elevated air CO2 concentrations (Körner and Bazzaz, 1996; Overdick, 1993). Therefore in the future, the increased air CO2 concentrations can modify or influence element contents in mosses and their heavy metal concentrations can be relatively decreased which would have effect on their heavy metal bioindication value.

Abstract: This work’s aim is predict the photosynthetic responses of forest floor cryptogam species to elevated atmospheric CO2 level. The study was carried out at the natural CO2 spring of Lajatico (Toscana). We compared the photosynthetic behaviour of six in situ growing indigenous moss species, and further 2-2 one-over-one transplanted moss (from different habitat) and native lichen species at CO2 spring to control site. This study suggested that the long-term adjustment of photosynthetic capacity to elevated atmospheric CO2 may be diverse and strongly species dependent. Keywords: chlorophyll fluorescence, CO2 assimilation, OTC chamber, elevated air CO2 concentration Introduction The concentration of the atmospheric CO2 has been increasing since the mid-1800s to the present day (Houghton et al. 1990; Hughes 2000). There is nowadays an extensive consensus in the scientific community and in the relevant International Programmes that the CO2 spring resource is providing an invaluable contribution to Global Change research (Raschi et al., 1997). Cryptogamic species are important components of the photosynthesising biomass in many ecosystems from the tropics to the arctic regions (Pócs et al., 1987; Smith 1982). Terricolous (soil covering) mosses and lichens buffer and preserve the soil moisture and element content. On the other point of view with their rapid turnover and simple morphological characteristics mosses and lichens could be one of the best indicators of the global climate change. Large pools of nutrient and carbon can be found in the desiccation tolerant plants of these ecosystems, and therefore significant aspects of ecosystem function depend on their physiological response, production and turnover pattern. However the potential effects of elevated CO2 level on bryophytes and lichens has received much less attention than effects on other plants such as trees, crops and grasses (Sonesson et al., 1995; Tuba et al., 1998). The behaviour and responses of plants under elevated air CO2 concentrations is the matter of the way of their acclimation (Tuba 2005). The acclimation to the elevated air CO2 environment is strongly depending on the photosynthetically produced soluble sugar and starch amount, which shows diverse pattern both at present day and elevated air CO2 concentrations, especially under stress conditions both in lower and cryptogamic plants (Maróti et al., 1984; Meenks et a., 1991; Tuba et al., 1996). Cryptogams being poikilohydric they cannot regulate their water content, their water loss is determined by saturation deficit, boundary layer resistance and the radiation environment and they desiccate and get rewetted as a daily routine (Proctor 1979). This work’s aim was to predict the photosynthetic responses of four cryptogamic species to elevated atmospheric CO2 level. The study was carried out at the natural CO2 spring (Mofeta di</p><p id="Pg622">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 2016 Borboi) of Lajatico (Toscana, 85 km from Florence). We compared the photosynthetic behaviour of two moss and two lichen species at CO2 spring to control site. Materials and Methods Site description: The study was carry out at and around the natural CO2 spring area of Lajatico (Toscana, Italy); 85 km west of Florence. The natural vent (CO2 spring) called “Mofeta di Borboi” (43°26'N, 10°42'E) extends over an area of 0.7 ha. The area is covered by a coppiced stand dominated by Quercus ilex. The CO2 spring is located on the north-facing slope (20%) of a hill near the bottom of a small valley about 300 m above sea level. Plants around the CO2 spring are exposed to daytime CO2 concentration of about 700 μmol mol-1 throughout the year with short-term variations between 500 and 1000 μmol mol-1 depending on wind speed and convective turbulence. The CO2 concentration at different heights within the canopy varies little (Raschi et al. 1997). Investigated moss and lichen species: Tortula ruralis (Hedw.) Gaertn. et al., Syn.: Syntrichia ruralis Brid. , Pottiaceae C. Müll. Plagiomnium cuspidatum (Hedw.) Kop., Syn.: Mnium cuspidatum Hedw.Cladonia convoluta (Lam.) P. Cout.; Cladonia furcata (Huds.) Schrad. Ssp. furcata. Site selection, source of material and measuring circumstances: The two moss species (Tortula ruralis, Plagiomnium cuspidatum) were transplanted from two different sites of Hungary with their original soil substrates. Tortula were originally growing in the semiarid stand of the Festucetum vaginatae danubiale grassland near Vácrátót, Hungary (25 km N of Budapest; 47o41’ N, 19o15’E, 180 m a.m.s.l.), while the forest dweller Plagiomnium were collected from the Botanical Garden of the Szent István University (Gödöllő, Hungary; 28 km E of Budapest; 47o36’ N, 19o21’E, at 220 m altitude). The transplanted lichens (Cladonia convoluta, Cladonia furcata) are frequent in the nearby forest-floor but not living in the close vicinity of the CO2 spring. All of the transplanted cushion/thalli were measured after a two weeks long adaptation period. Despite of the season the temperature was mild (19-21oC) and rainy (as usual) in November, while in May the weather was drier with similar degrees. The photosynthetical active radiation (PAR) values ranged between 10-100µmol m-2s-1 measured at the forest-floor. Methods used: The activity of photosynthetic apparatus was detected by a portable twowavelength chlorophyll-a fluorometer (PEA: Plant Effitiency Analyser, Hansatech Ltd., UK), which together with other methods, like thermoluminenscence (Sass et al., 1996) is an effective non-destructive, in vivo probe of photosynthetesis in cryptogamic plants (Takács et al, 1999; Tuba et al., 1997). Before the measurements all samples were dark adapted for 30 minutes. From the fluorescence induction curves Fo, Fm, Fv, Fs parameters were measured and from these the potential (Fv/Fm) and actual (PSII) quantum yield of photosystem II, the potential activity (Rfd) and the non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) were calculated. CO2 gas exchange rates were measured by a portable infra-red gas analyzer (CIRAS-1, PP System, Hitchin, UK). The photosynthetical active radiation (PAR, µmol m-2s-1) was measured by the light sensor of the CIRAS. The water content of the samples was measured gravimetrically. All samples were fully rehydrated before the start of the measurements and kept close to their respective optimum water contents. At least three repetitions have been done on the cushions/thalli selected for each measurement. Significant values were calculated by T-test.</p><p id="Pg623">VII.

Net CO2 assimilation rate of the transplanted lichen and moss species at CO2 spring and control site. Although the data presented in this paper do not allow excessive generalization, moss and lichen species may apparently respond in a different way to CO2 enrichment. Desiccation-tolerant bryophytes and lichens photosynthesise and grow only when they are wet (Tuba et al., 1998; Csintalan et al., 2005). Compared to the vascular plants since the desiccation-rehydration cycle itself causes profound changes in the photosynthetic activity of these plants (Tuba et al., 1998), the effects of increased atmospheric CO2 concentration on their carbon balance and growth are not necessarily parallel with those experienced in vascular plants (Tuba et al., 1996; Tognetti et al., 1998). As in their original habitat the investigated transplanted lichens and mosses experience higher temperature and light intensity, therefore the climatic and daily weather conditions can strongly affect the length of the desiccation and rehydration periods and via this way, the length of period for their acclimatization to the enriched CO2 concentrations. In May 2002 in the Fv/Fm and PSII parameters there were no statistically significant differences between the plants at the vent and control sites (Figure 1.A). Rfd and NPQ values of transplanted species growing at the CO2 spring were generally downward regulated (Figure 1.B). The CO2 assimilation rate expressed on surface unit was higher in C. furcata growing at the CO2 vent, in the other lichen species it was statistically unchanged, while in the two moss species it was significantly decreased (Figure 2.).

As a consequence the total dry matter mass will also be increased, which in turn will enhance the moss and lichen soil cover and this will increase the soil water and element content preservation water content and soil organic matter by mosses and lichens.

Herbicide treatments were applied preemergence at 1600 and 2000 g ai/ha rates. Percent control of Echinochloa crus-galli (ECHCG) was visually assessed. Data presented shows percent control at the last evaluation. Weed control efficacy of acetochlor is impacted by the rainfall. Soil applications of acetochlor require adequate rainfall to activate the molecule. Data from these trials showed that 14 mm of rainfall is required during the first two weeks after application for optimal activation of acetochlor. Keywords: acetochlor, ECHCG, rainfall, efficacy Introduction Acetochlor is a widely used pre-emergent herbicide to control grass and broad-leaved weeds in maize. Efficacy of soil applied herbicides is impacted by several soil and environmental factors; such as soil organic matter, clay content and rainfall. This paper will evaluate the impact of rainfall on acetochlor efficacy for control of Echinochloa crus-galli (ECHCG). This weed was choosen, because it is one of the most sensitive to acetochlor. Objective of this research was to evaluate the efficacy of pre applied acetochlor on ECHCG control, as affected by amount of rainfall during the first two weeks after application. Materials and methods A total of 28 small plot replicated field trials were conducted in France and Hungary between the years of 2003-2007. All trials followed the EPPO PP 1/50 (2): Weed in maize guideline. Acetochlor was applied pre-emergence to crop and weeds at 1600 and 2000 g ai/ha rates. Each trial was established as a randomised complete block (RCB) design with three replications of 2 X 10 m plots. Trial sites were on a range of soil types (for example), organic matter and pH (see Table 1). Herbicide treatments were applied with a 2.5 m wide boom back-pack sprayer, equipped with flat fan nozzles calibrated to deliver 200 – 250 l/ha spray solution at 240 kPa pressure. An untreated check was always included in the plot area for visual reference. ECHCG control was visually assessed on a scale of 0 (no control) to 100 (complete control). The data were analysed with ANOVA andpresented in Box-plot graphs.</p><p id="Pg626">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 2020 Table 1.

Differences in weed control provided by the two rates were more visible when the trial data was segmented into two groups according to the actual rainfall during the first two weeks after application, which is the most important period for herbicide activation. The first group included trials which experienced ’dry’ conditions (less than 14 mm rainfall) during the first two weeks after application. The second group of trials experienced ’wet’ conditions (greater than 14 mm rainfall) during the first two weeks after application. Efficacy data for these groups is presented in Figure 2.

Effect of rainfall on the efficacy of acetochlor As one more way to view the data, ECHCG control was summarized across both application rates and graphed against total rainfall received in the first two weeks after application in each trial (Figure 3). As data shows, acetochlor efficacy becomes more robust and reliable when 14 mm rainfall occured within two weeks after the appliction.

According to the trials, it can be concluded that 14 mm is the optimal amount of rainfall for acetochlor activation. Acetochlor is highly active on ECHCG even at lower rate (1600 g ai/ha), if rainfall occurs within 2 weeks after the application. Since it is difficult to predict the rainfall, the higher rate (2000 g ai/ha) should be recommended to provide good control of ECHCG across all conditions.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 2023 ACCUMULATION OF TOXIC ELEMENTS BY WHITE CAMPION (MELANDRIUM ALBUM) AT A COMMUNAL WASTE DISPOSAL SITE IN HUNGARY István SZABÓ1 – Sándor SZOBOSZLAY1 – Csilla KRIFATON1 – Emőke BARDÓCZYNÉ SZÉKELY2 – Balázs KRISZT1 1 Szent István University, Department of Environmental Protection and Environmental Safety, Páter Károly utca 1., 2103 Gödöllő, Hungary, e-mail:szabo.istvan@kti.szie.hu 2 Szent István University, Department of Nature Conservation and Landscape Ecology Abstract: The aim of our study was to analyse the presence of toxic elements in the soil and in plants related to the same species. The field of our research was a communal waste site in Gödöllő, Hungary. Samples were taken from the remediated part of the site from the soil cover. The accumulation of toxic elements (heavy metals) was tested in White Campion (Melandrium album [= Silena alba subsp. Latifolia]) as a bioindicator of the contamination (Kovács, M. et al., 1992/b). A modest base of evidence in top level soil and plant interactions show that chemicals present in the soil are detected in different plant parts (root, steam, leaf), too (Kovács, M. et al., 1992/a, 1993). Nevertheless, in connection with cadmium and mercury permanent anomalies were experienced by two year results of analytical measurements. In some cases, according to chemical analytical tests, cadmium and mercury are detected in plant parts, though these elements were not noticed in the top (20 cm) soil level where these plants were grown. Keywords: White Campion, Melandrium album, toxic elements, accumulation, waste disposal site, cadmium Introduction In our study the communal waste disposal site in Ökörtelek valley, Gödöllő was examined. Soil-plant interactions were studied at a remediated part of a communal waste disposal site in July 2006 and 2007. In both years the same chemical analytical methods were used to determinate the toxic element contents in the soil and in separated plant parts from the same sampling points. The aim of the survey was to find out any accumulation of toxic elements from the top level of the soil in plants related to the same species. The communal waste site of Ökörtelek valley has adequate volumetric capacity, sealing, and lasting insulated socket. However, the waste site was not insulated till 1997. Our study was focused on Melandrium album, because it was common and simply findable everywhere in the site. Materials and methods Samples were taken from separated roots, stems and leaves of the plants and the top 20 cm layer of soil where the plants were grown. In both years the same points of the site were sampled. The sampling areas were positioned by using Global Positioning System (GPS). Aim of analytical sampling was to assess element uptake ability of organisms related to the same plant species at previously appointed places. So in 2006, 5 different sampling points were designated at the sampling area that covers different habitat patches of the area. Melandrium album was chosen to be analysed on the basis of published data (Kovács et al., 1992/a, b) and it was found in every different habitat of the site. Samples were taken at each sampling point from individual plants. Chemical analytical tests were made by an independent accredited laboratory. In case of soil and plant samples eight toxic elements were examined: arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), mercury (Hg). Soil and</p><p id="Pg630">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 2024 plant sampling pots were given by the analytical laboratory.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 2025 Analytical results of the soil samples and plant parts from two different years (2006 and 2007) are presented in tables (Table 1., 2.) above. The most important graphs that were made by the results of the tables are presented below (Figure 1.-4.). By these results it can be noticed that in case of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, nickel, lead, zinc mostly roots contain the highest amount of the measured toxic elements (Table 1. and 2.). By these results it seems to be justified that top level of soil contained higher concentration of these elements than they were presented in plant parts.

Cadmium content of soil and plant parts related to the same sampling points in 2006 and 2007 In case of chromium (2006) the anomaly was found that in some sampling points (OK-1, OK-2) higher concentration can be found in the roots than in the surrounding soil. This anomaly was not verified in 2007, because the chromium graphs were running down as same as at the “typical graph” form (Table 2., 3.). In 2006 the sample results of mercury showed diversified graph views (Figure 2.), because the concentration of it in plant parts and in the soil was variable. In some cases (OK-1, OK-3) mercury could not be detected in the upper soil, in spite of that it appeared in plant parts. Nevertheless, at some points mercury was detected from the soil (OK-5), but from roots (OK-5/roots) it could not be detected. It is also interesting that stem and leaves in OK-4, OK-5 sampling points comprised higher mercury content than top of the soil. In 2007 graphs couldn’t be prepared, because mercury was not detected in any sample. The most considerable result of the analysed toxic element contents in the sampled soil and plant parts is related to cadmium (Figure 3. and 4.). Cadmium content remained</p><p id="Pg632">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 2026 under detectable limit in every soil samples, though cadmium appeared in plant parts. These results were also verified in the two sampling years (2006, 2007). Although cadmium did not appear in top level of surrounding soil, it was detected in Melandrium album in 2007, too. By these results it seems to be possible that plants got cadmium from deeper layers of the soil. These analytical results showed that cadmium can be taken up by Melandrium album from deeper soil layers of waste dumping ground. Although in our research these plants were not able to accumulate considerable amount of cadmium it could call attention of practical environmental engineers or scientific researchers that once covered contaminations can get to the surface again through the plants body. Environmental risk of recultivated and well covered (communal waste) pollutions can grow higher if it is noticed that certain toxic elements will be able to find the way back to the surface via the bodies of the growing plants. Hypothetically, secondary pollution could be caused by the plants if the accumulated toxic elements from lower soil layers (or from the covered waste) will be transferred by wind when the plant parts dry out. Conclusions Our aim was to determine effects of toxic compounds in soil and attributes of the scene (communal waste site) on Melandrium album by the results of the same (time, points) sampling of two different years. This communal waste site was covered with soil during the recultivation. In our study the concentration of eight toxic elements (arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, nickel, lead, zinc, mercury) was measured in separated plant parts (roots, stem, leaves) and from the upper level (20 cm) of soil. These analytical analyses helped to survey accumulation capacity of the chosen plants. In case of plant parts, elements that were examined accumulated in the root of the indicator organism to a great extent, but generally in lower concentration than in the soil. However, in some cases elements examinations pointed out anomalies, as these elements (mercury, cadmium) could not be detected in the top level soil, but they were presented in certain parts of the plant. It means that Melandrium album is able to take up toxic elements from lower soil layers, especially in this case from the former, covered communal waste. So as a result it was found that cadmium that was covered during the recultivation can get to the surface again with the deep layer accumulation of this plant. These results call our attentions to the fact that uncontrolled plant growth on covered waste sites possibly cause higher environmental risk.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 2027 MARKETABLE VALUE OF GRASSLAND PRODUCTS András NÁBRÁDI Department of Business Management and Marketing, Facultyof Ag. Economics and Rural Development, University of Debrecen, H-4032 Debrecen, Böszörményi str. 138, e-mail: nabradi@agr.unideb.hu Abstract: There are several grassland products the economic values of which are unclear in several cases. Besides demonstrating the social benefits of grassland products, the objective of the present study is to present the value of their diverse forms of utilization and their definitions in practice. The study groups marketable and non-marketable grass products and introduces a new category, the animal husbandry value of grasses. Keywords: grassland products, value of grasses Introduction Besides several other factors, economists differ from researchers in other areas of science since they are basically motivated by three issues: the first question they always raise is: “What can it be used for?”, the second is: “What is it worth?” and the third is: “How can it (its value) be determined?” What are the major factors in grass utilization? First we have studied their benefits through the areas of utilization. Materials and methods After revision and definition of the most significant areas of grassland products utilization will be grouping two main forms: namely: marketable and non marketable ones. Then we determined the cost of grasses as the baseline of selling price. After it will be summarize how can we determine the prices of marketable and non-marketable products. During this determination linear programming and deducting methods will be apply. At the end it will be initiated a new formula: the value of grass in animal husbandry. Results and discussion Animal nutrition is one of the “most ancient” areas of grass utilization closely related to human history. The use of herbs and medicinal plants gathered from meadows and pasturelands is still traditional and characteristic. Their special, individual use is health care, where not only medicinal raw materials, but fitness and wellness cures are related to grassland products as well. In areas subjected to soil erosion, deflation caused by wind and in areas of planted orchards and vineyards we utilize the traits of grasses that they physically protect and improve soils, preventing weeding and protecting soils from desiccation. (Várallyay, 2007.) Our pristine grasslands are botanical curiosities and they are individual zoologically as well as a result of their multiple natural interactions. Specific plant communities form specific eco-synoses and thus they maintain the biological diversity of animal life. Biological diversity means a single function of several components: the number of occurring species, the richness of species, their genetic variability within species, the diversity of ecosystems, the occurrence of species among other species and the balance of their occurrence. Functional diversity expresses the biological roles of species or species groups in a specific ecosystem and those ecological processes, which are performed by certain organisms, populations and communities. In a broader sense, biodiversity includes the metabolism capacity of ecosystems (Jávor et al., 1999; Várallyay, 2006). A special area of grass utilization can</p><p id="Pg634">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 2028 be the provision of a “human aesthetics” i.e. making our direct residential areas more semi-natural. The sport is a highly significant utilization of grasslands. If we consider merely the size of football fields only, their calculated area exceeds 1000 ha in Hungary. Besides the utilization of solar, water and wind energies that of “bio” energy has come into the limelight. One of its areas is “energy grass”, a specifically new potential not only for those who possess grasslands, but for those farmers, who have ploughlands and who perform their activities under less favourable circumstances. The most natural elements of profitability are seed-grain production (including cleaning and selection), technological development, improvement, and also the market sale or simply the selling of all these products. Moreover, profitability can manifest in a land owner’s leasing his pastureland if he will not perform farming activities. Following the revision and definition of the most significant areas of utilization, the second question can be raised: How much the product of utilization is worth for us in terms of money? First of all we start from the economic principle that the price of a product is determined by the relation of demand (buyers) and supply (vendors) according to current market conditions. In the case of low supply, high demand raises the price. On the contrary, the same product, if supply is high and demand is low only can be sold at a lower price. This correlation is true of grasses and grassland products as well. If there were no other influences, the question could be answered: the value of grasses is determined by the relation of current demand and supply, i.e. the value evaluation of market is dominant, there is no need for further investigation. It is worth as much as it is paid for it! The problem is merely the fact that in the case of grasses, buyers are usually vendors as well! Grassland products, taking especially domestic conditions into consideration, do not provide or hardly provide market commodity supply that is why they are called “non-marketable” products. Direct commodity supply can include seeds (grass and lawn mixes) or rarely baled hay or grass meal. The majority of grasses is used in animal husbandry as “own” forage, where “clear market” conditions are difficult to find. When determining the value of grasses, we start from the potentials of utilization and we sum up grassland products again. Which are marketable and non-marketable grassland products? (Table 1.) Table 1.: Evaluation of the possible forms of grassland utilization on the basis of their marketability Product/Name Marketable Non-marketable Forage for own use + Forage for sale + Medicinal plant, herb + Soil protection + Nature and environmental protection, diversity + Pleasant human environment + + For sporting purposes + Energetics + Business utilization + From own sources</p><p id="Pg635">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 2029 In the case of marketable utilization the price of grassland products can be determined relatively simply. The relation of demand and supply is dominant; however, the basis of price determination is the cost of production. In the case of planted grasses the costs of establishment and the expenditure of annual utilization are separated (Tables 2., 3.) Table 2.: Costs of grassland establishment Table 3.: Costs of grassland utilization (hay) If the grassland product is forage for sale, the starting point is the cost of production for forage. Here we can use the cost calculation well-known in accountancy. The direct costs of product production (materials, e.g. fertilizers, personal costs, divided /mechanical services/, accounted depreciation, other direct costs and standard, indirect or general costs) are to be taken into consideration. This can be the basis for the determination of selling price. Furthermore, the relation of demand and supply can be an influencing factor for product price. If demand is low, producers can only sell products at a price about the production cost (e.g. baled hay). If demand is high, the producer can gain extra profit above his accounted expenses, as he can sell his products at much higher prices than his/her expenditures. How can we determine the price of other marketable products? Medicinal plants and herbs can be included in the marketable category of products if collected products are sold. In this case the calculated personal-type surplus costs of picking-collecting are added to the annual costs of the applied production technologies. The starting point of selling can be the calculated production cost, but in this case demand will be the decisive factor in price calculation as well. The category of business benefits includes leasing lands as well. This also belongs to the marketable category of products. Several grassland products are included in the non-marketable category. The economic value of non-marketable utilization can only be calculated approximately. The literature of economics knows two kinds of approaches: the first is the method of deducting from the marketable end-product produced as a result of “produce”, and the second is the method based on so-called replacement value. The deductive method is based on a costbenefit analysis, meanwhile replacement value aooly linear programming. As we have already mentioned in relation to marketable utilization methods, production cost can be the starting points here as well. Therefore, the products of non-marketable utilization should yield as much as their production in terms of money cost. Finally let’s explain the value of grass in animal husbandry. The animal husbandry value of grasses is determined by the nutritional value of grassland product itself. This is different in the case of green grass, hay, silage, haylage, straw or grass meal. Generally, it can be concluded that grasses are the cheapest and the most natural forage varieties for ruminants. Their use can replace other main forages to be produced perhaps Name of technological operation Cost (EUR/ha) Soil preparation 31-135 Cost of fertilizers 15-46 Cost of seed-grains (40 kg/ha): 138 Sowing: 15-31 Weed control, mowing for cleaning 15-46 Total: 215-396 Name of technological operation Cost (EUR/ha) Mowing (1-3 occasions): 15-46 Swath management 8-23 Baling + transport 19-96 Total: 46-165</p><p id="Pg636">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 2030 in ploughlands. Hungarian grassland products, which are mostly utilized by foraging, are highly rich in minerals and medicinal plants that improve the health of grazing animals, therefore enhance the animals’ life performance and the resulting product will become more suitable for human consumption. Figure 1: The value of grass in animal husbandry A primary advantage of keeping grazing animals is that as a result of movement and natural circumstances, these animals’ life performance is greater, and they are healthier (Figure 1). It has double consequences. Greater life performance decreases losses due to selection; moreover, diseases, which abruptly emerge in the event of barn arrangement, do not manifest. When determining the animal husbandry value of grasses, subsidies must be regarded as well. Conclusions This study strived to answer three questions. The first was how grasslands and their products can be utilized. The second, how much utilization is worth and the third, how its value could be determined. On the basis of the above mentioned we have answered quite a few questions but there are still some problems to be solved and answered by others.

Studentu st. 11, 259. Akademija, Lithuania, e-mail: laima.cesoniene@lzuu.lt Abstract: The aim of this study is to determine the processes of migration and transformation of nutritional in model systems of untouched soils using different amount of organic fertilizers. Investigations shows that the greatest amount of nitrates, nitrites and phosphates was found in the first layer of the soil in 60 days’ time after application of organic fertilizers. Later concentration in this layer decreases as it increases in the second and the third layers of the soil. However, even in 150 days’ time after application of organic fertilizers, concentration of nitrates, nitrites and phosphates in the forth and the fifth layers of the soil increases insignificantly. Concentration of ammonium ions was found the greatest in 10 days’ time after application of organic fertilizers. It was found especially great in the first layer of the soil (11.69 mg l -1 ) and after 60 and 150 days’ time after application of organic fertilizers concentration of ammonium ions decreases. Migration of nitrogen compounds in soil is slow, takes places at a speed of 0.2 cm/ day. Correlation between soil parameters was established. Dynamics of nutrients in the model soil systems shows availability of nutrients for plants after different time of application of organic fertilizers. Keywords: organic fertilizers, model soil system, nitrates, nitrites Introduction Rational application of fertilisers in arable farming is one of the very important issues to day. From one side obtained yields of different crops depend an adequate amounts of nutrients in soil, at the same time fertilisers are an important factor determining dissipated regional pollution and affecting the chemical composition of groundwater. Applying the Best Management Practice in fertilizer calculation – based on the environmental circumstances, soil conditions and the plant nitrogen demand – only limited amounts of surplus nitrogen can be detected in the soil-water system after the growing season (Nemeth, 2006). Sustainable mineral fertilizer rate for corn in the given agroecological conditions ranges between 150 and 200 kg/ha of mineral nitrogen. Aditional amaunts of nitrogen can cause increase in yield and in grain nitrogen content, but with stronger adverse effects on water quality (Mesic et al., 2007). As a result of mineralization of organic matter process, different water-solube N forms (NO3 -, NH4 +, organic-N) are appeared in the soil solution, and dynamics of that are influenced by soil parameters, e.g. pH, organic matter content or soil biological activity (Kincses et al., 2007). N content, dry weight and yield of plant were strongly influnced by agro ecological conditions. The applicationn of 5 kg stable manure m-2 or 100 g NPK 5-2030 m-2 can be recomended for good nutritive quality of plants as well as standard yield if the wether conditions are favorable (Herack Custic aet al., 2007). The NO3 –N content of the 0-100 cm profile correlated well with yields achieved in tillage methods both under non-fertilized and fertilized conditions (Megyes et al., 2007). More detailed studies are needed on nitrogen dynamics in the soil and availability for plants from organic fertilisers. The aim of this study is to determine the processes of migration and transformation of nutrients in model systems of untouched soils using different amount of organic fertilizers.</p><p id="Pg638">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 2032 Materials and methods Research was carried out in untouched soils of 50 containers measuring 50 cm in height and 8 cm in diameter. Containers were filled with carbonate-rich glayic washed loamy moraine (Calcari- Epihypogleyic Luvisol). The bottom end of containers was heatsealed with a film and the top end was remained unsealed. Containers were kept under the conditions of equal temperature and humidity. To determine migration of organic compounds, the soil in containers was poured with 100ml of organic fertilizers (slure), other containers remained controls (no slure was poured). Composition of the sluge was as follows: pH- 7.6; total nitrogen (N) %- 0.26; total phosphorus (P) %- 0.078; nitrates (NO3) mg/l -1.68; nitrites (NO2) mg/l- 0.012; electric conductivity - μSm/cm- 13.2. The content of containers was divided into 5 layers and samples were analyzed at the Laboratory of Environmental Science of the Environmental Institute at the Lithuanian University of Agriculture according to approved methodologies. Concentrations of nitrates, nitrites, ammonium ions, phosphates and pH in different layers of soil were calculates. Concentrations of nutritional materials in different layers of model soil were determined after 30, 60, 100 and 150 days after application of organic fertilizers. To express substantiality of interdependence of different soil parameters coefficients r were calculated and statistical significance of this relationship was assessed according to p coefficient (when p &gt;0.05 correlation was regarded as statistically significant) (programme STATISTICA). Results and discussion Concentrations of nitrates, nitrites, pH, ammonium ions and phosphates in different layers of model soil after 30, 60, 100 and 150 days after application of organic fertilizers are shown in Figure 1. In 60 days’ time after application of organic fertilizers the concentration of nitrated had signally increased in all the layers of the soil, the greatest being in the first layer 17 mg l-1. In the end of the experiment (in 150 days’ time after application of organic fertilizers) nitrate concentration was found greatest in the third layer of the soil (at 30 cm) equal to 12 mg l-1. The findings show that in carbonate-rich glayic washed loamy moraine migration of nitrates is slow and takes place at a speed of 0.2 cm/day. In 10 days’ time after application of organic fertilizers, concentration of nitrites is very low (0.06 – 0.4 mg l-1) in all the layers of the soil. In 60 days’ time nitrites concentration increased in all the layers and it was especially great in the first layer of the soil equaling to 2.52 mg l-1. In 150 days’ time after application of organic fertilizers, nitrite concentration decreased to 1.08 mg l-1 and the greatest concentration of nitrites was found in the third layer (1, 1 mg l-1). Like nitrates, in carbonate-rich glayic washed loamy moraine nitrites migrate at a speed of 0.2 cm/day. Concentration of ammonium ions was found greatest in all layers of the soil in 10 days’ time after application of organic fertilizers. An especially great concentration was found in the first layer of the soil which equaled to 11.69 mg l-1. In 60 days’ time and in 150 days’ time concentrations of ammonium ions decrease and become similar to those in control containers (fertilizers were not applied). (differences were found insignificant p&lt;0.05).</p><p id="Pg639">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 2033 Phosphate concentration was found the greatest in 60 days’ time after application of organic fertilizers. It was especially great in the first layer of the soil (9.85 mg l-1). In 150 days’ time after application of organic fertilizers phosphate concentration in the first three layers distribute evenly and are similar to those in control models (where fertilizers had not been applied). Having performed measurements of pH, it was found that an average acidity of the soil arrived at 6.64, values ranging from 5.8 to 7.45. In 10 days’ time after application of organic fertilizers, the first layer’s of the soil pH was found inferior to that in control models (became more alkaline). In 30 days’ time pH value in the whole profile of the soil was lesser than that in the control model. 0 5 10 15 20 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm 50 cm NO3 - mgl-1 af ter 10 d af ter 30 d af ter 60 d af ter 100 d af ter 160 d 0 1 2 3 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm 50 cm NO 2 - mgl-1 after 10 d after 30 d after 60 d after 100 d after 160 d 0 5 10 15 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm 50 cm NH4 + mgl-1 af ter 10 d af ter 30 d af ter 60 d af ter 100 d af ter 160 d 0 5 10 15 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm 50 cm PO4 mgl -1 after 10 d after 30 d after 60 d after 100 d after 160 d 0 2 4 6 8 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm 50 cm pH after 10 d after 30 d after 60 d after 100 d after 160 d Figure 1.

Cereal Research Communications 2034 (0.8194&lt; r &gt;0.99; p&gt;0.05), except for the correlation between ammonium ions and value of pH (p&lt;0.05). Correlation was found negative between the values of pH and NO3 -, NO2 - and PO4 3- (as values increased, pH value decreased). One of the reasons for this may be the fact that the more acid surroundings grow, the faster processes of oxidation and nitrification are. Correlation was also found negative between the values of NH4 + and the values of NO3 -, NO2 - (the fewer ammonium ions, the greater concentration of nitrates and nitrites). This can be explained by the fact that the first layer of the soil contains the greatest amount of oxygen; intensive oxidation of organic material takes place as the result of which nitrates (NO3 -) are produced. In the second and the third layers of the soil similar processes take place as in the first layer. There is no correlationbetween soil parameters in the fourth and the fifth layers of the soil (p&lt;0.05). Conclusions The greatest amount of nitrates and nitrites was found in the first layer of the soil in 60 days’ time after application of organic fertilizers. Later concentration in this layer decreases as it increases in the second and the third layers of the soil. However, even in 150 days’ time after application of organic fertilizers, concentration of nitrates and nitrites in the forth and the fifth layers of the soil increases insignificantly. Concentration of ammonium ions was found the greatest in 10 days’ time after application of organic fertilizers. It was found especially great in the first layer of the soil (11.69 mg l-1) and after 60 and 150 days’ time after application of organic fertilizers concentration of ammonium ions decreases. Migration of nitrogen compounds in soil is slow, takes places at a speed of 0.2 cm/day. Concentration of phosphates was found the greatest in 60 days’ time after application of organic fertilizers. It was found especially great in the first layer of the soil (9.85 mg l1). In 150 days’ time after application of organic fertilizers concentrations of phosphates distribute evenly in the first three layers of the soil and become similar to control models. Correlation between soil parameters under investigation (after application of organic fertilizers) was found the strongest in the first layer of the soil. As soil’s pH value lessens, processes of oxidation and nitrification become faster. Intensive oxidation of organic materials takes place resulting in production of nitrates.

DURING LONG TERM LOAD EXPERIMENTS László NAGYPÁL1 – Lajos SZABÓ 1 – Laszló SZEGEDI 2 1 Tessedi Sámuel College, H-5540 Szarvas, Szabadság str. 2. Hungary, szabo.lajos@mvk.tsf.hu 2 Károly Róbert College, H-3200 Gyöngyös, Mátrai str. 36., Hungary, lszegedi@karolyrobert.hu Abstract: research on white mustard as indicator plants were carried out in the eighth year of the long term heavy metal load experiments (Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, Zn) initiated in 1994 at Károly Róbert College. According to the results mercury, arsenic, and lead could not be found in the green sprouts of the plant in 2002. Hg and As quickly altered in the soil into a non-absorbable form. Lead, as indicated in previous research, remained in the roots of the plant and did not translocate into the plant organs. Data shows that the enrichment of Cd was significant. In the case of total element content we were able to prove a significant connection between the total zinc, copper, cadmium and chrome concentration of the soil and the corresponding metallic content of the plant. No significant connection could be proven between the total element content and the element content of the harvested plant with the exception of cadmium. While analysing the absorbable element content we found significant correlation between the soil’s element content and the element content of the rape sprouts in the case of aluminium and chrome. The absorbable element content and the plant’s element content at harvest did not show any significant correlation. Of the fenological and agronomical features we only examined the germinative-power (number of stems) and height. Data indicating toxicity were found only in the case of cadmium and chromium where all three treatments significantly reduced the number of mustard stems in the plots. Of the treatment combinations it was only the quality of the metals that significantly influenced the number of stems, significance could not be shown in the effects of the doses. We came to similar conclusions while examining the height of the mustard plants. Keywords: white mustard, toxic element accumulation, fitotoxic effect Introduction The outcomes of the experiments of the past decades as well as the surveys (monitoring) of the state of the environment proved that in industrial districts, in urban areas, along main roads, and in sewage and sewage-sludge treated agricultural areas the heavy metal content of the soil has risen abnormally (Németh and Kádár, 1991; Kádár, 1993; Takácsné Hájos, 1997; Szegedi et al., 2007). The heavy metal accumulating ability of plants that are directly consumed by humans indicates the dangers and possible dangers the population is exposed to at a given level of contamination (Kádár, 1993a; Németh, 2006; Várallyay, 2006; Fodor, 2000; Fodor-Szabó, 2006). The “critical” limit concentration levels – of both plants and soil – can be explored in open field long term load experimints (Tóth et al., 2006). On behalf of the Ministry of Environment and Rural Development the “Examination of the Heavy Metal Content of our Environment” research programme was launched in 1991 in the Research Institute for Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (RISSAC). In 1994 Károly Róbert College joined to the programme providing a venue at the Tass Puszta Educational Farm following the guiding principles and methodology prepared by the Research Institute for Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.</p><p id="Pg642">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 2036 Materials and methods Experiments were carried out in the Educational Farm on sour, firm brown forest soil involving 8 elements (Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, Zn), at 3 contamination levels (0/30, 90 and 270 kg element/ha), in 3 repetitions on 35 m2 (3,5 m x 10 m) plots. In the splitplot experiment the 8 examined elements represent the main plots while the 3 contamination levels represent the sub-plots. Treatments were implemented by using the water soluble salts of the elements only once at the beginning of the experiment. In 2002 we examined the effects of the 8 elements on white mustard (Sinapsis Alba L.). Sampling took place at the phenological phases that best determine the the plants’ nourishment level, which, in the case of white mustard, is the green sprout and preharvest state. Sampling took place three times from each plot from a randomly selected linear metre from where the whole plant was removed. 0,5 metre from the edge was left untouched. After measuring the green mass we dried the samples in a natural way after which we measured the air-dry weight. The fitotoxic effect of the elements were determined by measuring the germinative-power (number of stems) and height. After weighing, drying, and crushing we determined the element content of the samples. The element composition of the vegetable matter was determined – after a cc HNO3 + H2O2 exposition – by the ICP laboratory of MTA TAKI using an ICP-AES plasma emission spectrophotometer. Of the fenological and agronomical features we examined the germinative-power (number of stems) and height. We counted the number of stems in a linear metre in each experimenta plot in the green sprout state of the plants. The mathematical and statistical assessment of the data was completed with the variant analysis of the two-factor, split-plot arranged experiments. Results and discussion Table 1 shows the element content of the plants sampled in the green sprout state while table 2 shows element content of the plants sampled at harvest. According to the results mercury, arsenic, and lead could not be found in the green sprout condition of the plant in 2002. Previous research had had similar results involving other plants as well (Fodor, 1998). Hg and As quickly altered in the soil into a non-absorbable form. Lead, as indicated in previous research, remained in the roots of the plant and did not translocate into the plant organs. According to data the enrichment of Cd is strong therefore Cd remained extremely mobile in the soil-plant system even eight years after contamination (Fodor, 1998a). As for Al previous experiments had already proved that Al the load does not influence the Al content of the plants (Fodor, 2002). We also examined the connection between the total and absorbable element content of the mustard and the soil. In the case of total element content we were able to prove a significant connection between the total zinc, copper, cadmium and chrome concentration of the soil and the corresponding metallic content of green sprout mustard. No significant connection could be proven between the total element content and the element content of the harvested plant with the exception of cadmium. While analysing the absorbable element content we found significant correlation between the soil’s element content and the element content of the rape sprouts in the case of aluminium and chrome. The absorbable element content and the plant’s element content at harvest did not show any significant correlation.</p><p id="Pg643">VII.

However, the F-value of the treatment was 2, which indicates that the treatment elements triggered significant effect. It can be established that all of the lead treatments as well as the 3rd dose of the arsenic and copper treatment significantly raised the number of stems per linear metre. All three doses of cadmium and chrome significantly reduced the number of stems of the mustard compared to the control, which leads us to conclude that they had toxic effects on the germination of the mustard. Copper produced a rather interesting result since the first dose had a blocking effect on the number of stems, the second dose was neutral, while the third dose significantly increased it. As for the elements’ effects on height we can declare that the first dose of both lead and mercury as well as the third dose of zinc had a much stronger stimulating effect than the rest of the treatment elements. Mercury, just like in the case of the number of stems, induced positive changes in the height of the mustard plants.</p><p id="Pg644">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 2038 The cadmium and chrome treatments significantly reduced height, so they had a negative effect. Arsenic hindered growth only after the first treatment, the larger doses had a stimulating effect. Zinc, quite surprisingly, significantly increased height after all three treatments. Conclusions According to the outcomes of the experiment the effects of the heavy metals are provable even eight years after contamination, and although their concentration and effects change year by year, their toxicity will not terminate. The enrichment of the toxic elements is more dominant in the young stems than towards the end of the growth season. The large scale accumulation of cadmium in the mustard plant proves that it is the most dangerous and deservedly most widely researched element presently. The different heavy metal treatments influenced the number of mustard stems. It is important to note that there were experimental variants where the germination data of the plots treated with high concentration of metallic contamination were better than the control plots, which indicates that the effects of the heavy metal treatments on the number of stems is not always blocking. This also holds true for the height of the mustard. References Fodor L.: 1998. Effect of heavy metals on wheat and maize crop on brown forest soil. Agrokémia és Talajtan 47. 1-4.: 197-205. p.

E-mail: nagy.henrietta@gtk.szie.hu Abstract: According to the different publications and professional literature, the most common comprehensive index for measuring the development level of different territorial units and which is also able to reflect several factors at the same time is the gross domestic product (GDP). GDP has been used to compare the developments of individual countries for long, but its application for regions only started in the past few years. However it must be emphasized that GDP is not the only index for economic development, so it must not be declared as the only one index for counties and regions, but it is recommended to apply other statistical indices also in territorial analyses (PUKLI 2000). Keywords: gross domestic product, competitiveness, regional GDP Introduction In order to make economically established development strategies for the territorial units, we need to apply development methods that are suitable for spatial examinations. There are statistical-mathematical methods that can be well applied in regional examinations too, so we tried to focus rather on these methods in our study. For these methods such input data are necessary that are able to characterize the competitiveness and development of the regions. Thus we have intended to highlight that there is not a consensus exiting among the experts concerning the indices themselves. A region’s competitiveness cannot be examined with the same methods and indices we apply for the countries, since regions are not autonomous units. Though GDP is not the only one index of regional development or the control of development actions’ effects, but it is fundamental. It has gained key importance in regional analyses and regional policy to be a special index for the allocation of community development supports (NEMES NAGY 1995). Defining the regional/territorial amount of GDP raises several questions in theoretical, information and institutional fields (FISCHER 1994). It is an international experience that relatively reliable regional GDP can only be defined with estimates and on larger territorial units (BAIGGORI 1994). Consequently, if it is defined as exactly as possible, it is not enough to orientate spatial development itself, since it is not suitable for reflecting the multiple characteristics of spatial development and its application at the level of sub-regions is especially unsafe. Materials and methods Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the domestic added value and it is one of the most important elements of national economic balances. It means the new values produced in the whole economic activity in one year and measured in money value (namely in the national currency). The added value produced by the players of the economy can be calculated in two ways.</p><p id="Pg646">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 2040 On one hand it is the gross production value minus the current usage for production, on the other hand it consists of the gross income from work, profit and loss before tax and depreciation. While national income includes only the new values produced in material sectors (industry, agriculture, producing services), GDP also includes the activities in the non-material service sectors (tertiary and quaternary). GDP is only one index of the national accounts. It is the balance of production accounts. It is the difference between the production value of products and services and the values of applied materials and services during their production. In theory, regional accounts are the tallies of national accounts for regions. In practice, however, they cannot be aggregated in a totally detailed format due to the economic units existing in more than one region. Most of the financial and income distribution transactions (taxes, income of the owners, loans) of these multi-regional units cannot be divided among the regions. Because of all these obstacles, in the European Union only production accounts and the accounts of household incomes are compulsory to compiled. The latter one has great significance, because thanks to it, the differences between the regions can be measured not just from the production side but also from the side of population consumption. The quality of regional GDP data basically depends on 2 factors: the method applied and the quality of data applied. Regional GDP can be calculated in different ways. Bottom-up calculation method is based on an assumption that we have all the necessary information about all the production units in the region to calculate the GDP. With the addition of data we can get the regional GDP and as the sum we get the data for the country. With top-down method we divide the total GDP among the regions with the help of such numbers that have been calculated from territorial data reflecting the GDP’s territorial distribution at most. These helping data can be the active population, the number of employed people, the sum of wages etc. The mixed method is the combination of the two methods mentioned, reflecting the finding that there are no countries where the bottom-up summing could be applied in all the fields of the economy. Concerning territorial homogeneity we can distinguish 3 types of economic associations. Units of one region, whose activity covers mainly one region only. Enterprises, whose sites are situated in more regions. Such institutional units whose activity covers more than one region or even the whole country (PUKLI 2000). Results and discussion As a general principle, GDP must be calculated on the region, where the producing unit is residential. In the case of companies which have several sites, the sites must be considered individual producing units. The problems listed above and other problems occur if GDP is calculated territorially disaggregated. As calculating in territorial way, „domestic area” is equal to a region. For territorial GDP other terms are also usually used, like Gross Regional Product (GRP).</p><p id="Pg647">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 2041 Today majority of countries do not have territorial GDP calculations and official publications of this topic. In many countries there are not territorial economic indices which could be used, in other countries GDP is not the most important index. Without detailing the reasons and the factors behind, we only mention as a reminder that in the former socialist countries the growth index of industrial gross production was the most spread economic index that was calculated on regional level too. In the USA personal income is the index about which there are data collected for more than 100 years for each state. Theoretical difficulty is that not every economic activity can be localized punctually. Thus, it is difficult to localize even theoretically the income returns of the activity of financial institutions. From statistical and accounting point of views localizing the added values of companies with several premises is basically unsolved. In the case of activities, especially those which are linked to „space” like telecommunication or transportation, value production can only be distributed with „estimation”. There are further problems in measuring the regional competitiveness because e.g. it is difficult to measure the region’s foreign trade with calculations based on GDP. The problem is that the income and profit of foreign capital is also included in gross output, which is not always spent in the same region. The comparison based on average wages gives a more appropriate picture, since the attractiveness of a region can be well represented by the disposable incomes of the people of that region (RÉTHELYI – TÚRY 2003). There are several approaches concerning the competitiveness of countries. We can distinguish two different approaches: one provides complex ranks on the basis of comparative examinations, while the other analyzes only the difference in the development level of individual countries. We give details about two different approaches providing complex competitiveness ranks: the results of IMD and WEF. IMD (International Institute for Management Development) takes into consideration statistical (hard) data and data from questionnaires (soft), evaluating 4 groups of factors with 243 indices: economic performance, efficiency of government and business sector and infrastructural supply. WEF (World Economic Forum) makes 2 ranks for the 80 countries examined: GCI-index (Economic Development Index) examines the basic factors of economic development. MICI-index (Microeconomic Competitiveness Index) evaluates the business environment. Conclusions The differences in regional GDPs and in regional incomes strengthen the statement that GDP can be considered a comprehensive index, but it is not able to reflect all the major factors of economic development. Furthermore, concerning the quality of figures used for the calculation of the regional GDP we can state that the changes in the economy and society mean serious challenges for the economic statistics. Because of all these problems estimations as well as the uncertainties cannot be avoided during calculations.</p><p id="Pg648">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 2042 To the question: „How safe are the regional GDP figures?” we can answer – based on the abovementioned – that due to the estimates in the case of national or multi-regional economic associations and the territorial obstacles of data-collecting, the quality of data is poorer than that of the national data.

CRUSE1 - Carl HERNDL2 - Elena POLUSH3. 1 Department of Agronomy, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa, USA rmc@iastate.edu 2 Department of English, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa, USA, cgh@iastate.edu 3 Office of Evaluation and Educational Innovation, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas, USA, elenapolush@yahoo.com Abstract: The bioenergy industry offers benefits and threats to soil and water resources. The biofuel industry must have these residues to make liquid fuels and profits. Soil and wter resources need the residues to control soil erosion and maintain water quality. Sustainability of the biofuel industry depends on conserving both soil and water resources. These conflicting issues must be resolved successfully if biofuels are to play a significant role in furnishing the world’s energy supply. Keywords: Soil erosion, wataer quality, bioenergy, biofuels. Introduction Recent reports and publications such as that of Perlack et al, 2005 and Burton et al, 2006 indicating a high capacity of this nation’s lands to produce feedstocks for renewable fuels have created large expectations in rural America, in Congress, and on Wall Street. Meeting these expectations while preserving our soil and water resources may be a challenge or an opportunity, depending upon how the bioenergy industry develops (Dobó et al. 2007; Markó and Popp, 2007). It presents a challenge because the plant residues serving as our most important soil and water conservation tool are also required for fuel production in the cellulosic liquid fuel industry. It may be an opportunity because a more diverse variety of plant species may eventually be produced on the landscape and these plants, or crops, which help conserve the soil and water resource, may have a market. As the biofuel industry develops, producers may be able to plant perennial grasses or woody species that both have a favorable impact on natural resources and provide income as liquid fuel feedstocks. Crop Residues, Soil and Water Resources What is the concern relative to soil and water resources? Soil erosion and water runoff are greatly impacted by surface residue cover. As cover is reduced, both soil erosion and water runoff increase. Plant species that offer little protective cover after removal of above ground biomass, species such as those grown as row crops, will require diligence in limiting residue removal if soil loss and water runoff are to be maintained at acceptable rates. Research indicates that maintaining soil organic matter contents will require even more conservative residue removal rates than that needed for soil erosion control (Wilhelm et al. 2007). If soil organic matter content drops and erosion increases, not only will the resource be degraded, but crops will also require increased inputs to maintain productivity. The concern then becomes whether or not crop residue will be removed and, if so, how much will be removed.</p><p id="Pg650">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 2044 Residue Removal Issues Crop residue will be removed and sold only if this practice is profitable. If it is profitable, we must consider the long term conservation benefits of leaving the proper amounts of residue on the field vs. the short term profitability associated with residue sales. Maintaining soil productivity so that long term profitability can be sustained is a strong motive for retaining field residue cover. Unfortunately, leaving the correct amount of residue in the field is a significant challenge when landscape variability requires different amounts of residues be left on different parts of the field. This challenge may be met with advanced harvesting technology. A potentially bigger challenge might present itself when we consider who will make decisions about residue harvest and what benefits they receive for limiting this harvest. It is somewhat clear that the land owner has benefits associated with maintaining soil productivity and therefore has personal financial incentives to limit residue harvest to a sustainable level. The benefits of limited harvest and other conservation practices are less clear, however, for a renter or a land management company whose goal is short term profit, especially in a competitive market with short term leases. Because a large majority of Iowa harvested lands are rented this situation poses a serious concern to soil and water conservation and the sustainability of Iowa farmland. (http://www.nass.usda.gov/census/census02/volume1/us/st99_2_040_040.pdf) Climate Change Changing rainfall patterns create another challenge for soil and water resources. Published science (Groisman et al., 2005) indicates that the frequency of very heavy rainfall events has increased in the Central U.S. by 26% in the last 30 years. Other climate change studies indicate greater future precipitation is likely in the Central U.S. along with greater climate variability (O’Neal et al, 2005). Very heavy rainfalls cause disproportionate amounts of water runoff and soil loss. Maintaining surface protection against these increasingly common heavy rainfalls seems more important today and in the future than ever. Climate change models vary in predictions of rainfall pattern changes spatially. However, they all indicate increased frequency of extreme events and it is these events that cause the greatest natural resource damage. Conclusions This set of conditions leads us to the following two critical questions. First, do we have the knowledge to identify how much residue can be removed while maintaining long term soil productivity and water quality? And, second, how do we balance the energy needs of the country, financial desires of investors, and the need to conserve the natural resource in the cellulosic biofuels industry? If the cellulosic biofuels industry and natural resources upon which this industry relies are to be sustainable, these questions must be addressed and addressed soon.</p><p id="Pg651">VII.

On the study site, located at the Szabadkígyós Steppe, the analyses of the mineral composition, salt, Na and humus content of soil samples, and the botanical mapping of the entire territory were performed in 1979 and 2005. Results indicate that due to climate change the ground water table has descended significantly, and the past 25 years has brought considerable changes on the site. Alteration of hydrological conditions generated changes in the mineral composition and chemical parameters of the soil, simultaneously with which the vegetation of the area transformed too. It has been proved that botanical structure is in a strong correlation with soil composition. Keywords: mineral composition, vegetation, steppe, climate change, Szabadkígyós, Hungary Introduction From the numerous researches focusing on the consequences and effects of climate change many attempts to describe transformation processes with quantifiable parameters. (Ligetvári et al., 2006; Stehlová, 2006; Vágó et al., 2006; Mikulec, Stehlová, 2007). The key factor behind environmental change is usually the alteration of the water cycle, which influences the character of landscape components through direct and indirect processes, amplified frequently by additional anthropogenic impacts. Climate change might induce short and long term changes in the water cycle (Rakonczai, 2006). Concerning long term effects probably the most important is the permanent change of the ground water level, which might exert its effects through various interrelated mechanisms. Firstly, the deeper the water table moves the more difficult the plants can reach and utilise ground water, which finally leads to the decrease of biomass. Secondly, changes in ground water can also modify the vertical water and salt transfer in soils, which might result the transformation of genetic soil types (Barna, 2007). As a consequence, sodification processes or under reverse conditions desalination can be observed. In both cases the modification of soil type is followed by the change of natural vegetation. As a result of precipitation decrease, especially from the 1980s, the greatest changes in the ground water table, which sank at some locations by 7 m, were experienced on the plains rimmed by the Danube and the Tisza Rivers. Previously, by applying GIS we estimated the degree of annual water shortage. The maximum shortage was determined in years 1995 and 2003, when its value was approximately 4.8 km3, which is almost as much as the total annual water consumption of Hungary (Rakonczai, 2006). If ground water level decrease is permanent then its consequences can be experienced in the transformation of soils and natural vegetation (Várallyay, 2007).</p><p id="Pg653">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 2048 This paper presents the results of our investigations on the effects of climate change on the soils and vegatation of the Szabadkígyós Steppe, SE Hungary. Materials and methods The Szabadkígyós Steppe is located south of the city of Békéscsaba on the territory of the Körös-Maros National Park in South-East Hungary. In 1977 and in 1979 as a part of the preparations for declaring the area protected detailed geomorphological and pedological investigations were made on the area. These also involved the complex analysis of a characteristic meadow solonetz profile under transformation into steppe soil, microclimatic measurements and the allocation of sample plots where joint evaluations could be made together with botanists. In the framework of the later study detailed botanic surveys were repeated in the characteristic periods of vegetation development, and at the same time the chemical parameters of soils under different the vegetation types were analysed. Samples were taken from the upper 140 cm layer of soil profiles. The research activity was renewed on the territory from 2003, as it was noticed that during the elapsed 25 years the previously sodic landscape significantly changed, though the original sampling sites remained identifiable. The effects of high ground water level were less and less apparent: saline precipitations started to disappear from the soil surface, and the decreasing salt content enabled the gradual advance of grassy vegetation. Samples collected in 1977, 1979 and 2005 made possible the quantitative assessment of soil transformation. These results could also shed light on the physical and chemical background of landscape modification experienced in the past 25 years. The transformation of the soil profile was investigated from two different aspects. Complex instrumental analyses served the assessment of mineralogical processes, while measurements on salt and organic matter content helped to understand the changes in the living conditions of the vegetation. The measurement of total salt, Na and humus content followed the Hungarian patents. Chemical analyses were performed on the upper 30 cm layer of the profiles. In 1977 the X-ray diffractional (XRD) analyses on mineralogical compositions were made in cooperation with the University of Debrecen and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (Szöőr et al 1978, Gerei, Rakonczai, 1985). In 2005 mineralogical compositions were assessed again with the XRD method but this time at the University of Szeged. Images were made with a DRON-UM type diffractometer (LiF monochromator, 35 kV exciting potential, 20 mA anode current) from a 3° to 63° 2θ angle range. Results and discussion The studied soil profile experienced essential changes in the past quarter of a century. The most important modifications were: total salt content significantly decreased, the amount of the previously abundant Na cation dropped, and instead Ca became the dominant. All these resulted a denser vegetation cover, which lead to the considerable increase of humus content. Data verify spectacularly the transformation of soils and provide sound explanations for vegetation change (Fig. 1). The results of X-ray diffractional measurements are presented in Table 1. Concerning both sets of samples the amount of quartz decreases continuously with depth. However there is one important change if 1980 and 2005 data are compared, namely the</p><p id="Pg654">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 2049 proportion of quartz increased significantly in the top layers. The amount of feldspars is balanced both ins space and time. The amount of calcite increases with depth in both the 1980 and the 2005 sequence, and it reaches its maximum at 1 m. Considering the 2005 profile the proportion of calcite is higher, reflecting also Ca increase and the decline of the soil’s sodic character. Dolomite behaves similarly in both profiles and it appears at deeper sections. Chlorite and kaolinite are also stabile their quantity does not change with depth or time. The amount of illite-muscovite and smectite groups increased with depth in both cases, though 2005 data reflect that their maximum shifted to deeper strata. 0 20 40 60 80 100 0-10 10-20 20-30 0 0,1 0,2 0,3 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8 0,9 0-10 10-20 20-30 0,0 1,0 2,0 3, 0 4,0 5,0 6,0 0-1 0 10-2 0 20-3 0 2005 1979 Total salt content (%) Na content (SAR%) Humus content (%) Figure 1.

Cereal Research Communications 2050 In 1980 cenological relieves were made in the study plots by estimating the cover rate of plant species (Kovács and Molnár, 1986). The survey was repeated in 2006 at the same study plots. The cover rate of plants signing of wet-, occasionally flooded soils almost doubled, while the cover rate of fresh and dry soil plant species slightly decreased. The total number of species decreased between 1980 and 2006 (from 40 to 35), however, the number of wetland species increased. Vegetation change clearly indicates the decrease of salinity in the study area (Table 2.). The total cover of the vegetation was higher in 2006 than in 1980. Nevertheless, the cover rate of poly- and euhaline plants halved, although the number of salt tolerant species did not decrease considerably. The number of mesohaline plant species remained the same, though they started to occupy the habitat of highly salt tolerant species, i.e. their cover rate increased. Conclusions It can be claimed that as a result of climate change and concomitant ground water level sinking the chemical state of the soil underwent substantial modifications on the study site. As a consequence, the concentration of Na, characteristic of saline environment, became significantly lower. The increased calcite content of the profile also refers to de withdrawal of sodic processes. Along with the sinking of ground water level the amount of highly mobile minerals (primarily argillic) in the upper layers of the profile decreased. This is a result of leaching processes. The salt tolerant plant populations of the area transformed, the area covered by halinophob species increased. It was proved that the changes in soil characteristics are simultaneously followed by vegetation change. The changes detected were uniform, thus clearly sign the trends affecting the studied environment. References Barna, Gy.: 2007. Talaj- és vegetációváltozások a Szabadkígyósi pusztán. In: Galbács, Z.

NÉMETH Faculty of Agricultural Water and Environmental Management, Tessedik Samuel College H-5540 Szarvas, P.O.B. 3, Hungary; e-mail: nemeth.tamas@mvk.tsf.hu Abstract: In a long term mineral fertilisation experiment the nutrient uptake, dynamics of growth, green mass, sugar yield and dry matter yield of Silage orghum were analysed. The soil of the experimental area was calcareous in the deeper layers, with an 85-100 cm humus layer, pH(KCl) :5,0-5,2, humus content 3,0-3,2%, upper limit of plasticity according to Arany (KA) 50 and clay content 32%. The aim of this paper to demonstrate the relationship among the nitrogen supply, green crop, sugar content and sugar yield of sweet sorghum variety Róna 4. Keywords: N-supply level, green mass, saccharose content, sugar yield Introduction The silage sorghum is a perspective plant for producing bulk feed because it is a relatively good adaptable plant with excellent drought resistance. The significance of such drought resistant plants like sorghum will increase in Hungarian agriculture, as it has been highlighted by several authors (Vágó et al., 2006; Balla et al., 2006; Dobó et al., 2006). Sweet sorghum is characterized by good internal content parameters, and excellent silage can be made of it. The nutrient supply, as an agrotechnical element, has an outstanding role in the increase of green crop and the improvement of feeding value. In development of quality oriented and environment friendly nutrient supply system it is very important to study all those fields that are summarized by Izsáki (1999, 2001 and 2003) as follows: -determination of specific nutrient demand of plants on the basis of yield and quality parameter;-to study the relationships between the nutrient supply, crop yield and quality respectively;-more exact calibration of nutrient supply limit for the different landsite categories;-determination of nutrient supply limits of soil for each plant species and plant group;-studies on relationships of nutrient supply conditions, nutrient concentration and quality of plants. A well-balanced nutrient supply should be ensured after a previous soil analysis as the plants react very sensitively both to the absence and to the predominance of elements. However one has to know the available nutrient content of soil in the interest of so-called economical nutrient supply. If it is unknown, the optimum nutrient doses can’t be applied (Harmati, 1997). One of the aims of our studies was to identify the relationships between the nitrogen supply, green mass, sugar content of the stem juice and sugar yield of silage sorghum as well as to determine the nitrogen supply limits precisely. Materials and methods The experiment was carried out on chernozem meadow soil in the experimental station owned by the Agricultural Sciences Institution of Faculty of Agricultural Water and Environmental Management of Tessedik Samuel College with four different N, P and K supply levels, in total combination of treatments i.e. in 64 nutrient treatments set up in a split-split plot design with three replications. In the frames of the experiment 15 of the</p><p id="Pg657">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 2052 64 nutrient treatments were selected in which the height, number of shoots and leaves of silage sorghum as well as the foliage, green crop, dry matter yield, nutrient content and sugar content of above-ground parts of plants were studied from 2002 till 2004. The total area of plots was 20.0 m2 while their net area was 10.4 m2. The mathematical and statistical evaluation of results of experiment was carried out by Sváb’s (1973) variance analysis. The temperature and precipitation conditions in the summer half-year of experimental year 2002 were similar to the many years average, however the spring was a bit drier and the summer was slightly rainier. Results and discussion Table 1 demonstrates the green crop of silage sorghum in the harvest ripening stage, at the end of milky ripe stage – at the beginning of wax-ripe stage. Based on our studies we can say that in 2002, when the precipitation was adequate, the green crop increased reliably up to the 80 kgha-1 N dose, but the further increase of the dose did not result in significant growth of yield. The 240 kgha-1 nitrogen supply decreased the sugar content of stem significantly. Despite the decreasing sugar content – as a result of increase of green mass – the nitrogen supply up to 80 kgha-1 increased the sugar content per hectare, which is statistically proven. However the increase of sugar content was not identified by the further increase of N. Figure 1 demonstrates the changes in the green crop of sweet sorghum as a function of N-supply and the influence of N-supply on sugar content.. The green mass produce of control plots without N-supply was 47,53 tha-1 . Significant green mass yield increase (63,18 tha-1) was found besides the 135 kg ha-1 NO3 N content of soil. The bigger nutrient supply doses did not increase the yield, moreover the decrease was experienced as a tendency. The highest saccharose content (15,25%) was found in the plant stand of the non-treated control plots in the period of silage ripening stage. The 80 and 160 kgha-1 N doses slightly decreased the sugar content, but the most serious decrease was found and registered at the application of 240 kgha-1 dose (12,51%). The next figure (Figure 2.) shows the relationship between the Nsupply and the sugar yield. According to the experiments the decrease of sugar content as a result of the N-supply is compensated by the increase of green mass. The highest sugar yield (6,57 tha-1) was measured at the 135 kg ha-1 NO3 N of the soil, which is statistically proven, and means 0,92 tha-1 sugar yield increase. The further increase of N supply dose to 160 kgha-1 resulted in mild, while its increase to the dose 240 kgha-1 resulted in significant decrease of sugar yield. Table 1.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 2055 VARIATION IN YIELD AND PERSISTENCE OF WHITE CLOVER UNDER N FERTILIZING AND GRAZING Krešimir BOŠNJAK1 - Josip LETO 1- Mladen KNEŽEVIĆ 1- Marina PAVLAK 1-Hrvoje KUTNJAK 1 1 University of Zagreb, Faculty of Agriculture, Croatia, e-mail: jleto@agr.hr Abstract: Research objective was to examine the effect of nitrogen (N) application (0-N0 and 150 kg ha -1 year -1 -N150) and rotational grazing by cattle (C) and sheep (S) on the dry matter (DM) yield and persistence of white clover in mixtures with grasses. N150 significantly reduced the growing points, stolon length and stolon dry weight by more than 70% compared to N0. Grazing treatment affected stolon population density only in interaction with N. The highest stolon population densities were achieved with SN0. S had higher clover DM yield than C. N0 had higher clover DM yield than N150. However, the interaction grazing management x N rate was significant, so the highest yield of white clover was recorded for SN0. Keywords: white clover, stolon, nitrogen, sheep grazing, cattle grazing Introduction In recent years, environmental and economic factors have stimulated interest in the use of grass/clover swards with low or zero inputs of mineral N, as an alternative to grass swards receiving high inputs of N, for grazing beef cattle and sheep. Obtained yields of different crops can be too small if adequate amounts of N in soil are not available during the vegetation period while, at the same time, excessive fertilization can be very expensive and inefficient in economical and ecological sense (Mesić et. al., 2007). The use of 1 kg active N ingredient can result in 100 kg ha -1 of extra yield on the grassland (Tarnawa et. al., 2006, Husti, 2006). White clover plays an important role in the pasture ecosystem by contributing N fixed by symbiotic Rhizobium bacteria and improving pasture quality. Low sward content and its variability among years, with time of year and with management practices are the main problems encountered. Application of N fertilizer to mixed perennial ryegrass/white clover swards generally results in a decrease of the white clover population density (Frame and Newbould, 1986), although moderate spring applications do not necessarily have this effect (Laidlaw, 1984). Decline in the white clover growth associated with higher N fertilizer rates is even more expressed in grazed swards due to the influence of animals. The reduction in yields and, hence, in persistence of white clover under grazing is mainly due to stolon removal (Evans et al., 1992) and deposition of dung and urine. The objective of the current field study was to examine the effect of N application (N0; N150) and rotational grazing by cattle and sheep on DM yield and persistence of white clover (Trifolium repens L.) in a mixture with cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata L.) and smooth-stalked meadow grass (Poa pratensis L.). Materials and methods The three-year experiment (2000-2002) was conducted in north-western Croatia, at the Faculty of Agriculture experimental station, on brown acid soil (650 m altitude). A mixture of 12 kg ha-1 cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata cv. Amba), 6.4 kg ha-1 smoothstalked meadow grass (Poa pratensis cv. Balin) and 6.4 kg ha-1 white clover (Trifolium repens cv. Rivendel) was sown in August 1998, with a seedbed dressing of 40 kg N, 130 kg P2O5 and 130 kg K2O ha -1. Potash and phosphate dressings were repeated at the same rates in the autumn of 1999, 2000 and 2001. During 1999, the sward was topped</p><p id="Pg661">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 2056 regularly to control annual weeds. In 2000, the total experimental area (0.6 ha) was divided into 12 equal paddocks (0.05 ha). The experiment consisted of all combinations of (i) two grazing managements (rotational grazing by cattle and sheep) and (ii) two annual N application rates: 0 kg N ha-1 and 150 kg N ha-1 in six applications from spring to autumn. The layout was a randomized-block design with three replications. The grazing regime was imposed when the mean sward height was 17-20 cm for cattle and 13-15 cm for sheep and continued until a post-grazing height of 5 cm was attained. Grazing was applied for a maximum of 24 hours with 10-12 Charolais heifers and 35-40 Charolais ewes plus lambs, depending on the herbage available. White clover herbage production was measured before each of the grazing cycles (rotations), from April to October, by cutting at random fifteen quadrats (1x0.3 m) per paddock to ground level. A 200 g sub-sample of the cut material was hand separated in the laboratory, oven-dried for 24 h at 105 0C and weighed to ascertain the clover content. Sward cores were taken for measurements of white clover components: growing point density (axillary + terminal buds), stolon length and stolon dry weight per unit area, twice a year, at the start of grazing in late April and at the end of grazing at the end of October. Fifteen representative turf cores per paddock were taken at random to a depth of ca 50 mm using a golf-course type corer (100 mm diameter). After hand separation in the laboratory, the clover growing points actively growing on the stolon were identified and counted. Clover stolon length per unit area of the ground was monitored at the same time. Roots were clipped off with scissors and discarded, the remaining stolon was then oven-dried for 24 h at 105 0C and weighed. There were 5-7 rotations per year, depending on the year and grazing treatment. All data were subjected to the analysis of variance using the GLM procedure of SAS (SAS Institute, 1997). All variables were transformed by square root transformation. Upon the analysis of variance, a multiple comparison test of average values, along with the Bonferroni correction method, was conducted for the significant effects and interactions. Results and discussion The total precipitation during 2000 (995.6 mm) was 19% less than the long-term average (1230.9 mm) and the mean annual temperature (8.4 0C) was 27% higher than average (6.6 0C). August, with only 0.5 mm precipitation and 2.8 0C higher temperature than average, was especially dry and warm. The following two experimental years were more humid (+104.6 and +20 mm, respectively) and warmer than the long-term average. No significant differences were recorded in the number of growing points, stolon length, stolon dry weight, clover DM yield and contribution to total grassland DM yield between grazing managements and N applications either within or between particular investigation years at the start and at the end of grazing seasons. However, a 60% reduction in the number of growing points, stolon length and stolon dry weight was recorded in April 2001 compared to the beginning of the experiment and a further decrease by more than 75% in April 2002 compared to April 2001 in all treatments and combinations (data not shown). Averaged over all years, the grazing management did not significantly affect the number of white clover growing points, stolon length and stolon dry weight (Table 1), whereas omission of N application (N0) resulted in higher values of all white clover properties compared to N150 (P&lt;0.01). A higher clover yield was obtained under sheep grazing (P&lt;0.05) than under cattle grazing. However, a</p><p id="Pg662">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 2057 grazing management x N rate interaction (P&lt;0.05) was recorded for all investigated properties except stolon dry weight in April. The highest values of the investigated clover properties were recorded in SN0. Rhodes (1991) suggests that a minimum of 20 m m-2 of stolons is necessary in early spring to ensure satisfactory clover development later. This criterion was fulfilled only at the beginning of the experiment when the average stolon length of all treatments amounted to 46.87 mm-2. At the same time of 2001, stolon length dropped to 16.44 mm-2, and to only 3.89 m m-2 in 2002. Reduction in the number of growing points, stolon length and stolon dry weight during the investigation period resulted from N application and the interaction of N application and grazing. The adverse effect of N application on white clover growing points, stolon branching and stolon weight are consistent with the results of field experiments elsewhere (Davies and Evans, 1990; Höglind and Frankow-Lindberg, 1998; Sibbald et al., 2002, Laidlaw and Steen, 1989, Schils, 1997). One of the factors responsible for sudden reductions in clover stolon lengths is a combination of drought and rotational grazing (Brock and Caradus, 1995). During the grazing season of 2000, large deviations from normal monthly precipitation and temperatures were recorded, which probably contributed to the effects of the grazing method and N application on white clover growth. The potential benefits of white clover, namely its ability to fix nitrogen and its superior nutritional characteristics and intake can only be realized if white clover is present in a sufficient amount in the sward. An average content of 30-50% throughout the year has been suggested as a desirable amount (Stewart, 1984). In this experiment, this desirable amount was not achieved in any of the investigation years. Both grazing treatments had a destructive effect on the white clover yield and clover contribution to total sward production. Sheep grazing depressed the clover content less than cattle grazing, contrary to the results of Briseno de la Hoz and Wilman (1981), Evans et al. (1992) and Murphy et al. (1995), who reported that cattle grazing depressed clover content less than sheep grazing in ryegrass/white clover swards. This might be partly explained by the positive effect of more frequent defoliation and a lower sward under sheep grazing which, along with omission of N application, probably caused lower competition of grasses and better light conditions in the sward. It also lessened the white clover overshadowing by the aggressive companion grass cocksfoot and provided somewhat better conditions for its growth. Cocksfoot has been found to suppress white clover growth in established mixtures to a greater degree than some other cool-season grasses (Gooding and Frame, 1997). Table 1.

Conclusions Sheep grazing with absence of fertilizer N had the lowest depression effect on white clover growth which might be partly explained by the positive effect of more frequent defoliation and a lower sward under sheep grazing which, along with omission of N application, probably caused lower competition of grasses and better light conditions in the sward for her growth.

CROATICUS (BORBAS) TUTIN Sanja MORIĆ1- Ines VRŠEK 1-Ana JURIŠIĆ 1-Zoran ŠINDRAK2- Miroslav POJE 1 1 Department of Ornamental Plants, Landscape Architecture and History of Garden Art, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zagreb, Svetošimunska 25, 10 000 Zagreb, Croatia, E-mail: smoric@agr.hr, 2 Department of Pomology, Faculty of Agriculture University of Zagreb, Svetošimunska 25, 10 000 Zagreb, Croatia Abstract: Croatian clove, Dianthus giganteus D´Urv ssp. croaticus (Borbas), the indigenous perennial, neoendemic plant, was chosen out of the flora of the continental Croatia for the placement on the ornamental plant market. Basic prerequisites for the introduction into commercial growing of this attractive species were researched during the three year period of the project "Introduction of indigenous ornamental species into horticulture". Croatian clove could be used in ornamental horticulture for planting in private gardens and public spaces, as a pot flower or cut flowers. As a first step to introduce it into culture, methods and duration of plant propagation were researched. Seeds collected in natural habitats, were sown in unheated plastic greenhouse in two seasons (spring and autumn). It was determined that the sowing date doesn't make any significant difference for the growth parameters of the seedlings, like plant height and plant diameter as well as the number of shoots per plant, which gives us the possibility of growing this species during the year-round floriculture production. Keywords: indigenous plants, sowing date, generative propagation Introduction In horticulture there is a constant search for new species on the market. Besides decorativeness and attractiveness of the plant variety, there is even greater demand for the "natural" looking species which blend in the area where they are introduced so it becomes similar to their natural habitat. Besides lower costs of maintenance and the ecological appearance of such green areas, there are less soil repair interventions which is especially important for all extensive areas, particularly for the larger areas like the ones along the motorway where the ornamental plants, besides visual improvement, successfully prevents erosion as well as on all sloped grounds. Soils get destroyed under the influence of society and anthropogenous landscapes made irrationally without any thought on the sustainable development (Várallyay, 2007). Indigenous plants are a valuable source for enrichment of supply and use of ornamental plants. The goal of the introduction into horticulture can sometimes be protection of endangered plant species of the indigenous flora, and their production can prevent gathering of these plants in nature as well as their endangerment (Noordegraf, 2000). Dianthus giganteus D´Urv ssp. croaticus (Borbas) is a species from the Caryophyllaceae family, an herbaceous perennial ranging in height from 15 to 60 cm. It is attractive because of its grass-like habitus and red purple-colored flowers gathered in bloom, which appear between May and July. According to The Red Book (1994, 2005) it is a sensitive and endangered taxon because of the excessive gathering and the natural succession of the habitat. This perennial is still not in horticultural production, so research is needed for the possibility of use as a pot flower, for cutting, and for ornamental flowerbed. Plant propagation experiments are among the first experiments during the research of the possibility of new species to be introduced into production. According to the research (Hunyadi Borbély et al., 2007 cited after Frank, 1999; Balogh et al., 2007 cited after HoffmannBurucs, 2005, Hoffmann et al., 2006 and Csajbók et al., 2005) significant influence on</p><p id="Pg665">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 2060 the yield have water, nutrients, soil, light, and temperatures, and this is similar for ornamental cultures. For the introduction into culture it is necessary to conduct a research on the possibility of the generative plant propagation, so the goal of this research is to determine morphological plant characteristics like plant height, plant diameter and number of shoots per plant for two plant sowing treatments (spring sowing and autumn sowing) for Dianthus giganteus D´Urv ssp. croaticus (Borbas) species. Materials and methods In 2004 an experiment using the Dianthus giganteus D´Urv ssp. croaticus variety was conducted in the Department of Ornamental Plants, Landscape Architecture and History of Garden Art (Maksimir, Zagreb) as a part of a project "Introduction of indigenous ornamental species into horticulture" by the Ministry of Science, Education and Sports. The seeds were gathered in natural habitats in Croatia and sown by spring and autumn sowing treatments in unheated plastic greenhouse of the Department into Klasmann Substrate 1. basic components of the substrate were a mixture of black and white peat of a very fine structure (0-10 mm), pH (H2O, v/v 1:2.5):6.0, the level of added fertilizer (g/l):1.0 contents of nutrients: 140 mg N l-1, 160 mg P2O5 l -1, 180 mg K2O l -1, 120 mg Mg l-1, trace elements. Multipot in which the seeds were sown was used, and plastic 300 ml pots (number 10) were used for replanting. The first sowing treatment was scheduled for early May, and the plants germinated late May. After one month the seedlings were replanted into plastic pots and kept in the open. In mid July, when it was possible to sell seedlings, a measuring of height (cm), plant diameter in the widest part (cm), and the number of shoots was conducted. The second sowing treatment was in mid October 2004 with similar growth dynamics, a month between the sowing and the germinating, and then replanting into pots of the same size as for spring sowing. The plants were grown in unheated plastic greenhouse. The same measuring as for spring sowing was conducted in March 2005. Data considering morphological traits (plant height, plant diameter and number of shoots per plant) of plants sowing treatments (spring sowing and autumn sowing) were analyzed using the SAS® version 9.1 Data were subjected to the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), where F-test was used to estimate differences between trait means among plant sowing treatments. Regression analyses were performed in order to investigate the nature and intensity of relationships between plant diameter and plant height. Correlation coefficients (r) with p values ≤0.05 were considered significant. Results and discussion Plant height by spring sowing was between 4 and 19 cm, and by autumn sowing 7.5 and 16 cm. Average plant height by autumn sowing measured mid July of 2004 was 11 cm, and the average plant height by spring sowing measured on the same day was 11.9 cm. Plant diameter by spring sowing was between 5.5 and 24 cm, and by autumn between 12 and 25 cm. Average value of the plant diameter by the autumn sowing was larger than the plant diameter by spring sowing by 1.5 cm. The number of shoots on plants by spring sowing was between 2 and 9, and by autumn sowing between 6 and 17. The average number of shoots on plants by autumn sowing is larger than the number of shoots by spring sowing by 5.4 pieces. Based on the collected data, the one-way</p><p id="Pg666">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 2061 analysis of variance was carried out. Data on the plant height, plant diameter and the number of shoots per plant were processed. (Table 1.) Table 1. Morphological characteristics of Croatian carnation (Dianthus giganteus D’Urv ssp.. croaticus) grown by spring and autumn sowing . The values are averages ± SD. Morphological characteristics Growing season Plant height (cm) Plant diameter (cm) Number of shoots/plant Spring sowing 12.02±2.62 15.72±3.76 4.8±1.69 Autumn sowing 11.00±2.66 18.50±3.63 10.2±2.97 F-test n.s.* n.s.* P&lt;0.001 n.s.* - no significant difference There was no significant difference between spring and autumn sowing for plant height and plant diameter traits. This shows that this way it is possible to sow plants in spring for flowering in summer and autumn, and also in autumn for flowering in spring. Linear regression analysis was performed to examine in which way plant height is correlated to plant diameter (Figure 1. and Figure 2.). It can be seen that these two traits are connected almost in the same way and with a similar slope line for both plants grown by spring sowing and plants grown by autumn sowing. Because of the smaller number of plants, the correlation coefficient r was somewhat smaller for the autumn sowing (0.57), but still significant at p≤0.05 (considering F-test). These results give us right to presume that generally the plant height increases evenly with its width. Figure 1.

Conclusion Based on the conducted research and the processed data of measurement it can be concluded that the sowing date had no significant influence on the measured growth parameters like plant height and diameter. Also the plant luxuriance had no measurable influence on the number of shoots, both more and less luxuriant plants grew equal number of shoots by both spring and autumn sowing. Significant correlation of p≤0.01 was determined between parameters of plant diameter and plant height by spring sowing, while by autumn sowing the significance was p≤0.05. The results point to the possibility of the year-round production of the Dianthus giganteus subsp. croaticus species to be used as a pot flower or for ornamental flower beds.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 2063 INFLUENCE OF GRASS-CLOVER MATURITY STAGE ON RUMINAL DEGRADABILITY OF SILAGE Goran PERČULIJA 1 – Mladen KNEŽEVIĆ 1 – Krešimir BOŠNJAK 1 – Josip LETO 1 1 University of Zagreb, Faculty of Agriculture, Croatia, e-mail: gperculija@agr.hr Abstract: The aim of this experiment was the evaluation of the rumen degradation kinetics of the dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP) of grass-clover silage harvested at three phenological stages of grass-clover mixture. Samples were collected from cultivated grass-clover plots established in Zagreb (Croatia) in 2002. The kinetics of degradation of dry matter and crude protein was determined by the technique of nylon bags using 4 Charolais sheep provided with a rumen cannula. Significant differences (P&lt;0,01) were obtained among phenological stages in rapidly soluble and potentially degradable fractions, degradation rates of DM and CP and in the effective degradability (ED) of DM and CP. Keywords: Silage, dry matter, crude protein, in sacco degradability, phenological stage Introduction The yield of arable crops may be influenced by many factors such as water, temperature and nutrient deficiency (Bertić et al., 2007). Grass-clover silage (GCS) varies greatly in terms of chemical and biological composition due to the impact of factors such as the maturity stage at harvesting, sward botanical composition, level of fertilisation, climate and ensiling techniques upon the fermentation process in the silo and on nutritive value (Szabó and Pepó, 2007; Knežević et al., 2007). For grass and clovers in general, the substantial decrease in the feeding value that accompanies advanced maturity is due to chemical and physical changes in the plants. The proportion of cell walls increases in the plant material and the increased lignin content is correlated with reduced forage intake and degradability of the cell wall material in the rumen (Jung, 1989). The present study was carried out under the hypothesis that feeding early-cut silage would significantly increase DM and CP degradability in comparison with the medium- and late-cut silage. Materials and methods Sward and silage making The GCS was made from a semi-permanent, predominately orchardgrass meadow harvested on 18 May, 25 May and 06 June (late vegetative, internode elongation and flowering growth stages of orchardgrass respectively) for silages designated early, medium and late, respectively. Botanical composition was determined from 30 forage samples by manual separation of sward components (grasses, clovers, forbs). The sward contained 80.6% orchardgrass, 13.7% legumes out of which 11.2% white clover (Trifolium repens L.) and 2.5% red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), 2.3% other grasses and 3.4% forbs on a DM basis.Herbage for silage was cut with a disc mower and wilted for 8 h in the swath before harvesting with a round baler. Chemical analysis The DM contents of GCS were determined by oven drying to a constant weight at 60 ºC in a fan-assisted oven (ELE International). Total N concentrations of GCS were determined by the Kjeldahl method (AOAC 1990, ID 954.01) using a Gerhardt nitrogen analyzer. Additionally, N concentration was expressed as crude protein (CP) (total N x 6.25) g kg-1 DM. Acid Detergent Fiber (ADF) and Neutral Detergent Fiber (NDF) were</p><p id="Pg669">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 2064 measured using the procedure of Van Soest et al. (1991). Silage pH was determined in a water extract from 10 g of fresh silage and 100 ml distilled water using the pH meter 315i (WTW). In sacco degradability studies The nylon bag method (AFRC, 1992) was used to determine the rate of degradability of DM from the feeds when suspended in the rumens of four rumen-fistulated Charolais sheep, 4 year old, of approximately 60 kg live weight. The animals were fed a ration of meadow hay and pellet concentrate for sheep in a ratio of 75:25 (DM basis), which was calculated to provide maintenance. The bag size was 10 cm x 20 cm with a pore size 50±15µm (ANCOM Technology Corp., USA). All silage samples were dried and milled trough a 1.5 mm sieve. Then, 5 g of each sample was put in nylon bags and incubated in the rumen for 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h. In each sheep, two bags were used for each time interval. After withdrawing the bags from the rumen, they were put into icy water, then washed in a washing machine for 15 min using cold water and then kept in a freezer. After all the bags had been taken from the rumen, they were dried for 2 days at 60 °C. The value of degradability at time 0 was obtained by washing two bags in a washing machine for 1 h using cold water. For each bag, the residue was analyzed for DM. The degradability at each time interval was calculated by taking the mean value obtained from the eight bags. The percentage of degradability (Y) of DM and CP at time (t) was obtained from an exponential curve of the type: Y= a + b (1-e (-ct)) which was fitted to the experimental data by iterative regression analysis (Ørskov and McDonald, 1979). In this equation, e is the base of natural logarithms, constant ‘a’ represents the soluble and very rapidly degradable component and ‘b’ represents the insoluble but potentially degradable component, which degrades at a constant fractional rate (c) per unit time. The effective degradability (ED) of DM and CP in each GCS was then estimated (Ørskov and McDonald, 1979) by the following equation: Effective degradability (%) = a + bc / c + k In this equation, k refers to the fractional outflow rate of small particles from the rumen. The value of 4% fraction/h for k was used (Alvir et al., 1998). The results on DM and CP degradability were corrected using the NEWAY 5.0 software (Ørskov and McDonald, 1979). The results on GCS chemical composition were analyzed using mixed model procedures while those on in sacco degradability using the GLM procedure (SAS, 1999). Results and discussion Chemical composition of grass silages Silage at a more advanced stage of maturity was harvested 19 days later than the earlycut material and the orchardgrass was stemmy and in full flower, in marked contrast to the early-cut herbage which had no emerged seed heads. The chemical composition of GCS is given in Table 1. Advancing maturity was evidenced by a linear increase in cellwall carbohydrate as ADF (P&lt;0.01) and by a linear decrease in the CP content (P&lt;0.01) in GCS. Higher CP concentration and lower NDF and ADF concentrations in the earlycut silage than in the medium- and late-cut silage can be explained by a higher leaf to stem ratio (Jung, 1989). The average pH values varied from 4.4 in early-cut silage to 5.2 in medium-cut silage.</p><p id="Pg670">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 2065 Degradability characteristics of DM The mean in sacco DM and CP degradability at each time interval is given in Figure 1. and 2. The release of DM and CP from feeds during 3 to 72 h of incubation in the rumen indicates differences in degradation between the forages as well as differences in the final maximum release after 72 h incubation. Differences were the greatest between the early- and the late-cut silages, as expected. Characteristics of the DM and CP degradation of the silages are given in Table 2. Medium- and late-cut silages had a significantly lower (P&lt;0.01) soluble component than the early cut silage. This indicates that early-cut silage may be rich in soluble compounds. The insoluble but fermentable component (b fraction) and its rate of fermentation in the early- and medium-cut silages was significantly (P&lt;0.01) higher than that in the late-cut silage, suggesting lower degradability of ADF and NDF in the latter feed. This superiority of degradable ADF and NDF of the early- and medium-cut GCS may be caused by lower lignin content in these feeds compared to that of the late-cut silage. There was a significant (P&lt;0.01) difference between all feedstuffs in the DM and CP ED, with the highest ED of earlycut silage and the lowest ED of late-cut silage. This study and that of Long et al. (1999) support the view that the herbage maturity stage at harvest is one of the main factors affecting the nutritive value of forages. According to Long et al. (1999), the 48 h in sacco DM degradability varies from 621-778 g kg-1DM. The in sacco DM degradability of grass silages in the present study varied within these ranges. The advancing maturity of grass led to decreased degradation of silage DM as determined using the polyester bag procedure in the rumen (Vanhatalo et al., 1996). 0 20 40 60 80 100 3 6 12 24 48 72 Incubation time (hours) D M d e g ra d a b ili ty ( % ) early medium late 0 20 40 60 80 100 3 6 12 24 48 72 Incubation time (hours) C P d e g ra d a b ili ty ( % ) early medium late Figure 1 and 2.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 2067 ISOLATION A NEW CARBENDAZIM DEGRADING BACTERIUM FROM HUNGARIAN AGRICULTURAL SOIL SAMPLES AND ITS PRELIMINARY CHARACTERIZATION Veronika NÉMETH1 – Zsuzsanna ANTAL2 – Csaba VÁGVÖLGYI2 – László MANCZINGER2 1 Department of Physical Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences and Informatics, University of Szeged, H-6720 Szeged, Rerrich Béla tér 1., Hungary 2 Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Sciences and Informatics, University of Szeged, H-6726 Szeged Közép fasor 52., Hungary, e-mail: manczing@bio.u-szeged.hu Abstract: A new carbendazim degrading bacterium was isolated from Hungarian agricultural soil sample by microbiological enrichment methods. The molecular analysis revealed that this isolate belongs to the Variovorax paradoxus species. The isolate was able to use carbendazim as sole carbon and nitrogen source. The pH optimum and temperature optimum for growth were detected at 6.3 and 30°C, respectively. This isolate seems to be a potential tool for bioremediation of carbendazim polluted agricultural soils. Keywords: carbendazim degradation, Variovorax paradoxus Introduction The use of chemical pesticides in modern agriculture generates many ecological and human toxicological problems (Birkás et al, 2006; Jolánkai et al, 2006, Várallyay, 2006). One of the most frequently used fungicide worldwide and in Hungary is carbendazim (Fig.1.). In spite of its frequent use and importance, there are only a few report dealing with its microbial degradation. The high acute ecotoxicological effect of this compound generates a substantial interest in such processes. Furthermore, carbendazim is a suspected endocrine disruptor in human and animals, so its residues in food are dangerous. Until now, single isolates of Pseudomonas (Fuchs and de Vries, 1978), Rhodococcus (Holtman et al, 1997) and Ralstonia strain (Gui-Shan Zhang et al, 2005) proved to be able to degrade carbendazim. Among fungi, one isolate of Alternaria alternata and Phanaerochete crysosporium were described as good carbendazim degraders (Silva et al, 1996: 1999). Bacterial degradation mechanism and pathway was also partially explored. The first step is the hydrolyzation of the carbamate group and after that the remaining 2-amino-benzimidazole is degraded by ring fission leading to 1, 2- diamino-benzene. This intermedier is further degraded via the beta-keto adipic acid pathway. As part of pesticide degradation studies, this investigation had the aim to isolate bacteria able to metabolize carbendazim from Hungarian agricultural soil samples. Materials and methods Enrichment, isolation and purification of carbendazim-degrading bacteria. Soil samples were collected from agricultural fields in Zala county (Hungary), where carbendazim was regularly used. Isolation of carbendazim-degrading bacteria was carried out via the continuous enrichment culture method. Briefly: 5 g of soil sample was suspended in 50 ml sterilized NaCl solution (1.0 g l-1). From this suspension 0.1 ml</p><p id="Pg673">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 2068 was inoculated into enrichment medium (g l-1): K2HPO4 1.0, MgSO4 x 7H2O 1.0, NaCl 0.5, and carbendazim 200 mg l-1. Carbendazim (94.6% pure) was firstly dissolved in 1 M hydrochloric acid at 20 mg ml-1 concentration. The pH of the medium was about 7.0 after the addition of carbendazim solution. The flasks were incubated in the dark at 20 °C on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm. After 14 days, dilution series were made from each culture and 50 µl aliquots were spreaded onto yeast extract glucose agar plates: (g l-1) yeast extract 2.0, glucose 2.0, Bacto agar 18. Plates were desiccated and incubated for 3 days at 20 °C. Dominant colonies were picked up and tested for their carbendazim degrading ability. Carbendazim degrading abilities of the isolates were measured in enrichment medium supplemented with 50 mg l-1 carbendazim and 150 mg l-1 yeast extract. After incubation, samples from the cultures were diluted to twicefold with ethanol, centrifuged at 10 000 g for 3 minutes and the absorbance of the clear supernatants were determined in a spectrophotometer at 280 nm where both carbendazim and 2-amino-benzimidazole have strong absorbance maximum. The degradation rate of carbendazim was correlated with the reduced absorbance values measured. The taxonomical position of the isolate with best degrading ability was determined by partial sequencing the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. For PCR reaction standard conditions were applied with the following primers: Eub-341f 5’-CCTACGGGAGGC AGCAG3’ and UP-765r 5’-CTGTTTGCTCCCCACGCTTC-3’. Results and discussion From the ten soil samples collected, eight different bacterium isolates were obtained after the enrichment step where carbendazim was the sole carbon and nitrogen source in the medium. The carbendazim degrading abilities of these isolates are presented in Table 1. Table1. Carbendazim degrading abilities of different bacterial isolates obtained from Hungarian soil samples.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 2069 revealed that 10/1 shared 100% identity with the 16S rDNA of strains of V.

Until now only bacteria belonging to the genera Pseudomonas, Rhodococcus and Ralstonia were known as good carbendazim degraders (Gui-Shan Zhang et al, 2005). Our results show that V. paradoxus 10/1 was able to degrade 90% of carbendazim within ten days (Fig. 2.). The isolate was able to grow in ranges pH 5.5-7.5 and temperature 10-40 °C, respectively (Fig. 3.). The carbon and nitrogen source utilization spectra of this bacterium were also investigated. From the tested 23 carbon sources, D-xylose, D-sorbitol, D-mannitol and some amino acids (L-leucine, L-izoleucine, L-proline, L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine) supported its growth. In the presence of glucose, galactose and other common mono- and disaccharides the growth of the strain was poor. From the compounds tested urea, L-glutamine and L-asparagine (besides other L-amino acids were the best nitrogen sources. V. paradoxus utilized NH4Cl and NaNO3 very poorly. 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 0 5 10 15 20 Culturing time (Days) R e m a in e d c a rb e n d a z im ( % ) Figure 1. Structure of carbendazim. Figure 2.

Conclusions Hungarian agricultural soil samples proved to be excellent sources of bacterial isolates with outstanding carbendazim degrading ability. Key parameters of an efficient enrichment technique were determined and optimized. Results of this study proved that besides the ubiquitous soil bacteria Ralstonia, Rhodococcus and Pseudomonas, the members of Variovorax genus have also a great potential and significance in the biodegradation of agricultural pollutants.

The control of quality parameters is difficult, because the amount and quality of the wastes from husbandry and plant production is seasonally different. More variants can be determined connected to the season or any periods. With the utilization of these recipes our aim is to increase the biogas production, and revise the quality parameters of the produced fermented material. We compared the quality and quantity parameters of the input and output materials in the period of 2006. October – 2007. May. The result gave an overview about the effectiveness of the fermentation and more information about the quality of the produced material, with which the following utilizations can be determined. Keywords: biogas, biomass recipes Introduction The potential raw materials of anaerob fermentation among others are the liquid manure from farming and the sewage water from slaughters. The locating and using of liquid manure is a special problem. The liquid manure is produced in large amount has unfavorable pathogen content which causes its pollutant effect (Petersen et al., 2007). During the biomass fermentation two main products are produced. Next to the biogas, the residuum is a useful, good quality organic fertilizer. According to the experiences, during the fermentation the organic content of the liquid manure is decreasing with 4050%, the volume with 15-20%. The number of pathogens, parasites and viruses in the output material is smaller than at the beginning of the degradation. The fermented material contains nutrients in a form that easy to uptake (Schulz and Eder, 2001; Tarnawa and Klupács, 2006; Németh, 2006). The weed seeds lost their germination ability. The odor emission is also decreasing. The control of quality parameters is difficult, because the amount and quality of the wastes from husbandry and plant production is seasonally different. According to scientific papers the best C/N ratio for the effective biogas production is 24,8:1 (Bai and Bartha, 2007). The quality and quantity of input organic materials are various, so it is important to monitoring them. The data about the incoming and uploaded materials is collected at the biogas plant directly, the parameters of the input materials are determined in the laboratories of the plant. The quantity and quality parameters of the daily uploaded and output organic materials were examined through 8 months. The aim was to determine recipes considering the seasonality, maximize the biogas-production with the utilization of these recipes producing a useful organic fertilizer with optimal nutrient content.</p><p id="Pg677">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 2072 Materials and methods The Biogas Plant of Nyírbátor is built and operated by the Bátortrade Ltd., a partner of a company group, which main profile is complex agricultural production and processing. Because of this a huge amount of biomass is produced (Petis, 2005). This biogas plant is the first which based on mixed raw materials. By Kacz and Neményi (1998) the effectiveness of biological degradation can be increased with 40% with the utilization of reactors based on mixed materials, compared with reactors that use only one kind of raw material. In this plant - in long term average - 29% of the biomass is farmyard manure, 13% are fermented products from plant production, 19% is wastes and secondary products of plant production and 39% are animal wastes (Petis, 2007). The biogas plant uses serial connected mezofil and thermofil fermentor-tanks, which have total volume of 17.000 m3. The time-demand for fermentation of the raw materials is determined by their single degradation process. The degradation of cellulose based raw materials from plant production is slower than the green materials and animal wastes. Because of this it is important to select raw materials considering the degradation time for effective biogas production (Petis, 2005). To ensure this pre-fermentation of some wastes is needed to harmonize the degradation time of different materials, and the microorganisms be able to degrade these materials (Bagi et al., 2007). The most economical way of biogas production when it is based on the secondary products and wastes which are locally available (Tamás et al., 2006; Petis, 2007). Almost 50% of the raw materials are produced locally, near the plant of Bátortrade Ltd. The biogas plant is storing one part of the materials. The other part is given to one of the two mixing tanks depending on the daily demands (Petis, 2007). The volume of each mixing tank is 300 m3 which is filled with biodegradable materials and completed with slaughter sewage water. The raw material can be given after homogenization from the mixing tanks and directly to the fermentors hydraulically. The retention time of the substrate is around 18 days in the mezofil fermentors and 22 days in the thermofil fermentors. The daily load of the mezofil fermentor is 18.000 kg organic material if 6% organic content is assumed. This means 2,8 kg organic material per m3. The degraded material is stored in output liquid phase tanks and using as irrigation water with nutrient content (Petis, 2005; Petis, 2007). Results and discussion There is no significant difference between the N contents of the input materials and fermented output materials thank to that minimal N transformed to gas (Figure 1.). That means ammonia is not produced in a large amount in the system, so the anaerob fermentation does not move to harmful microbiological processes. The amount of input N was larger with 1-2% between in wintertime compared to the spring or autumn period because of the increment of animal wastes in the system. In spring and autumn the Nloss was more than 3%.</p><p id="Pg678">VII.

Cereal Research Communications 2074 Conclusions The composition of the input biomass not only influences the fermentation processes, but determines the quality parameters of output from biogas plants. The liquid phase of the output material can be used as an environmental friendly fertilizer to supplement the nutrient content of the soil. Because of its large moisture content it reduces the irrigation costs. The utilization of the different wastes using as biomass can solve two main problems: the disposal of the hazardous materials of agriculture and food industry and give a renewable energy source, the biogas.

Keywords: soil tillage, soil utilisation methods, complex measurements Introduction In the Department for Soil Utilisation and Rural Development of Karcag Research Institute broad examination of new soil use methods was started in 1997 based on the research achievements gained in the past decades. As the soil – besides the climate and weather – is one of the main factors of plant production, which basically determines the quality and economical conditions of production, that is why the knowledge of the effects of plant production on soil is very important. On the Great Hungarian Plain a lot of so called "minute soil" can be found. The time of suitable soil management is very short in the case of these soils because of the short range of optimal soil moisture content. The soil management, before or after the optimum range, can destroy the soil structure. If conventional tillage is applied, the moisture-, air- and heat regime of the soil become worse due to compaction, and the decomposition of crop residues becomes slower. 2/3 of the carbon content of the organic matters getting into soil is emitted into the air in CO2 form contributing to the global climatic change (Birkás, 2002). During the soil tillage research we strained after development of a technological operation which:  contains the possible minimum number of operations,  contains technological elements without turning up operation (ploughing),  saves the useful moisture content of the soil and at the same time provides adequate amount of air,  uses machines with minimal soil damaging effect and makes the soil cultivation cheaper.</p><p id="Pg681">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 2076 Materials and methods The main goal of the soil cultivation experiment set in 1997 was to determine the application possibilities and the efficiency of the applied reduced tillage system that can stop the physical degradation of the soil. The investigated area is at Karcag belonging to the Tiszafüred-Kunhegyes region (Marosi, Somogyi, 1990). The examinations were carried out on the plot H-1, which is a 16 ha plot with meadow chernozem soil on the territory of Karcag Reserach Institute. The treatments were as follows:  conventional tillage on 3.5 hectares,  soil protective reduced tillage on 12.5 hectares. This cultivation system requires special soil tillage tools and machines (Table 1.), which ensure the improve the compacted soil structure (JD-510 Disk Ripper), and also needs special sowing machines (JD-750A, JD-1750 or JD-1760) that can create a proper seedchannel in an uncultivated soil or stubbles due to their special construction. Using the data of complementary measurements (penetration resistance, Tuba-Czimbalmos, 2003; water balances in lysimeters, Zsembeli, 2005; fertilisation, Zsigrai, 2005), we collect data about fuel consumption and tractive power demand. The instruments of the energetic measurements: „Spider-Mobil” data logger, power measuring cells with frame, PLU flow meter. We also have a rev counter and a telemetric meter to measure torque. The precise localisation and the velocity of the tractor are detected by means of a GPS instrument. The actual soil moisture content and the penetration resistance of the soil were measured with a „3T System” electronic probe at the beginning and at the end of the vegetation period. Table 1.

The measurements were done in an undisturbed area, where no soil cultivation took place before. The possible differences in the cultivation influencing the measurement results could be avoided this way. According to our data the tractive power of JD–510 medium-deep loosener was the lowest, hence the most favourable, while the plough needed the most power. This difference originates from the nature of the cultivation, meaning the cutting, lifting and turning of 20,000 m3 soil mass per hectare if ploughing at 20 cm depth is assumed. The physical properties and the groundwater level are also strictly influenced by the method of soil cultivation (Huzsvay et al., 2006). If we compare the soil preparation</p><p id="Pg682">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 2077 made with the JD-510 medium-deep loosener and with the IH 7.2 disc, it can be concluded that the new method is more favourable from the point of view of its loosening and soil moisture preserving effects. This favourable soil state ensures good conditions for winter wheat to tolerate with no yield decrease the droughty period that characteristically occurs before harvest time in our region (Figure 1.). Parallel to the decrease of the number of tillage operations, the energy consumption is decreasing (Nagy et al., 2006). The relative energy consumption values measured in the investigated plot are summarised in Figure 2. It can be concluded that significant decrease of energy consumption can be achieved by the application of a reduced tillage system, in this case 1210 MJ/ha was the difference. Besides saving considerable amount of energy, the costs and the environmental load decrease as well. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33 35 37 39 41 43 45 47 49 51 53 55 57 59 S o il m o is tu re c o n te n t (% ) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 S o il re s is ta n ce ( M P a ) Soil moisture content with JD Disk Ripper Soil moisture content with disk Soil resistance with JD Disk Ripper Soil resistance with disk 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 Traditional tillage Disc Protective cultivation Different soil cultivation method G a so li n e co n su m p ti o n M J/ h a Tyre packer Combinator Disc 2x JD-510 Ploughing Figure 1.

Cereal Research Communications 2078 Conclusions The main goal of this examination is to test the adaptation possibilities of environmental protective soil utilisation methods, which are already widely used in the EU countries, for the circumstances of Hungary, and within that, for the conditions of TiszafüredKunhegyes region. The research results gained so far: We established that the machinery and tools of the soil protective production technology (soil cultivation tools and sawing machines) are well applicable within the frequently extreme climatic conditions characteristic for the investigated area. The quality of the tillage operations is higher comparing to the conventional operations. We figured out that by the application of the new method 50 percent decrease of fuel consumption and 50-60 percent decrease of labour and operation hours can be achieved. Weed control was found to be the critical point of the new soil protective system, the elaboration of its technique is in progress, some preliminary results will be soon available by the practice through extension services. The limits of the application possibilities of the new system will also be determined; therefore the users will be able to do the operations in proper time. Knowing the energetic efficiency of the main crops (winter wheat, maize, sunflower) grown in our region, and taking its low energy- and labour demand and environmental friendly features into consideration, we consider reduced tillage a more favourable and cheaper solution involving further considerable potentials for the local farmers compared to the recently popular trend of bio-ethanol/bio-diesel utilisation even for a longer term.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 2079 RESPONSE OF MAIZE TO LIMING IN NORTHERN BOSNIA Mihajlo MARKOVIC1- Jovan TODOROVIC1 - Milan BIBERDZIC - Zemira DELALIC3 1 University in Banja Luka, Faculty of Agriculture, Republic of Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina e-mail: mmarkovic@blic.net 2 University of Priština, Faculty of Agriculturae, Lesak, Serbia, 3 University in Bihac, Faculty of Biotechnology, Bihac, 77000 Bihac, Bosnia and Herzegovina Abstract: The field trial with hydratized dolomite meal (47% CaO + 34% MgO) applications in four amounts (0 , 5, 10, 15 and 20 t ha -1 ) was conducted on Gradiska hydromorphic soil (four replicates, basic plot 59.5 m -2 ). Maize was grown for three growing seasons (2005 – 2007). Liming resulted by yield increases for 48% (3-year means: 4.19 and 6.23 t ha-1, for 0 and 20 t of lime, respectively). In our study, significant influences of liming on ear-eaf composition at flowering were found for P, Ca, Mg, S, Fe and Mo. For example, by application 5 t ha -1 of lime leaf-P, -Ca, -Mg and -S were increased compared to the control for 12%, 18%, 25% and 22%, respectively. Especially influences of liming were found for Mo status in maize leaf because by using 5 t ha -1 limes it was increased nearly three-fold compared to the control. By additional increases of lime rates to 20 t ha -1 leaf status (P, K, Ca, Mg, S and Mo) were similar (non-significant differences) to the lowest lime rate. Keywords: liming, maize, nutritional status, yield Introduction Soil degradation is oft limiting factor of field crop yields (Varallyay, 2006; Kadar, 2007; Pepo, 2007). In Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&amp;H) soils are limited fertility, mainly because of less favorable physical and chemical properties. Acid reaction and nutritional unbalances, mainly low levels of plant available phosphorus (P) as well as unfavorable physical properties are limiting factor of pseudogley fertility (Okiljevic et al., 1997; Todorovic et al., 2003). Liming and increased fertilization (mainly with P) are usually recommendations for improvement of pseudogley soils (Petosic et al., 2003; Kovacevic et al. 2004). Markovic et al. (2006) shown survey of P nutritional problems under conditions of northern Bosnia. Aim of this study was testing maize response to liming in the Sava valley area, Republic of Srpska, B&amp;H. Materials and methods The field experiment with liming was conducted at April 14, 2005 on Gradiska (Republic of Srpska, B&amp;H) hydromorhic soil (pH in 1nKCl = 4.30; 4.5 P2O5 mg and 6.3 mg K2O 100 g -1 according AL-method; humus 0.93%). Hydratized dolomite meal (47% CaO + 34% MgO) was used in amounts as follows: 0 (control), 5, 10, 15 and 20 t ha-1. The trial was conducted by randomized block design in four replicates (basic experimental plot 7.0 x 8.5 m = 59.5 m-2). NPK fertilization (kg ha-1: 160 N + 120 P2O5 + 120 K2O) were applied in spring before presowing soil tillage treatments in form of NPK 15:15:15 and urea (46% N). Maize (hybrid NS444 – creation of Novi Sad Scientific Institute for Field and Vegetable Crops, Serbia) was sown in the first 10-day of May by pneumatic sowing machine (distance in row 28.0 cm; interrow spacing 70 cm). Maize was harvested manually (4 internal rows from each basic plot). Grain yields were calculated on realized plant density and 14% grain moisture basis. Mean soil sample was taken by auger to 30 cm of depth at end of March 2005. Nutritional status of soil was made by extractions with AL-solution. The ear-leaf (25 leaves in mean</p><p id="Pg685">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 2080 sample) was taken at beginning of silking stage (middle of July 2005) for chemical analysis. The total amount of individual elements in the leaf samples was measured by the ICP-AES technique after their microwave digestion using concentrated HNO3+H2O2. Statistical analysis were made according Mead et al. (1996). Weather characteristics are important factors of maize yields. In general, water shortage, especially in July, are in connection with low maize yields (Josipovic et al., 2005). The growing seasons 2005 and 2006 were favorable because precipitation was adequate for maize need, while drought stress was main weather characteristic of the 2007 growing season (Table 1). Global climatic change forecasts and their impact of field crops growing have been discussed in the recent studies (Mikulec and Stehlova, 2006; Balla et al., 2007; Stekauerova and Nagy 2007).

Excess of water in May 2006 could be responsible for plant density reductions about 30% compared to planned density. Application of the highest lime rate yield for 2005 was increased two-fold. Also, by application the lower lime rates, yields were increased for 40% (5 t lime ha-1) and for 71% (10 and 15 t). In the second year of testing, liming resulted by yield increases up to 44%. In general, under drought stress conditions of the growing season 2007, low maize yields and yield depression as affected by the highest rate of lime were found. Using 15 t lime ha-1 resulted by yield increase for 42 % compared to the control (Table 2). Kovacevic et al. (2006) applied five rates of lime (carbocalk: waste of sugar factory, 39% CaO) up to 90 t ha-1 and field crop yields were increased as follows: up to 50% and 36% (maize for 2001 and 2002, respectively), up to 49% (sunflower 2003) and up to 30% (barley 2004). Optimal lime rates (t ha-1) concerning yield increases were 60 (maize for both year of testing), 45 (sunflower) and 15 (barley). In our study, significant influences of liming on leaf composition were found for P, Ca, Mg, S, Fe and Mo were found. For example, by application 5 t ha-1 of lime leaf-P, -Ca, Mg and -S were increased compared to the control for 12%, 18%, 25% and 22%, respectively. Especially influences of liming were found for Mo status in maize leaf because by using 5 t ha-1 limes it was increased nearly three-fold compared to the</p><p id="Pg686">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 2081 control. By additional increases of lime rates to 20 t ha-1 leaf status (P, K, Ca, Mg, S and Mo) were similar (non-significant differences) to the lowest lime rate. Table 2.

As affected by ameliorative fertilization maize grain yields were increased up to 32% and 17%, for 2004 and 2005, respectively. Conclusions Liming had considerable effects on maize yields from 40 to 100%, depending on the lime rate and the growing season. With exception of low K status (about 1.0 K and dry matter is on marginal level of adequate K supply) nutritional status of maize was in normal ranges for applied treatments.

Keywords: Natural water supply, withdrawing groundwater, water evaporation, Grate Man-Made River Project Introduction In Middle East and North Africa (MENA) the natural water supply is very important for water consumption of population and the agricultural sector. The total available freshwater in MENA region is 467 billion m3 (km3) of which 81,8% is for only Middle East, and of which 70% is only for two countries, namely Turkey and Iran. The remaining 30% is availability for the Arab countries in Middle East (11,8%) and North Africa (18,2%). The Arab World extends from Morocco at the Atlantic Ocean to Iran, at Arab Gulf and Caspian Sea. The growth of population needs much more food production and in consequence of which, water use within unfavourable dry weather conditions based on the global warming process. Materials and methods Continuously in consequence of increasing intensive water use from surface water and soil water, the water shortage can appear as serious difficulty for the population. Also during the irrigation, the evaporate-transpiration results in large losses of water. Even the loss of irrigated raining water can be about 70%, which goes to the air. This evaporation leads to decrease water availability for human use. An annual potential</p><p id="Pg689">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 2084 evaporate-transpiration rate, as the loss of water to the atmosphere, is greater by between two and 20 times the annual rainfall of the region. Only when water -reaches - sub-surface aquifers, is the storage secure from such unwanted losses. Water may be lost on its way to sub-surface storage through evaporation from ground, vegetation and water surfaces. Also the other unfavourable issue for the MENA region, that only 22,7% of all available water is groundwater. The large portion of the surface water results in serious difficulties, because of the warm dry weather the water evaporation is very considerable. Results and discussion The Middle East and North Africa region has very considerable difficulties concerning the environmental conditions, because, excluding Turkey, this region has 1.100 million hectare land where the humid zone is less than 10 percent of the region, the other 90% is dry or drier part of the region, where the 30% of population lives. Also the large scale irrigated areas are only 2% of this total area. The large scale irrigated area includes the Nile and Euphrates-Tiger river-valleys. While 20 million ha of land are irrigated, as 32% of 62,5 million hectare cultivated lands. Based on the international estimation by the 2030, the number of population in this region will be about 300 million, who need much more water for consumption and agricultural production. The increasing population has a possibly the other difficulty in this region, because estimated 1,7% annual growth crop production by 2030, the growth population is about 3-4% annually concerning the estimation of FAO. Also other difficulty, that in 2000 the average yield of wheat was 1,4 ton per hectare. Comparably the average middle yield of wheat was 3 ton per hectare, and its good average yield was 6 ton per hectare in Hungary. In Middle East and North Africa region it often happens, that harvesting can not be realised on all cultivated areas because of the warm and non adequate, dry weather conditions. Also farmers can not buy enough fertiliser for plant production; in spite that countries of this region could consume much more fertiliser than the developing countries averagely at present. The other important difficulty is that the withdrawing groundwater in Libyan coastal, Nile Delta of Egypt and the Middle East‘s coastal areas. Because the water withdrawing is very intensive mainly for agriculture, in this case in 3-5 km distance from the coast the freshwater is reduced and the sea water intruded and took positions closer to the surface. Pumps started pumping the salt water into the place of earlier ground fresh water. Continuously the level of the sea water flowing into place of the earlier freshwater increases over the sea level near to the coast. In order to discontinue this problem under face cistern system should be set up. In Libya the Great Man-Made</p><p id="Pg690">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 2085 River Project (GMMRP) can securely supply fresh water based on the ground water. In Libya total consumption all over the country in 1998 was 3923,76, representing consumption for agricultural purposes, 85% (3335,3 million m3, yearly), urban purposes, 11,5% (452,56 million m3, yearly), and industrial (including oil) purposes, 3,5 % (136 million m3, yearly). Within the GMMRP the 4000 km long water pipeline system. The Great Man - Made River Project is aimed at the delivery of more than 6 millions m3 of water per day on the completion of its five stages, from its resources in the South to the North, where the demand is concentrated. Local resources suffer from significant depletion and depredated quality. As this project is considered as one of the greatest water delivery systems in the world, it is listed among non-traditional water resources, though the transported water is groundwater. Allocations of the Great Man -Made River Water are 80% for agricultural purposes, 12% for urban purposes, and 5% for industry. Operation of the first stage has partially commenced on 28 - 8 1993, and the second stage on 28 - 8 - 1996. Accordingly, 400 million m3 of the first stage water were transported by the end of 1998, and 230 millions m3 from the second stage waters by the end of 1998, mostly for urban purposes. Water desalination is an important and prospective non traditional source. According to the available data, total design capacities of the desalination units executed in the Great Jamahiriya during the last 30 years exceeded 230 million m3 per year, produced by about 400 desalination plants, which makes the Jamahiriya a leading country in North Africa and the Med-Basin in the use of desalinated water. Conclusions 1. In general in costal areas of this region, groundwater can be sea water, because of volume of freshwater is reduced in volume by pumping. This process reflects the changes of natural environment resulted by human activities. As Urban, László declared, that “Since the XVIII century such leading and increasing production has developed, in which natural regeneration can be less possible to offset the negative consequences of human activity” (Urbán, L. 2006, p. 12.). This negative influence of human activities happened in MENA regions, when the groundwater was pumped by human work, so the sea water could inflow into its place at the costal areas. 2. In general based on the natural and geographical conditions of the MENA region the volume of soil water is so much different, for example it is not significant in Egypt and some countries of the Arabian Peninsula. In other countries of the MENA region the soil water contributes to less than 20 per cent of the national water use, like in Jordan. In the other countries like Turkey, Syria and Iraq, which do not have considerable soil water during almost year, but rainfall can provide soil water for winter season, which can ensure some of water for dry-land farming and grazing. In this case soil water considerably supports to increase agricultural yield and food supply for population of</p><p id="Pg691">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 2086 this part of MENA region. 3. Because the soil water can not play significant role of MENA region, it can be important to discover groundwater storage, which can ensure water resource for irrigation. Even this can be very important, when low rainfall can not ensure adequate agricultural yield. 4. The re-use of water has played a major role in the use and management of water in areas where topographic circumstances allowed water to drain from irrigated fields to those located at lower levels further down the system. According to the international estimations the national level Egyptian water utilisation in agriculture, through re-use, is about over 70 per cent. 5. Because the costs were so difficultly established and because much of the desalination activity is concentrated in economies that operate in a privileged world of oil enrichment it is not easy to provide reliable opportunity costs or definitive predictions of what the costs will be in the future.

The results showed that the status of the elements mentioned was highly justifiably affected by the interaction of the fertilisers and apple cultivars used. Keywords: Zeolite, agrozel, soil, apple, microelements, leaf, concentration. Introduction The excessive, frequently uncontrolled and routine use of mineral fertilisers had a very adverse effect on the yield and quality of fruits, including apple, as well as on chemical (pH), physical (structure) and particularly biological soil traits (the presence of beneficial microorganisms) in the recent and far past. Such soils, as a rule, do not have optimum ambient conditions for normal growth and development of the root system. Soil amendment measures for crop cultivation are costly and long-term. One of the measures considered more efficient and cheaper is the use of zeolite, commercially termed agrozel. The use of the said material in fruit plantings in Serbia is considered ground-breaking. Milosevic (2000), Glisic and Milosevic (2003, 2006) and Glisic et al. (2005, 2007) were the first to have studied the agrozel effect on the vegetative growth and yield and macro- and microelement content of apple, strawberry and blackberry leaves. Although apple, like other fruit species, has low microelement requirements for normal life processes, their absence or excess highly adversely reflects on the total biological tree status. The basic objective of the paper was to determine the agrozel effect on the microelement leaf content of the vertisol-grown apple in its ninth- and tenth-leaf period, being the full cropping stage. Material and methods The field experiment The microelement concentration examinations were conducted over the 2002-2003 period in the apple planting established in 1994, 15 km north-east from Cacak. The planting distance was 3  1.2 m (2,778 trees ha-1). Idared and Melrose apple cultivars grafted on the M9 dwarfed vegetative rootstock were used for the research. Slender Spindle was the canopy form employed. The variants (treatments) involving the material added (fertilisers) in November 2001 and 2002 were as follows: A1 - Manure+NPK (15% N, 15% P and 15% K), A2 - NPK, A3 - Agrozel+manure+NPK, and A4 - Agrozel+NPK. The trial was set up following a randomised block design with 10 trees per cultivar in four replications. The fertilisers from the trial treatments were distributed in 0.5 m long bands on both row sides at the rates of 5 kg cattle manure, 100 g complex mineral fertiliser NPK and 1 kg m-2 agrozel. Following the material distribution, rotary hoeing</p><p id="Pg693">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 2088 was carried out for the material incorporation into the soil. Baerlocher et al. (2001) and Butorac et al. (2002) recorded that with its traits of ion exchange and adsorption, water binding and water releasing capacity and binding of heavy metals from the soil, agrozel can indirectly increase the availability of certain elements and provide more favourable ambient conditions for the plant root system to take up nutrients from the soil. Towards July, apple leaves were collected from the mid-portion of the shoots – 20 per tree in all - for the chemical analysis to be conducted for chemical microelement (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, B) determination. Atomic adsorption method by the Perkin Elmer 703 AAS was used to assess the Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn concentrations. The B concentration was established calorimetrically using a Zeiss MK 6 colorimetre with the phenolphthalein indicator. Experimental data were subjected to analysis of variance. For mean separation a Duncan’s test at P &lt; 0.05 was used. Interaction of A and B factors was determined using the LSD test at P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.01. The data were analysed by the ANOVA statistical programme (Mead et al., 1996). Weather and soil characteristics The data presented in Table 1 show that basic climatic factors over the research years were within the long-term mean values. Mean temperature over the growing season (April-October) of 2002 was 0.9°C higher than the long-term mean. Table 1.

A low precipitation level in the first part of the growing season (74 mm m-2 during April and May) was characteristic of the second research year (2003), resulting in the total precipitation amount over the growing season being lower than the long-term mean. According to its characteristics, the soil in the planting belongs to a group of loam soils. The results on its chemical composition are presented in table 2. Table 2.

The zinc concentration in the A2 variant (NPK) was found also to be 30.00 g g-1 dry matter. Boron was the highest in the A3 variant (35.10 g g -1) i. e. when agrozel, manure and NPK were added simultaneously. The analysis of the microelement concentrations in apple leaves by cultivars (factor B) showed the Idared leaves to have had higher iron (163.75 g g-1 dry matter), zinc (31.71 g g-1) and boron (34.71 g g-1) contents and the Melrose ones to have had more manganese (38.06 g g-1) and copper (4.62 g g-1). The analysis of variance showed that the differences in the average microelement concentrations in apple leaves resulted from the statistically highly significant interaction of the fertilisers and apple cultivars used. Comparisons of our results with the ones recorded by Stoilov (1977), Bergmann (1992), Bojic et al. (1996), Porro et al. (2002) and, to a certain extent, by Márton (2004), Nagy et al.

Conclusions Based on the results obtained in this work it can be concluded that the highest iron concentration was determined in the A1 variant (manure+NPK), those of manganese, copper and zinc in the A4 variant (agrozel+NPK) and the highest boron level in the A3 variant with the simultaneous agrozel, manure and NPK addition. The Idared cultivar leaves were recorded to have more iron, zinc and boron, compared to the Melrose ones with higher manganese and copper levels detected. The differences in average microelement concentrations in apple leaves resulted from the statistically highly significant interaction of the fertilisers and apple cultivars used.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 2091 STUDY OF THE FITNESS FROM THE CBP20 MUTANT ARABIDOPSIS Renáta BACSO 1 – Tibor JANDA 2 – Gábor GALIBA 2 – István PAPP 1 1 Dept of Plant Physiology and Plant Biochemistry, Corvinus University of Budapest, Ménesi u 44, Budapest, Hungary. E-mail: renata.bacso@uni-corvinus.hu 2 Agricultural Research Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Martonvásár, Hungary Abstract: Drought stress tolerance is an important trait in horticultural practice and breeding. We found that an Arabidopsis mutant line with improved drought tolerance carried a lesion in the CBP20 gene, which is a member of the nCBC complex. The cbp20 mutant displays only mild pleiotropic morphological abnormalities, but elevated sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA). Apparently this later property leads to fast stomatal closure and thus improved drought tolerance. We studied the physiological consequences of improved water retention in the cbp20 and other ABA oversensitive mutants, with special emphasis on changes of performance of photosynthetic apparatus and competitive fitness coupled with drought hardiness. We found that faster ABA responses of stomata do not impair photosynthetic capacity under non stressed conditions. We found that restricted gas exchange in cbp20 plants did not confer drought tolerance in the presence of competitors for water. These data reveal a new aspect of ecophysiology of water use in plants. Keywords: Arabidopsis, drought stress, fitness studies, cbp20, abscisic acid Introduction Soil water content is elementary for plants under drought stress. (K. Balla 2006.; M. A. El-Tayeb 2006) Plants are able to develop several physiological adaptation mechanisms to tolerate drought conditions. A major control point for water loss is stomatal regulation (Fan et al 2004), although protection against dehydration may also be a result of activation of different stress response pathways (Umezawa et al 2004). A growing number of mutants are being discovered with improved drought resistance phenotype; gcr1 (Pandey and Assmann 2004), mrp5 (Klein et al 2003), cbp20 (Cap Binding Protein 20, Papp et al 2004) are a few examples. Drought resistance may be a consequence of faster stomatal closure, a situation found for example in the cbp20 mutant. Restricted gas exchange may also exert limitation to photosynthesis, thus decreasing the fitness of the plant. We have addressed this question by measuring photosynhetic activity of mutant and wild tipe plants. Restricted transpiration is beneficial when the plant is examined isolated, however not necesserily under competition, which is a case in natural contditions. We also set out to explore this possibility. Materials and methods Plant material and growth conditions: Arabidopsis thaliana cv. Columbia was used as wild type control for the cbp20 mutant. Plants were grown under short day light conditions (10 hours light, 14 hours dark periods) for four weeks after sowing. From the fifth week on long day illumination was applied (16 hours light, 8 hours dark). 8 week old wild type and 9 week old mutant plants were used in the experiments to compensate for the mutants’ somewhat slower growth rate. Relative humidity was kept at 65%, temperature was 21 Co and and photon fluence rate was 120 µEinstein m-2 s-1. Plants were sown in pots according to the patterns in Figure 1.</p><p id="Pg697">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 2092 Watering: On the first day of the measurements the soil was saturated with water to field capacity. This was followed by witholding watering for the duration of the experiment. Characterization of the water status of the plants and soil: Soil water content was monitored by a gravimetric method. Pots were weighed in the early afternoon at the days indicated during the measurement period. Gravimetric water content (GWC) was calculated as a ratio between the water content of pots at field capacity and at the actual time point of the measurements by using the equation below: GWC (%) = [(W-DW) (FW-DW)-1] 100 Where; W – weight of pot at the time point indicated, DW – weight of pot after desiccation, FW – weight of pot at field capacity. Plant water status was characterized by water potential measured by a pressure bomb (PMS610, PMS Instrument Co). All experiments were repeated three times unless otherwise stated, with one representative result shown. Results and discussion Wild type and cbp20 mutant plants behaved as expected when grown in separate pots, mutants remained greener and more turgid than wild type by the end of the app. one week period of water deprivation. The non-wilting phenotype of the mutants however was lost among wilt type neighbors (Figure 1). At the phenotypic level mutants did show wilting and characteristics of water shortage very similar or indiscernible from the other (wild type) plants in the same pot.

The experiment was repeated five times for cbp20 with similar results, one representative is shown. Without irrigation wild type plants (“pattern A” in Figure 3) wilted in about 7-8 days, reaching leaf water potential (-4)-(-5) MPa (Figure 3, line A). By this time gravimetric water content (GWC) has declined to 20% (Figure 2, line A). Pots containing cbp20 mutant plants only (Figure 3) kept more water and plant water potential did not sink considerably. The soil in these pots remained wetter, easily discernable by touching (GWC 40 %, Figure 2). Pots with both wild type and mutant plants lost water at a rate close to “pattern A” pots, with GWC 20% at day 7 of the experiment (Figure 2). Remarkably the leaf water potential of both mutant plants in “pattern B” pots followed the water potential of their wild type neighbors (Figure 3, line „cbp20”). Under limited water supply (half amount of the evaporated water by the mutants to all pots) the observed changes in water potential and GWC of cbp20 were somewhat slower but trends remained the same as above (data not shown). Conclusions Loss-of-function mutation in the Cap Binding Protein 20 gene of Arabidopsis (cbp20) has been described earlier (Papp et al 2004). The main phenotype of this class of mutants is oversensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA), although the mechanism of the effect is not yet fully elucidated. ABA oversensitivity causes faster stomatal closure, thus improved water retention. Restricted gas exchange did not decrease photosynthetic</p><p id="Pg699">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 2094 activity in the cbp20 mutant. This case therefore stomatal limitation may not be effective for photosynthesis. We also investigated the effect of competing neighbors (wild type plants) on the drought resistant phenotype of these mutants. The pressure bomb method proved sensitive to detect moderate water stress in Arabidopsis. We found that when growing among wild type plants water retention in neither of the mutants conferred appreciable drought resistance, as mutants wilted at similar speed as wild type plants around them. Roots of neighboring plants desiccated the soil in the vicinity of the mutants whose water potential declined rapidly following their neighbors. We can assume however that other ABA oversensitive mutants may have different or additional ABA dependent responses activated in response to drought, thus may exhibit improved drought tolerance even in our competitive assay.
