BEF is very rich in content but rare in solid progress. The battery energy storage system (BESS) is making substantial contributions in BEF. This review study presents a comprehensive analysis on the BEF with BESS, in terms of the current study statues, connection to building energy management, integration with renewable energy sources and electric vehicles. In addition, electric vehicle (EV) is found to be flexible by itself for BEF. This study delivers some new insights and findings that the synchronized aging of building and battery and complex optimization with multiple indexes, is still challenging. Additionally, the opportunities behind the challenges are also highlighted that the higher level of BEF can be achieved by tackling the higher level of system complexity. Further, the suggestions about distributed energy control for distributed energy system, as well as coupling building energy pattern with users’ behavior pattern, are also proposed. The review study may further facilitate the BEF with BESS and push forward the synergistic improvement of building energy efficiency, intensity, and flexibility.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en"

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Background</title><p id="Par73">Energy is not only a vital support of modern economy but also the basis for the survival and development of human society. Since industrialization, fossil fuel such as coal and oil has become an indispensable energy basis for human society. However, with the increasing of energy consumption, the shortage of traditional energy has caused serious problems. In the Stated Policies Scenario [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], the growth speed of electricity use is more than a double of overall energy demand, confirming its critical role in modern economies. The share of electricity which is less than the half of oil today, will overtake oil by 2040 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par74">In order to alleviate the situation of energy shortage and the adverse impact of traditional energy on environment, many scientists adhere to the research and development of renewable energy. Progress in the power sector was concentrated while renewable energy is gradually becoming more economical compared to the conventional thermal power. By the end of 2019, renewables provided an approximate more than 26% of global electricity generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Among them, power generation technologies of renewable resources e.g., solar energy and wind energy, have attracted wide attentions and become the main sources of electricity supply. In the mid-2020s, the advancement of wind and solar PV generation outstrips coal in the power generation mix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. More than half of the total electricity generation will be supplied by low-carbon sources by 2040, in which wind and solar PV will play the key roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par75">However, these renewable resources are volatile and unpredictable for power generation. Even with a well monitored and controlled smart gird, the high variability of renewable energy resources requires platitudinous energy storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. With the technological development and cost reduction of electrical energy storage (EES) recently, EES could be installed to optimize the performance and stability of renewable systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The development of battery energy storage system (BESS) technology is found to be critical to the system volatility and unpredictability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In addition, BESS can ameliorate the efficiency of energy utilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and decrease the impact of peak demand period caused by the traditional power grid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Many countries have put forward different electricity pricing policy scenarios to encourage users to use BESS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. From the view point of users, it is the most attractive to use batteries to reduce daily expense. Because the price of batteries is going down and their performances are improved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], distributed electrical storage shows great potentials not only in independent units but also in the electric vehicle fleet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par76">As a top energy user, building energy consumption should also be further optimized. With the continuous improvement of built environment, building energy consumption is increasing compared with the situation decades ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It is of great significance to use BESS in buildings and even to connect it with other networks to form a more effective system for energy utilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and achieve building energy flexibility (BEF). Besides, the combination of photovoltaics, building energy saving and battery storage systems has also proven to be a critical means to mitigate the catastrophic climate change risks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The BESS will certainly occupy a more prominent position in the future for its use in buildings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and make bigger contributions for BEF.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Motivations</title><p id="Par77">It is a critical question that how BESS can be better built and managed, not only for meeting the building energy demand but also for increasing the building energy flexibility (BEF). Energy consumptions of different buildings will vary greatly with time and building function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. BEF is a new concept for solving this problem. Compared with the rigid building load, the flexible building load is obviously more suitable for the actual user’s demand.

In general, BEF refers to the load with flexible characteristics that can actively participate in power grid operation control and interact with power grid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The concept of flexibility means the capability to preserve balance over energy generation and load (i.e., energy consumption) under uncertainty of the power system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The BEF is variable within a certain period, in which the load uncertainty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] should be seriously considered since it has noticeable impact on the results. The building load could be flexible through a resource regulation and dynamic power management tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. And in order to achieve flexible electricity loads, energy storage systems play an important role for load shifting or adjustment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par81">Depending on the forms of energy usage, both thermal energy storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and battery-based electricity storage are critical for BESS as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. For thermal energy storage, it is a novel idea to use building structure and furniture for heat storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. As for battery-based electricity storage, the regulating effect of battery storage on building energy consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and the regulating ability of battery storage on power grid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] all show significant impacts.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Illustration of different flexibility and energy storage options within a building [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/44245_2022_4_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par82">In the overall building energy system, the demand-side response (DR) is closely linked with BEF and BESS. The development of battery promotes the DR, and it can also optimize the use of battery in return [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. DR offers a means of settlement to the grid imbalance which place restrictions on the use of renewable energy. DR could contribute to the stability of smart grid while succeed in cost savings for buildings and other participants in the smart grid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. At present, there are many effective models for DR according to different types of buildings such as commercial buildings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], office buildings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], residential buildings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Research trend and distribution</title><p id="Par83">Since the BEF is an increasing popular topic in the building and energy field, the development trend and distribution need to be identified. The statistical data of the publication years and the nationality of authors are obtained as shows in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> by using the database in the Web of Science with the keyword “building energy flexibility”. The statistical results show that the number of publications of BEF is increasing year by year. Especially in the past decade since 2010, the ascending speed is becoming faster. In fact, from the perspective of literature content, the relevant studies have also been further expanded. The momentum behind this increasing research interest is related to severe energy problems, renaissance of artificial intelligent, evolvement of smart grid as well as some impacts from government policies.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Yearly publications related to BEF and country distributions of authors (data source: Web of Science)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/44245_2022_4_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par84">It is noteworthy that the top six publishing countries account for nearly 90% of the total publication number for BEF. The percentage of China’ contribution is 41.8% which is far more than the second place USA. Ranking as the first place, China plays an important role and is making bigger contribution now. According to the publication data and the trend, it can be forecasted that the publication number in this topic could be over 700 in 2022.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Building energy demand and response</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Building energy demand</title><p id="Par85">A critical analysis on the load features of different building is the basis for a better demand response (DR) management towards BEF. Public buildings have the technical ability to provide a lot of flexibility for the electricity system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The HVAC systems in public buildings can be used as a suitable demand response resource to provide auxiliary reserves for several reasons. The demand response of HVAC system is much faster than the 10 min warming-up fully responding for generators, and the curtailment can be achieved almost immediately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Therefore, when considering energy conservation by demand response management in public buildings, HVAC system is often the main object [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p id="Par86">While the flexible electricity demand in residential buildings suggests theoretically flexible loads of two categories. The first category includes the loads with evident thermal inertia, such as air conditioning and refrigeration, space, and water heating. The second category includes loads with separation of electricity and energy services demand in time. The so-called ‘wet’ implement: dishwashers, washing machines, and tumble dryers are included in this category. Consumers ought to change their demand for energy services such as lighting, cooking and entertainment, which will not be as flexible as they are involved in demand response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p id="Par87">The industrial building sector is particularly suitable to implement DR for BEF, by shifting industrial electricity consumption to night time based on the production need [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Further, most of the manufactured products are much easier to be stored. There is an important distinction between industrial “production” loads and “support services” load. Support serves loads can usually be used more flexibly than the production loads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In the residential and commercial buildings, the control of HVAC and lighting systems can realize the load adjustment, whereas industrial demand side management (DSM) involves power-intensive industrial processes with controlled production levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Building energy demand response</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>General classifications and tools</title><p id="Par88">Demand response (DR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] can be realized by a series of customers’ actions according to specific conditions in the system. End users may need to achieve temporary reducing, increasing, or shifting power consumption by changing the plan of energy consumption, or using on-site generation and energy storage rather than directly taking electricity from the grid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. DR is helpful to combine new decarbonization electric loads and different renewable sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Its arrangement helps to optimize the utilization of existing infrastructure, stabilize the price of electricity market, and decrease the future investments demand of grid and peak load.</p><p id="Par89">DR can be classified based on the timing, frequency, duration, and its predictability and on whether response happens due to manual behavior changes, direct load control, or automation. They may also be sorted as static or dynamic state, depending on whether pricing or other signals follow a preconcert schedule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Distinction between static and dynamic interventions means a lot. The dynamic interventions might change continuously instead of following a predetermined schedule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p id="Par90">Researchers propose different control models for DR in different types of buildings, and energy flexibility is gradually considered in actual use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The DR model based on BEF can be also discussed in terms of economy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Possible business models for energy efficiency and DR providers in various electricity market sections are analyzed. The analysis shows that the demand side surge of energy storage resources will ensure more business models working with the electricity market department. DSM providers can also choose appropriate business models according to the electricity market and the DSM duration/interruption frequency tolerance, ramp ability and required advance notice time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Diverse DR programs may lead to different risks, rewards, and uncertainties. Finding a balance between them may lead to effective DR control solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par91">As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, under the scheme of dynamic DR, it can be further divided into two broad categories. In the first type of “incentive-based DR programs”, consumers get incentives to change their energy consumption patterns based on the supply-side requirement.

The life span is limited but the only thing we can do is to prolong its life span or keep efficiency degradation a minimum within a certain life span. The same principle also applies to the study of building energy system with BESS.</p><p id="Par124">There are many studies putting forward different strategies by considering battery aging issues. The study by Wankmüller et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>] finds that by introducing the penalty cost into the objective function, the energy arbitrage optimization model can reduce the cycling of the battery. And the profitability of the BESS in the whole life can be improved. Cai et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>] presents a model predictive control (MPC) method on the basis of aging-aware for sustainable buildings operation with on-site PV and BESS, which can decline the operating cost by 9% and by 4% at most under the condition of moderately increasing battery degradation. The experimental results by Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] show that the battery has a promising payback time, through the optimally deep discharging rather than the common practice of shallow discharging to prevent phenomenal degradation. Compared to the battery only system, Li et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>] proposed a hybrid energy storage system (HESS), which consists of the superconducting energy storage system (SMES) and the battery, has directly raised the life span from 6.38 years to 9.21 years.</p><p id="Par125">Researchers are calling for the advancements in battery material science to tackle the battery aging issue from the bottom. But that process could be long, and what currently we could contribute in building sector is the optimal control and management of BESS when serving with BEF. In addition, it is noteworthy that most of literature only focused on the issue of battery aging while overlooked that within a certain period of time, the building itself as well as the other energy equipment in buildings are degrading simultaneously. Especially, some studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>] start to notice that the impact of building envelope for the energy flexible buildings is substantial, which means the aging of building envelope will also play an important role.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>System optimizations with multiple evaluation indexes</title><p id="Par126">It is hard to set a clear and ultimate goal for the energy flexible buildings because their performances are linked to many different evaluation indexes.

Overall, the integrated technology selection and operation (TSO) optimization model provides a valuable viewpoint into practical project evaluation, and it is conducive to decrease the non-determinacy of capital-intensive project related system.

Nevertheless, decline of battery costs and supportive policies would confirm that batteries play an increasingly vital role in solar plus systems. Moreover, if taking all the incentives into account, the combination of energy storage and PV power generation may have more profits than PV alone system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. The study of Heine et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>] found that adding batteries which meet 1.5–1.6 times of the annual peak energy purchase demands, offers the maximum NPV for PV-battery systems in locations with appropriate utility ratios.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par129">Tech-economic indexes: The analysis from Bagalini et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>] implies that PV system alone is not economically feasible because of low electricity prices, high technology costs.

Another case study on a single-family house and apartment block was conducted by Foteinaki et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>] in which they emphasized the importance of building envelope considering its thermal capacity. Quantitatively, Ramos et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>] pointed it out that after DSM on building thermal mass is implemented, for heating and cooling, it saves the cost by 3.2% and 8.5% at most respectively.</p><p id="Par136">However, few literatures make collective consideration and deep integration of the above mentioned two aspects with demand side management (i.e. DSM) towards BEF. There is another challenge that if our studies on BEF is expanded from analysis on a single building to a building cluster, an even higher possibility maybe reached. Walker et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>] pointed out that the different thermal load profile among different buildings could offer a great opportunity of energy flexibility.</p><p id="Par137">Besides, an even higher level of building energy flexibility could be released through integration with many more relevant systems, such as building plus EV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] or even including regional heating system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>] and with both fixed and variable feed-in price components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Distributed energy control for distributed energy systems</title><p id="Par138">It is noticed that most of studies on building energy flexibility designed a centralized coordinated energy management system or algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>] to better control each part of the system.

Actually, in some studies, they indeed make distributed energy system in the framework. Concerning an advanced control, multi-agent control (or distributed energy control as a counter part of centralized coordinated energy management), may offer a new horizon for the BEF study.

In recent years, building energy flexibility (BEF) has been a third important element for building energy evaluation and management. Meanwhile, the integration of battery energy storage system (BESS) will playing a big role. There is a noticeable increasing research inputs in this topic while lacking of comprehensive review study. This study provided a comprehensive review and in-depth analysis on BEF with BESS, covering major aspects from some basic structures to system modeling. The following findings and research outlooks are discerned to spread the application of BESS in BEF.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par146">Based on the data survey and statistical processing, it is found that the publication for BEF is increasing in an exponential curve. It is worth mentioning that the publication number from the top six countries possess more than half of the total literature about BEF. China plays an important role in study field, ranking second in the list.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par147">The energy characteristics of various building types are investigated which can offer a better understanding from the angle of end users. This is an initial basis for demand response (DR) management in which the classifications and tools for DR are summarized and their applications for BESS in buildings are discussed. In the utilization, the selection of DR strategy mainly depends on the fluctuation of energy sources, the characteristics of BEF and the local power tariff policy.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par148">The BESS can be divided into stationary (conventional battery) and mobile (electric vehicle) types. For the stationary type, the integration of various renewable energy sources including solar energy, wind energy, and PV-wind energy sources are discussed. For the mobile type, the EV offers new solutions to building energy management, but their interaction and coordination is much more complex than the stationary type. It brings a greater possibility to BEF to meet the demand of market and users.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par149">Finally, the challenges and future research opportunities are identified from 6 aspects, including: the synchronized aging of building and battery and complex optimization; system optimization with multiple index covering from energy to social indexes; the abundant opportunities of BEF behind the challenges of higher system complexity; the great potential of distributed energy control for distributed energy system; the co-working of building energy pattern and users’ behavior pattern; as well as critical technology advances to facilitate BEF. This study may further facilitate the BEF with BESS and push forward the synergistic improvement of building energy efficiency, intensity and flexibility.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (Grant number: No. 51678263) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China (Grant Number: 2019kfyXJJS189).
