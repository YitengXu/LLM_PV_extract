fast increase in the amount of municipal waste and, in turn, issues of rising cost and environmental pollution. Therefore, alternative treatments such as waste-to-energy should be developed in the context of the circular economy. Here, we review the conversion of municipal solid waste into energy using thermochemical methods such as gasification, combustion, pyrolysis and torrefaction. Energy yield depends on operating conditions and feedstock composition. For instance, torrefaction of municipal waste at 200 °C generates a heating value of 33.01 MJ/kg, while the co-pyrolysis of cereals and peanut waste yields a heating value of 31.44 MJ/kg at 540 °C. Gasification at 800 °C shows higher carbon conversion for plastics, of 94.48%, than for waste wood and grass pellets, of 70–75%. Integrating two or more thermochemical treatments is actually gaining high momentum due to higher energy yield. We also review reforming catalysts to enhance dihydrogen production, such as nickel on support materials such as CaTiO<sub>3</sub>, SrTiO<sub>3</sub>, BaTiO<sub>3</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, TiO<sub>3</sub>, MgO, ZrO<sub>2</sub>. Techno-economic analysis, sensitivity analysis and life cycle assessment are discussed.</p></abstract><kwd-group

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par5">Population growth at a greater pace, rapid urbanization, higher living standards and sophisticated lifestyle have a very large impact on consumption pattern and the generation of wastes. Industrial and domestic activities generate waste which may be degradable or non-degradable, hazardous or non-hazardous to the surrounding environment and cause adverse health effects on the living beings. Waste materials can be either in solid or in liquid forms and fall under different categories such as municipal solid wastes, industrial wastes, medical wastes, radioactive wastes, chemical wastes and agricultural waste.</p><p id="Par6">The management of wastes is very important to reduce the adverse effect on the environment. Statistics says that the annual growth rate of municipal solid waste ranges from 3.2 to 4.5% in developed countries and 2–3% in developing countries (Tang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2018</xref>; Monisha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">The emanation of waste in solid forms is of very large proportion and highly complex to handle. The municipal solid waste generation report from the United Nations affirms that almost 100% of the goods procured by consumers get converted to waste in a span of 6 months (Al Rayaan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2021</xref>; Nanda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2021</xref>; Gunarathne et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">Though the recyclable waste proportion is estimated closer to 80%, about 90 to 95% of the wastes reaches the landfills due to improper handling and the disposal of them (Gaeta-bernardi and Parente <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2016</xref>). All developing countries are facing challenges in collecting and disposing the waste. In many countries, food wastes and plastics are the major contributors of municipal solid wastes (Zhou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">2015</xref>; Khan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2016</xref>). Furthermore, due to the outbreak of coronavirus disease followed by sudden lockdown across the world, the drastic increase in the usage of plastic materials, i.e., face mask and gloves, has increased the municipal solid waste generation rate with approximately more than 6000 tons per day in Southeast Asian countries (Yang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">2021</xref>; Cai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">A few decades ago, waste-to-energy technologies were introduced to produce energy and valuable products from waste and paved way for finding technologies in processing wastes based on a tool called ‘waste hierarchy’—reduce, reuse, recycle and recover to landfill (Voss et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">2021</xref>; Smidt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2010</xref>). The aim of waste hierarchy is to reduce the waste generation and to increase the recycle and reuse of the waste materials. Waste hierarchy method helps in reducing greenhouse gas and pollutants which harm the environment (Sánchez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2015</xref>; Sivaprakash et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2011</xref>; Rajamohan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2010</xref>).</p><p id="Par10">The paper and plastic are the major fraction in municipal solid waste ranging from 50 to 80% while the remaining fraction is contributed by textile, wood, sewage waste, kitchen wastes and laundry waste. The composition of municipal solid waste may vary depending on local economy, climatic condition, lifestyle and infrastructure. The waste generation of an area is proportional to the average income of the people. Demolition and construction activities consist of used wood and may contain 2–3% of non-wood such as glass, plastics, concrete and scrap metals.</p><p id="Par11">The annual quantity of solid wastes generated in India has increased from 6 million tons in 1947 to 48 million tons in 1997 and to 90 million tons in 2009 and also expected to increase by 2047 up to 300 million tons (Gupta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2015</xref>). The global generation rate of municipal solid waste is estimated as 1.3 billion tons per year in 2012 and expected to rise 2.2 billion tons annually by 2025 (Couto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2016</xref>). The management of municipal solid waste is commonly reduced by incineration, about mass reduction (70–80%) and volume reduction (80–90%) and utilized as electricity with net electrical efficiency of 30% (Chan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par12">The treatment of municipal solid waste includes dumping in landfills, incineration of waste and waste-to-energy treatments such as biological process, chemical process, bio-chemical conversion and thermochemical processes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Classification of thermochemical and non-thermochemical treatment methods available for energy production from municipal solid waste</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10311_2022_1410_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par13">Plastic materials possess certain intrinsic properties similar to fuels which makes them as a throughput material for the production of heat, steam and several other fuels through thermochemical methods. In addition, biomass from different sources can be used as renewable sources for energy production. During thermochemical treatments when compared to fossil fuels, biomass emits a reduced amount of SO<sub>x</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub> and greenhouse gases (Acharya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2015</xref>; Rawoof et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2021</xref>; Rajamohan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2008</xref>). The waste-to-energy is one of the most promising alternative methods in waste management strategies.</p><p id="Par14">About 80% of energy is derived from the petroleum products to satisfy the energy demand around the world. The thermochemical treatment of municipal waste is gaining momentum as the most promising waste-to-energy production method mainly due to sustainability. The studies showed that less than 100,000 m<sup>2</sup> of land is enough to treat 1 metric ton per year of waste for 30 years, while 3,000,000 m<sup>2</sup> is necessary for landfilling of 30 metric tons of municipal solid waste (Arena <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2012</xref>). The concentration of organic and inorganic contaminant can be securely disposed and utilized by thermochemical treatment without any threats.</p><p id="Par15">The by-products obtained from thermochemical method such as bottom ash, solid residues and metal or non-metal slags are recyclable and can be reused. The emission of greenhouse gas and other pollutants are significantly minimized and estimated that about one ton of CO<sub>2</sub> is retrieved when compared to landfilling. Life cycle assessment studies considered that waste-to-energy technology has a less impact on environment and can be used as a source for power generation. The electricity and process heat from thermochemical treatment method can be utilized for both industrial facilities and for residential or commercial power requirements (Arena <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2012</xref>; Saidi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par16">This review focuses on (i) the outlook of various thermochemical treatment methods of municipal solid waste viz., organic, paper, plastic and mixed municipal solid waste, (ii) latest reforming methods and catalysts available for enhanced fuel production and (iii) practical challenges involved in implementation on real-time applications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Thermochemical conversion technologies</title><p id="Par17">Biomass is a renewable, clean and green source to produce fuels that can cater the energy needs. However, the direct usage of biomass as biofuels has many limitations such as poor calorific value, undesirable moisture content, abnormal composition and properties. Thermochemical techniques offer pathways that alleviate these disadvantages and drastically reduce the undesired by-products by optimizing the operating conditions (Ong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par18">Combustion, gasification, pyrolysis, hydrothermal carbonization and torrefaction are the thermochemical methods that aid in the production of biofuels from lignocellulosic and non-lignocellulosic materials. Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows an outlay on various thermochemical treatments of municipal solid waste for biofuel production and reforming processes.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Production of fuels, electricity and other products by thermochemical treatment of municipal solid waste and reforming methods for hydrogen production</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10311_2022_1410_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Torrefaction into solid products</title><p id="Par19">Biomass can be converted into char, coke and biochar which have similar properties to that of coal. Biochar derived from torrefaction possess properties of coal fuel. Torrefaction is the mild pyrolysis process carried out in the absence of oxygen or in an inert atmosphere at 200–300 °C to produce biofuel with improved fuel characteristics; the torrefied solid biomass has high calorific value, low moisture content and other properties such as grindability and hydrophobicity (Tran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2013</xref>). The aim of torrefaction is to produce solid fuel as an alternative to coal and to produce materials with high hydrophobicity (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par20">The toasted biomass contains much of volatile matter and requires high residence time to reduce the volatile matter. Combustion reactions are suppressed because of low oxygen supply. Improved grindability reduces power cost required for size reduction and enables the displacement of coal usage. Additionally, the lower equilibrium moisture content of the torrefied biomass has the advantages of storage ease and higher heating value (Agar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2012</xref>).</p><p id="Par21">Gaseous products produced in torrefaction process are classified into permanent gas (CO and CO<sub>2</sub>) and condensable gas (acetic acid and water). Torrefaction is also reported as a thermal pre-treatment process of biochar production to improve the energy density and used as a low-moisture feedstock to produce energy. Torrefaction may be light, mild or severe based on the temperature input required to consume the lignocellulosic contents of the biomass. In torrefaction process products can be in all three forms and most of those can be used as fuels. Some of the products received in torrefaction are H<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, toluene and benzene (gaseous form); H<sub>2</sub>O, acetic acids, alcohols, aldehydes and ketones (liquid form); and char and ash (solid form) (Mamvura et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par22">The advantages of torrefaction process include higher heating value, higher hydrophobicity, grindability, lower O/C and H/C ratios and low moisture content of the coal produced (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2015</xref>). Hydrothermal carbonization was considered as the most used thermal technology where the yield of solid biofuel was around 38% when compared to pyrolysis, torrefaction and gasification (15%, 15% and 3%). The hydrothermal carbonized biofuel showed more advantages than fossil and also showed certain constraints with heating value, bulk density, energy density and grindability (Angulo-Mosquera et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Pyrolysis to produce liquids</title><p id="Par23">Biomass can be converted into liquid fuels, namely, bio-oil, bio-diesel and bio-ethanol by using pyrolysis, transesterification and fermentation, respectively. The scope of this review is limited to production of bio-oil through pyrolysis as the other methods are non-thermochemical techniques. In pyrolysis technology waste materials are degraded thermally with restricted supply of air or oxygen at 300–600 °C to generate the energy in the form of fuel, biochar, syngas and biofuel precursors. Pyrolysis is an irreversible process; the materials which undergo the process are continuously subjected to changes in physical and chemical composition (Mamvura et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par24">Pyrolysis process has a wide range of application in chemical industries for the production of methanol, biochar and activated charcoal with the only limitation being emission of harmful gases which causes adverse effect in the environment (Hasan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2021</xref>). The biochar produced through pyrolysis assists in adsorption and used in heavy metal remediation, soil amelioration and carbon sequestration. The biochar is also used as a soil conditioner which can alleviate about 0.75 gigatons of carbon or 2.75 gigatons of carbon dioxide per year if used globally on an average till 2050 (Shahbaz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par25">The fuel product of pyrolysis, called as pyrolytic oil (dark brown color liquid) is characterized by large water and oxygen content, high acidity with pH from 2 to 4, low vapor pressure, high viscosity, weak stability and low heating value (16–19 MJ/Kg) (Kan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2020</xref>). The bonds in hydrocarbons are thermally broken to produce bio-oil at the temperature range of 400–800 °C. Pyrolysis can be slow, fast, catalytic or microwave-assisted. The main products in slow and fast pyrolysis process are biochar and bio-oil, respectively, where slow pyrolysis incurs low heating with long residence time and fast pyrolysis incurs high heating with short residence time (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par26">Bio-oil contains more than 300 organic compounds; however, bio-oil is not directly used as a fuel due to several disadvantages. The by-products generated through the bio-oil production depend on temperature, particle size, heating time, catalyst used and heating rate. High-quality bio-oil can be produced by using noble metal-supported catalyst and further processing in refineries (Ong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2020</xref>).

biomass is burnt in limited supply of air or oxygen to generate producer gas. Producer gas is composed of H<sub>2</sub>, CO, CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> with certain by-products including H<sub>2</sub>S, COS, CS<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub> and HCN (depends on feed). The temperature range of gasification is generally between 600 and 1200 °C (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2021</xref>). The producer gas can used as a direct fuel or can be converted into profitable products like H<sub>2</sub>, synthetic natural gas (methanation) and diesel, jet fuel, gasoline (Fischer–Tropsch diesel process), methanol, ethanol and dimethyl ether (Shahbaz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par28">The product consists of mixture of gases depending on various parameters such as gasifying agent, type of gasifiers used, equivalence ratio, temperature, feedstock particle size, moisture content and catalyst. The gasification process is further classified into steam gasification, supercritical water gasification and catalytic gasification depending on the gasifying agent. The main drawback of using syngas for downstream application is high concentration of impurities such as tar, particulates, alkali chloride and sulfur species. Various hot syngas clean-up systems have been developed for the removal of such impurities.</p><p id="Par29">In combustion technology, heat is the main product and yield depends upon feedstock, gasifier and temperature (750–1500 °C). Almost all solid wastes can be treated using combustion. Other than electricity production, combustion is also used for drying, pre-heating and steam generation in industries. The carbon-based materials like coal are majorly used for production of energy, releasing large amount of CO<sub>2</sub> to the environment (Chan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par30">According to the International Energy Agency, coal contributes to approximately 44% of CO<sub>2</sub> emission in the range of 0.34–0.39 kgCO<sub>2</sub>/kWh.

The activation energy of the blends at 110–600 °C is 170 kJ/mol and at 600–1000 °C is 300 kJ/mol. Increasing paper sludge percentage increased the average activation energy from 200 to 250 kJ/mol.

The degradation properties and degradation mechanisms of plastic wastes are highly complex to assess the feasibility, reactor design and scale-up process (Al Rayaan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2021</xref>). The influence of used and unused plastics refuse-derived fuel in the pilot-scale downdraft type fixed bed gasifier was studied. The results showed that both used and unused plastic waste showed the same yield of syngas but the higher heating value of unused plastic (781 kJ/Nm<sup>3</sup>) was relatively higher than the used plastics (500 kJ/Nm<sup>3</sup>) (Kungkajit et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par46">The pyrolysis of waste plastic stream from industry and household plastic waste was investigated using microwave reactor made of quartz at operating frequency of 25 GHz under N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere with carbon as microwave adsorbent. The pyrolytic products were bio-oil and biochar. The liquid product was quite viscous with certain fraction of aromatic compounds which can be used as a solvent and precursor.

The experimental studies confirmed that 94.48 wt% carbon conversion rate was achieved at 800 °C using 3 wt% feedstock concentrations in a reaction time of 60 min at pressure 23 MPa and also reported that the change in pressure showed a minor change in gasification efficiency of plastics. The analysis of solid residue revealed the depolymerization of plastics and further proceeding of gasification reaction yielded carbon microspheres with a diameter of 0.8–1.5 µm (Bai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par48">Baby diapers are manufactured by using non-biodegradable plastics and super absorbent polymers which make them difficult to deteriorate. The microwave-assisted pyrolysis of used diapers was investigated for the influence of microwave power and operating temperature. The microwave-assisted pyrolysis process produced liquid oil (43 wt%), gases (29 wt%) and char (28 wt%). Alkanes, alkenes and esters were yielded in the liquid oil which has applications for chemical additives and cosmetics other than fuels.

Wet torrefaction experiments were conducted using leaf litter (34.67%), food waste (23.33%), vegetable waste (14.33%), fruit waste (11%) and non-recycled plastics (16.67%). The effect of wet torrefaction was studied at various temperatures (150, 175, 200 and 225 °C) in a 2.5 L stirring reactor. 200 °C temperature, holding time of 30 min and solid load of 1:2.5 were recommended as optimum conditions for the energy yield of 89%.

Particle size fraction below 5 mm (33.4 wt%), 5–10 mm (40.1 wt%) and 10 mm (26.5 wt%) were used. The study inferred that minimizing the size of particle improved the quality of gas in both pyrolysis and gasification.

About 500 g of municipal solid waste was loaded into the reactor for both the processes with the temperature maintained at 400 °C in case of isothermal process. The quality of bio-oil was higher in non-isothermal process when compared to the isothermal process. The bio-oil generated from isothermal process had high acid content which decreased the calorific value. However, the study reported that the product from non-isothermal process showed traces of impurities.

This section focuses on steam reforming, thermo-catalytic reforming and supercritical reforming. Production of tar is a common problem due to incomplete gasification of biomass into syngas. Tar causes severe problem such as clogging, loss in energy conversion efficiency because of the aromatic mixtures present in the tar. Tar contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which is hazardous to the environment when disposed in water resources.</p><p id="Par58">Tar elimination can be accomplished using physical method, catalytic method and thermal cracking.

The different methods involved in steam reforming process are: (i) non-catalytic steam reforming which operates at a high temperature (1000–1400 °C) and (ii) catalytic steam reforming which is carried out at a low temperature (500–800 °C) (Remón et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par60">Thermo-catalytic reforming is an enhanced intermediate pyrolysis process consisting of a 400–500 °C pyrolysis stage and a reforming stage. Thermo-catalytic reforming process produces H<sub>2</sub> enriched syngas, biochar for soil remediation and high-quality bio-oil suitable for hydrodeoxygenation process (Neumann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2015</xref>). The utilization of wide variety of biomasses (high humidity and high ash content) was considered as a major advantage in thermo-catalytic reforming process. Coking is an undesirable side reaction that degrades the activity of catalyst and mechanical strength. Coking can be reduced by optimizing the operating parameters such as temperature, steam to hydrocarbon ratio, space velocity (Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2021a</xref>).</p><p id="Par61">Bio-oil, syngas and biochar are generated during the reforming process. Nearly 30–45% of the biomass is converted to syngas, 7–15% is converted into bio-oil and 25–50% becomes biochar while water is generated as a by-product. Product quality and yield depend on the feedstock biomass composition. Thermo-catalytic reforming conversion process requires both thermal and electrical energy and also utilizes a part of the conversion product toward self-sustainability of energy potentially which lead to economic advantage (Moreno et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par62">The thermo-catalysis of agricultural waste under different reforming temperatures reported that the increment in temperature (500–700 °C) causes adverse effects on properties of the product such as chemical composition, quality and quantity; higher reforming temperature yielded product with high heating value and H<sub>2</sub> content (Santos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par63">Supercritical water reforming is a promising technology which converts wet biomass and organic wastes into hydrogen and syngas without vaporizing water.

The abatement of emission was examined by many researchers and most of the study showed that catalyst and municipal solid waste ratio played a vital role in emission control.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Life cycle stages for sustainable production of hydrogen through reforming from different feedstocks from thermochemical treatments are presented</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10311_2022_1410_Fig4_HTML.png" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p id="Par115">The life cycle assessment of catalytic gasification for H<sub>2</sub> production using wheat straw as feedstock was studied. The process was divided into five units, namely, biomass collection and pre-treatment (P<sub>1</sub>), biochar catalyst preparation using fast pyrolysis (P<sub>2</sub>), two-stage pyrolysis–gasification unit (P<sub>3</sub>), product separation unit (P<sub>4</sub>) and H<sub>2</sub> distribution to downstream plant (P<sub>5</sub>). The study showed that the product separation unit (P<sub>4</sub>) was found to generate higher greenhouse gas and resource depletion impacts (Loy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par116">The valorization of bio-oil using supercritical reforming followed by low temperature Fischer–Tropsch process was studied. The life cycle assessment studies were performed in the three case studies chosen in a comparative way (with or without CO<sub>2</sub> storage). They were (i) complete reforming of natural gas to H<sub>2</sub>, (ii) reforming partial fraction of aqueous phase and (iii) aqueous phase reforming to H<sub>2</sub>. Out of these, the second case study with CO<sub>2</sub> storage showed the lowest global warming potential impact and reported the significant reduction of emission with respect to fossil fuel (Ortiz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par117">The investigation on an innovative management of waste electrical and electronic plastics which includes treatments such as sorting, dissolution or precipitation, extrusion, catalytic pyrolysis and plastic upgrading was conducted.

In addition, the author evaluated the generation of emission for five different engine loads (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 kW) and reported that CO, NO<sub>x</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>x</sub> decreased with increasing load except hydrocarbons (Indrawan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par121">Particulate emission from gasification and pyrolysis of biomass under 500, 600 and 700 °C was studied. The particles emitted from gasification and pyrolysis process were mainly under the size range of 0.25–1 µm and 1–2.5 µm, respectively. The result showed that the highest proportion of particles in the emission were ranging from 0.25 to 1 µm due to their size-dependent volume concentration, which is about 39.60%, 51.94%, 58.14%, 43.08%, 53.16%, 65.29% for 500 °C gasification, 600 °C gasification, 700 °C gasification, 500 °C pyrolysis, 600 °C pyrolysis, 700 °C pyrolysis, respectively (Yao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par122">The influence of mixed waste ratio on emission was studied using five different wastes such as domestic garbage, sludge and swill waste along with coal and grass biomass in circulating fluidized bed at 850 °C. The result reported that the NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emission was reduced by adjusting the ratio and the dioxin emission was lower than the emission standard.

Fine particles with diameter less than 2.5 µm from municipal solid waste and biomass combustion was subjected to cytotoxic test on human adenocarcinoma alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549) and normal human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) and reported that municipal solid waste emitted significantly higher content of heavy metals (Pb, Zn and Cu) and dioxins than biomass, which caused most severe cell injury on BEAS-2B cells than A549 (Shang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par125">The impact of changes in pre-treatment of rice straw combustion on particulate matter size range 1–10 was investigated. The author introduced the combination of water washing, viz., water washing after torrefaction (W–T), torrefaction after water washing (T–W) and hydrothermal carbonization under certain conditions such as oxy-fuel condition (oxy30 and oxy50), long leaching time (24 h), large H<sub>2</sub>O to biomass ratio (40:1). The result showed that W–T ratio (1:40) was suitable for particulate matter size PM<sub>1</sub> emission under oxy50 condition and W–T ratio (1:10) was suitable for PM<sub>10</sub> emission under both combustion condition for practical application (PM: particulate matter) (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par126">The co-combustion of rice husk and coal was carried on drop tube furnace at 1300 °C and studied the formation of PM<sub>10</sub> (particle size 10 µm) from combustion of raw rice husk, torrefied rice husk and blends with lignite.

The study concluded that the non-food waste showed maximum N<sub>2</sub>O emission when compared to food waste (Feng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par128">The greenhouse gas emission of biochar obtained from Mangifera indica seeds and Passiflora edulis shells via torrefaction process at 210–300 °C was investigated and compared the emission performance with coal. The result showed that greenhouse gas emission from obtained biochar was significantly low when compared with combustion of coal and co-firing 10–20% of biochar and coal effectively mitigated the greenhouse gas emission (Lin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par129">Plastic waste was subjected to laboratory-scale pyrolysis process at 500 ± 30 °C with and without catalyst (fly ash and zeolite). The catalyst to feed ratio was 1:10. The engine test showed that using blend fuel (80:20; diesel: plastic pyrolytic oil) reduced oxides of nitrogen and hydrocarbon emission, when compared to pure diesel or pure pyrolytic oil (Singh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par130">The emission characteristics of pyrolytic oil obtained from mixed plastic waste using Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> doped Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> were examined.

Free radical production is one of the important demerits in co-gasification process and the mechanism is still unknown due to the lack of detection methods of free radicals. Research studies to explore free radical issue will be of greater scope in alleviating the limitation of co-gasification processes and make the process prospective on commercial scales. Additionally, studies are needed to integrate two or more thermochemical treatments to give a better energy output. The integration could be torrefaction with pyrolysis, torrefaction with gasification, anaerobic digestion with gasification. The integrative approaches are modeled based on the influence of feedstock composition, optimum operating conditions required, techno-economic and sensitivity analysis.</p><p id="Par133">Furthermore, life cycle assessment studies are required for the waste valorization via integrated pathways. Microwave-assisted and plasma-assisted treatments were stated in various research works, but microwave-assisted are hindered by a lack of understanding in industrial microwave heating applications. However, plasma-assisted solution has been proven as the best method for disposing municipal solid waste and should be made accessible and available at suitable prices by innovative design in municipal corporations.</p><p id="Par134">Liquid fuel obtained via pyrolysis process is considered as the best alternative, but the fuel has to meet the government standards prior to commercial usage. Investigations on the fabrication of novel catalysts, promoters and support materials to enhance the selectivity, productivity and activity with no or little effects on coking, sintering and poisoning can be carried out. Determining the degradation pathways using computational and modeling approaches to generate fuel and energy from the municipal solid wastes in eco-friendly and energy efficient operations can bring an insight to build technologies on this domain that can cater human needs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par135">The step-by-step implementation and proper management of municipal solid waste generation are obligatory at local, national and global levels to have a pollutant free environment. Thermochemical treatment for municipal solid waste has been considered as one of the most promising technologies to convert solid waste into useful and profitable products. This review presents the various thermochemical treatments for municipal solid waste and reforming methods for enhanced biofuel products and reports pertaining to the emission of undesirable products and their impacts on environment are reviewed. The limitations and pragmatic challenges were alleviated by several modifications in the existing technology for practical implementation. Heterogeneous catalysts were used in several works for better catalytic properties yielding promising potential than homogeneous catalysts. Catalysts used in reforming processes for H<sub>2</sub> production and life cycle assessments were briefly reviewed.</p></sec></body><back><sec
