These new effects originated mostly from the van der Waals interaction between the different layers. Here we report that a new optical and electronic device platform can be provided by heterostructures of 2D graphene with a metal oxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>). Our novel direct synthesis of graphene/TiO<sub>2</sub> heterostructure is achieved by C<sub>60</sub> deposition on transition Ti metal surface using a molecular beam epitaxy approach and O<sub>2</sub> intercalation method, which is compatible with wafer scale growth of heterostructures. As-grown heterostructures exhibit inherent photosensitivity in the visible light spectrum with high photo responsivity. The photo sensitivity is 25 times higher than that of reported graphene photo detectors. The improved responsivity is attributed to optical transitions between O 2p orbitals in the valence band of TiO<sub>2</sub> and C 2p orbitals in the conduction band of graphene enabled by Coulomb interactions at the interface. In addition, this heterostructure provides a platform for realization of bottom gated graphene field effect devices with graphene and TiO<sub>2</sub> playing the roles of channel and gate dielectric layers, respectively.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>10933</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>9</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>23</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep14374.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>11</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>26</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep14374" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep14374</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Graphene (Gr) is a very attractive material for diverse optoelectronic and electronic device applications due to its extraordinary transport properties, broad spectral-bandwidth and fast response time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. For many applications, dielectrics layers such as SiO<sub>2</sub> play a crucial role in device operation. In graphene field effect transistors (GFET), graphene provides the active layer where the channel carriers are modulated by gate biasing through the dielectric layer. In graphene optical devices a dielectric layer is needed to induce a built-in potential within the structure so that photo-excited electrons can be extracted from the photosensitive materials into the graphene layer on top. Currently the photosensitive 2D materials such as MoS<sub>2</sub> or WS<sub>2</sub> are widely investigated to enhance photo-responsibility. Recent studies of graphene/photosensitive 2D heterostructures have revealed new physical phenomena such as Moire patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, new Dirac points<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and the Hofstadter butterfly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. These originate from the van der Waals interaction at the interface. The observation of significant improvement of quantum efficiency in Gr/WS<sub>2</sub>/Gr heterostructure resulted from Van Hove singularities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> originated from van der Waals interaction. Due to the lack of direct growth methods, however, fabrication is typically done by exfoliation or transfer methods. Here, we propose new direct growth approach to structure graphene/a photosensitive material and report its dual function (bottom gated FET and photodetector) that make it a unique hybrid device. In this studies, TiO<sub>2</sub> has been considered since it is a well-known material that has been widely used for light harvesting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> as well as a high dielectric constant (~100). These dual characteristics make TiO<sub>2</sub> a very attractive material for the realization of both electronic and photonic devices. The schematic diagram of our growth approach is shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>. The as-grown heterostructure displays both photosensitivity under visible light and field effect phenomena when the gate voltage through the underneath TiO<sub>2</sub> dielectric layer. We demonstrate this dual functionality by depositing two top metal contacts on the Gr/TiO<sub>2</sub> heterostructure to serve as source and drain electrodes. The gating voltage is applied through the underlying TiO<sub>2</sub> on n-type SiC in a bottom gated FET configuration. With the same device configuration, the photosensitivity under visible light illumination is measured by the change of photoconductivity with zero gate voltage. We believe that the observed photo response at zero gate voltage is caused by the optical transitions between the valence band maximum, associated O 2p orbitals in TiO<sub>2</sub> and the conduction band minima, formed by the C 2p orbitals of the graphene in the Gr/TiO<sub>2</sub> heterostructure. The schematic diagrams of device and measurement configurations are shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b,c</xref>. The electrical transport experiments to characterize Gr/TiO<sub>2</sub> heterostructure have been conducted in air.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The schematic diagram of Gr/TiO<sub>2</sub> structure growth and the configuration of its electronic and optical device.</p><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The C<sub>60</sub> is deposited on Ti/SiC to grow graphene.

The growth temperature was kept at 1400 °C during these experiments. First, the C<sub>60</sub> flux was held at 1.6 × 10<sup>−7</sup> Torr while the growth time varied. As growth time increased, the 2D peak position shifted linearly to lower wavenumber. After 30 min. growth, the 2D peak was located at ~2712 ± 5 cm<sup>−1</sup>. With longer growth time (90min.), it shifted to 2705 ± 1.5 cm<sup>−1</sup>. The FWHM of the 2D peak showed similar behavior to peak position. The value of the FHWM decreased from 71 ± 9 cm<sup>−1</sup> (30 min. growth) to 56.5 ± 2 cm<sup>−1</sup> (90 min. growth). The quality of the graphene was estimated from the ratio of the D and G peaks. The growth time dependence of the D/G ratio also exhibited similar behavior to position and FWHM of the 2D peak. Increased growth time resulted in a decrease of the D/G ratio from 0.32 ± 0.07 (30 min. growth) to 0.23 ± 0.01 (90 min. growth). The C<sub>60</sub> flux dependence with two different fluxes was also evaluated. The growth was done at 1400 °C for 2 hr. With increasing flux from 0.8 × 10<sup>−7</sup> to 1.6 × 10<sup>−7</sup> Torr, we observed improvement of graphene quality with a decrease of the D/G ratio and 2D FWHM by 40% and 20%, respectively. The peak position also shifts to lower wavenumber from 2706 cm<sup>−1</sup> to 2703 cm<sup>−1</sup>. Next, the effect of O<sub>2</sub> intercalation at 500 °C at various times was studied with Raman analysis. The 2D peak position shifted slightly to lower wavenumber. A 4hr. intercalation led a 2D peak shift of only 5 cm<sup>−1</sup>, to lower wavenumber. The 2D FWHM showed entirely different behavior. Initially it broadened compared to that of as-grown graphene (12 ± 5 cm<sup>−1</sup> for 45 min. intercalation) and then started to narrow (13 ± 3 cm<sup>−1</sup> for 2 hr. intercalation). The graphene quality variation was estimated by comparing the D/G ratio before and after intercalation. We did not observed any variation of the ratio for intercalation up to 60 min. but a significant increase was observed beyond 60 min.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The comparison of graphene grown on Ti and TiO<sub>2</sub> surface</title><p>Graphene growth was attempted on both Ti and TiO<sub>2</sub> surfaces. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows (a) C 1s and (b) Ti 2p regions of the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra after C<sub>60</sub> deposition on both TiO<sub>2</sub> (red color curve) and Ti (blue color curve). As seen in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, the C 1s region exhibits two distinct peaks, located at 284.7 eV and 281.5 eV, on both surfaces. The higher and lower binding energy peaks are attributed to graphene and TiC, respectively. Typical Ti 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and Ti 2p<sub>1/2</sub> peaks for TiO<sub>2</sub> are located at 459.1 eV and 464.8 eV respectively. However, our results (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>) show the doublet peaks are located at 454.7 eV and 460.7 eV. The peak positions and 6.0 eV peak separation of the Ti 2p doublet agree well with those of TiC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The O 1s peak for TiO<sub>2</sub> is typically located at 530.6 eV but our measurement (not shown here) shows no O 1s peak corresponding to TiO<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, we conclude that C<sub>60</sub> deposition results in graphene and TiC formation on both Ti and TiO<sub>2</sub>. The formation of TiC upon C<sub>60</sub> deposition could be explained by a carbon thermal reduction reaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. A Gibbs free energy calculation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> shows that TiO<sub>2</sub> reacts with carbon to form TiC and releases CO gas above 1300 °C. The high substrate temperature (1400 °C) during C<sub>60</sub> deposition could initiate carbon thermal reduction reactions between molecular C<sub>60</sub> and the TiO<sub>2</sub> surface.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>XPS spectra of graphene grown on Ti metal and TiO<sub>2</sub> surface.</p><p>(<bold>a)</bold> High resolution C 1s spectra for Gr/Ti (blue color) and Gr/TiO<sub>2</sub> (red color).

Furthermore, TiO<sub>2</sub> has been obtained from oxidation of TiC in the temperature range from 623 K to 1073 K in air<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Consequently, the conversion of TiC into TiO<sub>2</sub> was accomplished with an O<sub>2</sub> intercalation procedure. Intercalation was conducted under controlled O<sub>2</sub> pressure (10<sup>−4</sup> Torr) in the XPS chamber (details in Method). <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> shows the evolution of the (a) C 1s, (b) Ti 2p and (c) O 1s spectra as O<sub>2</sub> intercalation progressed. Besides peaks for as-grown graphene at 284.7eV and TiC at 281.5 eV, three peaks associated with C-O (286.1 eV), C = O (288.1 eV) and the π → π* (291.5 eV) transition were observed in the C 1s spectra (not shown here). Since oxygen-carbon bonding was observed in the as-grown sample as well, the existence of C and O bonding might be due to air exposure during transfer from the growth chamber to the XPS chamber. In as-grown graphene/Ti structure, graphene peak is located at 284.7 eV with ~1.2 eV FWHM. However, the shift of peak position to 284.2 eV and the FHWM narrowing from 1.2 eV to 1 eV were observed as intercalation proceeds. We attribute the shift in binding energy to substrate interactions between the Ti and TiO<sub>2</sub>. The conversion of TiC into TiO<sub>2</sub> during intercalation is shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>. The Ti<sup>4+</sup> cation doublet located at 458.8 eV and 464.6 eV and the metallic type bonding (titanium carbide) Ti<sup>0</sup> peaks located at 454.7 eV and 460.9 eV were observed. These peaks are associated with Ti 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and Ti 2p<sub>1/2</sub> transitions, respectively. The evolution of chemical composition at different temperatures and intercalation times is also shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a–c</xref> At 500 °C, the TiC C 1s peak intensity decreases as intercalation proceeds as seen in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref> (three curves on the bottom). This peak was still observable after 12 hrs. of intercalation at this temperature. A higher intercalation temperature yielded a more rapid reduction of the TiC peak intensity. At 700 °C, the TiC peak disappeared after a 2 hr. intercalation while 6 hr. intercalation was required at 600 °C. During the initial stage of intercalation, we observed two oxide states such as Ti<sup>4+</sup> and Ti<sup>3+</sup> along with TiC peaks (Detail in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Information</xref>). TiC related peaks in the C 1s and the Ti 2p spectra were not observed after 6 hr intercalation at 600 °C, which indicates a full conversion of TiC into TiO<sub>2</sub>. A further increase of temperature to 700 °C showed even faster conversion of TiC than was observed at 600 °C. The 2 hr. intercalation fully converted all of the metallic TiC layers into insulating TiO<sub>2</sub> layers as shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> (top two curves in each panel). The O 1s peak (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>) for TiO<sub>2</sub> starts to appear after 1 hr intercalation (not shown here) and its peak intensity increases with further intercalation. We calculated the activation energy for TiO<sub>2</sub> conversion by O<sub>2</sub> intercalation and graphene etching by the O<sub>2</sub> (detail in Method).

Ti/Au contacts were deposited for source and drain contacts on top of the 1 cm × 1 cm samples.  The channel length was about 6 mm. The schematic diagram of GFET structure is shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>. First, the gate leakage current was measured to ensure isolation between the graphene and the n-SiC substrate. The measured gate leakage current was on the order of picoamps over the gate voltage range of ±10 V (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">supplementary Information</xref>), indicating strong isolation was provided by the TiO<sub>2</sub>. The gate response was measured for a gate voltage range of ±20 V and is shown in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>. Starting with hole-doped graphene the current flow between the source and drain decreases as the gate voltage decreased to ~3 V. Beyond this voltage, the source-drain current starts to increase as gate voltage goes negative, showing the characteristic V-shaped ambipolar behavior of graphene.

However, its large bandgap (3.2 eV) has restricted its use to ultraviolet applications since the photo response is only activated under ultraviolet radiation. Several approaches have been proposed to extend its photo response to a broader range such as dye sensitization, doping and coupling with semiconductors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. To explore possible photonic applications we measured the photosensitivity of our Gr/TiO<sub>2</sub>/n-SiC heterostructures at room temperature (RT). The schematic diagram of measurement is shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a</xref> compares the I–V curves with and without visible light illumination under zero gate bias voltage. A white light LED (Power ~36 mW) was used for illumination and the source-drain bias voltage was swept from -1V to 1V. In the dark, a linear I–V relation was measured with 0.048 Ω<sup>−1</sup> conductance. Upon illumination, the device showed an increased current flow through the source-drain contacts with increased current flow at high bias voltage. The conductance of the graphene improved to 0.06 Ω<sup>−1</sup>, indicating a visible light photoresponse in our heterostructure. The calculated photo-responsivity of the heterostructure is about 278 mAW<sup>−1</sup>, which is much higher than that reported for modified graphene photo-detectors such as graphene metal junctions (6.1 mAW<sup>−1</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, graphene p-n junctions (10 mAW<sup>−1</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> and biased graphene (0.2 mAW<sup>−1</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Note that our measurements were performed with a low intensity white LED light while modified graphene photo-response experiments were conducted under illumination from a high intensity laser source. The gate response under gate bias with and without light illumination is shown in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>. In the dark, the transfer characteristic exhibited typical ambipolar behavior of graphene. The CNP was ~ + 1.5 V, indicating hole doping of the graphene layer. Under illumination, however, the response changed entirely. The source-drain current increased continuously as the gate voltage was varied from −20 V to 10 V. Multiple devices tested under the same conditions showed similar behavior. At positive gate voltage, the photoconductivity becomes much higher than that of the negative gate voltage region because photon induced electrons increase the net charge flow through the graphene. In the negative gate voltage region the induced holes reduce the net current between the source and drain. The output characteristics under illumination as shown in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref> clearly show the increase in photo-induced conductivity. While the gate voltage changed from −20 V to 20 V, the drain current also increased, corresponding to the increase of photo-conductivity. At V<sub>g</sub> = −20 V, the graphene photoconductivity resulted in a conductance of 0.052 Ω<sup>−1</sup> while it increased to 0.06 Ω<sup>−1</sup> at 20 V. The difference between negative and positive gate voltage might be related to variations of net current flow through the channel. The response to turning the light on and off was measured under 0.2 V bias between source-drain as shown in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>. The gate voltage was set to zero volts. Upon turning the light on the photocurrent sharply increased. When the light was turned off, the photocurrent quickly dropped to the dark state. The rise and fall times of our device were about 0.4 s. The fast temporal response is quite different from that of bare graphene and graphene hybrid photo-detectors that have a slow response to external light illumination with typical rise and fall times of several seconds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Since the photo-excited electron-hole pairs in graphene recombine very rapidly due to the symmetrical electrode structure, the low light absorption (2.3% per mono-layer) of graphene and the zero bandgap, the photo-response of graphene is weak. To improve its response, modified graphene structures such as graphene-metal junctions, graphene p-n junctions, graphene coupled to waveguides and biased graphene have been proposed but the reported photo-responsivity is still in the range of 10 mAW<sup>−1</sup>, which is lower than that of our photo detector. Since the large bandgap (3.2 eV) of TiO<sub>2</sub> does not allow for a photo-response to visible light, the photo-response observed here might originate from the Gr/TiO<sub>2</sub> heterostructure. A possible mechanism for the enhanced visible light photoresponse seen in our Gr/TiO<sub>2</sub> heterostructures may be provided by Geng, Liu and Yao<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In an attempt to explain the reported visible light photocatalytic effect of TiO<sub>2</sub>/graphene composites they calculated the electronic properties of atomic scale TiO<sub>2</sub> clusters on graphene films and predicted anchoring of the clusters by charge rearrangement at the interface due to an interaction between the Ti 3d orbitals of the TiO<sub>2</sub> and the p orbital of the graphene sheet. This results in extra states in the bandgap of TiO<sub>2</sub> which enable absorption of visible light by the composite and the transfer of photoexcited electrons from the TiO<sub>2</sub> valence band to the graphene conduction band. The subsequent separation of electrons and holes in graphene and TiO<sub>2</sub> leads to long carrier lifetimes. In addition, since the interface between TiO<sub>2</sub> and graphene plays a critical role, they also suggested that increasing the interface contact area could improve the photo response. We speculate that a similar process may be taking place in our comparatively large area heterostructures. The absorption of light takes place primarily in the TiO<sub>2</sub> closest to the interface where their density of states is modified by the presence of the graphene layer. Electrons then transfer to the graphene layer and increase the electron density. The separation of electrons and holes reduces recombination and the holes in the TiO<sub>2</sub> can screen the gating effect under positive bias while inducing more holes in the graphene layer under negative bias, leading to a reduced photoconductivity at negative bias. This model explains our experimental results shown in the gate response characteristics (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). In the modified graphene photo detector structures, the temporal light on/off photo-response showed slow rise and fall times because the photo-excitation is not related to a bandgap transition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Therefore, we believe the abrupt on/off response seen in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref> is likely due to transitions between the TiO<sub>2</sub> O 2p valence band and the graphene C 2p conduction band minimum of the Gr/TiO<sub>2</sub> heterostructure.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Photo-response of Gr/TiO<sub>2</sub> heterostructure at zero gate voltage.</p><p>(<bold>a</bold>) I<sub>sd</sub> vs. V<sub>sd</sub> output characteristics in the dark (red color plot) and under visible light illumination (blue color plot).
