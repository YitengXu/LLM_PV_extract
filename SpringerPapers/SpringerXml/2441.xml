The link between climate change<index-term id="ITerm22"><term>Climate-Change</term></index-term> and natural disasters is becoming clearerâespecially through developments in impact attribution research. High-resolution datasets and more sophisticated models have allowed researchers to find the fingerprint of climate change<index-term id="ITerm23"><term>Climate-Change</term></index-term> in individual weather events (Ornes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2018</xref>).

IPCC defines climate-induced extreme weather events as climate extremes (IPCC, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2012</xref>).

Bangladesh is geographically, geologically, hydrologically, and meteorologically vulnerable to natural disasters. It is the largest delta on earth facing the Bay of Bengal formed at the confluence of three major rivers: Brahmaputra, Ganges, and Meghna. This unique landscape creates ideal circumstances for cyclones, floods<index-term id="ITerm36"><term>Flood</term></index-term>, and storm surges. Meandering rivers change course due to riverbank erosion with silted islands (<italic>chars</italic>) forming and disappearing in a matter of years. Bangladesh has always wrestled with abundance and scarcity of water: too much water floods<index-term id="ITerm37"><term>Flood</term></index-term> a large swath of the country in the wet season, while too little water causes droughts during the dry season. The plate tectonics of the Himalayan region also brings moderate to severe earthquakes to the country (GoB, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2009a</xref>).</p><p id="Par12">The demography of Bangladesh also adds to its vulnerability<index-term id="ITerm38"><term>Vulnerability</term></index-term> to natural disasters. It is the most densely populated country in the world (except a few smaller nations/states with population &lt;â10 million) with a total population of ~â165 million and a population density of ~â3,277 per square mile (United Nations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2019</xref>). About 63% of the population living in rural<index-term id="ITerm39"><term>Rural</term></index-term> communities are predominantly engaged in farming<index-term id="ITerm40"><term>Farming</term></index-term>and fishing<index-term id="ITerm41"><term>Fishing</term></index-term>, often poor and without access to adequate infrastructure (The World Bank, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2018</xref>). Many of these communities are situated in disaster-prone areas and are exposed to a multitude of natural disasters that exacerbate poverty, landlessness, and loss of livelihood<index-term id="ITerm42"><term>Livelihood</term></index-term>. A study published in Nature Communications states that more than 70% of the total number of people worldwide currently living on climate implicated land are in eight Asian countries, including Bangladesh and India (Kulp &amp; Strauss, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par13">From the north of the sub-continent, climate-induced glacial melt is bringing more water with heavy sediment loads from the eroded soil of the Himalayas down to the riverine delta. Monsoon rain floods<index-term id="ITerm43"><term>Flood</term></index-term> large parts of the country and dry season droughts triggered by extreme heat evaporates the water and deposits silt in riverbeds. This creates the perfect storm for catastrophic annual floods<index-term id="ITerm44"><term>Flood</term></index-term> that erode riverbanks and inundate farmlands, villages, and towns. Normal flooding (<italic>barsha</italic>) affects about 25% of Bangladesh each year, but land use and settlements are well adapted to it. Severe flooding (<italic>bonya</italic>) or flash floods<index-term id="ITerm45"><term>Flood</term></index-term> (<italic>baan</italic>) can submerge more than half of the landmassâdamaging crops and property, disrupting economic activities, and causing injury and loss of life.</p><p id="Par14">From the south, a rising ocean aided by stronger tidal and wind movements is forcing volumes of water inland causing coastal flooding, erosion, and saltwater intrusion. Formerly fertile agricultural lands have become unfit for cultivation and freshwater fisheries are rendered unfeasible. Before and after the monsoon season, cyclones with wind speeds up to 280 kmph develop in the Bay of Bengal with predictable regularity. Storm surges and associated tidal waves rise to 10Â m in height resulting in catastrophic consequences for the coastal inhabitants (Schmuck, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2003</xref>). Cyclones bring multiple threats of severe winds, storm surges, and heavy rainfall<index-term id="ITerm46"><term>Rainfall</term></index-term> that result in both surface and riverine flooding, with bigger storm surges often inundating areas protected by embankments<index-term id="ITerm47"><term>Embankments</term></index-term>. The frequency of floods<index-term id="ITerm48"><term>Flood</term></index-term> and storms (including cyclones) in Bangladesh shows a clear increase in the total number of events in the three most recent decades compared to the previous two (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">16.1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 16.1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Occurrence of floods<index-term id="ITerm49"><term>Flood</term></index-term> and storms by decade in Bangladesh since 1970.</p><p><italic>Source</italic> Authorsâ calculations based on data from the Emergency Events Database, Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, UniversitÃ© catholique de Louvain</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/504755_1_En_16_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par15">Over the centuries, the people of Bangladesh have learned to develop ways of life adapted to the inevitable natural calamities of the area while still aspiring to improve the socio-economic circumstances of the poor and the vulnerableâespecially since the nationâs independence in 1971. However, climate change<index-term id="ITerm50"><term>Climate-Change</term></index-term> has become the straw that threatens to break the camelâs back for this naturally and demographically vulnerable country. It is predicted that with a 0.5-m sea-level rise, Bangladesh could lose approximately 11% of its land, affecting an estimated 15 million people living in its low-lying coastal region by 2050 (EJF, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020</xref>). A 1.0-m sea-level rise could submerge 17% of the coast, inundate 20% of the country, and potentially displace more than 30 million people (Glennon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2017</xref>). It is thus not surprising that Bangladesh has often been labelled as âground zero for climate change<index-term id="ITerm51"><term>Climate-Change</term></index-term> or the poster child of climate vulnerabilities and impactsâ (Szczepanski et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Anatomy of Disaster Management in Bangladesh</title><p id="Par16">Major developments in disaster management<index-term id="ITerm52"><term>Disaster management</term></index-term> in Bangladesh began in the 1990s. At the national level, the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief (MoDMR) was responsible for inter-ministerial planning, coordination, and disaster response. Under the MoDMR, there are two agencies: the Disaster Management Bureau (DMB) and the Directorate of Relief and Rehabilitation (DRR). The DMB, established in 1993, was a small professional unit at the national level that performed specialist functions at both national and local levels. The government also set up a national council and various committees at national, district, Upazila (sub-district) and union (local council) levels for disaster preparedness. The main focus of disaster management<index-term id="ITerm53"><term>Disaster management</term></index-term> was relief and rehabilitation guided by the first Standing Orders on Disaster (SOD) published in 1997âlater modified and translated in English in 1999 (Haque &amp; Uddin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par17">The 2000s saw a global shift in disaster management<index-term id="ITerm54"><term>Disaster management</term></index-term> towards a more holistic model that prioritized prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery.

A significant part of the losses can be attributed to climate change<index-term id="ITerm93"><term>Climate-Change</term></index-term> (GoB, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>). From <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2010</xref>â2015, there were 17 high/medium impact natural disasters in Bangladesh and many localized hazard events, with economic losses ranging from 0.8 to 1.1% of GDP (GoB, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2017</xref>). According to a study on disaster-related public spending, the Government of Bangladesh allocated Tk. 15,097 crore (~ US$19 billion) for 164 projects between 2011 and 2015. Out of this allocation, 68.5% was spent for disaster preparedness and risk reduction.

The UDMC immediately called an emergency meeting and informed both the Upazila level committee (UzDMC) and the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB). The UDMC promptly employed 100 labourers to repair the embankment<index-term id="ITerm145"><term>Embankments</term></index-term> (using an earmarked fund: The 100-day work budget). In addition, 50 volunteers, including the WDMC members of Ward nos. 2, 3 and 4 participated in the repair work.

The WDMC of Ward#4 played a critical role in reducing the risk of embankment<index-term id="ITerm147"><term>Embankments</term></index-term> failure throughout the process: from the initial communication and information dissemination to the evacuation of people and completion of the emergency repair work. Cyclone Fani caused widespread damage elsewhere including the death of 81 people in India and Bangladesh and USD 8.1 billion in economic losses (AON, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2020</xref>). The President of the WDMC said: âAs a local community<index-term id="ITerm148"><term>Community</term></index-term> member it is our responsibility to do the immediate response, the WDMC gave us a platform and idea about formal process of response through the appropriate authority.

These systems have greatly reduced the scale of loss of lives, livelihood<index-term id="ITerm163"><term>Livelihood</term></index-term> and property in the country (see Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">16.3</xref>). The takeaway lessons from the DRR and ERM<index-term id="ITerm164"><term>Emergency response management (ERM)</term></index-term> systems in place in Bangladesh are summarized below.</p><p id="Par44"><italic>Government Commitment and Institutional Framework</italic></p><p id="Par45">Disaster preparedness, management and recovery are high priority activities for Bangladesh. The government has taken a holistic, multi-level, multi-sectoral and multi-stakeholder approach to develop policies, guidelines, management and action plans, legal frameworks, rules, and implementation plans to address these issues. The Prime Minister of the country heads the<index-term id="ITerm165"><term>Disaster management</term></index-term> National Disaster Management Council (NDMC). Legal mandate afforded by the Disaster Management Act of 2012 empowers the disaster management institutions<index-term id="ITerm166"><term>Institution</term></index-term> to coordinate across various levels of the government and leverage resources from a wide range of stakeholders<index-term id="ITerm167"><term>Stakeholders</term></index-term>.</p><p id="Par46"><italic>Stakeholder Engagement</italic></p><p id="Par47">The<index-term id="ITerm168"><term>Stakeholders</term></index-term> national level committees have representation from all relevant government units and ministries as well as inclusion of international agencies, non-governmental agencies, and private entities as appropriate. At local levels, government representatives interface with local organizations (religious and educational institutions<index-term id="ITerm169"><term>Institution</term></index-term>), local dignitaries and volunteer networks. Vertical integration of management bodies between all levels ensures chain of command, information flow, clear designation of roles and responsibilities and appropriate legal and logistical support. This institutional setup also facilitates the development of joint implementation programs by government entities, international organizations, NGOs, and the civil society.</p><p id="Par48"><italic>Community-Based Programs</italic></p><p id="Par49">NGO initiatives parallel to government programs are creating innovative new programs at the grassroots level<index-term id="ITerm170"><term>Grassroots level</term></index-term>on education<index-term id="ITerm171"><term>Education</term></index-term>, awareness building<index-term id="ITerm172"><term>Awareness building</term></index-term>, infrastructure solutions and grassroots-level disaster management<index-term id="ITerm173"><term>Disaster management</term></index-term>. The <italic>Letâs Hear Rana Bhai</italic> example illustrates one such initiative. These community-based approaches coordinate local response with the engagement of local institutions<index-term id="ITerm174"><term>Institution</term></index-term> and people through trained volunteers, prior installation of critical infrastructure (e.g. cyclone shelters<index-term id="ITerm175"><term>Cyclone shelter</term></index-term>) and logistical support during and after disasters. Access to local knowledge, resources and volunteers facilitate the development of cost-effective alternatives to top-down infrastructure solutions.</p><p id="Par50"><italic>Livelihood Solutions</italic></p><p id="Par51">Forest<index-term id="ITerm176"><term>Forest</term></index-term> conservation programs in several coastal communities in Bangladesh are achieving disaster risk reduction<index-term id="ITerm177"><term>Disaster risk reduction (DRR)</term></index-term> while protecting community<index-term id="ITerm178"><term>Community</term></index-term> access to subsistence resources. All along the coastal belt, there are thousands of multi-purpose cyclone shelters<index-term id="ITerm179"><term>Cyclone shelter</term></index-term> which function as schools during normal times and act as a refuge during disasters. Many of these shelters in the Coxâs Bazar area have been retrofitted with ramps for movement of livestock during disastersâthus saving lives. Livelihood<index-term id="ITerm180"><term>Livelihood</term></index-term> and income-generating opportunities empower vulnerable communities in tandem with DRR efforts.</p><p id="Par52"><italic>Gender Inclusive Approaches</italic></p><p id="Par53">Women are often disproportionately burdened by natural disasters. For example, water scarcity<index-term id="ITerm181"><term>Water scarcity</term></index-term> due to salinity<index-term id="ITerm182"><term>Salinity</term></index-term> intrusion often results in women having to travel longer distances to collect drinking water. The institutional mechanisms in Bangladesh require representation and participation of women in all committees at the local levels. The DRR program development process also mandates consideration of gender-specific issues and solutions. The CBA-ECA program in Teknaf demonstrates how this can be accomplished. Ensuring womenâs health and well-being make their communities more resilient.</p><p id="Par54"><italic>Resilience Building and Sustainable Development Goals</italic></p><p id="Par55">NPDM 2016â20 is<index-term id="ITerm183"><term>Resilience building</term></index-term>organized around<index-term id="ITerm184"><term>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</term></index-term> the theme of building resilience for sustainable human development which recognizes how building resilient communities go hand in hand with DRR and ERM<index-term id="ITerm185"><term>Emergency response management (ERM)</term></index-term>.

Both infrastructure solutions and community-based programs of DRR and ERM<index-term id="ITerm188"><term>Emergency response management (ERM)</term></index-term> have potential for reducing setbacks towards SDGs.

NGO initiatives to pilot WDMCs like the <italic>Panii Jibon</italic> project by BPDC in Goroikhali have led to formal adoption of the WDMC model in the updated 2019 Standing Orders on Disaster (SOD). The DRRO of Coxâs Bazar, the lead government official at the district level, lauded the idea of WDMCs promoted by NGOs and acknowledged that this model would fill a gap at the grassroots level<index-term id="ITerm192"><term>Grassroots level</term></index-term>and make DRR and ERM<index-term id="ITerm193"><term>Emergency response management (ERM)</term></index-term> more effective. This positive and collaborative culture of cooperation is not a happenstance, but the result of a multi-level institutional framework that fosters relationship building in the service of an essential humanitarian cause.</p><p id="Par58">Finally, we note that this study is an effort to document the framework of disaster management<index-term id="ITerm194"><term>Disaster management</term></index-term> in Bangladesh and tease out important lessons and best practices. A critical analysis of the limitations and opportunities for improvements of disaster management<index-term id="ITerm195"><term>Disaster management</term></index-term> systems in Bangladesh is also important but has not been addressed in this chapter.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Concluding Remarks</title><p id="Par59">Disaster management<index-term id="ITerm196"><term>Disaster management</term></index-term> and emergency response will be part of the new reality as the world experiences a rapidly changing climate with uncertainties and inadequate global response to reverse the course of human activities that fuelled this crisis. Unexpected events such as the Covid-19 pandemic will further endanger communities, exacerbate vulnerabilities and alterÂ the traditional ways of life. We hope that the detailed description of the institutional mechanisms, perspectives on implementation of the programs at the ground level and stories of innovation from Bangladesh presented here will offer useful lessons on disaster management<index-term id="ITerm197"><term>Disaster management</term></index-term> for other South Asian countries, developing nations around the world and vulnerable communities of western countries. As for Bangladesh, while the country has managed to significantly reduce human casualty, many more are likely to succumb to future disasters. There is a long road ahead with opportunities for further innovation, but no room for complacency.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Partial support for this research was provided by an implementation grant from the Henry Luce Foundationâs Luce Initiative on Asian Studies and the Environment (LIASE) for faculty research support at Oberlin College.
