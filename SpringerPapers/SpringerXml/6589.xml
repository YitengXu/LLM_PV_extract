Red (R) and blue (B) lights are often used, being highly active for photosynthesis. The effect of R and B spectral components on lettuce plant physiology and biochemistry and resource use efficiency were studied. Five red:blue (RB) ratios (0.5-1-2-3-4) supplied by LED and a fluorescent control (RB = 1) were tested in six experiments in controlled conditions (PPFD = 215 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, daylength 16 h). LED lighting increased yield (1.6 folds) and energy use efficiency (2.8 folds) as compared with fluorescent lamps. Adoption of RB = 3 maximised yield (by 2 folds as compared with RB = 0.5), also increasing leaf chlorophyll and flavonoids concentrations and the uptake of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and magnesium. As the red portion of the spectrum increased, photosystem II quantum efficiency decreased but transpiration decreased more rapidly, resulting in increased water use efficiency up to RB = 3 (75 g FW L<sup>−1</sup> H<sub>2</sub>O). The transpiration decrease was accompanied by lower stomatal conductance, which was associated to lower stomatal density, despite an increased stomatal size. Both energy and land surface use efficiency were highest at RB ≥ 3. We hereby suggest a RB ratio of 3 for sustainable indoor lettuce cultivation.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fundación Séneca (Fundacion Seneca)</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">https://doi.org/10.13039/100007801</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">20555/IV/18</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orsini</surname><given-names>Francesco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>9</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>19</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2019_Article_50783.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">In the coming decades, agricultural production may be constrained by limited availability of water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> and mineral nutrients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> as well as reduced availability of labour and accessibility to land and fertile soil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Concurrently, worldwide increases in urban population are resulting in higher food needs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Indoor vertical farms with full electric lighting have been suggested as a strategy to overcome land and resources scarcity by increasing water and nutrients use efficiency, thanks to the complete control of environmental factors and the limited exchanges with the external environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. A simulation study with lettuce<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> showed that vertical farms can increase land, water and nutrients use efficiency as compared to greenhouses located in Sweden, The Netherlands or the United Arab Emirates, although at the cost of elevated energy needs mainly associated with electric lighting. These achievements are related with the higher number of plants per unit land area thanks to the use of multiple growing layers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, but also to the possibility to recover water lost by transpiration and excess minerals and water draining from the growth media<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. As for the quality features, the available possibilities for manipulating environmental conditions inside vertical farms were reported to allow for increased nutraceutical value (e.g., with reference to antioxidant content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>) or decreased contamination risks (e.g., heavy metal deposition, pesticide application or nitrate accumulation in leaf tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>). To date, however, the main constraints that limits large scale application of vertical farms are the high initial investments and the higher costs associated with energy consumption for illumination, cooling, heating, and dehumidification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, as technology in LED application successfully evolves toward increasing the efficiency in converting electricity into light useful for photosynthesis (e.g. with values up to 2.6 μmol J<sup>−1</sup>, according to Radetsky<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>), a growing number of studies suggest that the overall efficiency of the system is highly dependent on the lighting strategy (e.g. spectral composition, intensity and photoperiod<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>). Accordingly, specific portions of the spectrum are considered to be major energy sources for photosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, given that the quantum yield curve of chlorophyll contains two peaks at the red (600–700 nm) and blue (400–500 nm) ranges. As a consequence, it is generally assumed that LED light use efficiency for indoor plant cultivation is highest with a combination of red and blue LEDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. A major share of the available research on vertical farming systems has targeted the cultivation of lettuce (<italic>Lactuca sativa</italic> L.), due to its short growth cycle, the small plant size and the overall adaptability to intensive growing conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The combined search for the terms <italic>Lettuce</italic> and (<italic>plant factory</italic> or <italic>vertical farm</italic> or <italic>light emitting diode</italic> or <italic>indoor cultivation</italic> or <italic>indoor farm</italic>) in SCOPUS® database resulted in more than 280 research papers in the last ten years, with more than 50 papers published on the topic only in 2018. Nevertheless, the great variability of the spectra used in currently available literature (e.g. only RB = 8 against fluorescent or monochromatic red LED in Yorio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>; RB = 1 against monochromatic blue or monochromatic red in Johkan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, or RB = 3 against a mixture of red, green and white LEDs or a fluorescent light in Lin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>) does not allow for identifying the optimal red:blue (RB) ratio in the light spectrum for lettuce cultivation. Indeed, what emerges is that the adaptation of the currently available plant growing technologies into indoor farming systems is a complex puzzle that requires a systematic approach, starting with the definition of the optimal light spectrum. Accordingly, the present study aimed at the identification of how variations in the RB ratio of the incident light (see spectra in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) affect sustainability and resource use efficiency in indoor grown lettuce, by dissecting growth performance and related physiological and biochemical adaptations of the plant.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Light spectra used in the experiments.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2019_50783_Fig1_HTML.png"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Lettuce response to changes in spectral RB ratio</title><p id="Par3">Due to the absence of significant interaction between light treatment and experiment within the trials realised at Bologna University, mean values for each treatment from the five experiments (exp. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) are hereby presented and discussed. Fresh yield progressively increased from RB = 0.5 to RB = 3, whereas no further increase in yield was observed when RB exceeded 3 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). No differences in yield were observed between FL and LED lights at similar RB value (RB = 1) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). A similar yield response to RB ratio was also observed during exp. 6, where RB = 3 resulted in a yield increase by 34% as compared with RB ≤ 1 (average values from RB = 0.5 and RB = 1, data not shown). Previous evidence of the promotion of lettuce growth associated with mixed red and blue light was provided by Johkan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, where plants grown under monochromatic red light had lower yields when compared with plants grown under lights supplying RB = 1. On the other hand, monochromatic red was shown to promote shoot yield in both red and green lettuce, as compared with a number of red and blue combinations in another study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Fresh yield was also increased when lettuce plants were grown under monochromatic red light as compared with mixed red and blue or a monochromatic blue light<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, albeit at the expense of a lower plant dry matter content. It shall be noted, however, that the combination of red and blue light was beneficial for lettuce plant growth as compared with either monochromatic blue or monochromatic red light in another experiment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, overall suggesting that there is an optimum RB ratio. In the current study, the yield increase associated with the increasing red fraction of the spectrum only occurred up to RB = 3, and higher RB values did not result in additional lettuce yield (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). Similarly, plant dry weight increased by the increase of the red light component up to RB = 3, and it decreased at RB = 4 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>), suggesting an optimum response of dry weight to red and blue light ratios, as recently confirmed in greenhouse grown tomato undergoing supplementary LED lighting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The increase in dry weight in response to additional red light was previously suggested by Snowden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> who reported the highest dry yield in lettuces grown under LED lights featuring RB ranging between 4 and 7 as compared with higher or lower RB values. Under fluorescent light, plant dry weight was significantly smaller than under the LED treatment supplying RB = 1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). The beneficial effects of LED lighting on dry weight accumulation were previously evidenced in studies where a control treatment with fluorescent lamps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> or a combined fluorescent + high pressure sodium lamp<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> was included. From the same study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, it was also concluded that the combination of fluorescent and high pressure sodium light resulted in lower dry matter content in shoots of lettuce as compared to their growth under LED light supplying a mixture of red and blue light with an RB up to 3, whereas, higher RB ratios or a monochromatic red light reduced dry matter content. In our experiments, dry matter accumulation followed an optimum function, with the highest dry matter content associated with RB = 2 and RB = 3 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). As compared to plants illuminated with a similar RB ratio provided by LED lamps, those grown under fluorescent lamps (FL) presented significantly lower dry matter content (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>) due to lower plant dry weight (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>) despite a statistically similar fresh weight (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). It was previously suggested that lettuce grown under fluorescent light compensates for the reduced photosynthetic efficiency with greater light interception by a larger leaf area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, as also observed in the current study, where FL presented the highest leaf area (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>), with similar values being achieved only with LED light with RB = 4. The increased leaf area under FL light, but lower dry mass accumulation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>) resulted in higher specific leaf area (SLA) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). The larger leaf area and higher SLA of lettuce grown under fluorescent lights instead of red + blue light was previously associated with puffiness (e.g. softer leaves) and a loose shoot structure of the former<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, a response that was observed during our experiments.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Plant fresh weight, (<bold>B</bold>) plant dry weight, (<bold>C</bold>) dry matter content, (<bold>D</bold>) leaf area, and (<bold>E</bold>) specific leaf area (SLA) for lettuce plants grown under LED lights with different RB ratios (closed symbols) or under fluorescent light (open symbols).

Our results are consistent with the findings reported by Snowden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, who observed that the leaf area was reduced for lettuce grown under 200 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> PPFD when the blue light fraction of the RB spectrum was increased. This dwarfing effect of blue light was previously observed for rice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, grape seedlings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and strawberry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. On the other hand, among LED treated plants, the highest SLA was observed at the lowest RB ratio (RB = 0.5; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>), mainly due to the constant decrease of dry weight in response to decreased RB values (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">Other than leaf area, blue light may also influence leaf morphology, altering stomatal density and size, for instance in grapes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. For our study, stomatal size was generally increased by LED lights as compared with FL, and a progressive increase in size was also associated with the increased fraction of red light in the spectrum (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). On the other hand, stomatal density (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>) and conductance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>) were shown to decrease when light with RB ≥ 2 was supplied. In a previous study, Wang<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> reported that stomatal density and stomatal conductance decreased in lettuce leaves in response to increased RB ratios. Similarly, increases in the red light fraction were associated with a concurrent decrease in stomatal conductance in cucumber<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The role played by blue light in increasing stomatal conductance is a well-documented phenomenon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, which is due to the fact that stomatal guard cells open by the blue light receptors phototropins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Increase in plant photosynthetic net assimilation associated with augmented blue light was also previously observed in lettuce plants grown under 500 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> PPFD, whereas no significant differences in photosynthetic efficiency appeared when a number of red and blue spectra were compared at 200 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> PPFD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In our study, the plant PSII quantum efficiency (Fq’/Fm’, measured during exp. 6) decreased with increasing RB ratio; Fq’/Fm’ was 0.52, 0.51, 0.50, 0.50 and 0.48, respectively for RB values of 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 (data not shown). In a previous study on cucumber<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, the variations in the RB ratio presented a significant though limited effect on Fq’/Fm’, which decreased when the red portion was increased from 50% to 85%, 93% and 100%.

(Belluno, Italy) and featured hyper red (peak at 669 nm) and blue (peak at 465 nm) emitting diodes, whose relative light intensity were set using a digital control system provided by the lamp supplier. Spectral properties were determined using an illuminance spectrophotometer (CL-500A, Konica Minolta, Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan). A constant PPFD of 215 ± 5 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> over the plant canopy was measured using a QSO (Apogee instruments, Logan, UT, USA) PAR Photon Flux Sensor (with equal sensitivity to red and blue radiation), connected with a ProCheck handheld reader (Decagon Devices Inc., Pullman, WA, USA). Electric power consumption (W = J s<sup>−1</sup>) was measured using a multimeter (Fluke 189, Fluke Corporation, Everett, WA, USA). All instruments were periodically checked and calibrated by manufacturers and when indicated by the manufacturer guidelines calibration was also performed at the time of measurements. In order to define the lighting system’s efficacy for converting electricity into light, the PPFD:electricity ratio (μmol J<sup>−1</sup>) was estimated through flat-plane integration technique as the ratio of the incident PPFD (μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) at a set distance (40 cm, equal to the height of the lamp from the canopy in all experiments) and the light electric power consumption (LEPC, W m<sup>−2</sup> equal to J m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.

LED treatments were characterised by five red:blue (RB) photon flux ratios of 0.5 (RB = 0.5, LEPC: 154 W m<sup>−2</sup>, PPFD:electricity ratio: 1.40 μmol J<sup>−1</sup>), 1 (RB = 1, LEPC: 172 W m<sup>−2</sup>, PPFD:electricity ratio: 1.25 μmol J<sup>−1</sup>), 2 (RB = 2, LEPC: 210 W m<sup>−2</sup>, PPFD:electricity ratio: 1.02 μmol J<sup>−1</sup>), 3 (RB = 3, LEPC: 219 W m<sup>−2</sup>, PPFD:electricity ratio: 0.98 μmol J<sup>−1</sup>) and 4 (RB = 4, LEPC: 219 W m<sup>−2</sup>, PPFD:electricity ratio: 0.98 μmol J<sup>−1</sup>).

During each experiment, six separate compartments (each 0.64 m<sup>2</sup> surface and 0.4 m<sup>3</sup> volume) of a climate controlled growth chamber were used. Each compartment was sealed with light opaque walls, internally painted in white, and equipped with fans constantly replacing internal air (200 air exchanges per hour). Before each experiment, full randomisation of light treatments was operated. Seeds were germinated in a potting media composed by a mixture of peat and vermiculite (70:30 v:v), under fluorescent lamps (FL, TL-D 90 De Luxe 58 W, Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands, featuring RB = 1, PPFD: 215 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>; LEPC: 386 W m<sup>−2</sup>, PPFD:electricity ratio: 0.55 μmol J<sup>−1</sup>). Fourteen days after sowing (with plants presenting two true leaves), plantlets were removed from the substrate by gently washing roots and transplanted into individual hydroponic systems (jars of 1 L of volume each) resembling a deep water culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> with roots constantly submerged into a nutrient solution (electrical conductivity, EC: 1.6 dS m<sup>−1</sup>, pH: 6.5; N-NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>: 14 mM; N-NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>: 4.4 mM; P: 1.0 mM; K: 5.0 mM; S: 2.0 mM; Ca: 1.2 mM; Mg: 5.2 mM; Fe: 17.9 μM, Cu: 2.0 μM, Zn: 3.8 μM, B: 11.6 μM, Mn: 18.2 μM, Mo: 0.5 μM).

The six light treatments (one in each compartment) started at transplanting and included a control with fluorescent light (FL, with RB ratio of 1, details above) and five different LED light treatments where the RB ratio ranged from 0.5 to 4 (RB = 0.5, RB = 1, RB = 2, RB = 3 and RB = 4). Each compartment contained 48 plants (6 rows x 8 columns) and measurements were taken on the central 9 plants.
