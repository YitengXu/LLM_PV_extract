In particular, organic molecules are a class of metal-free compounds that consist of earth-abundant elements with good synthetic tunability, electrochemical reversibility and reaction rates. However, the short cycle lifetime and low capacity of AORFBs act as stumbling blocks for their practical deployment. To circumvent these issues, here, we report molecular engineered dihydroxyanthraquinone (DHAQ)-based alkaline electrolytes. Via computational studies and operando measurements, we initially demonstrate the presence of a hydrogen bond-mediated degradation mechanism of DHAQ molecules during electrochemical reactions. Afterwards, we apply a molecular engineering strategy based on redox-active polymers to develop capacity-boosting composite electrolytes. Indeed, by coupling a 1,5-DHAQ/poly(anthraquinonyl sulfide)/carbon black anolyte and a [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3−/4−</sup> alkaline catholyte, we report an AORFB capable of delivering a stable cell discharge capacity of about 573 mAh at 20 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> after 1100 h of cycling and an average cell discharge voltage of about 0.89 V at the same current density.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Aqueous organic redox flow batteries are affected by short cycle life and low capacity.

To have a holistic understanding of the structure-property relation, a series of DHAQ isomers (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>) with varying substitution sites of hydroxyl groups (i.e., 1,2-DHAQ, 1,4-DHAQ, 1,5-DHAQ, 1,8-DHAQ and 2,6-DHAQ) were investigated in terms of redox potential (E<sub>1/2</sub>) and solubility (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). Among all the DHAQs, although 2,6-DHAQ has the lowest E<sub>1/2</sub> (−0.706 V vs. SHE in 1 M KOH at 25 ± 1 °C) and the highest solubility (0.60 M in 1.5 M KOH at 25 ± 1 °C), it has been reported that the irreversible dimerization of anthrone intermediate during the reduction process severely impairs its stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. However, the root cause for the side reaction remains unclear.</p><p id="Par7">Here operando attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) was performed to scrutinize the changes of bonding structures by monitoring the reactions of 2,6-DHAQ at different stages of reduction. The operando ATR-FTIR measurement was conducted with a commercialized spectroelectrochemical cell (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>) upon cyclic voltammetric (CV) scans. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> and Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref> show the time-dependent transmittance difference (ΔT) of the FTIR spectra of 2,6-DHAQ during the reduction and oxidization processes in the first cycle of CV scan and the subsequent two scans, respectively. The vibrations of C–O and C=C bonds of 2,6-DHAQ in the range of 1300–1600 cm<sup>−1</sup> were recorded during CV scans. The signal of C=C gradually diminished in the cathodic scan and re-emerged in the anodic scan while C–O showed a reversed trend. Interestingly, the variations of stretching (υ(OH), 2800–3800 cm<sup>−1</sup>) and bending (δ(H<sub>2</sub>O), 1634 cm<sup>−1</sup>) vibrations of water molecule became sizeable after the reduction scan. Such a change could be rationalized by the variation of the solvent environment associated with a disruption of the established water molecule network with the quinone molecules through hydrogen bonding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, as similarly reported for the “water-in-salt” and “molecular crowding” based electrolytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Degradation analysis of DHAQs.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Evolution of the operando FTIR spectra of 2,6-DHAQ during reduction and oxidation processes in the first cycle of CV scan. <bold>b</bold>, <bold>c</bold> The calculated energy changes of 2,6-DHAQ (<bold>b</bold>) and 1,5-DHAQ (<bold>c</bold>) and water at different redox states.

As shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>, no change in transmittance at both 1634 and 3250 cm<sup>−1</sup> was observed during the entire reduction process, until a sharp increase appeared after the electrolyte was rested for a while, suggesting a subsequent slow chemical process rather than an electrochemical one which disrupted the water molecule network. The FTIR spectrum of the electrolyte at the end of resting is broadly consistent with that of 2,6-DHAQ<sup>2−</sup>, showing it remains the predominant compound after the resting process. In addition, the enchantment of the peaks at 1082 and 1550 cm<sup>−1</sup> indicates the presence of 2,6-DHAQ, while the new peaks at around 1105 and 1242 cm<sup>−1</sup> are attributed to the presence of 2,6-dihydroxyanthrone (2,6-DHA), suggesting the disproportionation reaction during the resting process producing 2,6-DHAQ and 2,6-DHA. (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>). These results, along with attenuated reduction current in the subsequent CV scan (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref>), evince a destructive effect of the changes of surrounding water network, which induces degradation of 2,6-DHAQ during the reduction process.

The presence of hydrogen bond between 2,6-DHAQ<sup>2−</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O prevents the nucleophilic addition and stabilizes the 2,6-DHAQ<sup>2−</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. There are two possible routes in the subsequent reaction process: adsorption of another 2,6-DHAQ<sup>2−</sup> (2:1 complex) or H<sub>2</sub>O molecule (1:2 complex) and the corresponding adsorption energy is 0.14 eV and −0.30 eV, respectively, indicating the uptake of another H<sub>2</sub>O is favored. After forming the 1:2 complex, further addition of 2,6-DHAQ<sup>2−</sup> becomes the rate determining step (ΔE = 0.15 eV), followed by a spontaneous disproportionation reaction. Here, the small energy barrier could be caused by the coulombic repulsion force for the addition of another reduced 2,6-DHAQ. For a deeper insight into the hydrogen bond-promoted formation of the 2:2 complex, electrostatic potential (ESP) maps were plotted. As shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13a</xref>, there isn’t an overlap of ESP maps of the two individual reduced 2,6-DHAQ.

The stronger hydrogen bond between 2,6-DHAQ<sup>2−</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O compared with that of 1,5-DHAQ<sup>2−</sup> leads to a weaker υ(OH) band of H<sub>2</sub>O molecule, resulting in a larger red shift as confirmed by the FTIR spectra in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref> (υ(OH) band ~2992 vs. ~3258 cm<sup>−1</sup> for 2,6-DHAQ<sup>2−</sup>·H<sub>2</sub>O and 1,5-DHAQ<sup>2−</sup>·H<sub>2</sub>O). Meanwhile, different from 2,6-DHAQ<sup>2−</sup>, it is energetically unfavorable to bring two 1,5-DHAQ<sup>2−</sup> together by forming hydrogen bonds with a H<sub>2</sub>O molecule due to a large energy barrier (15.92 eV for the direct uptake of another 1,5-DHAQ<sup>2−</sup> on 1,5-DHAQ<sup>2−</sup>·H<sub>2</sub>O and 16.64 eV for the uptake of another 1,5-DHAQ<sup>2−</sup> on 1,5-DHAQ<sup>2−</sup>·2H<sub>2</sub>O).

Moreover, the protonation of 1,5-DHAQ<sup>2−</sup> in 1 M KOH (pH = 14) has a positive ΔG of &gt;0.81 eV, indicating the molecule is deprotonated at such a high pH (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">15</xref> and Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>).

The capacity retentions were 78.8%, 65.8% and 96.0% for 1,2-DHAQ, 2,6-DHAQ and 1,5-DHAQ, corresponding to a temporal fading rate of 0.30%, 0.50%, and 0.06% per hour, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">20</xref>), which confirms the accuracy of the proposed hydrogen bond-mediated protection/degradation mechanism.

Soluble quinones possess varying redox potentials (−0.72 to 0.85 V vs. SHE) at full pH range (−0.7 to 15), which is also observed in solid quinone-based materials. More importantly, insoluble quinone-based polymers with the same redox center of their monomer show similar redox potential, which provide a convenient way of designing the solid capacity boosters. For example, the E<sub>1/2</sub> of 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4- benzoquinone (DHBQ) is 0.40 V (vs. SHE) at pH 1, while the polymer poly(2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone-3,6-methylene) also shows an E<sub>1/2</sub> of 0.40 V (vs. SHE) at the same pH (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">26c</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.

The strategy for designing capacity-boosting material is also applicable to phenazine-based materials as long as the soluble and solid materials share the same redox center. For instance, the E<sub>1/2</sub> of soluble phenazine-7,8-dihydroxyphenazine-2-carboxylic acid (DHPC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> is the same as solid tetrapyridophenazine/graphene composite (−0.88 V vs. SHE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>.

The kinetics of 1,5-DHAQ was first examined with a glassy carbon rotating disk electrode (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">27</xref>). The diffusion coefficient of the molecule was determined to be 7.24 × 10<sup>−6</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/s and the rate constant is 1.29 × 10<sup>−3</sup> cm/s, which is higher than most of the inorganic redox-active species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.

The E<sub>1/2</sub> of PAQS/CNT is negatively shifted, presumably attributed to the interactions between PAQS and CNT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. The material utilization tests were conducted with a 1,5-DHAQ | [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3−/4−</sup> full cell (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">34</xref>). After loading 312 mAh equivalent capacity of PAQS granules (2 × 1 × 0.5 mm<sup>3</sup>) into the anodic tank, the discharge capacity increased by 56 mAh at 2 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, corresponding to a 18% utilization of PAQS (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">35</xref>). Such a low utilization, which requires a state-of-charge (SOC) of the electrolyte solution as high as 90% in order to trigger the reaction, is ascribed to the sluggish reduction of PAQS by 1,5-DHAQ<sup>2−</sup> due to the small driving force of reduction as compared to oxidation (Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). And the head loss for the large-scale application is discussed in Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>.

Besides the standard potential difference (ΔE°) between 1,5-DHAQ and PAQS, the surface area and conductivity of PAQS granules also play an important role in material utilization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.

In addition, the highly dispersed CB and CNT in PAQS (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">37</xref>) enhance the electronic conductivity and are expected to promote the SMRT reaction. As shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">38</xref>, the capacity utilization of PAQS/CB increased to 28% while it was less than 10% for PAQS/CNT as the potential difference is too large to render an effective SMRT reaction.</p><p id="Par17">1,5-DHAQ-PAQS/CB anolyte system was then employed for long-term stability tests using the SMRT-based RFB design (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>).

The cell was cycled at a constant current density of 20 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> with an average discharge voltage of 0.89 V (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). After loading 350 mAh equivalent capacity of PAQS/CB granules (2 × 1 × 0.5 mm<sup>3</sup>) into the anodic tank, the discharge capacity increased from 459 to 573 mAh, corresponding to a 33% capacity utilization of PAQS/CB (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Taking 50% granule loading ratio and the above material utilization into calculation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, the actual anodic tank volumetric capacity is 47.3 Ah/L (details of calculation can be found in Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). An extended cycling test was performed to investigate the robustness of the 1,5-DHAQ-PAQS/CB anolyte system. The cell was cycled for over 1000 h and the capacity retention over 100 cycles was 99% with an average coulombic efficiency greater than 99.9%, corresponding to a capacity fading rate of 0.02% per day or 0.01%/cycle (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>), which is substantially better than the one without loading granules in the tank (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Such a stabilized anolyte system with the presence of PAQS/CB granules in the tank could be rationalized by the continued reactions between the 1,5-DHAQ<sup>2−</sup> and unreacted PAQS even after the charge process stops, which effectively lowers the concentration of the former and consequently the SOC of the electrolyte solution. In contrast, most 1,5-DHAQ would be reduced to 1,5-DHAQ<sup>2−</sup> in conventional RFB (without capacity-boosting materials in the tanks) at the end of charge process because of the high depth of charging process, at which some undesired reactions would be triggered at such a high concentration (0.1 M) of reactive DHAQ species. Hence, the PAQS granules in the tank also act as a SOC buffer, which adjusts the concentrations of 1,5-DHAQ<sup>0/2−</sup> to a moderate level and thus stabilizes the anolyte system.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Electrochemical performance of 1,5-DHAQ/PAQS/CB systems and itemized comparison with other quinone-based systems.</title><p><bold>a</bold> CV curves of 1,5-DHAQ, [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3−/4−</sup> and PAQS/CB in 1 M KOH.

Note that the theoretical volumetric capacity of the SMRT anolyte system could be as high as 139.5 Ah/L at 50% material loading ratio and 100% capacity utilization PAQS/CB granules (details of calculation can be found in the Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). There is ample room to enhance the capacity by promoting the material utilization. This could be realized by extensive engineering studies, including the optimization of microstructures and surface wettability of the granules accessible to the redox electrolyte, loading/packing of the granules, flow rate and electrolyte conditions, etc.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par20">We have demonstrated the development of a stable anthraquinone-based anolyte system for AORFB based on mechanistic insights gained from operando spectroelectrochemical studies of the reactions and subsequent molecular engineering. With combined operando ATR-FTIR and computational studies, the degradation mechanism of DHAQs were disclosed to be correlated with the formation and disruption of hydrogen bonding network between the reduced quinone molecules and water, which promotes the intermolecular electron transfer and disproportionation reaction of DHAQ and irreversibly results in the formation of dimer. These findings lead to an effective approach of circumventing the stability issue of DHAQ, by preventing the hydrogen bonding via molecular engineering of the position of hydroxyl groups. 1,5-DHAQ was discovered to present a distinct hydrogen bonding structure which stabilizes the molecule upon reduction. The application of molecule engineering strategy was further extended to guide the designation of capacity-boosting materials. PAQS/CB was used as capacity booster for 1,5-DHAQ-based anolyte system, which showed a volumetric capacity of 47.3 Ah/L (up to 139.5 Ah/L) with a capacity fading rate of 0.02% per day for over 1000 h at 20 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> and 25 ± 1 °C.</p><p id="Par21">This study reveals the influence of structural changes of a molecule on its electrochemical properties, which we believe will have interesting implications to other organic redox molecules. In addition, the 1,5-DHAQ-based anolyte in conjunction with PAQS which bears similar redox-active group, opens up an intriguing avenue for the development of solid capacity-boosting material.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par22">1,5-dihydroxyanthraquinone was purchased from TCI Chemicals.
