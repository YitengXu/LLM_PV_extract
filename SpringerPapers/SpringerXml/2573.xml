Here, we show the behavior of solvent and perovskite elements for four different perovskites families and nine different initial precursor solution systems in the case of the most popular preparation process which includes an anti-solvent dripping-assisted spin coating of a precursor solution and a subsequent thermal annealing. We show how the initial solution composition affects, first, the film formed by spin coating and anti-solvent dripping and, second, the processes occurring upon thermal annealing, including crystal domain evolution and the grain growth mechanism. We propose a universal typology which distinguishes three types for the growth direction of perovskite crystals: downward (Type I), upward (Type II) and lateral (Type III). The latter results in large, monolithic grains and we show that this mode must be targeted for the preparation of efficient perovskite light absorber thin films of solar cells.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Organo-metal halide perovskites are promising semiconductor materials for active layers applied to opto-electronics, e.g. photovoltaic cells.

They combine a facile preparation from perovskite precursor solutions (PPSs), manufacturing at mild temperature, a high tunability of their optical and electronic properties, up-scaling potential and low production costs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Fast progress in MHP research has been possible by a great global effort of the scientific community which has notably allowed a rapid improvement of the final films properties by playing on their final composition, on the perovskite precursor solution (PPS) composition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, interfacial engineering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, as well as on the processing techniques employed to obtain the final product<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">For photovoltaic (PV) applications, the quality of the final layer is a key parameter for both high performance and device robustness and stability. The final targeted film properties are a good coverage of the substrate, with no pinholes nor voids. The grains composing the films must be large, well-crystallized and with a monolithic structure. The defects must be passivated. In the monolithic structure, each grain is contacted by the adjacent layers which renders the transfer of the photogenerated charges fast and efficient. The growth and final properties are controlled, not only by the deposition technique and annealing parameters, but also by the components introduced in the PPS which are divided into those which will enter into the final composition of the layer and those that will help the synthesis but will be eliminated, especially upon the thermal annealing step. They are dissolved in high-boiling point polar solvents, typically N,N’-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), γ-butyrolactone (GBL), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. They are often mixed together or with a low-boiling point solvent for a better control of the precursors solubilization and elimination upon the film formation process. At present, the record solar cells have been fabricated from MHP films deposited by spin coating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. To accurately control the state of the layer that will be subsequently annealed, the most popular way consists in dripping an anti-solvent such as chlorobenzene, diethyl ether, or toluene upon spinning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. This step must be performed at a well-defined time which depends on the PPS composition and temperature. This technique is usually called one-step technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> in contrast with those where a precursor film, such as a PbI<sub>2</sub> film, is reacted with a monovalent cation solution or vapor to form the perovskite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Despite the huge experimental knowledge and work accumulated on how performant MHP films for PV can be produced, the mechanism of film formation, especially upon spin coating and thermal annealing has not been fully unveiled yet. How, starting from the wet film, the solvent is eliminated, and the crystal growth is controlled to get the monolithic structure upon thermal annealing, remains to be understood. For this, one must know how perovskite grains are formed from the wet layer that results from the spin coating and anti-solvent dripping. Techniques must be implemented to follow the fate of solvent molecules and various ions and their profile across the layer’s thickness evolution.</p><p id="Par5">If several analytical techniques are available to detect the composition of organic-inorganic perovskite films, only a few of them allow an accurate depth profiling of the films and of the whole devices. In the present work, the glow discharge-optical emission spectroscopy (GD-OES) technique has been especially employed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, combined with x-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). GD-OES is now well-established for elemental depth profiling of multilayered systems with layers thickness ranging from several nm to hundreds µm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The analytical capacities of GD-OES for the element detection can be as low as several ppm and its analytical capacities for depth profiling of thin layers are comparable with high vacuum surface analytical techniques such as Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) or X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. However, the depth profiling by the latter techniques is limited to only nanometric depths and to a reduced surface area of several hundred µm<sup>2</sup>, they are thus insufficient to reflect the overall situation of perovskite films and perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and they are prone to errors. Even for Hard X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (HAXPES) technology which provides chemical information several times deeper than conventional XPS, its depth of analysis is still limited, and a full perovskite film employed in PSC cannot be analyzed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. On the other hand, the analyzed zone of GD-OES is determined by the anode size, which can be several tens of mm<sup>2</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. This technique appears to be an interesting tool for depth profiling of MHP solar materials. The fact that the sputtering direction is perpendicular to the surface decreases the shadowing effect during sputtering. This makes possible to apply GD-OES to the analysis of the films formed on rough substrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Quantitative analysis of thin films by GD-OES can be tricky<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>; however, qualitative depth profiles analysis is also very informative and has been previously successfully applied in stability evaluation of perovskite materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. However, to our knowledge, the unique GD-OES capabilities, notably the fast profile recording (several tens of seconds for a solar cell perovskite layer) has poorly been applied to the study of the perovskite film preparation and to the film growth analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">In the present paper, we investigate the solvent and perovskite elements location in the films and their profile evolution upon the full film formation process. To get a view as large as possible and draw sound conclusions, we have investigated four different perovskite families, namely MAPbI<sub>3</sub>, FAPbI<sub>3</sub>/ FA<sub>1-x</sub>MA<sub>x</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>, Cs<sub>0.1</sub>FA<sub>0.9</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>, and Rb<sub>0.05</sub>Cs<sub>0.05</sub>FA<sub>0.9</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> (with MA for methylammonium and FA for formamidinium) and nine different PPS compositions, including or not halides and metal nanoparticle additives. They have allowed us to state two universal laws concerning the films produced by spin coating and subsequent thermal annealing. First, when the perovskite film is prepared by spin coating, the solvent accumulates in the upper part of the layer: the upper layer is richer in solvent than the lower one. On the other hand, Pb of perovskite is concentrated in the layer lower part. This surface solvent excess is eliminated upon the first seconds of annealing. Second, we have observed and analyzed three types of growth direction of perovskite crystals upon thermal annealing: upward, downward, and lateral. Among them, PSCs with high efficiency are always a consequence of the lateral growth. Furthermore, the growth direction is the results of the microstructural and compositional properties of the film that results from the spin coating/anti-solvent dripping step. We have been able to change the growth direction of perovskite crystals in the film by using accurate additives, especially halide salts or gold nanoparticles.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Investigated MHP films and solar cells</title><p id="Par7">The perovskite films investigated in the present work had various compositions and their deposition protocols have been optimized in our group in the past years.

The CsFAPI sample is characterized by the presence of pinholes, while the other films well-cover the substrate. We observe that MACl and NH<sub>4</sub>Cl additives favor the formation of large grains. It is also the case when gold nanoparticles are added in the PPS. Further information on the final film morphologies have been extracted from the cross-sectional views (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c–k</xref>). Only the CsFAPI layer presented voids embedded at the perovskite/mesoporous TiO<sub>2</sub> interface. The series of perovskite films on the right, namely CsFAPI/AKC, RbCsFAPI/KIAC, MAPI/Au_NPs and FAPI/MACl were prepared in the presence of additives. The very interesting point is that all these layers presented large grains, a monolithic structure, vertical grain boundaries and perfect contacts with the charge transporting layers (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3j–m</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">In the following, both (i) the effect of PPS spinning and anti-solvent dripping, and (ii) the effect of thermal annealing have been thoroughly investigated by the GD-OES technique completed by XRD measurements.

The elemental depth distribution of the MHP film’s constituents was recorded at each stage of the film preparation process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Spin coating and anti-solvent dripping processes</title><p id="Par12">The spin coating routine comprised a first stage of spinning at low speed (typically at 1000 rpm) to spread uniformly the PPS on the surface and then a stage at higher speed (typically at 4000 rpm) to start the film formation and solvent elimination. The dripping of anti-solvent was done at an accurate time which was carefully optimized for each system. Our aim was to track and understand the distribution of perovskite precursor (represented by the profile of Pb) and solvent (represented by the profile of the S element contained in DMSO) upon the spin coating step. This section focuses on GD-OES measurements done upon the CsFAPI/AKC perovskite preparation since the final S and Pb profiles were close after the spin coating step for all the various investigated samples (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). The results of S and Pb profiles without (W/O) and with chlorobenzene (CB) dripping are presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a–<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">f</xref>.</p><p id="Par13">The depth profiles of Pb and S are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a–c</xref> and Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d–f</xref> respectively. Two distinct layers are clearly visible, differing by the intensity of S and Pb signals. The first part of the profile represents the upper layer, and the second part represents the lower layer since deeper part of the film is probed with increasing GD-OES sputtering time. The interface between the two layers, defined as the slope sign change of the curves (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>) is shown as a vertical dashed line. One could note that the interface position does not move significantly. Considering similar erosion rate inside the layer, the similar erosion time indicates similar thickness of the upper layer for all MHP. When the spin coating time reached 25 s without dripping, two Pb peaks with the same intensity were visible in the profile (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). The film is then made of a colloidal dispersion of precursor aggregates and solvent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Considering constant emission yield, similar intensity indicates similar quantity of eroded Pb. After 40 s of spin coating, so at the end of the whole spin coating routine, without dripping, the decrease of the first peak was accompanied by the increase of the second one. It means that parts of the upper layer aggregates which contain Pb was transferred to the lower layer upon spinning but the interface between the layers did not move significantly (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). The movements of S and Pb were opposite. In Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>, with the increase of the spin coating time, the solvent amount, traced by S, in the lower layer was significantly reduced but remained near constant in the upper layer. The explanation is twofold: (1) The free solvent of the lower layer is transferred to the upper layer during continuous spinning, and the solvent from the upper layer is thrown out due to the centrifugal force and evaporation under the high-speed operation of the spin coater; (2) Continuous downward movement of Pb during spin coating process causes S to move upward. Another finding is that with the increase of spin coating time, the first peak of the S profile, which is representative of the upper layer, has moved to the right, which indicates that the solvent on the most surface is quickly thrown out under the action of centrifugal force and evaporation.</p><p id="Par14">In the case WITH CB dripping at 25 s. (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), only one broad Pb peak is visible at 25 s. At the end (40 s), the height of the peak increases and the peak maximum is shifted downward. The use of CB induces, a loss of solvent, the formation of a gel and the nucleation of what is described in the literature as a solvent-complex crystalline phase. This phase results from the interaction of DMSO with the precursor solutes. The intermediate phase is formed due to the O-donor Lewis base properties of DMSO. Its strong Lewis basicity favors the formation of a phase(s) with AX, PbI<sub>2</sub>, KCl, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl…<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. For instance, in the case of the well-investigated MAPbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite, this crystalline phase is escribed as MA<sub>2</sub>Pb<sub>3</sub>I<sub>8</sub>•2DMSO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. We can also mention that NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> is also a Lewis base that can presumably also interact with the precursors. The crystal phase formation enhances the measured performance of Pb. To better illustrate the role of CB in the preparation process, Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> juxtaposes the depth profiles of Pb for the samples spin coated for 25 s with and W/O CB. The presence of a single broad peak with strong intensity in place of two less intensive peaks can be interpreted as an acceleration of the solvent-complex phase formation by CB. Moreover, this peak (green curve in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) is very similar to that W/O CB spin coating for 40 s (blue curve in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), except that the peak with CB spin coating for 25 s is broader. It is concluded that the MHP obtained from W/O CB spin coating for 40 s is like that obtained with CB spin coating for 25 s. In Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>, the S profile from the sample WITH CB shows the same trend as in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>. However, the difference is that the intensities of the S curve W/O CB are higher than that WITH CB at 25 s (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). It means that the addition of CB during spin coating accelerates the solvent removal process, causes a rapid supersaturation and then promotes the precipitation of the crystalline solvent-complex phase. This is clearly seen on the XRD patterns without and with CB in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>. If XRD shows a crystallized precursor phase without CB dripping (peak at 11.79°), the intensity of the peak is much higher with CB while the diffraction peak is shifted to 11.91°, maybe because of a slightly different composition.</p><p id="Par15">To better understand the above processes, we have developed a quantitative approach based on the curve integration that has allowed us to distinguish the upper and lower layers. Our approach is summarized and exemplified in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>. In this approach, an area under the elemental depth profile curve in the zone, selected as the layer, is associated with the total (integral) quantity of the element in the layer. So, the evolution of the total content of the solvent and the precursor inside each layer and the contribution of each layer as a function of the treatment can be surveyed. In Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>, we can see that the total area of peak integral of Pb increases with the treatment time from 25 to 40 s spin coating. Whether it is spin coating for 25 s or 40 s, the total integrated Pb area with CB is always greater than the total integrated Pb area W/O CB. It proves that CB can promote the formation of perovskite precursor crystals. The relative proportions of the upper layer and the lower layer inside the whole profile, indicated by percentage in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>, show that the proportion of Pb in the lower layer increased as the spin coating time increased. While CB favors the solvent-complex phase formation, it also accelerates the removal of the free solvent. In Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref>, we observe that the total quantity of S was greatly reduced with treatment time, which proves that no matter adding CB or increasing the spin coating time, the solvent content is reduced. However, as analyzed above, the overall proportions shown by percentages in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref> confirm that the free solvent is gradually transferred to the upper layer with increasing spin coating time.</p><p id="Par16">According to our above systematic analysis, the whole process of spin coating is summarized in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The joint action of dripping CB and prolonged spin coating time results in an excess of solvent in the upper layer when the spin coating process is completed. On the contrary, the precursor crystallization is higher in the lower layer than in the upper layer and it results in an enrichment in lead. The addition of CB accelerates the transfer speed of Pb in the film and promotes the precursor phase formation. This is a general rule for the spin coating step of perovskite layers preparation.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Element redistribution upon spin coating.</title><p>(Top) Spin-coating routine.

We have used the GD-OES technique to follow the depth profile evolution of the solvent leaving perovskite films by evaporation upon thermal annealing. Indeed, the solvent employed was DMSO or DMF-DMSO mixtures, with DMF being eliminated in a great extent by the dripping performed upon the spin coating step<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. By GD-OES, we have tracked the S element contained in DMSO. As a strongly coordinating solvent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, the DMSO content was quite high in the initial layer. The S element profile for the various films and various annealing times are presented in Figs. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a–r. With increasing sputtering time, deeper part of the precursor/MHP layer was analyzed until reaching the <italic>meso</italic>-TiO<sub>2</sub> layer (dashed black line in Figs. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a–<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">r</xref>). Before annealing, the DMSO profile was asymmetrical in all kinds of samples, and we observed that the outer part of the film was richer in solvent than the inner part. For the annealing, our results distinguished two stages. <bold>Stage-1</bold> corresponded to the initial film color change from yellow translucent to brown (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>). XRD patterns show the formation and growth beginning of the α-phase (perovskite dark phase) during this stage (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>). This phase was initially absent in all the samples except in the FAPI/MACl one. The most superficial residual solvent evaporated then for all kinds of perovskites (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a–c</xref>, Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g, i</xref>, and Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4m–o</xref>). This stage varied from &lt;4 s to 60 s, depending on the PPS composition and then on the final perovskite composition as summarized in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>. We observed that it was longer (10 s) for the DMSO-rich MAPI precursor film (also annealed for 1 h) and very long (60 s) for the FAPI film which corresponds to a poorly stable compound in its perovskite α-phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. <bold>Stage-2</bold> corresponded to the brown to dark brown color change.

These samples exhibit a large GI, higher than +30%. A downward growth is found for CsFAPI, CsFAPI/KC, and MAPI films. (ii) If SLS-2 is greater than SUS-2 with GI lower than −30%, the film grows upward (from bottom to top). This is the case of the RbCsFAPI and FAPI samples. (iii) Finally, when the slope of the upper layer in the stage-2 (SUS-2) is very close to that of the lower layer in the stage-2 (SLS-2), it results in more homogeneous films with big monolithic grains. We define this growth trend as lateral growth. The GI of the samples that meet the lateral growth falls between +30% and −30% (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This case is encountered for the CsFAPI/AKC, RbCsFAPI/KIAC, MAPI/Au_NPs, and FAPI/MACl samples, those which exhibit a monolithic structure in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. (i) and (ii) cases lead to multiple and oblique grain boundaries and to the production of rather small perovskite grains (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). Films of (i) and (ii) cases have also a higher roughness compared to layers stemming from a lateral growth ((iii) case) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>).</p><p id="Par22">In the cross-sectional SEM view of the CsFAPI sample (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), we found the appearance of voids embedded at the perovskite/TiO<sub>2</sub> interface and pinholes on top views. To deeply understand the causes of this phenomenon, we introduce another essential parameter, MLU, for the Multiple of Lower layer residual solvent ratio over Upper layer residual solvent ratio at the critical annealing times reported in Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. In Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14</xref>, we can see that the MLU for the CsFAPI, at 4.45, is the highest among all kinds of perovskites we investigated. This means that after 30 s of annealing time, the Lower layer RSR is 4.45 times higher than the Upper layer RSR. In other words, the CsFAPI sample is the only one for which the inner solvent is badly eliminated. We can then suppose that, due to the formation of a perovskite crust at the film surface, solvent molecules remain entrapped in the inner part of the layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Voids are formed upon solvent escaping, releasing a poor <italic>meso</italic>-TiO<sub>2</sub>/perovskite interface. In the cross-sectional views of other samples, no voids were present.

Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">15</xref> compares the GD-OES solvent profiles for precursor layers prepared with chlorobenzene and with diethyl ether (DEE) anti-solvents. In both cases, the initial layer presented a DMSO excess near the surface. Interestingly, with diethyl ether, the intensity of the S-signal was lower, and DEE acts as a better dryer of the layer. The outer DMSO was quickly eliminated during the first seconds of thermal annealing in both cases. Another interesting point is that a more homogeneous elimination of DMSO subsequently occurred upon annealing in the case of DEE. It resulted in a lower GI value (−10.2% instead of −23.3%). We can conclude that the type of anti-solvent affects the growth parameters of the layer and is an important lever to tune the final properties of the perovskite film. We also note that, in the present case, it did not change the layer growth direction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Perovskite layers growth models and types</title><p id="Par24">The large amount of information on the perovskite films growth stages and mechanism upon thermal annealing which have been gathered in the present work have been schematically summarized in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. We have evidenced two stages. Upon <bold>Stage-1</bold>, the crystallites combining the solvent molecules-cations-lead-halogens are thermally decomposed and the solvent molecules evaporate. By a rearrangement and recrystallization process, perovskite crystals are formed which grow in all the directions. First, our findings show that the location and density of the first seeds/crystallites formed then, and which is a consequence of the microstructure and composition of the precursor layer, will decide the subsequent steps, especially the layer growth direction as illustrated in the middle part of Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. Their concentration at the top, middle and bottom part of the layer will drive the growth in the downward, lateral, and upward directions, respectively. Moreover, their density will decide the final size of the crystals in the perovskite layer. Sparsely dispersed crystallites are targeted since it will lead to the growth of large grains which are beneficial for the final performances of the devices. Upon <bold>Stage-2</bold>, different behaviors have been found depending on the PPS composition. Our study shows that the additives govern the film formation since the early stages and have a crucial role to tune the size and composition of the precursor aggregates and initial nuclei<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. The gradual evaporation of MACl or NH<sub>4</sub>Cl can self-regulate the perovskite crystal growth and favor a slow conversion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. In general, additives will promote the lower nucleation site density, bigger precursor crystallites, control the solubility of the precursor solutes and the composition of the crystallized intermediate phases, drive the solvent elimination speed and then the layer growth speed. During <bold>Stage-2</bold>, a transition to a directional growth of the perovskite grain occurs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The direction and speed of the growth will define the final MHP layers properties.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Parameters and typologies of perovskite layers growth models.</title><p>Perovskite film formation process upon annealing.

If the film is dense with a rather slow growth, the type is <bold>Ia</bold>. A special case is encountered when a surface crust is formed. The inner solvent is especially difficult to eliminate then and is entrapped in the inner part of the film. Its escape leads to the formation of voids at the bottom contact interface and of pinholes (<bold>Type Ib</bold>). The second case is when the growth direction is upward (<bold>Type II</bold>). Both <bold>Type I</bold> and <bold>Type II</bold> lead to rather small grains with multiple grain boundaries. Finally, the targeted growth behavior for high device efficiency, good homogeneity and good stability is the lateral one that we name <bold>Type III</bold>. We have noted that this type was encountered when the initial as-cast layer contained the perovskite phase (FAPI/MACl sample) (<bold>Type IIIb</bold>) or not (<bold>Type IIIa</bold>). For <bold>Type III</bold>, a monolithic structure with reduced and vertically oriented grain boundaries is formed. This growth mode results in smoother layers. It favors the fast charge transfer to the contact at both MHP film side in the solar cells.

GD-OES has allowed us to profile and track solvent and elements fates. We have distinguished the inner and outer parts of the layers. As a general law, prolonged spin coating time results in an excess of solvent in the upper layer part and in a lead accumulation in the inner part when the spin coating process is completed. This effect is accelerated by using an anti-solvent steam which also favors the solvent elimination. The anti-solvent treatment must be triggered when the layer is dry enough to reach the supersaturation under the effect of the anti-solvent stream and to induce the generation of crystalline intermediate phases of optimum size and density. Additives must also be used for a better optimization of these parameters. These additives, which are chloride and Lewis bases in the present work, enter in the composition of these intermediate.</p><p id="Par27">For the thermal annealing, we have distinguished two stages. Upon <bold>Stage-1</bold>, solvent, in the outer film part, is eliminated. The active perovskite phase is formed by decomposition of the precursor phase, forming the initial perovskite crystallites which grow in all the space directions. During <bold>Stage-2</bold>, the perovskite grains grow in a preferential direction, and the residual solvent is eliminated. The initial composition of the intermediate is then key to regulate the grain growth speed and direction which has been tracked by how solvent is eliminated throughout the film thickness. We have proposed growth parameters indexes, namely, GI and MLU to quantify and accurately describe the differential solvent elimination between the inner and upper layer parts. They have allowed us to propose an universal new typology which distinguishes three types depending on the growth direction of perovskite crystals in thin films and which has been validated by a large number of various halide perovskite films studied: downward (<bold>Type I</bold>), upward (<bold>Type II</bold>) and lateral (<bold>Type III</bold>). The growth direction is key for the final properties of the films. Among them, the best efficiency has been always found for solar cells prepared with monolithic films resulting from a lateral growth mode. <bold>Type III</bold> growth mode must be targeted for the preparation of efficient perovskite films for solar cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Preparation of substrates, compact TiO<sub>2</sub>, and mesoporous TiO<sub>2</sub> layers</title><p id="Par28">Fluorine-doped SnO<sub>2</sub> (FTO) substrates (TEC 7 from Pilkington) were etched pattern by zinc powder and 10% HCl solution prior to be cleaned with soap and water.

Then, 17.9 μL of bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide lithium salt solution (Li-TFSI) (Sigma–Aldrich) solution (517 mg in 1 mL ACN), 30.4 μL of TBP (tert-butylpyridine) (Sigma–Aldrich) and 14 μL of tris(2-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)−4-tert-butylpyridine)-cobalt(III) tris (bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (Dyesol, FK209) (376 mg in 1 mL acetonitrile) were added to this solution. Forty microliters of the HTM solution was spin coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, the device was completed by thermally evaporating a 70–80 nm thick gold back contact on the Spiro-OMeTAD layer.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Characterization methods</title><p id="Par39">The structure of the organo-metal lead perovskite films was characterized by a PANanalytical X-Pert high-resolution X-ray diffractometer (XRD) operated at 40 kV and 45 mA and using the CuKα radiation with <italic>λ</italic> = 1.5406 Å. The morphology of perovskite thin films was measured using a field-emission SEM equipment (Zeiss Supra 40) in the in-lens mode.</p><p id="Par40">Glow-Discharge Optical Emission Spectrometry (GD-OES) analyses were performed using a HORIBA Jobin Yvon GD Profiler 2 with Quantum Software. The instrument configuration included a RF-generator (at 13.56 MHz), a standard HORIBA Jobin Yvon glow discharge source with a cylindrical anode of 4 mm internal diameter and two optical spectrometers (a polychromator and a monochromator) for fast-optical detection. No loss in time resolution was ensured thanks to the detection system, composed of independent photomultiplicators (PM), which guarantee simultaneous detection of the signals corresponding to multiple wavelength with spectral resolution of 12 pm. The emission signals of 47 elements were recorded but only the signals of the species of interest are discussed in the paper. The selected wavelength for Pb and S were 220.357 and 180.738 nm, respectively. The optical system was purged by high purity N<sub>2</sub> in order to detect emission lines in the VUV region. Prior to each analysis, the source was cleaned by sputtering a sacrificial Si wafer for 60 s. The interest of the technique is its rapidity and easiness for use. It does not need high vacuum nor specific sample preparation. Therefore, the films could be characterized rapidly (less than 1 min) after each step of preparation. High purity argon (99.999% minimum purity) was employed as the discharge gas. The Ar plasma was generated at an Ar pressure of 420 Pa and an applied power of 17 W. The precursor or perovskite layer was mounted on an O-ring at one side of the plasma chamber and used as a cathode. The total emission intensity depends on the erosion rate and emission yield. The data treatment and analysis were made in the hypothesis of a constant emission yield. Taking into account that the erosion rate can vary with chemical composition and microstructure inside the layer and between the layers, all the signals were normalized by the total emitted light. Only the normalized signals are shown and discussed in the paper.</p><p id="Par41">The <italic>J-V</italic> curves were recorded by a Keithley 2410 digital sourcemeter, using a 0.1 V.s<sup>−1</sup> voltage scan rate. The solar cells were illuminated with a solar simulator (Abet Technology Sun 2000) filtered to mimic AM 1.5 G conditions (100 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>). The illuminated surface was delimited by a black mask with an aperture diameter of 3 mm. The power density was calibrated at 100 mW.cm<sup>−2</sup> by the use of a reference silicon solar cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>D.Z. acknowledges the CSC-Paristech program for Ph.D scholarship funding (grant number 201806310126).
