Harnessing their full potential as antimicrobial agents will require methods for cost-effective large-scale production and purification. Here, we explore the possibility to exploit the high protein synthesis capacity of the chloroplast to produce AMPs in plants. Generating a large series of 29 sets of transplastomic tobacco plants expressing nine different AMPs as fusion proteins, we show that high-level constitutive AMP expression results in deleterious plant phenotypes. However, by utilizing inducible expression and fusions to the cleavable carrier protein SUMO, the cytotoxic effects of AMPs and fused AMPs are alleviated and plants with wild-type-like phenotypes are obtained. Importantly, purified AMP fusion proteins display antimicrobial activity independently of proteolytic removal of the carrier. Our work provides expression strategies for the synthesis of toxic polypeptides in chloroplasts, and establishes transplastomic plants as efficient production platform for antimicrobial peptides.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are promising next-generation antibiotics, but are difficult to produce due to the toxicity to bacterial hosts.

AMPs represent an important part of defense strategies against pathogenic microbes, and are produced by both eukaryotic and prokaryotic life forms, although the majority of identified AMPs are from animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Due to the increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria, AMPs have received considerable interest as an alternative to currently used antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In addition to their potential use to treat infectious diseases in humans, AMPs are also considered as alternatives to antibiotics as growth promoters in animal husbandry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">AMPs are generally short polypeptides. The average length of all AMPs in the Antimicrobial Peptide Database (APD) is 33.19 amino acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> (database accessed in February 2022). The vast majority of AMPs have a positive net charge and are composed of a mix of hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups that fold into an amphipathic conformation, where one side of the molecule is hydrophobic and the other side hydrophilic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The positive net charge of AMPs promotes electrostatic interactions with negatively charged bacterial membranes, but not with neutral eukaryotic membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The hydrophobic regions of AMP molecules facilitate binding and integration into bacterial membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Negatively charged and uncharged AMPs that kill bacteria also exist, although they are rare. Only 5.7% of bactericidal AMPs are uncharged and only 6% have a charge below zero<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> (APD accessed in February 2022). Since purification from the native host is usually not feasible and direct chemical synthesis is far too expensive (with the possible exception of some very small AMPs that do not require disulfide bridges or other post-translational modifications), recombinant expression using transgenic methods represents the most promising strategy for commercial-level AMP production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">In spite of their bactericidal activity, recombinant production of some AMPs in bacteria is possible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. However, especially for the large-scale and cost-effective commercial production, plants represent the most promising production platform. Transgenic plants have been shown to facilitate the synthesis of large quantities of biopharmaceuticals at low costs, with the option to scale up production by simply expanding the planted area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Both stably transformed and transiently transformed plants can be used for recombinant protein production. Transient expression offers the benefit that negative effects of transgene expression on growth can be avoided, and the response time for development of new therapeutics is short<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Stable expression systems rely on genetic transformation of either the nuclear or the plastid genome. For production purposes, they offer a number of significant advantages: The harvested biomass is free of transgenic pathogenic microbes (<italic>Agrobacterium</italic> or viruses), there is no requirement for transformation of every new batch of plant material (likely also resulting in much greater batch-to-batch consistency in protein accumulation levels) and substantially reducing cost<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and facilitates scale-up to large greenhouse or open field cultivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The use of specialized promoter systems can trigger expression in all tissues, restrict transgene expression to specific tissues or enable inducible expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Expression from the plastid (chloroplast) genome is a particularly attractive method of heterologous protein production in plants, because chloroplasts can accumulate very large amounts of foreign protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, and offer the additional benefits of transgene exclusion from pollen transmission and the absence of epigenetic transgene silencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Production of AMPs or antimicrobial proteins in plants has been attempted by transient expression, stable nuclear transformation and plastid transformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">When considering possibilities to develop strategies for the production of AMPs in plants by expression from the plastid genome (i.e., in transplastomic plants), several important considerations come into play. In view of the prokaryotic origin of plastids, a serious concern is that antimicrobial peptides may damage the plastid (and its membranes) in a similar manner as they kill bacteria. Problems with AMP production in bacteria have been extensively studied, and different solutions have been developed to enhance accumulation and reduce toxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Recombinant AMP production in bacteria is commonly attempted by using an inducible expression system, to allow unhindered growth of the bacterial culture before induction of AMP synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In fact, inducible expression was key to the heterologous production of most of the AMPs that could be expressed in bacteria, indicating that the inherent toxicity of AMPs to prokaryotic production hosts represents a serious obstacle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">Another significant concern is that AMPs might be unstable inside plastids due to their small size, the presence of hydrophobic domains (which can be problematic in plastid transgene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>). AMPs share these properties with the small plastid targeting peptides that are rapidly degraded after protein import has been completed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par9">In fact, AMPs and transit peptides for protein import into plastids and mitochondria are so similar that AMPs are considered as possible evolutionary ancestors of organellar targeting peptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. The presequence protease (PreP) in plastids and mitochondria efficiently degrades cleaved-off transit peptides with a size of 10-65 amino acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, suggesting that polypeptides of similar size that are recombinantly expressed in plastids will also be degraded by PreP. PreP displays a preference for positively charged residues at the cleavage site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, which could further contribute to degradation of positively charged (cationic) AMPs. In addition, plastids harbor an oligopeptidase (organellar oligopeptidase, OOP) that degrades peptides of 8-23 amino acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> and potentially also contributes to the instability of small polypeptides expressed in plastids. Notably, the chloroplast genome encodes a few small proteins, with PetN, a subunit of the cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>6</sub><italic>f</italic> complex of only 29 amino acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, being the smallest example. However, all of these small proteins are subunits of protein complexes (photosynthetic complexes residing in the thylakoid membrane, chloroplast ribosomes), and the rapid (often co-translational) incorporation of these small proteins into large multiprotein complexes likely protects them from proteolytic degradation.</p><p id="Par10">In this work, we systematically compare multiple approaches to maximize AMP expression levels in transplastomic tobacco plants, and simultaneously, reduce the toxic effects associated with high-level AMP accumulation in chloroplasts. Based on the above considerations, we hypothesize that embedding AMPs into larger polypeptides will increase their stability, because they will not be recognized as PreP and/or OPP substrates. In order to increase the size of AMPs, we pursue two parallel strategies: (i) the fusion of multiple antimicrobial peptides connected by flexible linkers, and (ii) the use of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) as a cleavable fusion partner.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design of AMP fusion constructs for transplastomic expression</title><p id="Par11">Given the above-described concerns related to AMP toxicity and instability due to their small size, we sought to test the idea that fusion proteins of several AMPs can be expressed to high levels in chloroplasts. In addition, combination of different AMPs could result in synergistic antimicrobial effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, thus providing more potent antimicrobials. In bacteria, recombinant production of AMPs is frequently performed as fusions to carrier proteins like glutathione S-transferase (GST), thioredoxin or small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) – a strategy that increases AMP stability and solubility, and reduces toxicity to the host<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The carrier proteins can be removed after purification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, and production of AMPs as SUMO fusions and subsequent cleavage and purification of the peptide were demonstrated in <italic>E. coli</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>.

In the course of this work, we have explored diverse strategies to utilize transplastomic tobacco plants as production platform for antimicrobial peptides (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par46">Chloroplasts can express foreign proteins to very high levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, including large antibacterial proteins such as phage-derived lytic enzymes (so-called endolysins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>) and antiviral agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>. However, the expression of very small polypeptides poses serious challenges, due to the presence in plastids of specific proteases that degrade polypeptides smaller than 65 amino acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. We have addressed this problem by constructing protein fusions that increase AMPs size above the critical threshold for protease recognition. This was achieved by fusion of multiple AMPs separated by flexible linkers and/or fusion to SUMO, a soluble protein that can be easily removed post-synthesis by cleavage with a highly specific protease. In our work, fusion to the full-length SUMO protein enabled efficient AMP release by proteolytic cleavage. Although the majority of SUMO fusion was efficiently cleaved, part of the purified product may be in a conformation that did not enable recognition by the SUMO protease. SUMO cleavage mimics SUMO maturation in yeast, where the SUMO protease recognizes the structure of SUMO and cleaves within the C-terminal sequence motif GG/ATY converting full-length pre-SUMO into the mature form<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup>. To obtain a final product without any additional amino acids, the ATY sequence could also be omitted, in which case cleavage takes place between the C-terminal GG of SUMO and the fused protein sequence downstream (except if the GG sequence is followed by a proline residue), as demonstrated for SUMO fusions expressed in bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup>. The use of SUMO as carrier protein in chloroplasts is an approach that has not been explored before. Our data suggest that fusion to SUMO provides a valuable tool for efficient recombinant protein production and purification from transplastomic plants. In our study, SUMO fusion had three beneficial effects. First, in all (f)AMPs tested, we observed improved protein accumulation, presumably by increasing protein stability. Second, it greatly improved solubility of the AMPs, thus facilitating purification and bypassing the need to use detergents for AMP extraction. Third, combined with lowered expression levels, fusion to SUMO also alleviated the mutant phenotypes associated with fAMP expression.</p><p id="Par47">Previous work has shown that recombinant proteins that integrate into or interact with membranes impair chloroplast development, thus causing pigment deficiency and growth defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.

Given that AMPs are high-value products, such small delays in growth are likely acceptable for commercial production.
