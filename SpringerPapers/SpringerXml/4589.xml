Extended light-harvesting networks comprising hundreds and even many thousands of pigments form antenna systems that increase both the spatial and spectral cross-section for light harvesting. Subsequently, absorbed energy migrates to specialised protein centres for transient storage as a series of charge separation events. One such light-harvesting antenna is the phycobilisome of cyanobacteria and some red algae, which funnels absorbed solar energy towards the Photosystem I and II reaction centre complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The phycobilisome is a large multimeric, extramembranous protein complex that usually consists of a tricylindrical core of trimeric allophycocyanin. Peripheral rods of stacked hexameric phycocyanin subunits extend from the core, and in some circumstances these rods are extended with additional phycobiliproteins, either phycoerythrin or phycoerythrocyanin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The light absorbing pigments in the phycobilisome, the phycobilins, are linear tetrapyrroles that are covalently bound to their cognate proteins. One such phycobiliprotein is the ~18-kDa CpcA, which naturally binds phycocyanobilin (PCB) but can also bind phycoerythrobilin (PEB), phycoviolobilin (PVB), phycourobilin (PUB) or phytochromobilin (PϕB) when appropriate enzymes are expressed heterologously in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">The specialized light-harvesting and energy-transfer functions of phycobiliproteins have practical applications. These proteins form a range of stable, soluble, vividly coloured and highly fluorescent complexes used as fluorescent probes in epifluorescent imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. However, traditional optical imaging is fundamentally limited in terms of resolving power due to the wave-like nature of light, which results in the detected signal of a single molecule being spread over a much larger area than the molecule actually occupies. This is especially problematic for closely spaced molecules, which become indistinguishable.</p><p id="Par4">There are several different techniques that overcome this problem and achieve sub-diffraction imaging. The most common method is localization microscopy (LM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, which is further sub-divided into Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) and Photoactivated Localization Microscopy (PALM). LM overcomes the diffraction limit by taking advantage of the blinking properties of certain fluorophores that switch between bright and dark states. When only a few molecules are actively emitting at any time they can be observed in isolation from all others as a series of discrete point spread functions, which reveal their location<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Switching subsets of the bright and dark populations creates a process by which each of the molecules can be imaged in isolation and a super-resolved image can be reconstructed. Other techniques of achieving sub-diffraction imaging include Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, which uses a high-frequency structured illumination that is scanned across the sample through at least three different angles, yielding a series of moiré patterns, to uniformly increase the resolution of the final image. Through this patterned approach SIM is able to double the resolution, or effective numerical aperture, of an optical microscope.</p><p id="Par5">A typical LM experiment uses subsets of organic fluorophores and fluorescent proteins that exhibit the requisite blinking properties. Whilst organic fluorophores typically emit more photons per photoswitch than photoactivatable fluorescent proteins, leading to a higher localization precision, they have to be accurately targeted to the proteins of interest. Translational fusions with a fluorescent protein overcome difficulties with targeting that arise from staining with an external fluorophore, but their use in LM is limited because their brightness is generally lower than that for organic dyes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Given the limitations of photoactivatable members of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) family, for example, it is therefore of interest to develop small, stable, bright, photo-switchable, fluorescent proteins for applications in LM.</p><p id="Par6">Here, we show that the 17.6 kDa α-subunit of phycocyanin, CpcA, bearing either a PCB or PEB chromophore, represents a novel, photo-switchable probe for super-resolution microscopy. Photo-switching behaviour has been established both <italic>in vitro</italic> using surface-attached, nanopatterned CpcA-PCB and CpcA-PEB arrays and <italic>in vivo</italic> by using CpcA as a reporter of membrane protein distribution in the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane.

Purified CpcA-PCB and CpcA-PEB proteins were analysed by steady-state and time-resolved absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. Absorption and fluorescence emission spectra (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>) revealed that these pigment-proteins occupy different but overlapping spectral regions, in total spanning 500–650 nm for absorption and 560–760 nm for emission. The singlet excited state lifetimes of CpcA-PCB and CpcA-PEB were measured by fluorescence decay (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>) and transient absorption (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>) studies. The average values for CpcA-PCB and CpcA-PEB are 1.3 and 1.9 ns, respectively. The fluorescence quantum yields were determined by relative and absolute measurements. The average values are 0.23 for CpcA-PCB and 0.67 for CpcA-PEB; both are lower than those reported previously (0.39 and 0.98)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> but have the same relative ordering. In order to ensure that the fluorescence spectra and quantum yields are not compromised by effects of aggregation, the spectra were measured for CpcA-PEB over a five-fold range of concentration (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). This gave samples with an optical density (OD) at the 556 nm absorption peak ranging from 0.031 to 0.167 and the OD at the 510 nm excitation wavelength (to acquire fluorescence spectra) ranging from 0.009 to 0.046. The same absorption and fluorescence spectral profiles were obtained. Similarly, the integrated fluorescence intensities (when corrected for absorbance at the excitation wavelength) were the same. These findings indicate there are no significant effects of aggregation for such samples.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Photophysical analysis of purified CpcA-PCB and CpcA-PEB.

Representative time-resolved difference (ΔA = A<sub>excited-state</sub> − A<sub>ground-state</sub>) spectra as a function of time after excitation with a 100 fs flash for CpcA-PCB are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>. In these spectra, positive-going features represent excited state absorption (e.g., S<sub>1</sub> → S<sub>2</sub>, S<sub>3</sub>, etc.) and negative-going features reflect bleaching of a ground state absorption band (S<sub>0</sub> → S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>, etc.) along with excited state emission (S<sub>1</sub> → S<sub>0</sub>) stimulated by the white light probe pulse. The spectra for CpcA-PCB in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref> are dominated by bleaching of the ground state absorption band at ~640 nm due to formation of the lowest singlet excited state. This bleaching (and the rest of the absorption difference spectrum) decays to zero by 6 ns. This observation shows that the fluorescent lowest singlet excited state decays virtually completely to the ground state and thus that the yield of intersystem crossing to the lowest triplet excited state is virtually zero. The same conclusion is drawn for CpcA-PEB given that the bleaching of the ground state absorption band at ~570 nm for the lowest singlet excited state decays to zero by 7.5 ns (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). The transient absorption data depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> were acquired using excitation with 100 fs pulses having an energy of 1 μJ focused to 1 mm (2 × 10<sup>14</sup> photons/cm<sup>2</sup>). This photon density was chosen to minimize singlet-singlet annihilation and other multiphoton effects that could compromise singlet decay characteristics and triplet yields. Therefore, studies on CpcA-PEB were undertaken using excitation energies of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 μJ/pulse. The same results − a triplet yield of essentially zero − was found in all cases. The main difference is that at the highest excitation energies, a fast (&lt;10 ps) component to the excited state decay was observed, likely due to some singlet-singlet annihilation.</p><p id="Par9">Thus, for both variants the yield of intersystem crossing is zero and the yield of internal conversion of the singlet excited state to the ground state can be obtained from the fluorescence yield. In particular, the internal-conversion yield is 1− 0.23 = 0.77 for CpcA-PCB and 1− 0.67 = 0.33 for CpcA-PEB. The finding that these proteins do not produce triplet excited states eliminates a mechanism for photo-instability in which long lived triplet states in the presence of O<sub>2</sub> produce reactive oxygen species that could lead to degradation of the fluorescence probe (or other entities nearby). The photostability of CpcA-PEB appears to be somehow lower than that for CpcA-PCB in certain imaging studies (<italic>see below</italic>). Such a difference must then arise from processes initiated in the singlet excited state, such as photoinduced electron transfer (e.g. photooxidation) that would depend on the relative excited state energies and redox potentials of the two constructs.</p><p id="Par10">The values for fluorescence lifetime and quantum yield are similar to those for variants of the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP), for example, which are 3 ns and 0.76 respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The extinction coefficients (M<sup>−1</sup> cm<sup>−1</sup>) were calculated to be 100,265 M<sup>−1</sup>cm<sup>−1</sup> at 624 nm for CpcA-PCB and 112,590 M<sup>−1</sup>cm<sup>−1</sup> at 556 nm for CpcA-PEB. The overall brightness of these proteins is the product of the quantum yield and extinction coefficient, expressed in units of mM<sup>−1</sup>cm<sup>−1</sup>, which yields values of 23 and 75 for CpcA-PCB and CpcA-PEB, respectively, and compares well to EYFP, which has a brightness of 55.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Photo-switching and STORM of nanopatterned arrays of CpcA-PCB and CpcA-PEB</title><p id="Par11">To test the suitability of CpcA proteins as fluorophores suitable for STORM, we imaged nanopatterned arrays of the phycobiliproteins on a glass surface so the image to be reconstructed was known at the outset. The two types of CpcA were nanopatterned onto self-assembled monolayers on glass coverslips; these nanostructures have been well characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and were used previously to study fluorescence lifetimes of photosynthetic complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The samples were excited with either 514 nm (CpcA-PCB) or 532 nm (CpcA-PEB) lasers, which caused each of these pigmented proteins to undergo spontaneous photo-switching without the requirements of an activation laser. CpcA-PCB and CpcA-PEB settle into an on-off equilibrium with little evidence of photobleaching after an initial illumination period, a property required for photoactivatable fluorescent proteins.</p><p id="Par12">CpcA-PEB nanopatterns had been fabricated with 200 nm wide lines and 2 µm periodicity.

Analysis of the reconstructions by Fourier transform yielded a periodicity of 1.95 µm, in good agreement with the template used for lithography, and a linewidth (full-width half-maximum) of 200 nm.

In addition, we have demonstrated the feasibility of using CpcA-PEB and CpcA-PCB as fluorescent labels for 2D-SIM and 3D-SIM imaging, respectively. The differences in behaviour of the protein with these two imaging modalities arises from the difference in illumination intensity, whereby CpcA exhibits continuous fluorescence at lower illumination intensities and photoswitching at higher illumination intensities. The CpcA protein is derived from the light-harvesting antenna, the phycobilisome, of the cyanobacterium <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp.

Thus, there is almost no background signal from the apoprotein or unattached bilins (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S6</xref>), and the only localization signals observed are from the CpcA-bound form of the pigment.</p><p id="Par18">Transient absorption studies of the triplet yield (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) show the basis for the photostability of CpcA-PCB in particular (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S5</xref>), which arises from nearly complete decay of the lowest singlet excited state to the ground state, with virtually no formation of long lived triplet states that could produce reactive oxygen species. The brightness values for CpcA-PCB and CpcA-PEB, 23 mM<sup>−1</sup>cm<sup>−1</sup> and 75 mM<sup>−1</sup>cm<sup>−1</sup> respectively, lie within the range of most fluorescent proteins that emit maximally up to 600 nm.

Masks were then transferred to piranha-cleaned coverslips and dried under vacuum to remove any remaining water. For the two separate protein variants, different processes were used to create the nanopatterns. For CpcA-PCB, a self-assembled monolayer was created in the channels by vapor deposition by placing the coverslips under an anhydrous nitrogen atmosphere with 35 µl (3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane (MPTMS) (Sigma-Aldrich) before being placed into vacuum.

For imaging, cells were grown as described above using the appropriate plasmid combinations and antibiotics (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>). Cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 rpm, 4 °C, 15 min) and cell pellets were washed in 25 mM HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid), pH 7.5.</p><p id="Par31">For STORM, cells were resuspended in PBS and incubated on piranha-cleaned coverslips coated with poly-L-lysine (0.1%) and a dilute solution of 540/560 0.1 µm Fluospheres for drift correction (ThermoFisher Scientific). Cells were imaged with a 514 nm Coherent Sapphire laser at a power density of 1.6 kW/cm<sup>2</sup>. Imaging was performed with a ZT514/647rpc-UF2 dichroic beamsplitter (Chroma Technology) and a ZET532/640 M emission filter (Chroma Technology). 10,000 frames were collected with a 40 ms exposure on a Zyla 4.2 sCMOS camera (Andor Technology).</p><p id="Par32">For SIM, cells were resuspended in PBS and incubated on piranha-cleaned coverslips coated with poly-L-lysine (0.1%). Samples were mounted in SlowFade Diamond Antifade (ThermoFisher Scientific) and imaged in the Wolfson Light Microscopy Facility at the University of Sheffield. Samples were imaged on a DeltaVision OMX V4 microscope (GE Healthcare) with the Blaze 3D-SIM module equipped with a 60× 1.42 NA oil objective. CpcA-PEB was imaged with a 514-nm laser with emission collected through a 609/37 bandpass filter. CpcA-PCB was imaged with a 642 nm laser with emission collected through a 683/40 bandpass filter. Axial sectioning was achieved with a step size of 125 nm and the resultant image stacks were reconstructed with the SoftWoRx 6.0 software (GE Healthcare).</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Data availability</title><p id="Par33">All data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported as part of the Photosynthetic Antenna Research Center (PARC), an Energy Frontier Research Center funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences under Award Number DE-SC 0001035.
