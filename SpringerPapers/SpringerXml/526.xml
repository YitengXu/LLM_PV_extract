Optimally designed silver (Ag) front-contacts in the majority of c-Si solar cells utilize narrow grid lines (approximate width of 50 μm) to minimize shading loss and achieve high current, high fill factor, and hence, high photo-conversion efficiency. While screen-printing provides an economically attractive means for making these contacts, owing to suitability for high-volume manufacturing, the use of Ag adds significantly to the solar cell cost. Furthermore, despite more than three decades of use in photovoltaic manufacturing, the mechanism of contact formation during the firing of screen-printed contacts remains a subject of debate. Achieving optimal firing conditions to minimize contact resistance, and to develop new pastes with alternative materials (that is, earth-abundant and non-toxic), requires a detailed understanding of the contact formation process. <italic>In situ</italic> X-ray diffraction (XRD) data obtained during rapid-thermal processing (RTP) of Ag-paste materials reveal that there are multiple competing anti-reflective layer burn-through and Si oxidation reactions occurring with different temperature thresholds. The primary reactive species responsible for burn-through is lead-oxide (PbO), and these PbO driven redox reactions lead to liquid Pb formation and reversible Ag–Pb alloying during firing. Our <italic>in situ</italic> experiments also elucidate factors affecting dissolution of Ag into the frit and subsequent nanocrystal precipitation – key for achieving low contact resistance.</p><p id="Par4">Typically, screen-printing contacts onto the n-type emitter of a p-type c-Si solar cell employs a paste consisting of Ag particles, organic binders and metal-oxide glass frit. The frit, usually a PbO-based borosilicate glass, promotes a series of reactions allowing electrical contact to the emitter after deposition of the silicon-nitride (SiN<sub>x</sub>) anti-reflective and passivation layer during contact firing. Although the frit has long been known to enable this process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, conflicting arguments bring into question the specific role of the frit to enable SiN<sub>x</sub> burn-through and the mechanism of Ag transport to the c-Si surface. Hence, the actual electrical contact formation pathway remains scarcely understood – largely because previous investigations lacked <italic>in situ</italic> measurement capabilities with the temporal-resolution and operating temperature range necessary to observe these processes in real-time.</p><p id="Par5">Reactions responsible for contact formation occur during rapid heating, with ramp-rates of 50–100 °C s<sup>−1</sup>, at temperatures of 500–800 °C. In general, the Ag-paste is well known to penetrate the SiN<sub>x</sub> layer during firing by oxidation, and the resulting silicon-oxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) reaction product becomes incorporated into the molten frit. However, the associated oxidation reaction remains in question, since this can occur in one of several ways. The two most frequently cited arguments suggest either that SiN<sub>x</sub> is oxidized by PbO in the frit by<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>:<disp-formula id="Equ1"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2016_Article_BFncomms11143_Equ1_HTML.gif"/></disp-formula></p><p id="Par6">or, that Ag, which can dissolve in frit as silver oxide (Ag<sub>2</sub>O) up to approximately 5 wt.%(refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>), etches the SiN<sub>x</sub> by<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>:<disp-formula id="Equ2"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2016_Article_BFncomms11143_Equ2_HTML.gif"/></disp-formula></p><p id="Par7">The second case is perhaps less obvious, since Ag<sub>2</sub>O itself readily decomposes under thermal activation, and so may not seem an obvious reactant at contact firing temperatures. However, Ag<sub>2</sub>O becomes more stable when bound in certain glasses, and therefore, technically both reactions (1) and (2) are thermodynamically feasible. <italic>In situ</italic> results presented in this work reveal the dominant SiN<sub>x</sub> burn-through reaction.</p><p id="Par8">After SiN<sub>x</sub> opening, Ag contacts the Si emitter. Electrical conduction in fired contacts relies largely on tunneling through a layer of re-solidified glass frit, which forms between the c-Si surface and Ag bulk during firing.

Here, certain additional details remain in question. For instance, the means by which Ag deposits onto the emitter is not obvious. According to some authors the deposition of Ag on the emitter requires the Ag to first oxidize by:<disp-formula id="Equ3"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2016_Article_BFncomms11143_Equ3_HTML.gif"/></disp-formula></p><p id="Par9">and then dissolve into the glass frit before a subsequent redox reaction between Ag<sub>2</sub>O and c-Si (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>):<disp-formula id="Equ4"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2016_Article_BFncomms11143_Equ4_HTML.gif"/></disp-formula></p><p id="Par10">Not all agree with the Ag<sub>2</sub>O-based deposition model.

In addition, the extent of Pb formation, argued to assist in Ag sintering, has been questioned. Thus, ambiguity persists regarding details of metal transport and precipitation, the extent of Ag–Pb alloying, the extent of Ag–Pb–Si alloying if any occurs at all, and therefore the keys for achieving low contact resistance.</p><p id="Par11">Here, direct observation of SiN etching by PbO and Ag<sub>2</sub>O during different stages of firing using <italic>in situ</italic> XRD reveals the burn-through reaction and contact formation sequence. Studies on Ag, frit, c-Si and SiN model systems show a strong dependence of Pb formation, and hence Ag–Pb alloying, on oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) partial pressure during firing. In addition, Ag dissolution into the glass frit, and hence the resulting abundance of Ag precipitate formation, shows a strong O<sub>2</sub>-dependence. This investigation finds the Ag redox reactions only occur with sufficient O<sub>2</sub> at temperatures higher than 650 °C – negating a role of Ag in opening of the antireflective-coating at lower temperatures. Our findings also explain increased Pb formation observed when firing in a N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere compared with air. Understanding the temperature thresholds for each of these competing mechanisms accurately clarifies the nature of screen-printed, fast-fired contacts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Powder model system</title><p id="Par12">Model systems containing Ag nanocrystals, PbO-based frit, SiN<sub>x</sub> and c-Si, in varying combinations, have been fired in an air or nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) atmosphere and characterized using an <italic>in situ</italic> XRD/RTP apparatus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.

On cooling, the diffuse peak disappears while the Ag peaks gain intensity and broaden. Most likely, Ag peak broadening reflects contributions from newly formed Ag nanocrystals that precipitate within the glass during cooling.

In fact, the present study finds that both mechanisms occur, though with different onset temperatures. Examining the intensity trends versus time and temperature allows decoupling of the competing mechanisms. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> shows the corresponding temperature profile versus time along with Ag, Si and Pb integrated intensities. The Si diffraction intensity begins to decrease at about 10 s (500 °C). Then, the Ag peak intensity begins to diminish 5 s later, at about 14 s (650 °C). As the Ag signal begins to drop, the rate of Si signal loss accelerates markedly. Loss of Si signal results from Si oxidation by either PbO or Ag<sub>2</sub>O in the frit. Ag dissolution into the molten frit by reaction 3 must occur before etching by Ag<sub>2</sub>O (reaction 4). Since the Si signal decreases before the onset of Ag intensity loss, the low temperature oxidation (&lt;650 °C) must be dominated by reaction with PbO in the frit (that is, by reaction 1). The observation of Pb diffraction upon cooling below 320 °C supports this interpretation, as this confirms formation of Pb.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title><italic>In situ</italic> diffraction from a model frit system during firing in air.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Temperature profile versus time (solid line) and corresponding variation in Si and Pb diffraction intensity during temperature ramping and cooling.

To test this, Ag/frit mixtures (5 wt.% Ag) were isothermally annealed at 600 and 700 °C for 10 s. As shown in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, annealing at 600 °C induces only a modest increase in Ag(111) intensity, probably due to grain growth. On the other hand, at 700 °C, the Ag intensity decreases and only 30% of the initial intensity remains after 10 s. The loss of Ag diffraction intensity implies about 70% Ag dissolution into the frit by reaction 3. Therefore, Ag dissolution into the frit must occur with a temperature threshold between 600 °C and 700 °C, and hence, oxidation of SiN<sub>x</sub> or Si (observed onset temperature is approximately 500 °C) below this temperature range cannot involve Ag<sup>+</sup> ions.

During heating, the Ag peaks initially become sharper as a consequence of grain growth, and the intensity increases slightly. Then, above 650 °C (about 15 s), the Ag intensity diminishes continuously with increasing temperature up to the maximum temperature of 810 °C (about 20 s). In both cases, air and N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere, the Ag peak intensity recovers during cooling, albeit to a different extent.

According to the equilibrium Ag–Pb phase diagram, metallic Pb formed by redox reactions between PbO and SiN<sub>x</sub> readily forms a liquid alloy with Ag in this temperature range. As was previously shown, more Pb forms in N<sub>2</sub> due to irreversible reduction of PbO (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Hence more Ag–Pb alloying occurs in N<sub>2</sub>, which is almost entirely reversible due to low miscibility of Ag and Pb solid phases at lower temperatures. On the other hand, <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> showed that Ag dissolves readily into the glass in the presence of O<sub>2</sub> above 650 °C. Thus, in the case of firing in air, the dip in Ag signal reflects both Ag–Pb alloying and Ag dissolution, whereas only the former occurs in N<sub>2</sub>. In air, some of the Ag signal recovers as Ag nanocrystals precipitate within the glass upon cooling as a consequence of the temperature-dependent solubility. However, weak scattering from nanocrystals having a diameter below 2 nm, as are commonly seen in cross-sections of fired contacts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and Ag remaining bound as Ag<sup>+</sup> within the glass, are both consistent with lower Ag signal detected after firing in air.</p><p id="Par24">Before considering implications of these results on screen-printed solar cell contacts, it is important to show that the model systems used in the present work behave representatively. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> shows a cross-section SEM of our model frit system with inverted Ag pyramids penetrating the surface of the c-Si substrate beneath the Ag/frit/SiN<sub>x</sub> mixture after firing.

Interestingly, in this case, the mixture contained a larger proportion of frit (1:1 frit/Ag) compared with common Ag pastes used in solar cell contacts (typically lower than 0.1:1), which seems to have induced a larger characteristic Ag pyramid size compared with most other studies.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Cross section SEM showing Ag pyramids in a fired test sample.</title><p>SEM image at × 100,000 magnification where the scale bar is 1 μm, shows a cross-section of an Ag/frit/SiN<sub>x</sub> sample fired to 800 °C at 100 °C s<sup>−1</sup> and reveals formation of inverted Ag pyramids penetrating the surface of the c-Si substrate.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2016_Article_BFncomms11143_Fig6_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par25">A complete picture of the contact formation process, consistent with all previous findings and informed by the present <italic>in situ</italic> results, emerges as follows: during firing, above 500 °C, the frit melts and wets the Ag/SiN<sub>x</sub> interface.

Pb formed during the burn-through process alloys with and assists in liquid-phase assisted sintering of Ag (<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>). Above 650 °C, Ag dissolves into the frit and diffuses towards the emitter surface. In the vicinity of the Si emitter surface, Ag ions are consumed by redox reaction 4, which oxidizes Si to SiO<sub>2</sub> and deposits metallic Ag on the emitter surface (<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>). SiO<sub>2</sub> formed by reaction 4 is incorporated into the molten frit. On cooling, the solubility of Ag in the melt decreases and nanocrystals precipitate from within the glass matrix.

At the same time, over-firing must be avoided both to prevent excessive Ag deposition onto the emitter – Ag spikes – which can shunt the <italic>pn</italic>-junction in extreme cases, and to minimize SiO<sub>2</sub> generation, which increases the thickness of the glass layer and diminishes carrier tunneling.</p><p id="Par27">In the larger effort to replace costly Ag and toxic Pb in the solar cell manufacturing sector, the present study offers several insights. To replace Ag with an alternative, low-resistivity metal, assuming suitable work-function alignment for contacting Si, analogous use will require the metal have variable solubility in a frit system within a comparable temperature range (below 800 °C). The PbO-based frit may be replaced by a frit system containing another metal-oxide that alloys with the primary contact metal upon metal-oxide reduction and provides a low glass transition temperature. This is a necessary condition to achieve wetting and adhesion at the contact interface. The frit must contain a reactive species with a negative redox potential in relation to SiN<sub>x</sub>, and preferably to both SiN<sub>x</sub> and Si. Ultimately, metal solubility and transport kinetics enabling nanocrystal precipitation within the glass upon cooling, which allows carrier tunneling (that is, ohmic contact formation), depends strongly on the frit composition. Thus, the metal and accompanying frit used in the paste must be developed in tandem.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Model system</title><p id="Par28">Ag, frit, SiN<sub>x</sub> and c-Si model systems in this study have been characterized as powder mixtures.
