The recent advent of quantum dot inks has overcome the prior need for solid-state exchanges that previously added cost, complexity, and morphological disruption to the quantum dot solid. Unfortunately, these inks remain limited by the photocarrier diffusion length. Here we devise a strategy based on n- and p-type ligands that judiciously shifts the quantum dot band alignment. It leads to ink-based materials that retain the independent surface functionalization of quantum dots, and it creates distinguishable donor and acceptor domains for bulk heterojunctions. Interdot carrier transfer and exciton dissociation studies confirm efficient charge separation at the nanoscale interfaces between the two classes of quantum dots. We fabricate the first mixed-quantum-dot solar cells and achieve a power conversion of 10.4%, which surpasses the performance of previously reported bulk heterojunction quantum dot devices fully two-fold, indicating the potential of the mixed-quantum-dot approach.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary" specific-use="web-only"><p id="Par2">Solution processed colloidal quantum dots are emerging photovoltaic materials with tuneable infrared bandgaps.

Among emerging materials for third-generation photovoltaics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are of great interest in view of their size-dependent bandgap that allows efficient absorption across the broad solar spectrum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Advances in surface passivation and device architecture have led to consistent increases in photovoltaic performance, beginning from &lt;1% in 2005 to a recently certified record of 11.3%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Photovoltaic performance can be increased via charge separation using p–n junctions that interpenetrate at the nanoscale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In organic solar cells, the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) enables exciton dissociation into free carriers to avoid bimolecular recombination and thereby increase performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The BHJ is achieved via material phase separation at the nanoscale during film preparation. The BHJ concept has been explored in QDs as well with the goal of extending the carrier diffusion length and achieving device thicknesses comparable to optical absorption length. However, QD BHJ devices have so far shown solar power conversion efficiencies that reached at most half those of the best planar devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. These prior BHJ devices have relied on solid-state (a.k.a. place) ligand exchanges, and thus required two different QD materials for the donor and acceptor phases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Relative enhancements in current density have indicated progress on carrier extraction, but a low fill factor revealed the inferiority of the complementary QD material (Bi<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, ZnO, or CdSe) compared to state-of-the-art PbS QDs. Employing PbS QDs for both donor and acceptor phases has so far been impossible, since in a place exchange, the whole material stack is treated homogeneously.</p><p id="Par5">In this study, we took the view that—by contrast—a mixed QD ink would be an ideal material platform in which to advance PV performance. Each component could be separately optimized in solution before the mixture is formed. Surface ligands could be used to tailor electron affinity, allowing the shifting of QD band energy levels to prepare a desired hetero-offset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, as well as interdot coupling and carrier mobility for electrons and holes separately. We therefore prototyped the mixed-quantum-dot solid for solar cell applications. This type of mixed solid is based on an ink that combines, and retains the independent surface functionalization of, a donor and an acceptor class of QDs. Spectroscopic studies prove that the donor and acceptor dots are chemically distinct, and that inter-dot interactions are stabilized through hydrogen-bonding among surface ligands. Device simulations predict the optimal ratio of donor:acceptor in the mixture in light of asymmetric hole:electron mobilities, and experimental results agree well with the predicted optimum. Photoluminescence of the mixture shows strong quenching relative to the pure donor and acceptor components, indicating efficient charge separation at the nanoscale interface. Elementally resolved electron microscopy indicates a uniform mixture of donor and acceptor in the extended QD solid. We fabricate the first mixed-quantum-dot ink solar cells and achieve a solar power conversion of 10.4%, two times as high as the performance of previously reported BHJ QD devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Preparation of mixed-quantum-dot solid</title><p id="Par6">We began from a recently developed ligand substitution based on a two-phase solution exchange procedure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Concentrated QD inks were directly deposited by spin-casting to yield dense QD films<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Donor- and acceptor-type QDs were prepared separately using two sets of solution-phase ligand exchange protocols (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). To form QDs with deeper bands, the oleic acid ligands initially capping the QDs were exchanged with lead halide anions, PbX<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, to passivate the surface with halogen atoms, yielding electron acceptor (henceforth called A-Type) dots. For QDs with shallower bands, various small organic molecules bearing thiol groups to anchor to the QD surface are used in a separate exchange to form electron donor (D-type) dots. The best performing devices and controls were achieved using a mixture of organohalide perovskite ligands based on methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI<sub>3</sub>) for A-type QDs, and thioglycerol (TG) for donor (D-type) dots. Oleic acid and excess unreacted ligands were removed via purification (see Methods). Following the exchange, the hydrophilic functional groups, OH in the case of TG, and MA<sup>+</sup> and PbI<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> in the case of the perovskite ligands, render each type of QD dispersible in butylamine, allowing the production of concentrated QD inks. After the exchange process, the QDs maintain their uniform size distribution, with an average diameter of 3.3 ± 0.5 nm (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). An amorphous layer is observed on the MAPbI<sub>3</sub>-capped QD surface, and this crystallizes to form a thin shell of perovskite under 70 <sup>o</sup>C annealing used in subsequent processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Preparation of mixed-quantum-dot solids using solution ligand exchange. <bold>a</bold> Schematic of the solution ligand exchange process. <bold>b</bold> Calculated HOMO and <bold>c</bold> LUMO states of two coupled dots, showing charge transfer between MAPbI<sub>3</sub>- and TG-capped QDs in the mixed film. <bold>d</bold> Projected density of states demonstrate the offset of the band position between MAPbI<sub>3</sub>- and TG-capped QDs</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2017_1362_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p id="Par7">We then prepared mixed-QD inks comprising programmable ratios of D:A types of QDs. The mixed ink was spin-coated in a single step onto substrates coated with ZnO nanoparticles, forming smooth and uniform active layer thin films. Thiol-based ligands are known to move the bandstructure up to shallower energy levels, whereas halide anions deepen the bandstructure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The mixed-QD solid therefore incorporates a nanoscale-distributed band offset that separates electrons and holes into different domains, thus, preventing their subsequent recombination. Both density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b–d</xref>; Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>) confirm this staggered offset in the case of a 3 nm MAPbI<sub>3</sub>-capped QD adjacent to a TG-capped QD, exhibiting a band alignment that favors charge separation into separate carrier pathways at D/A interfaces.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Quantum dot surface characterization</title><p id="Par8">Various types of QDs, including PbS and PbSe, are known to have surfaces prone to atomic rearrangement, as well labile ligand–surface bonds. Exchange among ligands for A-type and D-type QDs during mixing of the two classes would result in mixed coverage, and negate the benefit of altering the levels of the bands. We define chemical orthogonality as a property of the QD mixture wherein, in the two distinct classes of QDs, each class of QD maintains its surface ligands throughout mixing in solution and in a film.</p><p id="Par9">To investigate whether we had indeed achieved QD chemical orthogonality, we used Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) to characterize the exchanges and the ligand exclusivity of the resultant materials. The absence of a carboxylic group C = O stretch (at around 1750 cm<sup>−1</sup>) from each exchanged QD sample indicates a complete ligand exchange and oleic acid removal. For MAPbI<sub>3</sub>-capped QDs, stretching and bending signals for C–H<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> (2850–2950 and 1380–1460 cm<sup>−1</sup>, respectively) and N–H<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> (3000–3300 and 1550–1700 cm<sup>−1</sup>, respectively) confirm the presence of the MA<sup>+</sup> cation. The TG-capped QDs, in contrast, show no narrowband N–H<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> signals, but instead reveal a broad and strong peak 3000–3600 cm<sup>−1</sup>, assigned to the O–H stretch of the terminal hydroxyl groups. After we mix the two classes of QDs, the N–H<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and O–H signals are retained. The O–H stretching signal shifts to a higher wavenumber and exhibits now a sharper lineshape. This is consistent with the previously reported disruption of intermolecular/intramolecular hydrogen bonds among surface TG molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. We conclude that, when the two classes of QDs are mixed, intramolecular hydrogen bonds are disrupted, and the hydroxyl groups on the TG molecule interact with perovskite functional groups. These chemical bonding features are retained after 70 °C annealing (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>), indicating that each class of ligand remains strongly bound to each class of QD.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Characterizations of ligand attachment and transient absorption photophysics. <bold>a</bold> Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of PbS QDs passivated by (i) MAPbI<sub>3</sub> (ii) TG, and (iii) two types of ligands (mixed-QD sample). <bold>b</bold><sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra of quantum dot ligands in solution (red) and bound to PbS quantum dot surface (black).

Hydroxyl groups of TG ligands are not reactive enough to bind to the QD surface, and they therefore remain protonated, maintaining their ability to act as hydrogen bond donors. The TG is not reactive with the MAPbI<sub>3</sub>-capped QDs because the robust Pb–S bond prevents ligand dissociation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In comparison, for the MAPbI<sub>3</sub>-capped QDs, it is known that stable ionic shells of [PbI<sub>3</sub>]<sup>−</sup> form a Stern layer on the surface of the dot, while cationic species such as MAI<sup>+</sup> and [PbI]<sup>+</sup> form a diffuse layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. This electrical double-layer maintains charge neutrality on the surface, therefore stabilizing the QD in solution. Due to the strong surface stabilization of both ligands, it is rare under ambient conditions for chemical reactions to occur in solution between the acceptor and donor QDs. These findings suggest that the mixtures of the QDs explored herein should be expected to preserve their distinct optoelectronic properties when incorporated into devices. It also illustrates two distinct colloidal stabilization strategies in a polar solvent, i.e., solubility due to hydrophilic functional groups for small organic molecules in the case of D-type QDs, and charged surfaces in the case of A-type QDs, meaning this strategy is applicable to other donor/acceptor type surface molecules.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Interdot carrier transfer and exciton dissociation studies</title><p id="Par12">We further tested this picture of surface ligands retained on each type of dot throughout mixing and annealing by investigating the photophysical properties of single-class QD vs. mixed-QD materials. In the mixed-QD BHJ solid, the rate of exciton dissociation is expected to be increased due to type II band alignment throughout the film, and interdot carrier transfer rates are expected to be intermediate between those of pure A-type and pure D-type films. To investigate further how the mixture of D- and A-type QDs influences excited state dynamics in the mixed-QD solid, we performed ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy (see Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> for detailed explanation of TA spectroscopy). Following photoexcitation, the carriers diffuse throughout the film from higher to lower energy sites due to the inhomogeneity in the QD solid. This will cause a time-dependent redshifting and narrowing of the exciton signal in TA spectra, schematically shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> (data for QD films shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref>). The rate of this process, called spectral diffusion, is directly related to the mobility of the carriers as they navigate the energy landscape, and is indicated by the more rapid decay of the signal at higher energies, mirrored by a rise of the signal at lower energies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Such time traces are plotted for solids of TG-capped, MAPbI<sub>3</sub>-capped, and mixed-QD films in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d and f</xref>, respectively. Relative rates of spectral diffusion are estimated by the temporal crossing of these high- and low-energy time traces for the different QD solids, and are found to be slowest in TG-capped QDs (crossover at 345 ps), fastest in MAPbI<sub>3</sub>-capped QDs (7.5 ps), and intermediate in the mixed-QD solid (12 and 40 ps). Spectral diffusion in the mixed-QDs comes closer to the timescale of the MAPbI<sub>3</sub>-capped QDs, consistent with the preponderance (2:1 ratio) of MAPbI<sub>3</sub>- to TG-capped QDs. Higher-power TA data reconfirm the intermediate dynamics of the mixed-QD film based on comparing the rates of diffusion-assisted Auger recombination (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). We conclude that the carrier mobility is highest for MAPbI<sub>3</sub>-capped QDs, lowest for TG-capped QDs, and intermediate between these two extremes for the mixed-QD film. Low mobility in the TG-capped QDs contributes to their poor device performance compared to pure MAPbI<sub>3</sub>-capped QDs. Additional analysis of TA spectral features is found in Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>.</p><p id="Par13">Importantly, despite the lower mobility in mixed-QD films, time-resolved PL spectroscopy indicates faster exciton dissociation in mixed-QDs compared to MAPbI<sub>3</sub>-capped and TG-capped QD films (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14</xref>). While TA signal measures carriers, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measures excitons and, therefore, is sensitive to exciton dissociation into free carriers, manifested as a rapid decay of the PL signal. This is a strong indication for the formation of a BHJ, where the staggered band alignment between D- and A-type QDs throughout the film favors charge separation of carriers into different phases.</p><p id="Par14">The appreciable difference between the mobilities of D-type and A-type QDs suggested the following possible solution: vary the D-/A-ratio in the film to modulate the overall transport of charge in the BHJ (i.e., mixed QD) active layer.

The ratio of D-type to A-type QDs will determine the abundance of percolation pathways for holes vs. electrons (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>).

The approach relies on forming a mixture of donor and acceptor QDs that each maintain their distinct chemical character when mixed in the solution phase and when formed into a final film. The electron affinity of the QDs is controlled by the application of surface ligands in solution exchanges completed prior to the formation of the colloidal mixture. These ligands are bound tightly to the surface, allowing the intimate mixture of the two dot classes to be preserved even in the solid state, leading to electrons and holes being separated into different domains, suppressing their subsequent recombination. Photocarriers can then migrate efficiently through their respective donor/acceptor transport media when the D:A stoichiometry is suitably optimized.

TEM samples were prepared by drop casting TG-, and MAPbI<sub>3</sub>-capped PbS QD solutions onto ultra-thin carbon 3 mm grids. The loaded grids were allowed to dry under a hot lamp for 5–10 min. Some samples were subject to short plasma cleaning (10–20 s) to reduce the effects of beam contamination inside the electron microscope.</p><p id="Par35">FIB technique was applied for the preparation of solar cell TEM sample using Zeiss NVision 40 FIB-SEM. The area of interest was coated with an ion-beam deposited protection layer of tungsten. The lamella under the area of interest was liberated by FIB milling and attached to a manipulator needle, followed by attachment to a post of a TEM half-grid. The lamella was thinned from both sides using line milling with the 30 kV Ga ion beam and the final probe current down to 40 pA. This was followed by a lower voltage polishing step on both sides at a 7º glancing angle with a 10-kV ion beam, and then again 5 kV.</p><p id="Par36">TEM analysis was performed using an aberration-corrected FEI-Titan Cubed electron microscope, equipped with an Oxford EDX detector and a Gatan EELS spectrometer, and operated at 200 kV for high-resolution imaging and 80 kV for imaging and EDX analysis. A combination of high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) imaging and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) imaging modalities were utilized to image individual nanoparticles and nanoparticle ensembles. In addition, energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) microanalysis was used to map the atomic species present in the various layers of the device and EELS was used to map the location of iodine in the active layer of the solar cell device.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Carrier extraction and morphology in the mixed-QD solid</title><p id="Par37">The normalized path length (<inline-formula id="IEq2"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq2_Math"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>̃</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mo>∕</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq2_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The film was placed at an incident angle of 30° away from the detector to avoid reflections of the incident beam. A 375 nm laser diode was used as a pulsed excitation source, and the time traces were acquired using the TCSPC near-infrared detector.

Part of the fundamental beam was used to pump an optical parametric amplifier (ORPHEUS, Light Conversion) to serve as a narrowband pump, while the other part was focused into a sapphire crystal to generate a white-light supercontinuum probe (900–1000 nm window with various optical filters). Both the pump and probe pulses were directed into a commercial transient absorption spectrometer (Helios, Ultrafast). Delaying the probe pulse relative to the pump provides a time window of up to 8 ns, and the time resolution of these experiments was ∼300 fs (estimated by the rise time of signal amplitudes in transient absorption spectra). TA measurements on QD films were performed at low powers to extract band tailing dynamics and at high powers to extract Auger lifetimes and dynamics. QD films were pumped at slightly shorter wavelengths than their bleach maxima to avoid pump scatter. TG-capped QD films were pumped at 820 nm (bleach maximum ~840 nm), MAPbI<sub>3</sub>-capped QD films were pumped at 890 nm (bleach maximum ~910 nm) and BHJ-QD films were pumped at 870 nm (bleach maximum ~890 nm).</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Data availability</title><p id="Par40">All data are available upon request.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This publication is based in part on work supported by an award (KUS-11-009-21) from the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), by the Ontario Research Fund Research Excellence Program and by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada.
