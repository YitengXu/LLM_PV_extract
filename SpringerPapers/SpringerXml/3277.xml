In spite of the progress of device structure design, the development of scintillators is far behind. Here, a Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub>: Mn scintillator showing a high light yield of ~67000 ph MeV<sup>−1</sup> at 564 nm is presented. Doping and intrinsic features endow Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub>: Mn with robust thermal stability and irradiation hardness that 71% or &gt;95% of the initial radioluminescence intensity can be maintained in an ultra-broad temperature range of 77 K-433 K or after a total irradiation dose of 2590 Gy, respectively. These superiorities allow the fabrication of efficient and stable nuclear batteries, which show an output improvement of 237% respect to the photovoltaic device without scintillator. Luminescence mechanisms including self-trapped exciton, energy transfer, and impact excitation are proposed for the anomalous dramatic radioluminescence improvement.

These facilities may operate continuously for more than 10 years at places without human beings and this calls for energy systems that can generate energy themselves and work for a long time. Nuclear batteries (NBs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, which convert energy from radiation sources into electricity appeal to above applications due to their extremely long working lifetime and high stability against harsh conditions. Recently, the radioluminescent NBs have been researched extensively due to the possibilities of higher energy conversion efficiency and protection of terminal semiconductors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Such kind of battery consists of three parts, namely, radiation source, scintillation layer, and photovoltaic device (PVD). The scintillation layer converts radiation energy into light emission and then, the PVD converts these photons into electricity. There is no doubt that the high efficiency of scintillator, radioluminescence (RL) spectrum consistent with the response of PVDs, perfect coupling between luminescent materials and PVDs are the dominating factors to achieve high conversion efficiency. Besides, a good stability of the scintillator against radiation and environmental attack is the basis of NB’s stability.</p><p id="Par4">In the past decade, investigations on the design of the device structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, application of various scintillators (organic or inorganic ones)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, effect and optimization of physical parameters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, and coupling between scintillators and PVDs have been carried out to improve the NB efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Despite the power output and efficiency of NBs have been improved significantly, the scintillators employed in these researches were mainly conventional transition or rare earth metal doped phosphors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, which typically possess short emission wavelength or low light yield (LY). For standard PVDs, the conversion efficiency at short wavelength (mainly shorter than 450 nm) region is usually low. Though some scintillators can emit long-wavelength light, their LYs are commonly frustrating. Therefore, to further improve the performance of NBs, new scintillators with both long wavelength and high LY are urgently needed to break the bottleneck.</p><p id="Par5">The success of lead halide perovskites in light-emitting applications redraw our attention back to metal halide scintillators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Their high photoluminescence quantum yield (PL QY) and good radiation absorption ability may endow them with high LY. Upon the first report of RL phenomenon of perovskite nanocrystals (NCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, demonstration of X-ray imaging based on perovskite NCs has been investigated extensively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Though the emission wavelength of perovskite NCs can be modulated feasibly, their LY is indeed low compared with many commercial scintillators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Besides, their poor stability and toxicity issues make it challenging in practical applications. Referring to the problem of lead, Tang et al. developed a new copper-based scintillator with ultrahigh LY<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Whereas, the emission peak locates in the UV region, which is not consistent with the response of PVDs. Kovalenko et al. reported the fabrication of zero-dimensional tin (Sn<sup>2+</sup>) halides and achieved relatively high LY and long-wavelength emission (660 nm) simultaneously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. But, Sn<sup>2+</sup> is easily oxidized in air and the organic part may also be destroyed at high temperature. Very recently, a new kind of zero-dimensional copper halide (Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub>) NC was reported to exhibit high QY and good stability with self-trapped exciton (STE) based blue emission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, making it potential candidate of highly efficient and stable scintillator for NBs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Here we show that doping Mn<sup>2+</sup> into Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub> crystals can induce significantly improved RL efficiency compared to intrinsic Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub> crystals and a maximum LY of ~67,000 ph MeV<sup>−1</sup> at an emission wavelength of 564 nm was achieved. This is, to the best of our knowledge, almost the highest value at such a long emission wavelength based on low cost material<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the Mn doped Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub> (Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub>:Mn) exhibits good stability against temperature variation that 71% of initial RL intensity can be maintained in an ultra-broad temperature range of 77–433 K while the RL intensity of pure Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub> shows a severe deterioration of 92.5%. Additionally, when Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub>:Mn was irradiated continuously for one month, more than 95% of its initial RL intensity has remained after a total dose of ~2590 Gy. To figure the reasons for the abovementioned phenomena, the luminescence mechanism is discussed detailedly with thorough analyses of structural and luminescent properties. These superiorities imply the promising application of the fashionable copper halide in NBs. Efficient and stable NB based on Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub>:Mn and PVD was fabricated finally, which shows an output improvement of 237% respect to that without scintillator and a power output of 0.46 μW cm<sup>−2</sup>. It is expected that such a new and robust scintillator will open a window for the fields of NBs and radiography.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par7">Structure characterization of Mn<sup>2+</sup> doping. Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub> consists of zero-dimensional electronic structures, and Cu<sup>+</sup> ions occupy two sites, a tetrahedral (Cu 1) and a trigonal (Cu 2) site (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). According to previous theoretical calculations, Cu 3d orbitals dominantly contribute to the valence band maximum (VBM), while the conduction band minimum (CBM) is mainly composed of Cu 4s and I 5p orbitals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Therefore, the exciton transition is localized, which mainly takes place within the Cu–I structures. Then, to modulate the electronic structure and optical properties, replacing Cu<sup>+</sup> or I<sup>−</sup> ions becomes the major strategy. In this work, we aim to introduce an additional exciton recombination center in this new copper halide by doping Mn<sup>2+</sup> to prolong the RL wavelength or even improve the RL efficiency. Though the possibility of achieving long emission wavelength has been evidenced very recently by doping Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, the scintillation performance and detailed structural/optical analyses have never been reported.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Structural analyses of Mn doping in Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub>.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Partial XRD patterns of powders with different doping concentrations. <bold>b</bold> Schematic demonstration of crystal structure of Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub> and doping sites. <bold>c</bold> Rietveld refinement of Mn15%. <bold>d</bold> EPR results of Mn3% and Mn15%. <bold>e</bold> XPS curve of Mn 2<italic>p</italic> in Mn15%.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2021_24185_Fig1_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par8">Theoretical calculations were firstly conducted to evaluate the influences of Mn doping. We can see that replacing either the tetrahedral or the trigonal Cu ions results in similar electronic structures and system energy with a difference of ~90 meV even at a heavy doping concentration (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). Mn dopant introduced additional energy levels between the band gap with a difference of ~94.7 meV for different doping sites. Moreover, the comparable ion size of Cu<sup>+</sup> (0.6 Å) and Mn<sup>2+</sup> (0.66 Å) makes the substitution process to happen easily. Therefore, replacement of Cu ions with Mn ions is possible from both crystal and energy factors.</p><p id="Par9">Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub>:Mn was prepared according to a previous work with significant modifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref> shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles for the Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub>:Mn with different doping concentrations, which exhibit similar diffraction peaks well indexed by standard data. For the sake of simplicity, Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub>:Mnx% was named as Mnx% in the following discussions, where x is the nominal concentration. The diffraction peaks first shift to larger degree upon doping and then shift to smaller degrees with the increase of Mn<sup>2+</sup> concentration (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The abnormal lattice contraction results from additional chloride ions in the precursor, which is much smaller than iodide ions. It should be noted that the incorporation of chloride ions does not change the electronic structure significantly (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). Besides, the concentration of chloride ion cannot be too high due to the intrinsic lattice instability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The lattice expansion with increased Mn<sup>2+</sup> concentration can be assigned to the larger ion radius of Mn<sup>2+</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. When doping concentration increases to 25%, the diffraction peak shifts back to a higher degree, indicating the saturation of Mn<sup>2+</sup> and lattice instability at high doping concentration, which will lead to poor optical properties undoubtedly.</p><p id="Par10">To verify the local crystal environments of Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions in the lattice, rietveld refinements were performed for Mn3% (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>) and Mn15% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), which confirmed the occupation of Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions at both Cu<sup>+</sup> sites (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were also conducted. No EPR signal is detected in the intrinsic sample while six well-resolved spectral lines corresponding to <sup>55</sup>Mn nucleus (<italic>I</italic> = 5/2) can be observed from both the Mn3% and Mn15% samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. First of all, such a strong and high resolved sextet spectral feature suggests a uniform dispersion of Mn<sup>2+</sup> in lattice sites with multi-coordination rather than on the surface. This also rules out the formation of other Mn<sup>2+</sup> related material phases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Second, the g factor of 2.0053, hyperfine splitting constant (<italic>A</italic> = 10.14 mT), and the spectral linewidth (2.51 mT) keep the same in these two samples, indicating the stationary coordination state of Mn<sup>2+</sup> in the lattice despite the signal intensity variation resulted from increased concentration. The A in these samples is a bit larger than that in other metal halides, which might be derived from the low coordination number and large anion radius<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. XPS results indicate the maintenance of Cu<sup>+</sup> state that a 2<italic>p</italic> doublet with the binding energy of 932.1 eV (2<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>3/2</italic></sub>) and 951.8 eV (2<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>1/2</italic></sub>) is observed (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Similar Cs<sup>+</sup> and I<sup>−</sup> ion chemical states are obtained in both undoped and doped samples (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>). Mn core level spectrum shows Mn 2<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>3/2</italic></sub> peak at 641.4 eV and Mn 2<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>1/2</italic></sub> peak at 652.6 eV with a separation of 11.2 eV, which confirm the existence of Mn<sup>2+</sup> dopant (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image and elemental mapping results (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>) reveal the particle size of several to a dozen micrometers and Cs, Cu, I, Mn elements are homogeneously distributed.</p><p id="Par11">Optical and anomalous scintillation properties. Intrinsic Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub> exhibits bright blue emission under a UV lamp (254 nm, Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> inset), which agrees well with the re-absorption free PL spectrum peaking at ~442 nm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Considering the zero-dimensional electronic structure and related large exciton binding energy, the quantum size effect is negligible in this material and large crystals can usually achieve high QY easily due to low lattice defect density and re-absorption free characteristic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. The prepared Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub> powder exhibits a QY of 38.3%. Doping of Mn<sup>2+</sup> introduces another emission band centered at 556 nm along with the intrinsic blue emission (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). When measuring the PLE spectrum with a monitor wavelength of 442 nm (intrinsic emission), it exhibited a similar spectrum to that of undoped sample. Representative excitation spectra monitored around 556 nm are shown in the bottom part, Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, which exhibit three bands centered at 310 (intrinsic), 385 (<sup>6</sup>A<sub>1</sub>(6 S)→<sup>4</sup>T<sub>2</sub>(4D)), and 485 nm (<sup>6</sup>A<sub>1</sub>(6 S)→<sup>4</sup>T<sub>1</sub>(4 G)), respectively. The UV part and that monitored at intrinsic emission wavelength are semblable, indicating the yellow emission from <sup>4</sup>T<sub>1</sub>(4 G) to <sup>6</sup>A<sub>1</sub>(6 S) can be achieved by energy transfer (ET) from Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub> or direct excitation of Mn<sup>2+</sup>.

Two very strange phenomena were observed. First, though pure Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub> showed obvious RL, the blue part almost disappeared when only a small amount of Mn<sup>2+</sup> was doped. There only existed an obvious Mn<sup>2+</sup> related yellow emission peaked at 564 nm along with a weak blue emission. The small redshift compared to the PL peak is in accord with other halides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. It is worth noting Mn<sup>2+</sup> PL is still weak in low doping concentration as shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>, but the RL intensity of Mn3% is much higher than that of pure Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub>. The RL intensity increases along with the doping concentration and reaches a maximum at a concentration of 15%. Then, a sudden RL intensity reduction emerges when the doping concentration increases furtherly (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>). Second, though pure Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub> possess the highest QY while its RL efficiency is the lowest (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). At low doping concentration (&lt; 7%), the QY under the excitation of 310 nm is relatively low while their RL intensity increases continuously. The variation trend of RL intensity is consistent with that of QY under the excitation of 385 nm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Apparently, the RL spectra are completely different from the PL counterparts, implying an interesting luminescence mechanism.</p><p id="Par13">Proposed luminescence mechanism. We then turn our attention to the luminescence mechanism. Though STE emission exhibits strong intensity under the excitation of UV light, it is very weak under X-ray (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). However, when we monitored the luminescence curves under the simultaneous excitation of UV light and X-ray, both the STE and Mn<sup>2+</sup> emission intensities increased (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). It seems that the X-ray and the UV light can excite the sample independently and the interaction between these two excitation processes can be neglected. Besides, simultaneous excitation did not introduce additional blue emission as its ratio is almost the average of the values under separate excitation (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11a</xref>). The emission peak of Mn<sup>2+</sup> under simultaneous excitation is also the direct combination with a peak in the middle of PL and RL peaks (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11b</xref>). In another word, these two excitations are independent to some extent and possess different excitation and recombination mechanisms.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Proposed PL and RL mechanism.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Luminescent spectra of thick Mn15% film under the excitations of X-ray, 320 nm laser or both.

Though the difference of PL QY is not very large (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, ex = 310 nm) and the optimized sample does not exhibit the strongest yellow PL (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12a</xref>), the samples possessing higher RL efficiencies show apparent enhanced direct Mn<sup>2+</sup> (<sup>6</sup>A<sub>1</sub>(6 S)→<sup>4</sup>T<sub>2</sub>(4D)) excitation efficiency, which accords well with the direct excited PL results (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, ex = 385 nm)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Therefore, the RL of doped samples may be connected with the direct excitation of Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions. The luminescent properties through the direct excitation based on the <sup>6</sup>A<sub>1</sub>(6 S) → <sup>4</sup>T<sub>1</sub>(4 G) transition (485 nm) show similar behaviors to that of exciting at 385 nm but less significant (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13b</xref>).</p><p id="Par15">We make an assumption of the PL and RL mechanism as described in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>. It has been reported that the intrinsic blue PL derives from the lattice distortion induced STE (I). Light induced excitation of electron results in the change of 3<italic>d</italic><sup><italic>10</italic></sup> to 3<italic>d</italic><sup><italic>9</italic></sup> and the variation of electronic cloud density leads to lattice distortion. This distortion is the origin of STE state and contributes to bright blue emission. After the introduction of Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions, the lifetime of intrinsic PL decreases along with the increased doping concentration before becoming saturated (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). The Mn<sup>2+</sup> related yellow emission possesses two components, indicating two possible exciton ET from STE (II) and CBM (III) levels, as described in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> left. In fact, these two recombination processes are in a competitive relation. At low doping concentration, STE related ET dominates and resulted fast decay (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14</xref>c and Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). With the increase of Mn<sup>2+</sup> concentration, direct ET from CBM gradually dominates, which possess longer PL decay time.</p><p id="Par16">In contrast to light excitation of band-edge electrons, X-ray excited electrons from core band to much higher energy levels (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> right). These electrons then undergo procedures of inelastic electron-electron scattering and thermalization, which finally relax to CBM for recombination. However, since the Cu 3<italic>d</italic> electrons is not excited directly, lattice distortion is relatively weak compared to that resulted from UV light excitation of Cu 3<italic>d</italic> electrons. Then, the formation of STE under the excitation of X-ray is very weak, leading to faint blue RL intensity. As a result, majority of the electrons on CBM will transfer to Mn<sup>2+</sup> levels (III) directly and contribute to strong yellow RL. This might be the main reason for the greatly reduced blue part under the excitation of X-ray compared to the PL curves.</p><p id="Par17">In addition to ET, direct excitation of Mn<sup>2+</sup> may play a more important role in the RL behavior. First, doped ions can be directly excited through impact excitation (II) provided its concentration is large enough, and when this process occurs, it is strongly dominant. Since the Mn<sup>2+</sup> doping concentration here is much higher than that of conventional rare earth elements, this mechanism may also make contributions. As we can see, though ET induced yellow emission in 450 °C-6 h sample is the strongest (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12a</xref>), its direct excited emission shows the weakest intensity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Besides, the RL curves show the same dependence on reaction parameters with the direct excited PL spectra though they possess semblable PL QY under the excitation of 310 nm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Namely, the RL mechanism is strongly concerned to the direct excitation of Mn<sup>2+</sup>. However, it is still difficult now to give out the direct evidence of impact excitation and more investigations are needed. The PL QY of samples here are not high enough, implying the existence of enormous nonradiative recombination centers. There is still a large room for future optimization and we believe higher LY values can be achieved with in-depth investigations.</p><p id="Par18">Efficient scintillation properties and robust stability. We conducted detailed investigations to evaluate the RL performance of Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub>:Mn powders. Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub>:Mn possesses a high X-ray absorption coefficient comparable to that of CsI, endowing this material with a strong basis for high LY (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">15</xref>). To accurately measure the RL, equal quality of samples was added in a tailored holder, which was then put into an integrated sphere with a fixed distance to the X-ray source (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). The RL spectra were recorded by a fiber-coupled spectrometer. The LY was measured with a reference strategy and a CsI:Tl single crystal was chosen as the reference. After the optimization of reaction parameters, such as reaction temperature (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">16</xref>), precursor ratio (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">17</xref>), and reaction time (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">18</xref>), the highest RL intensity was achieved at a reaction temperature of 370 °C for 24 h. The optimal reaction temperatures for Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub> and Mn15% are related to their melting points, and the low melting point less than 400 °C can potentially reduce production costs when large area and thick films are fabricated (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">19</xref>). Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref> shows the RL intensity comparison of CsI:Tl single crystal and optimized Mn15%.

Mn15% was chosen as the typical sample for the following studies due to its strongest yellow emission. Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref> comparatively shows the temperature-dependent RL intensity of Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub> and Mn15% in a very broad temperature range from 77 to 433 K. We can see that 71% of the RL intensity can be maintained for Mn15% while the undoped one exhibits a significant decrease of 92.5% (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">20</xref>). The ultra-stability of Mn<sup>2+</sup> doped scintillators in such a broad temperature variation enables them to adapt to most of the extreme environments, indicating the promising application in outer planets where sudden and severe temperature variation takes place often. In order to demonstrate the sustainable temperature-stability of Mn15%, the integrated RL intensities with five heating and cooling cycles in the range from 303 to 433 K were recorded as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref> without any protection, in which the RL intensity was measured at least 30 min later after the temperature reached the setpoint. For the first three cycles, the intensity remained unchanged. Though further temperature-treating induced RL intensity deterioration resulted from oxidation and phase decomposition, the intensity evolution trends kept the same. The possible deterioration mechanism can be found in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">21</xref>. All of these results imply the good stability against thermo and ensure good performance of subsequent NBs. The good RL stability is consistent with the PL properties (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">22</xref>).</p><p id="Par20">Radiation damage is another inevitable issue that all materials have to suffer. To evaluate the radiation stability, we first measured the RL intensity of Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub> under continuous X-ray irradiation (voltage, 50 kV, current, 80 μA, dose rate, ~1 mGy s<sup>−1</sup>). Interestingly, despite the low RL intensity, Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub> showed a persistent scintillation intensity even at 333 K with a total irradiation dose of ~29 Gy (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">23</xref>), indicating the robust matrix for dopant related emissions. However, as shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">24</xref>, after storage under the ambient condition, the RL exhibited an apparent degradation due to the influence of moisture. The as-prepared powder (Mn 15%) changed from white to light yellow and a phenomenon of agglomeration was observed. When the powder was dispersed in n-butanol, the supernatant became yellow (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">25</xref>), which was similar to the phenomenon of I<sub>2</sub> solids dissolved in n-butanol. It should be noted doping usually cannot modify the chemical property greatly. Therefore, the changed hygroscopy may not result from the doping effect. Considering the hygroscopy of MnCl<sub>2</sub> used in the reaction and the existence of unreacted trace-precursor owing to the solid reaction method, we tried purifying the as-prepared powder with n-butanol. Fortunately, MnCl<sub>2</sub> exhibits high solubility in n-butanol and this solvent does not destruct the scintillator (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">25</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">26</xref>). Even after a storage for 2 months without protection, the powder maintained a white color. No impurity formed and the powder is fine. The crystal structure and RL property almost did not change (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">26</xref>) after being irradiated and storage. This makes it possible to further measure the stability of this new scintillator.</p><p id="Par21">More than 95% of the initial RL intensity remained for Mn15% after an accumulated irradiation dose of ~2590 Gy at room temperature (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). Since CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> scintillator has been extensively studied recently, it was chosen as a reference to determine the stability of Mn15% in the present work. Compared to Mn15%, lead halide perovskite NCs exhibited poor stability under such a high dose rate, which showed a decrease of ~25% just after being irradiated with an accumulated irradiation dose of 6.9 Gy. The stability behaviors of CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> NCs observed here are quite different from the early reports, which can be assigned to the high irradiation dose rate used in this work. It is two orders of magnitude higher than that in the previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Additionally, 86.1% of the initial intensities were reserved when the samples were irradiated by X-ray with the same dose rate at 333 K (total dose of ~2590 Gy). Such robust thermal stability for lead-free halides has never been reported as far as we know. Future investigations should include the protection of these scintillators from the attack of moisture. Fortunately, the sealing technology nowadays is good enough to prevent the invasion of moisture.</p><p id="Par22">Characterization of nuclear battery. At this point, we have achieved a highly efficient scintillator with good stability against irradiation and high temperature.

When the Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub>:Mn film covered on the device, both the open circuit voltage and short circuit current increased under the same X-ray dose rate. Especially, the short circuit current increased greatly (an increase of 300%), indicating the vast generation of electrons with the assistance of the scintillator layer. Theoretically, the direct type device should exhibit higher efficiency compared to indirect devices due to additional RL step. However, thin film PVDs usually cannot absorb X-ray completely and increasing film thickness is inadvisable due to the limitation of carrier diffusion length and lifetime. Also, it is reported that taking full advantage of the direct and indirect conversion approaches can achieve better device performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Therefore, we should make a balance between scintillator film thickness and X-ray absorption. With the increase of scintillator film thickness, the output power showed a first rising and then decline trend. Obviously, both direct and indirect conversion procedures exist in our device and the optimized output power can reach 0.091 μW, a significant increase of 237% compared to the NB without scintillator. This improvement is much greater than that using CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> NCs as the scintillator layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.

Mn dopant not only introduces a new emitting center to reduce nonradiative recombination, but also overcomes the temperature quenching effect of intrinsic material. The highly direct excitation efficiency of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, combined with STE and the ET, contribute to a high LY of ~67,000 ph MeV<sup>−1</sup> at 564 nm, which is the highest value at such a long wavelength based on low-cost elements. Stable matrix and thermal activation of excitons lead to robust thermal stability and irradiation hardness that 71% or more than 95% of the initial RL intensity can be maintained in an ultra-broad temperature range of 77–433 K or after a total irradiation dose of ~2590 Gy, respectively.

The wave functions are constructed using a projected augmented wave approach with plane wave cutoff energy of 500 eV. The convergence threshold was set as 10<sup>−4</sup> eV in energy and 10<sup>−3</sup> eV/Å in force. The Brillouin zone integration is sampled using a set of 3 × 3 × 3 Monkhorst-Pack k-points.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was financially supported by NSFC (61874054, 51902160, and 61725402), Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST (2018QNRC001), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (BK20180489, BK20190475), and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (30918011208).</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>X.L. and H.Z. conceived and designed the experiments.
