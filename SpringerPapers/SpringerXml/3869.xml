However, challenges in their chemical analysis, sometimes at trace levels, and understanding their roles to elucidate surface structure–activity relationships in optical (solar cells) or (photo)catalytic performance and their removal are significant issues that remain to be solved. Here, we show a detailed analysis of TiO<sub>2</sub> facets promoted with surface species (OH, O, SO<sub>4</sub>, F) with and without post-treatments by <sup>31</sup>P adsorbate nuclear magnetic resonance, supported by a range of other characterization tools. We demonstrate that quantitative evaluations of the electronic and structural effects imposed by these surface additives and their removal mechanisms can be obtained, which may lead to the rational control of active TiO<sub>2</sub> (001) and (101) facets for a range of applications.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary" specific-use="web-only"><p id="Par2">Metal oxide nanocrystals can be grown with different facets exposed to give variations in reactivity, but the chemical state of these surfaces is not clear.

In particular, for nano-sized particles, the domination of these surface features has been demonstrated to lead to the particles exhibiting different physical/chemical properties compared with the bulk. Given that each facet possesses a distinctive intrinsic energy, it is understandable that both the concentration and chemical state of the surface features differ from facet to facet. Taking ZnO nanocrystallite as an example, the surface V<sub>o</sub> were shown to be present on the oxygen-terminated (002) facet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, and were recently quantified by Peng et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> Also, the chemical properties of surface zinc ions have been shown to be different on (100) and (002) facets, indicating the Lewis acidity of ZnO NP can be modulated by the morphology control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. These considerations have provided additional variables in tailoring the morphology of nanoparticles (NPs) with preferentially exposed facets during the past decades. Unfortunately, facets with high reactivity are unstable and tend to diminish rapidly to minimize surface energy during the crystal growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Accordingly, a structure-directing species (SDS) or surfactant is usually employed in the shape control of NPs, which renders them in metastable and high-energy forms. The SDS can subtly modify the chemical state of the surface features (especially metal cations) and provide a kinetic growth control for the formation of shaped NPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. As the growth rate of a crystal facet depends on the surface energy, different morphologies of NP could thus be prepared by using various SDS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The tailoring of anatase TiO<sub>2</sub> crystals with the termination of specific facets has received great interest for many years. However, most synthetic TiO<sub>2</sub> crystals are covered with thermodynamically more stable (101) facets rather than the reactive (001) facets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The breakthrough in controlling the synthesis of crystals with a high percentage of reactive high-energy (001) sites was not made until 2008<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. According to that literature, the relative stability of these two facets can be reversed using a small quantity of fluorine on the (001) surface during the particle synthesis. Since then, the controlled synthesis of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals with preferentially exposed (001) facets has been shown to display promising properties in photocatalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, methanol conversion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> and lithium batteries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, etc. Generally the removal of SDS, with fluorine in this case, after the controlled nanoparticle synthesis is required to avoid interference with the desired surface properties. It can be removed by a simple post-treatment step such as calcination at 600 °C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> or ion exchange with aqueous NaOH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> before the application to obtain a so-called ‘clean surface’. However, by adopting different removal methods, diverse results have been obtained in the literature in various applications (e.g., photocatalysis cases summarized in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), which have led to different interpretations and frequent disagreements among researchers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. For example, the NaOH-treated (001) facet (i.e., Na-(001)) showed higher activity in the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange dye than the F-capped (001) facet (i.e., F-(001))<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, while a reverse result was obtained for the same reaction by another research group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Also, both NaOH and calcination treatments were reported to increase the facet activity of (101) in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, while the NaOH treatment was concluded to lower the facet activity of (001) in this reaction by others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. These different observations can arise from the surface reconstruction of the unstable (001) surface upon its removal during calcination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> or traces of residual SDS that remain on the surface affecting the chemical state of exposed titanium (vide infra). So far, no clear rationalization or guidance for the selection of appropriate post-treatment methods has been achieved. In addition, the SDS modification on the TiO<sub>2</sub> surface has been demonstrated to efficiently modulate the surface Ti chemical state. For example, the post-modification of PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>/SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> on the TiO<sub>2</sub> surface can provide extra Brønsted acid sites and also increase Lewis acidity for enhanced sugar conversion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>/photocatalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.

Herein, using anatase TiO<sub>2</sub> samples of different morphologies, we successfully monitor the subtle changes of the Ti chemical state induced by a small quantity of surface adsorbates (i.e., fluorine, sulfate, OH) on various facets using <sup>31</sup>P magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in combination with trimethylphosphine (TMP) as a surface probe. This is based on the fact that the nucleophilic probe TMP molecule can form a stable adduct with the exposed Ti cation (Lewis acid (LA)) of the TiO<sub>2</sub> surface, and the formation of a surface TMP-Ti complex can be realized via coordination of the P atom to the surface Ti cation centre. According to <sup>31</sup>P chemical shift (δ<sup>31</sup>P) of the corresponding surface TMP-Ti complexes, it is demonstrated the surface Ti cations on various facets with different Lewis acidities, surface energies and steric arrangements can be carefully mapped, differentiated and quantitatively analysed. It is shown that some typical post-treatments (i.e., calcination or NaOH wash) to remove the fluorine (as SDS) can also lead to different surface Ti chemical states. According to our catalytic testing, extra caution must be exercised for even trivial surface treatments as a huge difference in activity can be obtained. This technique (i.e., using TMP as a surface probe) is thus demonstrated as a powerful tool in combination with conventional surface techniques adopted for TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Raman spectroscopy to offer comprehensive information of surface features on various functionalized facets to guide surface treatments/modifications of TiO<sub>2</sub> NP for various applications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals and their surface chemical states</title><p id="Par6">Samples prepared with 0, 2 and 6 mL of 50 wt% concentration of hydrogen fluoride (HF) reveal different morphologies and are labelled as powder (PD) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), F-(101) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>) and F-(001) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). All samples exhibited lattice fringes with d-spacings around 0.47 and 0.35 nm, in accordance with the [101] and [002] crystallographic planar directions of anatase TiO<sub>2</sub>, respectively. According to Wulff construction, the proportion of exposed (101) and (001) facets in as-prepared samples can be calculated (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). The powder sample was characterized with ~90% (101) facet, matching well with the thermodynamically stable (101) facet in anatase TiO<sub>2</sub> predicted by Wulff construction (~94%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.

According to the literature, when the concentration of HF is increased, it can increase the particle face length due to preferential adsorption of F to slow down its growth on this facet and hence the percentage of exposed (001) facet increases (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). Indeed, when 2 mL HF was used in our case, an average face length of ca. 6.6 ± 1.0 nm was achieved (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2b</xref>) with a substantially higher proportion of (001) facet (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). By using 6 mL HF, the elongated face length of ca. 41.0 ± 10.5 nm with a thickness of ca. 6.2 ± 0.9 nm nanosheet-like F-(001) particles were obtained (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2c</xref>).

In general, the chemical shift of <sup>31</sup>P (δ<sup>31</sup>P) in a range of −2 to −5 p.p.m. has been well attributed to the formation of a TMPH<sup>+</sup> ionic complex formed when a TMP molecule is protonated (Brønsted acid site), while the δ<sup>31</sup>P of adsorbed TMP spans over a wide range (−20 to −58 p.p.m.) when interacting with surface acidic site (LA site) with various Lewis acidity (the formation of TMP-LA) (Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.

Notice that similar results in chemical shift values have been shown by Deng and co-workers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> over their titanium oxide. The major peak at −36 p.p.m. and the shoulder at −29 p.p.m. with the integrated area ratios of 84.8 and 15.2% respectively can be attributed to the interaction between TMP and surface five-coordinate Lewis acids: Ti<sup>4+</sup>on the (101) facet as Ti<sub>5C</sub>(101) and Ti<sup>4+</sup> on (001) as Ti<sub>5C</sub>(001), respectively.

What is the nature of the peak with a chemical shift of −42.5 ± 1 p.p.m., which was not seen over the PD sample? Why did the samples with HF treatment (i.e., F-(101) and F-(001)) show both Brønsted acid and Lewis acid signals but the as-prepared powder sample (PD) possessed mainly Lewis acid signal?</p><p id="Par11">XPS, a technique to monitor element(s) on material surface, was used to analyse the surface compositions of these samples. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a–c</xref>, the surface F on powder, F-(101) and F-(001) samples can be monitored by XPS as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. It is noted that F is apparently retained on the facets (101) and (001) when the samples were prepared with F (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b, c</xref>) but the powder sample without previous exposure to F shows the total absence of F<sub>1S</sub> signal (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Despite the fact that XPS has been regarded as a surface-sensitive technique to atomic chemical states, it fails to give any chemical shift of Ti<sub>2P</sub> in the presence of fluorine (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d–f</xref>). It is clear that the long electrons escape depth, greater than the outermost atomic layer (few atoms depth) of the sample, and this renders XPS unsuitable for surface studies in this context (detection limit ~0.1% atom) and the monitoring of core electrons makes the binding energy of Ti also less sensitive to electronic effects from neighbouring F element(s). Auger electron spectroscopy is known to provide higher spatial resolution and the energy of ejected Auger electrons is more sensitive to the chemical environment compared to the core-level signals in XPS. However, as shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>, no peak shift was also observed for five Ti LMM Auger signals (marked by <italic>dashed blue line</italic>). This indicates the change of chemical state of the outermost Ti atom is still averaged out during the collection of Auger electrons from the electron escape depth. In contrast, the <sup>31</sup>P NMR is much more surface sensitive to the electronic change imposed by this SDS.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>XPS study of TiO<sub>2</sub> samples.

Note that a surface-bound ligand molecule generates an electric dipole, while this intrinsic ligand dipole depends on its chemical structure and binding mode. For Lewis-basic ligands, the interfacial dipole points from the ligand toward the metal (L<sup><italic>δ</italic>–</sup>→M<sup><italic>δ</italic>+</sup>) and the largest ligand-induced downward shift of electronic energy levels is observed for halide ion ligands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. This electronic effect can be supported by our DFT calculation on a fluorinated (001) model. As shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>, the calculated adsorption energy between TMP and Ti<sub>5C</sub> on the clean (001) facet (−1.20 eV, Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) is greatly increased to −1.76 eV when the surrounding Ti<sub>5C</sub> is fluorinated. According to the correlation plot between experimental δ<sup>31</sup>P and calculated adsorption energy in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>, this can explain the downfield shift of F-(001) observed within experimental error. It is thought that a similar downfield shift for the F-(101) facet occurs upon the fluorination of surface Ti<sub>5C</sub> at close proximity. The corresponding atomic ratios (Ti, O and F) of TiO<sub>2</sub> samples by XPS are summarized in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>. The apparent lower Ti:O values in the presence of F clearly suggest the formation of V<sub>o</sub> due to the strong electronic withdrawing effect of the surface fluorine groups. EPR (Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref> and Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>) and Raman (Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>) could also be used to indicate the electronic and structural changes of facets imposed by this surface impurity. Thus, such unstable (001) facets with F-containing surface oxygen vacancies could be hydrolysed (introduction of the OH functional group) during the treatment to account for the −42.5 ± 1 p.p.m. peak observed (see later experiments). In addition, the evolution of Brønsted acidity over the fluorine-contaminated facets can be rationalized by the surface hydrogen bonding stabilization of protons by the fluorine. As a result from this study, one has to be very careful about the detainment of surface additive on a particular facet which can subtly affect its electronic, structural and geometric properties (acidity), and hence the evaluation of facet-dependent properties. Thus, post treatment to remove SDS before the study of facet-dependent properties is crucially important.</p><p id="Par13">As stated, a NaOH wash<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and calcination treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> of F-treated samples at elevated temperature are the two commonly used methods in literature to remove surface F after the controlling of TiO<sub>2</sub> particle morphology. The apparent remaining F signal on Na-(001) sample (cf. Cal-(001)) after NaOH (0.1 M) treatment shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> clearly indicates that the F removal was not complete presumably due to the higher F affinity for this energetic surface. In contrast, there is no F found in all calcined samples by the XPS (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). However, this does not necessary suggest that calcination is a good method since high energetic facets may easily reconstruct to more stable surface at high temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Moreover, as evidenced by TEM images (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), calcination treatment causes severe particle aggregation for all three as-prepared PD, F-(101) and F-(001) while NaOH treatment does not lead to any observable aggregation and change in morphology. This result can be further supported by their corresponding XRD patterns (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>).

In order to reduce the influence of NaOH on the measured chemical shift values, the samples after the NaOH treatment were repeatedly washed with deionized (DI) water. Notice that no significant residual NaOH was retained on these surfaces (Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>). For samples prepared without HF (i.e., PD) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>), the NaOH treatment after rinsing with DI water clearly reduces the Lewis acidity of both Ti<sub>5C</sub>(001) and Ti<sub>5C</sub>(101) as δ<sup>31</sup>P shifts from −29 p.p.m. to −35 ± 1 p.p.m. for Ti<sub>5C</sub>(001) and from −36 p.p.m. to −41 ± 1 p.p.m. for Ti<sub>5C</sub>(101), respectively, for the surface mono-hydroxylation (cf. as-prepared PD, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).

However, for F-treated samples (i.e., F-(101) or F-(001)), a different Lewis acid distribution is obtained after the same treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b, c</xref>). The conversion of residual F-Ti to HO-Ti on high energetic facets, particularly on (001), by OH- exchange in the NaOH wash can give a very different electron density of Ti<sub>5C</sub> atoms compared to surface Ti without the F. The surface chemical functionalization by OH shifts the δ<sup>31</sup>P of TMP-adsorbed F-Ti<sub>5C</sub>(001)/F-Ti<sub>5C</sub>(101) from −22.5 ± 1/−31 ± 1 p.p.m. (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d, f</xref>) to −28 ± 1/−36.5 ± 1 p.p.m. (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b, c</xref>). In addition, the typical Brønsted acid signals (the formation of TMPH<sup>+</sup>) between −2 and −5 p.p.m. clearly indicate that there is a residue F left on both Na-(101) and Na-(001) sample surfaces (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b, c</xref>). On the other hand, the total F-depleted surfaces of −35 ± 1 p.p.m. for Ti<sub>5C</sub>(001) and −41 ± 1 p.p.m. for Ti<sub>5C</sub>(101) are expected to re-emerge since NaOH is capable of removing some surface F. The former peak (−35 p.p.m.) is unfortunately mixed with the OH-shifted F-Ti<sub>5C</sub>(001) peak (−36.5 p.p.m.) but the prominent at −41 ± 1 p.p.m. can be attributed to the reformation of Ti<sub>5C</sub>(101) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>) during its surface hydrolysis by the NaOH treatment.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>NMR results of NaOH-washed TiO<sub>2</sub> samples and their following sulfation treatment.

According to Yang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, surface Ti-F groups are totally hydrolysed during calcination in humid air at high temperature (endothermic reaction) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref>). In this case, the exposed surfaces of sheet-like anatase TiO<sub>2</sub> are also mainly covered by -OH groups.

According to our DFT calculation (i.e., −50 p.p.m., Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), this is due to the adsorption of TMP on Ti<sub>5C</sub> on (1 × 4) the reconstructed (001) facet (Ti<sub>5C</sub>RC-(001)). Thus, this peak can be used as a diagnostic peak to indicate reconstruction/aggregation induced by calcination. However, for F-(001), the same chemical shifts for Ti<sub>5C</sub>(001)/Ti<sub>5C</sub>(101) (i.e., −35 ± 1/−41 ± 1 p.p.m.) indicative of the mono-hydroxylation of the surfaces with no residual F can be obtained by calcination (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14b</xref>) but not for the NaOH wash at room temperature, where retention of F on Ti<sub>5C</sub>(001)/F-Ti<sub>5C</sub>(101) is evident (−28 ± 1/−36.5 ± 1 p.p.m., see Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>).

The sulfation of TiO<sub>2</sub> facets was therefore investigated after the calcination or NaOH wash with a prolonged period of time to ensure no F remained on the surfaces.

As calcination treatment causes severe aggregation and unavoidable facet reconstruction, we herein focus on the sulfation of NaOH-washed samples. For F-(101) and F-(001) samples, Brønsted acid (Ti-O(H)-Ti) sites removed by NaOH wash can clearly be reintroduced by a sulfation step with a large and distinctive peak around −4 p.p.m. (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e, f</xref>). It is interesting to note that two new and characteristic strong Lewis acid peaks due to TMP adsorption on sulfated surfaces, namely −25.5 ± 1 and −34 ± 1 p.p.m., are introduced. It is postulated these two new Lewis acid sites are arisen from the Ti<sup>4+</sup> modified directly by SO<sub>4</sub> at high surface coverage during the extensive sulfation but further verifications are required. Their strengths (peak shifts) are sensitive to the particular facets and their relative concentrations (peak areas) also depend on the relative proportions of (101) and (001) in the samples. For instance, S-Na-(101) with the preferentially exposed (101) facet shows a stronger signal at −34 ± 1 p.p.m. (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>), while for S-Na-(001) with the preferentially exposed (001) facet gives a more dominant signal at −25.5 ± 1 p.p.m. (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>). For the PD samples after the extensive hydrolysis during treatments, surface multi-hydroxylation is expected to give a peak at −50 ± 1 p.p.m., as well as the two Lewis acid peaks of −25.5 ± 1and −34 ± 1 p.p.m. (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Qualitative and quantitative analysis</title><p id="Par18">Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> summarize qualitative (chemical shift) and quantitative (peak area) information of deconvoluted peaks in TMP-adsorbed TiO<sub>2</sub><sup>31</sup>P MAS NMR spectra under various treatments. First, Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref> shows that the adsorption of TMP on Lewis acid centres of the higher energy (001) facet gives lower chemical shift value (−29 ± 1 p.p.m.) than that of the more stable (101) facet (−36 ± 1 p.p.m.) in our samples. F-treatment of the (001) and (101) facets can clearly enhance the Lewis acidity, shifting them to −22.5 ± 1 and −31 ± 1 p.p.m., respectively. This surface group with the highest electron withdrawing ability can also generate oxygen vacancies, and hence activating the surfaces substantially. However, it is clear from our study that calcination in humid air at elevated temperature can indeed remove the surface F groups by introducing hydroxylation to the surfaces. Replacing F, with a strong withdrawing propensity, by much weaker surface OH group will render the upshifts to −35 ± 1 p.p.m. for the (001) facet and −41 ± 1 p.p.m. for the (101) facet due to mono-hydroxylation as mentioned previously (multi-hydroxylation can further upshift the δ<sup>31</sup>P of the adsorbed TMP). However, the high coverage of OH particularly on (001) facet at elevated temperature during calcination can concomitantly lead to severe aggregation. For a prolonged period of time, this can lead to stepwise reconstruction of (1 × 1) (001) facets to the more stable reconstructed (1 × 4) structure (at −50 p.p.m.). On the other hand, the replacement of surface F with OH using a NaOH wash at room temperature can also achieve the F removal but retain the integrity of desired facets and prevent significant aggregation and reconstruction, giving the same shift values of −35 ± 1 p.p.m. for the (001) facet and −41 ± 1 p.p.m. for the (101) facet. However, our TMP-adsorption technique supported by other characterizations (XPS, EPR, Raman) show clearly that a NaOH wash at different times and concentrations at room temperature may not be sufficient to remove all surface F from the TiO<sub>2</sub>. If F is retained together with the mono-hydroxylated OH, it can give two new δ<sup>31</sup>P values (different Lewis acid strengths) of TMP-adsorbed F-Ti<sub>5c</sub>(001)/F-Ti<sub>5c</sub>(101) of −28 ± 1/−36.5 ± 1 p.p.m. (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). In addition, two strong Brønsted acid strengths (the formation of TMPH<sup>+</sup>) at −2.9 and −2.4 p.p.m. (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b, c</xref>) are also achieved due to the proton stabilization by residual F left on both Na-(101) and Na-(001) sample surfaces. Upon extended sulfation after the samples are calcined (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14c, d</xref>) or NaOH (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e, f</xref>) washed to replace all F with SO<sub>4</sub>, weaker Brønsted acid strengths between −3.7 and −4.7 p.p.m. with protons influenced by neighbour SO<sub>4</sub> are obtained. In terms of Lewis acid alteration, −25.5 ± 1 p.p.m. from sulfation of (001) and −34 ± 1 p.p.m. of (101) facets can be tuned. Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref> shows the highly sensitive δ<sup>31</sup>P value towards increasing electron withdrawing ability to the surface Ti<sup>4+</sup> from OH&lt;-O-&lt;SO<sub>4</sub>&lt;F which can provide fine-tuning of Lewis acid and Brønsted acid sites on TiO<sub>2</sub> facets by these surface additives. Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref> summarizes the anticipated molecular interactions between TMP and surface features on TiO<sub>2</sub> with various treatments/modifications. In addition, the TMP-assisted NMR technique displays quantitative assessments on the surface speciation (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The total adsorbed TMP over different samples also shows strong correlations with the total BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) surface areas of the samples (BET of S-Na-PD = 107.0 m<sup>2</sup>/g, S-Na-(101) = 77.3 m<sup>2</sup>/g and S-Na-(001) = 67.4 m<sup>2</sup>/g (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>), which is proportional to their total TMP/g (both Brønsted acid and Lewis acid from Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) uptakes of 512.6, 286.7 and 261.4 μmol/g, respectively). Typically, this technique shows a better surface sensitivity; for example, 5.8 μmol/g Brønsted acid stabilized by F on Na-(101) is detectable by the NMR (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) but no corresponding F signal is observed by XPS (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>).

Pioneered by Han et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> and Yang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, using sheet-like TiO<sub>2</sub> with a higher percentage of reactive (001) facets was proven to exhibit higher photocatalytic activity in aqueous medium (cf., P25). Both of the above reports also showed that the photocatalytic efficiency of the TiO<sub>2</sub> nanosheets can be further improved after removing surface fluorine either by calcination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> or NaOH wash<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, the changes in the quantity and quality of active sites on this (001) facet upon the above treatments were still unable to offer detailed analysis and assessment due to the lack of appropriate characterization techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. To illustrate the importance of acquiring the delicate surface electronic and structural changes imposed by a particular facet and surface chemical modifier, the influence of various treatments to TiO<sub>2</sub> surface features were monitored (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The photocatalytic decomposition rate of malachite green (MG) upon F-(001), Cal-(001) and Na-(001) in static solution was therefore studied to reassess the surface structure–photocatalytic activity relationships<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Corresponding results are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>. For samples with the preferential exposure of (001) facet, the NaOH-washed F-(001) sample (i.e., Na-(001)) shows the highest photo-decomposition efficiency while the sample without any treatment (i.e., F-(001)) shows the lowest efficiency (activity: Na-(001)&gt;Cal-(001)&gt;F-(001)). This result indicates that the key factors are neither crystallinity nor surface area. This is because F-(001) possesses similar crystallinity (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>)/surface area (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>) to Na-(001) and has a higher surface area than Cal-(001) but shows the lowest activity. The role of surface defect such as V<sub>o</sub> is also proved to be minor as both XPS Ti to O ratio (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>) and quantitative EPR signal at g~2.0 (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>) suggest the V<sub>o</sub> concentration is in a reverse order: F-(001)&gt;Cal-(001)&gt;Na-(001). There is also no significant change in their measured bandgap values (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">15</xref>), which is commonly reported to be one of the important factors in photocatalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. According to our NMR results, the possibility of Brønsted acid playing a key role is also ruled out as the Cal-(001) with no detectable Brønsted acid exhibits a higher percentage of MG degradation rate than F-(001), which has the highest Brønsted acid concentration in solution. The acid strength of Lewis acid also does not seem to play the key role in this reaction either as F-(001) with the strongest Lewis acid site (at ~−22 p.p.m., Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>) exhibits the lowest activity. In this case, the total Lewis acid concentration (465.8 μmol/g of Na-(001)&gt;145 μmol/g of Cal-(001)&gt;118.3 μmol/g of F-(001)) appears to be the primary cause for this activity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>) as it is proportional to the rate and yield of photodecomposition of the MG molecules. As the fluorine binds strongly to the surface Ti atom (blocking the Lewis acid site) on (001) facet, it is not surprising that its removal by NaOH wash in the Na-(001) sample with similar particle size (cf., F-(001)) has quadrupled the Lewis acid surface concentration. Even though severe aggregation has taken place over the calcined Cal-(001) sample, it still possesses a higher Lewis acid concentration than that of F-(001). A similar conclusion can also be drawn for samples with preferentially exposed (101) facets (i.e., PD, see Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">16</xref> also for commercial P25). This indicates that the surface feature and surface area are the key factors for the observed difference in the decomposition rates. This result can be supported by the observation of our previous study which found that the small degree of adsorption of dye molecules due to limited Lewis acid sites was the rate-determining step for photocatalytic reaction in the Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> case in static solution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. However, the photocatalytic reaction carried out in the flowing air seems to depend on Lewis acid strength more than the total Lewis acid concentration. Xiang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> reported that F-TiO<sub>2</sub> gives better activity than treated TiO<sub>2</sub> (i.e., Cal-TiO<sub>2</sub> and Na-TiO<sub>2</sub>) for the photocatalytic degradation of acetone in flowing air. They suggested the strong electron withdrawing ability of the surface Ti–F groups reduces the recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes and enhances the photocatalytic activity. However, according to our result, we believe the adsorption dynamic of acetone in flowing air is very different from that of dye in static water and can only be efficiently adsorbed from the gas phase by the stronger Lewis acid site of F-TiO<sub>2</sub> (e.g., −22 p.p.m., Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>) before the photodecomposition. Thus, the stronger nature of Lewis acid site of F-TiO<sub>2</sub> renders higher activity than that of the treated TiO<sub>2</sub> (i.e., Cal-TiO<sub>2</sub> and Na-TiO<sub>2</sub>) in the gas phase degradation of acetone in air.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>TiO<sub>2</sub> catalytic activity and the distribution of corresponding active sites.

However, the yield is almost tripled when using corresponding sulfation samples in the order of S-Na-(001) (73.87 wt.%)&gt;S-Na-(101) (65.16 wt.%)&gt;S-Na-PD (59.68 wt.%) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7e</xref>). This huge increase in yield for all the three samples could be easily mistakenly attributed to the introduction of weak Brønsted acid by sulfate modification at the expense of Lewis acid sites (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c, e</xref>). However, S-Na-PD with the highest total concentrations in both Brønsted acid and Lewis acid shows the lowest yield among the three samples and similar Brønsted acid strength is actually obtained for all the three samples. Thus, Brønsted acid does not seem to be the main site for this catalysed reaction. Notice that the sulfate modification of S-Na-PD, S-Na-(101) and S-Na-(001) also concomitantly introduces a new Lewis acid site of much greater strength than unmodified samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7f</xref>). The strength of this newly generated Lewis acid site at ~−25 p.p.m. (Ti<sup>4+</sup> modified directly by the neighbours SO<sub>4</sub> and OH, see Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>) is found to be comparable to sulfated/BF<sub>3</sub>-modified metal oxides (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>/ZrO<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, BF<sub>3</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>) which is characteristic of super Lewis acidity.

Traditional surface tools such as XPS, EPR and Raman spectroscopy have been widely employed to bridge facet-controlled NPs and their corresponding facet-dependent performances.

Moreover, various processing steps and post-treatment techniques (e.g., NaOH/calcination treatment here) used during the preparation of NPs from group to group further complicate surface environments and always lead to different interpretations and disagreements among researchers. Herein, qualitative and quantitative information on both the chemical state and distribution of surface cations among facets promoted with various groups have been well resolved by the use of an NMR-active probe (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>).

The peak position was referenced to C1s peak of the carbon tape at 285.00 eV. The EPR spectra were obtained by X-band CW EPR spectrometer (Bruker EMX) and the signal intensity vs. electron spin number was obtained from the double integral of the spectrum.
