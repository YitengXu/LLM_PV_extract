as geological samples from Earth record the natural history of our planet, astromaterials hold the natural history of our solar system and beyond. Astromaterials acquisition and curation practices have direct consequences on the contamination levels of astromaterials and hence the types of questions that can be answered about our solar system and the degree of precision that can be expected of those answers. Advanced curation was developed as a cross-disciplinary field to improve curation and acquisition practices in existing astromaterials collections and for future sample return activities, including meteorite and cosmic dust samples that are collected on Earth. These goals are accomplished through research and development of new innovative technologies and techniques for sample collection, handling, characterization, analysis, and curation of astromaterials. In this contribution, we discuss five broad topics in advanced curation that are critical to improving sample acquisition and curation practices, including (1) best practices for monitoring and testing of curation infrastructure for inorganic, organic, and biological contamination; (2) requirements for storage, processing, and sample handling capabilities for future sample return missions, along with recent progress in these areas; (3) advancements and improvements in astromaterials acquisition capabilities on Earth (i.e., the collection of meteorites and cosmic dust); (4) the importance of contamination knowledge strategies for maximizing the science returns of sample-return missions; and (5) best practices and emerging capabilities for the basic characterization and preliminary examination of astromaterials. The primary result of advanced curation research is to both reduce and quantify contamination of astromaterials and preserve the scientific integrity of all samples from mission inception to secure delivery of samples to Earth-based laboratories for in-depth scientific analysis. Advanced curation serves as an important science-enabling activity, and the collective lessons learned from previous spacecraft missions and the results of advanced curation research will work in tandem to feed forward into better spacecraft designs and enable more stringent requirements for future sample return missions and Earth-based sample acquisition.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NASA Science Mission Directorate</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id

Tachibana</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Human fascination with the night sky and with celestial objects that fall to the Earth from the sky is as old as our species, and use of these astromaterials as a natural resource occurred at least as early as the Bronze Age (Jambon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2017</xref>; McCoy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">2018</xref>; McCoy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2017</xref>). However, the initial curation of astromaterials as objects of scientific interest to understand our universe began more recently (Marvin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2006</xref>) and in earnest with the curation of meteorite samples in museums starting in the year 1748 at the Natural History Museum Vienna (Brandstätter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2006</xref>). Meteorites have remained objects of fascination by scientists and the public alike with the establishment of many meteorite collections across the world. Meteorite recovery and curation practices vary widely and are highly dependent on many factors, including the knowledge and resources of the finder and the financial and technical support available for the collection in which the sample is curated. The scientific importance of the sample can also be a determining factor, but this is predicated on the aforementioned factors. All meteorites, regardless of how they were handled from recovery to curation, have experienced uncontrolled entry and exposure to the terrestrial environment, including, at minimum, the terrestrial atmosphere and the ground. This exposure results in terrestrial contamination, the amount of which is typically dependent on the physicochemical properties of the meteorite, the conditions at the fall site, and the amount of exposure time to the terrestrial environment. Consideration of these factors can also be determining factors in how a meteorite sample is curated. An overview of meteorite collections, their contents, and curation practices is available in McCall et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2006</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">Until the 1960’s, delivery of all astromaterials to Earth were unplanned events that required reactionary responses for recovery and curation. However, with the initiation of the Apollo program, direct return of pristine astromaterials from another body became possible, and with it, established the need to design a facility to keep those samples in a pristine state for an indefinite period of time. Planning for the Lunar Receiving Laboratory (LRL) began in 1964, and the facility was completed in 1967 (Calaway et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2017</xref>; McLane et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">1967</xref>). As part of this planning, stringent protocols in the handling, storage, and processing of samples were developed. These protocols ensured that portions of the samples remained pristine or as close to an “as returned” state as possible in perpetuity to enable future scientific discoveries from the returned samples. The delivery of Apollo 11 samples to Earth occurred on July 24, 1969 at 12:50 EDT, four days after the first successful human landing on the Moon. This round-trip journey marked a transformative milestone in human history and as the first sample return mission, provided the initial fuel to drive the burgeoning field of planetary sample science.</p><p id="Par4">The planning process for curation prior to the return of the Apollo 11 samples set the precedent that curation involvement and planning begins at the inception of a sample return mission, and this founding principle has guided sample return missions subsequent to Apollo (e.g., Allen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2011</xref>; Yada et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR218">2014</xref>). There have been a total of 13 successful sample return missions, including six manned Apollo missions from NASA, three unmanned lunar sample return missions from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), the NASA Long Duration Exposure Facility that exposed various materials to the low-Earth orbit environment for approximately 6 years, the NASA Genesis mission that returned solar wind from the Earth-Sun Lagrange point 1 (L1), the NASA Stardust mission that returned particles embedded in aerogel from the coma of Comet Wild 2 and from interstellar space, and JAXA’s Hayabusa mission that returned material from the surface of asteroid Itokawa (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In addition, there are two sample return missions in flight, including JAXA’s Hayabusa2 mission that will return samples from the asteroid Ryugu and NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission that will return material from the asteroid Bennu (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Further details about each of these missions are provided in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. With each successive sample return mission comes with it an important set of lessons learned that are used to inform subsequent sample return missions, and these lessons learned extend to curation standards and practices. <table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Planetary sample return missions</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th><p>Program/Mission</p></th><th><p>Returned to Earth</p></th><th><p>Destination</p></th><th><p>Returned sample</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Apollo 11 (USA, NASA)</p></td><td><p>July 24, 1969</p></td><td><p>Moon: Mare Tranquillitatis</p></td><td><p>21.55 kg</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Apollo 12 (USA, NASA)</p></td><td><p>November 24, 1969</p></td><td><p>Moon: Oceanus Procellarum</p></td><td><p>34.30 kg</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Luna 16 (USSR)</p></td><td><p>September 24, 1970</p></td><td><p>Moon: Mare Fecunditatis</p></td><td><p>101 g</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Apollo 14 (USA, NASA)</p></td><td><p>February 9, 1971</p></td><td><p>Moon: Fra Mauro Highlands</p></td><td><p>42.80 kg</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Apollo 15 (USA, NASA)</p></td><td><p>August 7, 1971</p></td><td><p>Moon: Hadley-Apennine</p></td><td><p>76.70 kg</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Luna 20 (USSR)</p></td><td><p>February 25, 1972</p></td><td><p>Moon: Apollonius Highlands</p></td><td><p>30 g</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Apollo 16 (USA, NASA)</p></td><td><p>April 27, 1972</p></td><td><p>Moon: Descartes Highlands</p></td><td><p>95.20 kg</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Luna 24 (USSR)</p></td><td><p>August 22, 1976</p></td><td><p>Moon: Mare Crisium</p></td><td><p>170.1 g</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Apollo 17 (USA, NASA)</p></td><td><p>December 19, 1972</p></td><td><p>Moon: Taurus-Littrow</p></td><td><p>110.40 kg</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Genesis (USA, NASA)</p></td><td><p>September 8, 2004</p></td><td><p>Earth-Sun Lagrange 1</p></td><td><p>Implanted Solar Wind Atoms</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Stardust (USA, NASA)</p></td><td><p>January 15, 2006</p></td><td><p>Comet Wild 2/Interstellar</p></td><td><p>Small Particles Captured in Aerogel</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Hayabusa (Japan, JAXA)</p></td><td><p>June 13, 2010</p></td><td><p>Asteroid 25143 Itokawa</p></td><td><p>Tens of thousands of recovered small particles</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Hayabusa2 (Japan, JAXA)</p></td><td><p>December 2020 (Planned; in Flight)</p></td><td><p>Asteroid 162173 Ryugu</p></td><td><p>0.1 to 10 g Planned</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>OSIRIS-REx (USA, NASA)</p></td><td><p>September 2023 (Planned; in Flight)</p></td><td><p>Asteroid 101955 Bennu</p></td><td><p>0.06–2 kg Planned</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par17">The Apollo program offered the first set of lessons learned and set forth the modern era of curation practices for astromaterials from the solar system. With the exception of USSR Luna missions, all sample return missions in the last two decades have built upon the legacy of Apollo. While recent missions have contributed to lessons learned, the majority of lessons learned and established practices can be linked to Apollo. The Apollo program actively sought out a wide range of scientists and eventually levied the scientific community at large to influence mission conception and design. Mission decisions and laboratory research on returned samples, at least peripherally, were focused substantially in maximizing science obtained from samples in laboratory research. The majority of these sample scientists were found in the field of geological sciences. The management environment was an integration of human spaceflight mission objectives, engineering constraints, sample scientists, and those responsible to prevent back contamination of the Earth. In this management structure, conflicts routinely arose and were not only turf battles, but were rooted in basic technical conflicts to balance crew safety, lunar sample preservation, and potential hazard containment for unknown biological pathogens. Since Apollo was a series of missions, it was possible to improve sampling hardware and laboratory handling devices using experience and samples from the lunar surface. For example, regolith drive tube function was greatly improved through redesign for Apollo missions 15–17 to allow deep penetration with minimal distortion of stratigraphy. Knowledge gained from examination of the first samples (Apollo missions 11–14) allowed the switch from a high-vacuum gloved handling environment to pure gaseous nitrogen positive pressure gloveboxes, which better preserved sample cleanliness and ease of use.

Furthermore, if we look only at improving upon our current curation capabilities, we will not be prepared when returned samples require care that is very different from those within our current collections. At present, most returned samples are geological in nature, with the exception of the Genesis solar wind atoms that are implanted within a number of high purity material substrates. Most of the samples are kept close to room temperature and, when kept in the pristine environments of a clean laboratory, will maintain their fidelity indefinitely. However, future sample return missions could bring back samples that require storage and handling conditions outside of current capabilities, including gases, liquids, ices, or biological materials. To successfully curate these sensitive materials also requires new research, and we describe here a field of research that we refer to as advanced curation.</p><p id="Par19">Advanced Curation is a cross-disciplinary field that seeks to improve curation practices in existing astromaterials collections, including meteorite and cosmic dust samples that are collected on Earth. Specifically, advanced curation has two primary goals that include (1) expansion of the sample processing and storage capabilities of astromaterials facilities to prepare for future sample return missions and Earth-based collection of astromaterials and (2) to maximize the science returns of existing astromaterials sample collections. These goals are accomplished through research and development of new innovative technologies and techniques for sample collection, handling, characterization, analysis, and curation of astromaterials. In addition, advanced curation includes testing and evaluation of new technologies and operational procedures for future sample return missions through human and robotic analog studies. Here we outline best practices and procedures and highlight new results, capabilities, and ongoing activities in the field of advanced curation of astromaterials. In particular, we outline (1) the best practices for monitoring and testing of curation infrastructure for contamination, (2) the development of new storage, processing, and sample handling capabilities, (3) the development and improvement of new astromaterials acquisition capabilities on Earth (i.e., the collection of meteorites and cosmic dust), (4) the importance of contamination knowledge strategies for maximizing the science returns of sample-return missions, (5) best practices and emerging capabilities for the preliminary examination and initial characterization of astromaterials, and finally (6) a summary of the biggest challenges that lie ahead as we look toward future sample-return initiatives.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Monitoring and Testing of Curation Infrastructure</title><p id="Par20">All sample return curation facilities are designed and built to meet specific controlled environment and cleanliness standards for the curated samples. Curation infrastructure is defined as all engineering systems that control the sample’s storage and processing environment. This definition incorporates brick and mortar, temporary, modular, and mobile facilities. In addition, specialized equipment is included such as isolation chambers, gloveboxes, and desiccators that have the ability to alter the atmospheric chemistry, temperature, and pressure of the environment. During the Apollo program, curation infrastructure borrowed many innovative technologies from handling radioactive materials and biological quarantine practices. Today, curation infrastructure is derived from many industries including the nuclear, biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and semiconductor industries (USP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR193">2013</xref>; Whyte <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR214">2001</xref>; Ramstorp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">2000</xref>). Methods and techniques are either borrowed, augmented, or invented to maintain the controlled environment to mitigate terrestrial cross-contamination. Contamination covers any element that could compromise sample integrity. To quote the definition of pristine from Dworkin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2018</xref>), it means that “no foreign material is introduced to the sample in an amount that hampers the ability to analyze the chemistry and mineralogy of the sample”. While sample return missions designate contamination limits on specific elements and compounds at time of launch with focused science goals, samples are effectively allocated over time to study everything on the periodic table. Therefore, the implementation of curation infrastructure should be mindful that everything could be a contaminant to some research group. Modern cleanroom facilities have substantial infrastructure footprints that require continual monitoring to ensure they operate within the defined strict contamination control guidelines. This requires continuous monitoring and testing of the labs to verify that the sample processing environments remain clean from the standpoint of inorganic, organic, and biological contamination. As it is unrealistic to eliminate all contamination, careful monitoring and contamination knowledge must be conducted. To this end, curation laboratories that house astromaterials have developed numerous protocols and methods to monitor curation facilities and we outline those practices below.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Real-Time Continuous Monitoring and Testing of Curation Cleanroom Laboratories</title><p id="Par21">Cleanrooms are a specialized controlled environment that must be continually monitored to verify whether they are working to defined parameters and specifications. The international standards organization (ISO) have developed fundamental standards for cleanrooms, namely ISO 14644. Curation cleanroom laboratories follow this standard as well as many adopted recommend practices from several industries (e.g., IEST, SEMI, GSA, etc.). For curation facilities, cleanroom measurements are regularly made to ensure that the heating ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system is creating the appropriate cascade of positive or negative pressure and that Fan Filter Units (FFU), in conjunction with the HVAC system, are delivering the proper level of airborne particles to accepted limits for the planned ISO class. Temperature and humidity are also kept within pre-specified limits within the intended operational parameters of the HVAC system.</p><p id="Par22">Ideally, real-time remote monitoring can track airborne particulates, room-to-room differential pressures, temperature, humidity, and HVAC operations. Remote airborne particle counters have either internal or external pumps with a flow rate of 0.1 CFM (2.83 LPM) or 1.0 CFM (28.3 LPM) dependent on ISO Class and desired statistics. Many of them can output up to 6 channels of simultaneous data within the range of 0.3–25.0 μm. For ISO Class 4 and below, a dedicated 0.1 μm particle counter is desired to improve particle count statistics. While real-time remote monitoring is ideal, hand-held manual particle counters are sometimes used for spot checking spaces and annual ISO Class audits. For ISO Class 5 and above, these handheld particle counting instruments are typically set-up for a 2 minute measurement with a total sampling volume of 5.68 L and particle channels set at 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 5.0, and 10.0 μm. In lieu of real-time continuous remote monitoring, weekly particle counts of all curation labs are desirable of key areas with a full ISO audits conducted annually or bi-annually.</p><p id="Par23">Curation cleanroom laboratories primarily use a positive pressure differential barrier to reduce contamination. A pressure differential barrier is based on the concept of using positive pressure air flow cascade to create a cleaner zone towards a less clean zone as a first line of defense to prevent cross-contamination between two adjacent spaces. The pressure differential should be of significant magnitude and stability to prevent any reversal of air flow between barriers including when barrier thresholds are crossed and/or doors are opened. However, the pressure differential should not be too high as to create turbulent air flow that could compromise the clean zone. In addition, too high of pressure between zones can also prevent doors from opening. For example, at 0.10 inH<sub>2</sub>O (inches of water), a <inline-formula id="IEq1"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq1_Math"><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mn>7</mml:mn></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq1_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Whyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR215">2010</xref>) discusses the reason for ISO 14644-4 acceptable minimum of 0.02 inH<sub>2</sub>O (5 Pa) pressure between adjacent rooms. This acceptable minimum was established for processing facilities that handle products that can be adversely affected from greater pressures. These low pressure differentials can sometimes be found in long tunnels between processing cleanrooms that contain air flow sensitive products. Whyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR215">2010</xref>) further discusses if 0.02 inH<sub>2</sub>O (5 Pa) must be used; confirmation of the air flow direction must be verifiable with routine observable smoke flow tests (assuming such tests would not be a source of contamination). Sakraida (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">2008</xref>) discusses recent experimental studies that have tested the optimal pressure differential between clean zones. Pressure differentials between 0.03 to 0.05 inH<sub>2</sub>O were determined to be optimal for mitigating cross-contamination. The study further suggested that clean zones with pressures above 0.05 inH<sub>2</sub>O showed little increased benefit to mitigate contamination compared to increased energy costs of operating the air handling unit.</p><p id="Par25">Based on ISO 14644-4 standards and available cleanroom technology literature, astromaterials curation laboratories should ideally maintain ≥ 0.05 inH<sub>2</sub>O between interior “dirty” hallways to laboratory anterooms and a minimum of 0.03 to 0.05 inH<sub>2</sub>O in most adjacent rooms between anteroom and main laboratory. For primary astromaterials storage areas and processing laboratories, ideally 0.05 to 0.08 inH<sub>2</sub>O should be maintained to mitigate the long-term infiltration of contaminates. However, it is important to note that higher pressures may be desired to create a buffer to mitigate the risk of dropping below 0.05 inH<sub>2</sub>O based on air flow stability from the HVAC and laboratory layout.</p><p id="Par26">Real-time continuous remote monitoring is common for modern cleanrooms with a desired differential pressure accuracy of about <inline-formula id="IEq3"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq3_Math"><mml:mo>±</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.001</mml:mn></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq3_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Cleanroom construction materials, surfaces, sample handling tools, containers, and unknown visible material are analyzed directly or with tape-pulls or polyester wipes. Optical microcopy and SEM typically are used as an initial screening before using other methods of analysis. The following methods have been used in the past at the NASA JSC Curation office, on an as-needed basis, on witness plates, test coupons, millipore filters, and other material samples: (1) Optical Stereomicroscopy/Microscopy for macro particulate/other contamination, (2) FEG-SEM/EDX for micro particulate identification, (3) FT-IR and Raman Spectroscopy for surface contamination, (4) XPS for complete surface/thin-films/oxidation, (5) LA-HR-ICP-MS for gross surface inorganics, (6) VPD-HR-ICP-MS for molecular airborne inorganics, (7) TD-GC-MS with GL Sciences SWA-256 wafer analyzer for molecular airborne organics/outgassing, (8) DART-qTOF-MS for gross surface organics, (9) LC-MS for amino acids, and (10) AFM (Atomic Force Microcopy) for surface roughness/thin-films/cleaning changes.

The monitoring methods differ among these labs, but the overall goal, to reduce or eliminate contamination, is always the same. A key difference for curation facilities is the need to identify contaminants. Identification is not always a monitoring plan requirement in other industries. Microorganisms like bacteria and fungi are capable of physically and chemically altering astromaterials (Toporski and Steele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR189">2007</xref>). Since the nutrient levels in cleanrooms are purposely kept at very low levels, it is likely that microorganisms will seek out nutrient bearing phases in the astromaterials themselves (e.g. phosphorous rich minerals, organic carbon). Therefore, it is important to identify organisms in cleanrooms and understand how they might affect samples stored within the cleanrooms. The most common monitoring method for any cleanroom is cultivation of viable microorganisms like bacteria and fungi. The implementation of a variety of culture-independent analysis techniques that are employed more sporadically are also discussed.</p><p id="Par41">In the aerospace industry, biological testing is most commonly performed to meet planetary protection requirements for individual pieces of hardware and entire missions.

Cultured organisms are counted but not necessarily identified. ESA requirements are similar, but require cultivation on Reasoners 2 Agar (R2A) for oligotrophic bacteria, Thioglycolate Agar (TGA) for anaerobic bacteria, and Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) for fungi in addition to TSA (ECSS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2008</xref>). Only one set of R2A plates are heat shocked, while the remaining samples are incubated without being exposed to heat. The ESA standards also include provisions for collecting air samples with an impactor style sampling device. Sampling to meet planetary protection requirements is conducted with the assumption that all of the hardware will be exposed to DHMR (dry heat microbial reduction) or an equivalent process to sterilize the spacecraft. Organisms that survive the heat-shock treatment are counted as a proxy for what might be capable of surviving DHMR. These are fit for purpose assays that are not designed or intended to capture the total diversity of the cleanroom environment. While some facilities and/or missions do identify and archive isolates, this is not required or routine in every instance. Similar culture-based assays have been used to monitor Chinese and Russian space craft assembly facilities as well (Novikova <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">2004</xref>; Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR219">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par43">Cleanrooms used to manufacture pharmaceuticals and package food are also monitored for biological contamination. There are no detailed methods for how to monitor these types of cleanrooms, but cultivation-based techniques are generally the norm. ISO 14698-1 sets out very general principles and methods for biocontamination control in cleanrooms. The document states, “The appropriate sampling method and related procedures shall be selected and performed to reflect the complexity and variety of situations. Sampling shall be carried out using a device and method selected in accordance with the written procedure and in accordance with the instructions provided by the device manufacturer,” (ISO14698 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2003</xref>). The United States Pharmacopeial Convention also relies on cultivation based methods without specifying a particular set of sampling tools, growth conditions, or nutrients (USP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR193">2013</xref>). For example, air samples can be collected with a variety of tools, including: slit to agar samplers, centrifugal samplers, gelatin filter samplers, sieve impactors, impingers, and settle plates (USP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR193">2013</xref>). However, the USP document does make several important points regarding sampling methods and data analysis: (1) Total particulate counts from air sampling do not correlate to microbial abundance, although this is an area of open research (Raval et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">2012</xref>). (2) Microbial monitoring is semi-quantitative at best. (3) Colony counts (i.e. the number of culturable organisms) are highly variable from sample to sample and from day to day.

Cultivation based techniques are relatively cheap and easy to perform on a regular basis. However, they can be highly variable and even the most comprehensive culture-based sampling campaign is guaranteed to under-sample the environment (e.g., Hug et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2016</xref>; Lynch and Neufeld <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2015</xref>; Rappe and Giovannoni <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">2003</xref>).

Tag sequencing is a powerful monitoring tool, but it does have several important biases. PCR (polymerase chain reaction) based amplification of DNA is required for most low biomass samples. This amplification step does not amplify DNA from every organism equally. For example Moissl-Eichinger et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">2015</xref>) were able to cultivate organisms that they did not detect using, “universal” PCR primers for amplification and subsequent tag sequencing. Secondly, sequencing of any type cannot distinguish DNA from viable organisms from relict environmental DNA inside dead organisms. Several researchers have started treating their samples with compounds like PMA (propidium monoazide) to destroy DNA from non-viable organisms prior to sequencing (e.g., Mahnert et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2015</xref>; Moissl-Eichinger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">2015</xref>; Mora et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">2016</xref>; Weinmaier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR208">2015</xref>; Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR219">2018</xref>). Due to variations in primer choice, sequence length, error rate, and total number of sequences produced, it is very difficult to quantitatively compare data generated by different sequencing platforms (Tremblay et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR190">2015</xref>). Care should be taken to keep these variables as consistent as possible during monitoring. When changes are made, they should be directly compared to previous methods.</p><p id="Par46">Rather than amplifying and sequencing specific marker genes, it is also possible to sequence all of the DNA in a sample (with or without amplification) using the same types of DNA sequencers discussed above. This sequencing technique is commonly referred to as shotgun metagenomics (e.g., Bashir et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2016</xref>; Minich et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">2018</xref>; Moissl-Eichinger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">2015</xref>; Weinmaier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR208">2015</xref>). Shotgun metagenomics provides more information about the function of abundant organisms in the environment but often fails to detect rare members of the community (Tessler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR187">2017</xref>). Additionally, this technique generates large amounts of data that can be very challenging and time-consuming to interpret. At present, metagenomics is a powerful research tool, but it is probably not yet suitable for routine monitoring. New DNA sequencers, like the MinIon platform (Reuter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">2015</xref>), that generate longer reads may eventually be able to generate metagenomic data that are easier to assemble and interpret, but they are still being developed and improved.</p><p id="Par47">DNA sequencing can be used to inform the design of more rapid assays for biological monitoring. qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) can be used to assess the number of copies of genes in a sample that directly correlates to microbial abundance (Cooper et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2011</xref>; Hubad and Lapanje <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2013</xref>; Kwan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2011</xref>; Mahnert et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2015</xref>; Moissl-Eichinger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">2011</xref>; Moissl-Eichinger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">2015</xref>; Schwendner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">2013</xref>; Vaishampayan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR194">2013</xref>; Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR219">2018</xref>). When interpreting qPCR data, care must be taken to account for organisms that have multiple copies of the 16S or other marker gene (Větrovský and Baldrian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200">2013</xref>). DNA microarrays like the Phylochip have also been investigated as potential monitoring tools (Cooper et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2011</xref>; Jimenez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2011</xref>; La Duc et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2014</xref>; Probst et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">2010</xref>; Vaishampayan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR194">2013</xref>). Both of these techniques show promise as monitoring solutions, but they probably require initial investigation with culturing and DNA sequencing in order to ensure that probes and primers are designed to capture the communities present inside the cleanroom in question.</p><p id="Par48">Techniques that do not involve sequencing DNA are also being tested in cleanroom settings. All living organisms on Earth produce a compound called ATP (adenosine triphosphate) for energy storage. Measuring the concentration of ATP in a cleanroom sample provides information about the total number of viable cells (Benardini and Venkateswaran <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2016</xref>; La Duc et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2007</xref>; Mahnert et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2015</xref>; Venkateswaran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR198">2003</xref>), but it is not useful for identifying what organisms are present. MALDI-TOF (Matrix assisted laser desorption time of flight) mass spectrometry is now commonly used in the medical field to identify organisms, and it is being applied in aerospace cleanrooms as well (Andrade et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2018</xref>; Moissl-Eichinger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">2015</xref>). However, this technique is still dependent on culturing organisms. Fluorescence based monitoring systems can detect airborne cells but cannot identify them (Hallworth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2012</xref>).</p><p id="Par49">Biological testing of clean labs suffers from a lack of repetition. Outside the NASA standard assay, very few measurements are routinely replicated between labs. In some respects, this is good and appropriate. Monitoring methods should be modified to suit the environment and the questions being asked. The microbial profile of cleanrooms will be different in different environments (e.g., La Duc et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2009</xref>). For example, cold curation facilities should explicitly test for the presence of psychrophilic organisms (Sandle and Skinner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">2013</xref>). It would be a waste of resources to look for psychrophiles in labs maintained at room temperature. However, variations in sample collection, DNA extraction, DNA sequencing, and data processing methods make inter-lab comparisons very difficult. Testing new methods and techniques is an important area of research, but more effort should be made to relate these new measurements to previously generated data.</p><p id="Par50">Curation labs should design a monitoring plan that is capable of quantifying and identifying the microbes present therein. Unfortunately, there is no single measurement or technique capable of thoroughly describing a microbial community. Each method discussed above has its strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, a selection of culture-based and culture-independent techniques should be used to monitor cleanroom ecology. Samples should be collected from the air and from surfaces regularly and as frequently as daily when critical operations are being conducted. Special care should be taken to avoid organic or inorganic contamination during sampling. For example, agar filled contact plates used in the pharmaceutical industry are inappropriate for curation labs since they would introduce bioavailable organic compounds and trace metals into the lab. Most importantly, sample collection and analysis methods should be as consistent as possible in order to generate a baseline dataset that can be used as a basis of comparison for new techniques. Regular and consistent sampling is the most important feature of any environmental monitoring program.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Development of New Storage, Processing, and Sample Handling Capabilities</title><p id="Par51">As technological advancements and new ideas expand the variety and scope of scientific questions that can be asked with astromaterials samples, so expands the need for better storage, processing and sample handling capabilities of curation laboratories that house and process astromaterials samples.

Furthermore, the US Antarctic meteorite collection utilizes cold storage of new Antarctic meteorites, and initially used cold stages in a nitrogen glovebox for cold sample handling. According to Annexstad and Cassidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1980</xref>) “The specimens are transferred from a small staging freezer to the processing cabinet. A specially constructed stage, cooled by liquid nitrogen, is used to keep the sample frozen while an initial cold chip is removed from the meteorite. This chip is immediately returned to freezer storage for future experiments when a frozen piece may be required. The parent meteorite is then allowed to warm to ambient temperature naturally in the cabinet’s dry GN<sub>2</sub> environment.” In the first few years of Antarctic meteorite handling at JSC, the staff gained experience with storing and handling samples frozen, using a cold processing plate in a cabinet and using a cold storage room. Although some hardware was assembled to do this, it became clear after detailed tests that this was not an effective way to handle samples due to the difficulty of keeping samples cold while still allowing dexterity of the sample processor, length of time required to process individual samples, and overall expense. The cold processing approach was abandoned at JSC in 1979, after review and discussion by the Meteorite working Group (MWG) (Righter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par54">More recently, insights into the benefits of curation and processing under cold conditions have been gained from the collection, curation, and study of the Tagish Lake meteorite (Herd et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2016</xref> and references therein).

While there are no indications that the Tagish Lake meteorite contains water ice or other such volatiles, these conditions of storage and handling are justified by the discovery of especially volatile and/or reactive organic species (e.g., formic acid, naphthalene, and styrene; Hilts et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2014</xref>). Challenges and limitations of the Subzero Curation Facility include: mitigation of glovebox leaks, user comfort, and the extreme dryness of the Ar atmosphere, which would result in the sublimation of water or other ices from the samples (Herd et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2016</xref>). However, the facility achieves the goal of enabling documentation and processing of pristine astromaterials under low temperature in an inert atmosphere. The low-temperature curation of the Tagish Lake specimens reduces reaction rates, preserves intrinsic (volatile) organic compounds, and discourages microbial activity (Herd et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2016</xref>)—requirements that are desirable for returned samples from organic-rich asteroids, cometary nuclei, Mars, or other volatile-rich returned sample targets (lunar poles, icy moons, etc.) as discussed below.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Volatile-Rich Samples from the Lunar Poles</title><p id="Par56">The lunar poles are high-priority targets for sample return due to the possibility of significant quantities of water-ice and other volatiles in permanently shadowed regions (PSRs). Remote sensing data indicates that volatiles comprise up to several weight percent of materials in PSRs; the composition of the volatiles in the crater Cabeus’ PSR included H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>, CO, H<sub>2</sub>S, CH<sub>4</sub>, OH, SO<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, and CH<sub>3</sub>OH (Colaprete et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2010</xref>; Gladstone et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2010</xref>). This mix of compounds present a complex curatorial challenge, and even more so in the presence of local regolith/silicates (largely anorthosite or basalt). The volatiles detected by LCROSS have a range of condensation temperatures, and a subset are highly reactive in the presence of silicate minerals. If the solid and volatile components of a lunar PSR sample are stored together, therefore, a mixed-phase, highly reactive sample will likely result. The preservation of a lunar polar sample would therefore be maximized by separating the solid and volatile components and storing them in that configuration for the long-term.</p><p id="Par57">The presence of numerous reactive species presents several additional challenges. First, the corrosive nature of H<sub>2</sub>S limits the materials to which the sample can be exposed without alteration. Materials will therefore need to be selected that accommodate the curatorial requirements for isolation (materials should not significantly contract under cold temperatures), durability during sample processing/preliminary examination, and particulate contamination. Second, volatile-rich samples often contain gases that are hazardous to humans, even at low concentrations (e.g., CO, H<sub>2</sub>S, SO<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>). This additional risk—on top of the existing particulate exposure risk from solid samples—may require the use of respirators or special masks during preliminary examination and curatorial operations. The need to minimize leakage from curatorial hardware (gas containers, analytical equipment, gloveboxes, etc.) will be significantly higher for volatile-rich samples; because they will operate at cold temperatures, proper materials selection from the component to the system level will be a top priority.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Cometary Nucleus Samples</title><p id="Par58">The preservation of a cometary nucleus sample lies at the extreme end of cold-curation storage requirements because the sample would contain hypervolatiles including noble gases, nitrogen, and oxygen (Bieler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2015</xref>; Le Roy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2015</xref>), although the retention of these gases would only likely be achieved if they are trapped within solid ices of primarily H<sub>2</sub>O, CO, and CO<sub>2</sub>. Insights from the ROsetta Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis (ROSINA) instrument, which measured volatiles in the coma of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko demonstrate that, while dominated by water, the nucleus of 67P includes a wide range of volatile compounds, including molecular oxygen, CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, HCN, H<sub>2</sub>S, CH<sub>4</sub>, and many others (Bieler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2015</xref>; Le Roy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2015</xref>). Curation of these ices, which would almost certainly be intimately mixed with non-volatile, fine-grained silicate, oxide, sulfide and more refractory organic materials, would require significant technological development for cryogenic curation—assuming that the sample could be collected and returned to Earth under cryogenic conditions in the first place. Various options for the return of cometary nucleus volatiles have been studied, including cryogenic sample return, for which significant technical challenges exist (Veverka <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR202">2010b</xref>). Allowing volatile components to be released by warming a comet nucleus sample and capturing them in a separate container removes the need for cryogenic handling (Veverka <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR201">2010a</xref>), which was the approach proposed for the CAESAR mission concept to comet 67P.

The Planetary Protection Office classifies any “samples from solar system bodies that may harbor indigenous life” as Category V: Restricted Earth Return. Although there are currently three bodies with this designation (Mars, Europa, and Enceladus), this number can change in either direction as more information about any particular planetary body is gained. For example, during the first three Apollo sample return missions (Apollo 11, 12, 13, and 14), the Moon was considered Restricted. Consequently, the Apollo 11, 12, and 14 samples and astronauts were quarantined upon arrival while health assessments and biohazard tests were performed. However by Apollo 15, which launched just over two year after Apollo 11, the Moon was reclassified as Unrestricted and the final three Apollo missions (Apollo 15, 16, and 17) proceeded without the same level of biohazard Planetary Protection precautions.</p><p id="Par67">The scientific community has identified Mars Sample Return (MSR) as a high priority sample return activity for many years, and support for such an endeavor has waxed and waned over the last few decades. Current efforts relating to MSR are focused on a multi-mission campaign, the first of which is the Mars 2020 rover mission to Jezero Crater. At the time of writing, no space agency has fully committed to returning the samples that will be collected by Mars 2020, but NASA and ESA are discussing the possibility of forming a partnership to complete the campaign and decisions are anticipated to be made in the year 2020. Due to both Planetary Protection and Science requirements, the Mars 2020 rover mission has the most stringent inorganic, organic, and biological contamination control requirements of any sample return mission in history. Strategies for satisfying these and other requirements related to MSR and Restricted Earth Return in general are described below.</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>Facility Preparation</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Infrastructure</title><p id="Par68">Samples returned from any planetary body designated as Restricted must be contained within a Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) facility until it can be demonstrated that either (1) the samples do not pose a threat to life on Earth or (2) the samples have been adequately sterilized for release (Rummel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">2002</xref>, NASA technical publication 211842). The requirements and processes associated with biohazard testing and/or sterilization are developed specifically for each mission and each set of samples. International space treaties with the United States, COSPAR planetary protection policies, and NASA planetary protection policy directives and requirements do not impose any specific design requirements on a biocontainment architecture or BSL-4 facility. The policies simply state that the Earth must be protected from the potential hazard posed by extraterrestrial matter and microbial containment is required on Category V (sample return) Restricted Earth Returns. The U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services traditionally has jurisdiction of design and operating requirements for a BSL-4 facility in the United States. The “Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories”, 5th Edition (Dec. 2009) authored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services: Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institutes of Health; HHS Publication No. (CDC) 21-1112 (hereafter BMBL, 2009), houses the primary recommendations, standards, and design requirements for all BSL labs. Under this regulation, any related agents with unknown risk of transmission are classified to be under BSL-4 containment. Presumably, an extraterrestrial or unknown pathogen would require, at minimum, a BSL-4 containment. At this time, we cannot predict what other federal or international agencies may wish to impose additional guidelines and requirements and/or request jurisdiction of a NASA BSL-4 sample return lab. For example, the National Institute of Health (NIH) imposed additional design requirements at the Galveston National Lab beyond the BMBL requirements. The World Health Organization also has guidelines and requirements for BSL-4 laboratories and the Dept. of Agriculture has claimed some jurisdiction of extraterrestrial soils. For the Apollo Program in January 1966, the Interagency Committee on Back Contamination (ICBC) was established to include the CDC with Dr. David Sencer of the CDC as chairman, Department of Agriculture, Department of the Interior, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, National Academy of Sciences, and NASA, which imposed strict requirements on the construction of the Lunar Receiving Laboratory (LRL), JSC Bldg. 37. Therefore, historically, other agencies have been involved in the construction and operations of such a BSL-4 type lab.</p><p id="Par69">One of the major challenges in designing a facility for Restricted Earth Return Missions is the integration of the Contamination Control (CC) requirements necessary to protect the samples from terrestrial contamination and Planetary Protection (PP) requirements necessary to protect the Earth and its inhabitants (all life: from humans to animals to plants, etc.) from a possible extraterrestrial pathogen (e.g., microbes, viruses, or prions). While walls can act as physical barriers for protections, developing the proper pressure differentials inside and outside the laboratory is vital (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Unlike the curation of traditional unrestricted samples, which utilizes positive pressure gradients to protect the samples from contamination, BSL-4 facilities rely on negative pressure gradients to protect the scientists and general public from the samples. Although there have been a number of possible iterations demonstrated in the Draft Test Protocol (Rummel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">2002</xref>; Fig. 3), the presumed baseline requirement is that the samples must be contained within a BSL-4 Facility (BMBL 2009). In order to best protect the samples and Earth, redundancies are built into the design schematic (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Specifically, not only will the entire cleanroom laboratory be constructed within a BSL-4 facility, but the use of a Biosafety Cabinet (BSC) III double walled isolator for sample processing within the cleanroom will add an additional level of protection with the corresponding differential pressure scheme. For current BSL facilities in the U.S., a Class III BSC glovebox gastight (leak rate) criterion is <inline-formula id="IEq64"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq64_Math"><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mtext>–</mml:mtext><mml:mn>5</mml:mn><mml:mspace width="0.3em"/><mml:mtext>cc</mml:mtext><mml:mo stretchy="false">/</mml:mo><mml:mtext>s</mml:mtext></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq64_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

However, achieving a better leak rate on double-walled isolated containment may require additional engineering development and challenges. While there have been some studies exploring how these requirements could be implemented (Beaty et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2009</xref>), these studies need to be updated to reflect some significant shifts in possible facility usage (e.g. no animal studies, long-term use, multi-mission use). <fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Comparison of differential pressure gradients used for containment of astromaterials samples from bodies designated as restricted Earth return (adapted from Rummel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">2002</xref>: 6, Fig. 1): (1) The top schematic represents a standard sample containment design for unrestricted sample return missions. In this configuration, the highest pressure is situated inside a positive pressure glovebox or containment isolation chamber and pushes out to a lower pressurized cleanroom. The cleanroom is also under positive pressure relative to the outside of the lab. This positive pressure cascade is designed to mitigate the infiltration of outside or laboratory contamination to the astromaterials samples. (2) The middle schematic is a standard BSL-4 containment design for working with hazardous biological pathogens. In this particular configuration, the glovebox or containment isolation chamber that houses the biohazard is under negative pressure relative to the laboratory space. In addition, the laboratory is also under negative pressure relative to outside of the lab. This negative pressure cascade is engineered to protect the outside environment from a release of any biohazard. (3) The bottom schematic is the current design concept for a restricted Earth return sample containment that combines both of these technologies. The containment isolation chamber that houses the samples is designed with a double wall and the interstitial space is filled with a high purity gas at a higher pressure relative to the contained isolated samples and the cleanroom. The pressure between the cleanroom and containment is still under a negative pressure differential to maintain BSL-4 containment standards, but any leakage would be the high purity gas that pushes into the containment and out to the laboratory cleanroom. In addition, the cleanroom laboratory would be a positive pressure cascade with a negative differential pressure plenum barrier to maintain BSL-4 containment to the outside environment of the facility</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11214_2019_615_Fig3a_HTML.jpg"/><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11214_2019_615_Fig3b_HTML.png"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Functional Laboratory Design</title><p id="Par70">The verification of extinct or extant life within a sample may require the examination of organic compounds within the samples. As such, not only is it vital to ensure no terrestrial biological contamination occurs during sample handling and storage, but the amount of organic contamination must also be minimized. One of the main ways to do this is through the selection of manufacturing equipment and laboratory space with proper materials that have little to no potential to outgas or shed particles. This will require the use of mainly 300 series stainless steel and Teflon in areas with intimate contact with the samples. For this reason (as well as offering additional differential pressure gradients), double walled isolator cabinets are the likely choice for the handling of these materials since the suits utilized in BSL-4 facilities and the glovebox gloves could contaminate the samples with organic matter and make life detection more difficult (Vrublevskis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR203">2018a</xref>; Holt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2019</xref>). Although the utilization of a double-walled isolator (DWI) helps to mitigate the contamination risk, it requires a significant advancement in remote or robotically assisted manipulation since manual manipulation via a glove port could compromise the organic CC requirements due to material outgassing. Although there is work being done in Advanced Curation related to small particle handling, there are other groups investigating hepatic feedback remote handling, specifically for Mars Sample Return (Vrublevskis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR204">2018b</xref>). In addition to robotic sample manipulators, and any analytical equipment should be developed to allow scientists to manipulate samples and run analyses remotely.</p><p id="Par71">A further complication of returning samples from a restricted planetary body is the unknown long-term space requirements of the collection. Although Apollo samples were eventually deemed safe and released (two years after the first samples were returned), this will not necessarily be the case for future restricted Earth return missions. If a potential or actual health hazard is found, or if there are too many concerns about unknown unknowns, samples may never be released from containment. Therefore, multiple facilities and sample use strategies would need to be developed to conduct science in containment. One way to approach this is to construct a modular BSL-4 facility that has walls that can be shifted to accommodate the addition of new analytical instrument suites and other long-term curation/scientific needs.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Integration of Cleaning and Sterilization Techniques</title><p id="Par72">The safety of the samples and the technicians and environment at large will require not only a well-designed facility, but also the integration of cleanliness and sterilization protocols. While there are standard sterilization techniques (e.g. heat, peroxide, formaldehyde) and cleaning procedures (e.g. IPA, UPW), there is not one standard procedure that can do both simultaneously. In the case of MSR, where a major part of “life-detection” will rely on DNA extraction and not viability, any unviable biological matter remaining will compromise the samples and studies. Due to these considerations, strategies for integrating these procedures are underway. A similar strategy as that taken for flight hardware will be employed, clean the materials first and then sterilize without generating contamination. Although the Mars 2020 Mission has integrated the use of vapor phase hydrogen peroxide (VHP), they are using heat sterilization on the sample intimate hardware. However, given the specs of isolator cabinets (e.g. size and mechanics) and the systematic sterilizations needed to avoid cross-contamination and ensure safety, heat sterilization is not a viable option.</p><p id="Par73">The need to integrate the isolator cabinets into the facility’s infrastructure will mean that they will have to be cleaned and sterilized in place. For this we can draw upon best practices used in Curation Glovebox Laboratories and BSL-4 Cabinet Laboratories. For initial final cleaning/sterilization, a standard UPW/IPA cleaning procedure would likely be utilized (see Sect. <xref rid="Sec25" ref-type="sec">3.7</xref>) followed by sterilization utilizing an ultra-pure hydrogen peroxide solution. Given the harshness of the high concentration peroxide required (35%), amount of residual moisture after sterilization is complete, and its limitations in sterilizing instrumentation due to unexposed surfaces, a new technique is being considered. Not only does ionized hydrogen peroxide only require a solution of 8% hydrogen peroxide, it more easily permeates instrumentation, and does not leave a liquid residue (Webb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR207">2011</xref>; Grimaldo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2017</xref>). Although more research is required to confirm sufficient sterilization without generating long-term corrosion or systemic contamination, the outlook is promising.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Collection of Baselines for Science and Planetary Protection</title><p id="Par74">The concurrent requirements for sterility, particulate and organic volatile cleanliness, temperature control, leak prevention/sample isolation, and gas safety will need to be met in the coming years as exploration efforts at Mars, Europa, and Enceladus come to fruition.

The proper collection, storage, and cataloging of Contamination Knowledge (CK) associated with the production and assembly of the spacecraft, rover, lander, orbiter, and/or sampling system will be vital to these investigations. Without a well-constructed and curated CK collection, the baseline for contamination within the returned samples cannot be established. Therefore, after mission inception and design, the development of the CK collection as part of a mission’s curation plan (CP) should occur in conjunction with the mission’s CC and PP plans. The CP, CC, and PP plans and implementation of these plans during ATLO and Earth receiving operations are paramount to the ultimate value of the returned samples.</p><p id="Par79">Technological advancements to instrumentation are continually progressing with greater precision and accuracy for sample measurements, especially in the field of microbiology. An array of CK samples must be made available to scientists once restricted samples are returned to Earth, and those samples should be preserved in such a manner that they can be analyzed by instrumentation that was not invented at the time of their initial storage. Collecting and curating unanalyzed/unaltered samples will minimize the possibility that current analysis and extraction techniques destroy or alter the samples or otherwise inhibit yet to be developed measurements.

Although vacuum processing takes a very direct approach to minimizing sample contamination by avoiding sample contact with gases, the process is inherently difficult. Maintaining vacuum in large processing cabinets requires constant pumping and the use of cold traps to remove unwanted pumping oils and other contaminants, which renders gloves stiff with attendant processor fatigue, and any leaks in the system tend to introduce relatively humid ambient air. There is also the danger of rapid pressure loss through mechanical failure, which would introduce significant contamination and poses a physical risk to processors. Unfortunately, the F-201 processing glovebox chamber was prone to leaks and glove failures as well as difficulties in using vacuum hardware with an increasingly large volume of lunar samples, which ultimately drove the high vacuum complex to be used only for Apollo 11 and 12. For Apollo 14 onward, the high vacuum complex was replaced by a series of positive pressure gaseous nitrogen gloveboxes called the Sterile Nitrogen Atmospheric Processing (SNAP) Line and Nonsterile Nitrogen Processing Line (NNPL) (Reynolds et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">1973</xref>; Simoneit et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178">1973</xref>).</p><p id="Par81">The JAXA Extraterrestrial Sample Curation Center (ESCuC) in Sagamihara, Japan has successfully employed vacuum storage for samples returned from the Hayabusa mission to asteroid Itokawa and is planned for JAXA’s Hayabusa2 mission to carbonaceous asteroid Ryugu that is currently in flight (Okazaki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">2017</xref>; Sawada et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">2017</xref>; Yada et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR218">2014</xref>).

The curation of small particles includes the unambiguous identification of particles in/on collection substrates, the transfer of particles between collection, analysis, and storage substrates, sample characterization, sample preparation/subdivision, and the preservation and documentation of samples in a publicly available catalog. Astromaterials Curation facilities in the United States, Russia, and Japan currently maintain several small particle collections (Allen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2011</xref>): Lunar regolith fine-grained samples returned by Apollo astronauts and by Soviet Luna robotic spacecraft, Cosmic Dust that has been collected in Earth’s stratosphere by ER2 and WB-57 aircraft, Comet 81P/Wild 2 dust returned by NASA’s Stardust spacecraft, interstellar dust returned by Stardust, and asteroid Itokawa particles that were returned by the Hayabusa spacecraft. NASA and JAXA Curation offices are currently preparing for the anticipated return of two new astromaterials collections—asteroid Ryugu regolith collected by Hayabusa2 spacecraft in 2019 and returned to Earth in 2020, and asteroid Bennu regolith to be collected by the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft and returned in 2023 (Lauretta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2017</xref>). A substantial portion of these anticipated returned samples are expected to consist of small particle components, and mission requirements necessitate the development of new processing tools and methods in order to maximize the scientific yield from these valuable acquisitions.</p><p id="Par86">There are several aspects of microscale astromaterials curation that present challenges that are distinct from macroscopic sample curation. At scales of less than 100 μm, electrostatic and intermolecular forces dominate the behavior of particles. Particles adhere weakly to glass or tungsten needles via Van der Waals intermolecular forces, usually enabling transfer between analysis and storage substrates. These transfer operations are hindered by transient electrostatic forces. Triboelectric charging due to contact, separation, and frictional electrification (Matsusaka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2010</xref>) is the primary mechanism by which particles are lost during transfer operations (although environmental and instrumental vibrations also contribute to sample loss during transfers), and these triboelectric effects become more severe in low-humidity environments. Hayabusa2 and OSIRIS-REx collections will be curated in sample processing cabinets purged with dry GN<sub>2</sub>, and developing methods for suppressing triboelectric charge accumulation in these dry environments will be critical for successful sample processing.</p><p id="Par87">Sample characterization at the microscale also presents unique challenges. Typically, optical images of submicron to micron-sized particles do not provide sufficient information to investigators to make informed sample selections. Microscale particles are often imaged and characterized in scanning electron microscopes equipped with an energy-dispersive spectroscopic (EDS) detector for elemental characterization; such analyses are useful for investigators requesting samples with desired mineralogy and are necessary to distinguish true extraterrestrial material from terrestrial contamination for samples that are collected in the stratosphere. However, SEM analysis of microscale particles introduces an additional risk of loss due to sample charging from electron beam bombardment; additionally, some fragile organic and mineral phases may be potentially modified by e-beam characterization. In some instances (especially with rare samples), it may be necessary to subdivide a particle via ultramicrotomy or by focused ion beam (FIB) sample preparation. These methods must be carefully considered in order to avoid compromising the scientific integrity of the sample. The objective of advanced microscale astromaterials curation research is to better understand these challenges and to investigate tools, equipment, and methods that facilitate microscale sample processing.</p><sec id="Sec23"><title>Description of Tools and Equipment Used for Small Particle Handling</title><sec id="FPar4"><title>Tweezers</title><p id="Par88">Commercially available, low-Ni stainless-steel tweezers (e.g. Dumont No. 5 Dumoxel) can be utilized to reliably manipulate samples as small as several hundred microns by hand. Smaller particles (≥ 50 μm) may be manipulated by tweezers that are fixed to devices that enable mechanical or electrical actuation, especially when mounted on a micromanipulator. The NASA Curation Office at JSC has acquired two such devices manufactured by Micro Support Co., Ltd.; these devices are being used to investigate methods of particle removal from OSIRIS-REx contact pads. Challenges remain with small particle manipulation via tweezers (either by hand or by electrical/mechanical actuatable devices) due to lack of force feedback, and risk of deforming or fracturing particles with low tensile strength remains significant.</p><p id="Par89">The use of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) microtweezers for particle manipulation (Keller and Howe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">1997</xref>) have also been investigated. Initial experiments with these devices revealed similar force feedback limitations to stainless steel tweezers. In addition, silicon devices were more brittle, making removal and placement of particles on rigid substrates precarious operations that often resulted in the shattering of the microtweezers and the loss of the sample. Finally, the low-cost benefits due to mass production on a single wafer have so far not been realized, and the cost of these microtweezers has remained significantly more expensive than their stainless-steel counterparts.</p></sec><sec id="FPar5"><title>Needles</title><p id="Par90">Manipulation of particles by fine-tipped needles is a technique that has been utilized by curators since NASA initiated the cosmic dust collection in 1981. Particles smaller than 20 μm are typically transferred from a collection medium to an analytical substrate (e.g. beryllium disk or epoxy bullet) or to a storage container (e.g. concavity slide) using a microneedle made from glass or tungsten. With skill and practice, curation personnel can transfer particles as small as 5 μm between substrates by hand using a glass or tungsten needle attached to a pin vise. However, involuntary hand motions on the order of 100 μm make routine and reliable transfer tedious and precarious operations. For critical transfers, needles are attached to mechanical or motorized micromanipulators to improve transfer reliability and precision, while minimizing user fatigue. The intermolecular forces between the needles and the particles in this size range are typically sufficient to overcome repulsion due to triboelectric charge accumulation. Larger (≥ 20 μm) particles have been more challenging to manipulate. When using the same glass and tungsten microneedles for particles larger than 20 μm, triboelectric charging effects significantly hinder the reliable manipulation of particles. We have recently observed that, by utilizing tungsten carbide needles with low taper ratios (∼3:1), particles as large as 200 μm can be manipulated successfully. We speculate that these needles present greater contact surface area for intermolecular forces to capture particles, and that the needle shape may aid in the rapid redistribution of accumulated triboelectric charge; however, more tests are needed.</p><p id="Par91">Glass and quartz needles are fabricated using micropipette pullers that concentrate heat at the center of a solid core glass rod or capillary tube while applying force to each end; this action creates two needles with submicron tips. When a capillary tube is pulled in such a manner, and the tip is carefully broken off, a micropipette is created. A vacuum can be applied to this tube, creating a microscopic version of vacuum tweezers. We have investigated utilizing such a system to manipulate particles that are too large to be handled by Van der Waals adhesion. Our initial results are that, while the vacuum tweezer system is very efficient at securing larger microscale particles, releasing the particle by removing the vacuum frequently results in sample loss. We speculate that the vacuum action induces strong triboelectric charging effects.</p></sec><sec id="FPar6"><title>Microscopes</title><p id="Par92">Stereomicroscopes possess imaging characteristics such as long working distance and laterally correct viewing that make them extremely well-suited for freehand and mechanically assisted manual manipulation of microscale particles. Stereomicroscopes from manufacturers such as Nikon, Leica, and Olympus utilize two main optical designs—the Greenough design, which has two optically independent light paths, and the common main objective (CMO) design, in which optically parallel light paths share a common objective (Zimmer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR221">1998</xref>). Greenough designs are preferable in environments in which size and weight must be minimized, and where high magnification is not necessary or desired (e.g., suspended over a collector during cosmic dust harvesting). CMO optical designs afford increased magnification compared with Greenough type microscopes, and are utilized in more critical sample operations such as mounting particles onto analysis substrates.</p><p id="Par93">For the manipulation of very small (&lt;10 μm) samples, upright microscopes equipped with geared XY stages are utilized. These microscopes are equipped with long-working distance objectives capable of providing up to 500X magnification. The geared, manual XY stage is coupled to the Z-focus mechanism that raises and lowers beneath a stationary objective; this enables movement in X, Y, and Z independent of objective position. By placing a needle at the focal point of the objective, it is possible to transfer microparticles between substrates by moving the stage rather than by moving the needle.</p><p id="Par94">Digital microscopes are particularly useful in processing environments where stereo or upright microscopes would be inconvenient—for instance, in a N<sub>2</sub> sample cabinet or a temperature-regulated environment. They also introduce the potential to perform curation activities remotely, reducing contamination risks and operator fatigue. JAXA’s Hayabusa sample processing cabinet uses three digital microscopes—two mounted inside the cabinet, and one mounted externally—to image particles during transfer operations. Digital microscopes are best utilized with micromanipulator assisted particle transfers, especially if the microscope suffers from image lag.</p></sec><sec id="FPar7"><title>Micromanipulators</title><p id="Par95">Micromanipulators are mechanical, hydraulic, and motorized/ electrical devices that enable the precise handling of microscale samples. Most commercially available micromanipulators have three axes of motion, with motorized versions often providing a virtual fourth axis of motion (which is desirable for performing micro-fluid injections). Mechanical micromanipulators often use a combination fine-pitched screw mechanisms and linear guide rails to achieve microscale positioning. Singer instruments manufactures a mechanical micromanipulator with a 3D pantograph design (Robert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">1951</xref>); the user holds a pencil-grip stylus and, through the pantograph mechanism, manipulates a probe with a 4:1 reduction of hand motions.</p><p id="Par96">Motorized micromanipulators employ a combination of precision stepper motors and worm gear mechanisms to achieve microscale positioning and motion. These have the advantage of being able to be operated remotely and, in some cases, can be programmed for autonomous operation. A variety of input mechanisms can be utilized, including joysticks and rotary optical encoders. Motorized manipulators can also be computer controlled.</p></sec><sec id="FPar8"><title>Integrated Systems</title><p id="Par97">In order to achieve reproducible, robust, and reliable particle transfers and processing, a combination of microscopes, micromanipulators, and XY/XYZ stages are required. Motorized micromanipulators and XY stages require bulky power supplies and motor drivers (sometimes one per axis of motion), and microscopes with digital cameras often require desktop computers to operate the imaging software. Such equipment occupies large footprints in cleanrooms with limited space, compromises pristine environments with instrument cooling fans, and leads to unsightly tangled masses of cables and wires. The NASA Curation Office has recently obtained an integrated system that includes dual motorized micromanipulators, a motorized XYZ stage, and high-resolution digital microscope. The MicroSupport AxisPro system utilizes a graphic user interface control system, allowing all electromechanical components to be operated independently or simultaneously via computer mouse. A number of manipulation and sampling tools are available for the AxisPro, including an ultrasonic milling tool and a device that enables the electrical actuation of stainless-steel tweezers. The compact, integrated design of the system enables the possibility of placing the AxisPro in a N<sub>2</sub> sample cabinet with an operator performing sample processing activities remotely. So far, the AxisPro system has been used extensively for microsample handling technique development (e.g. implanting and extracting particles into polyurethane foam collectors).</p><p id="Par98">In order to minimize the risk of sample contamination (especially for collections that have been returned from extraterrestrial sources via spacecraft), materials restrictions are placed on tools and equipment used in sample processing cabinets.</p><p id="Par99">JAXA manipulates samples within its Hayabusa processing cabinet using an integrated mechanical manipulation system manufactured by Hitachi (Yada et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR218">2014</xref>). The system consists of an XYZ stage, a left and right micromanipulator, and a sealed digital camera; the system is constructed from T6061 aluminum, 304/316 stainless steel, Teflon, and quartz. No lubrication is used for the bearings, and the entire manipulator is disassembled and serviced annually to maintain performance.</p></sec><sec id="FPar9"><title>Six-Axis Compact Robot Arms</title><p id="Par100">While 3-axis micromanipulators have been extremely successful for activities involving the transfer of isolated particles in the 5–20 μm range (e.g. from microscope slide to epoxy bullet tip, beryllium SEM disk), their limited ranges of motion and lack of yaw, pitch, and roll degrees of freedom restrict their utility in other applications. For instance, curation personnel removing particles from cosmic dust collectors by hand often employ scooping and rotating motions to successfully free trapped particles from the silicone oil coatings. Similar scooping and rotating motions are also employed when isolating a specific particle of interest from an aliquot of crushed meteorite. While cosmic dust curators routinely perform with these kinds of manipulations using handheld tools, operator fatigue limits the number of particles that can be removed during a given extraction session. The challenges for curation of small particles will be exacerbated by mission requirements that samples be processed in N<sub>2</sub> sample cabinets. We have been investigating the use of compact robot arms to facilitate sample handling within gloveboxes. Six-axis robot arms potentially have applications beyond small particle manipulation. For instance, future sample return missions may involve biologically sensitive astromaterials that can be easily compromised by physical interaction with a curator; other potential future returned samples may require cryogenic curation (Calaway and Allen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2013</xref>). Robot arms may be combined with high resolution cameras within a sample cabinet and controlled remotely by curation personnel. Sophisticated robot arm and hand combination systems can be programmed to mimic the movements of a curator wearing a data glove; successful implementation of such a system may ultimately allow a curator to virtually operate in a nitrogen, cryogenic, or biologically sensitive environment with dexterity comparable to that of a curator physically handling samples in a glovebox.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Methods for Mitigating Triboelectric Charging</title><p id="Par101">Developing tools and methods for mitigating the effects of triboelectric charging during small particle processing activities is a major objective of microscale advanced curation research. Triboelectric charging results from contact, separation, and frictional charge induction (Matsusaka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2010</xref>). Examples include friction between storage substrates and instrument support stages or friction between manipulation tools and particles. Many storage substrates currently in use for small particle curation are fabricated out of glass, quartz, corundum, or other optically transparent material that enables the utilization of transmitted illumination; for example, interplanetary dust particles have traditionally been stored and distributed to investigators between a flat glass slide and a glass concavity slide. However, most transparent materials possess poor electron mobility, and any local accumulated charges are unable to easily redistribute. We have identified friction between these slides, particles, manipulation tools, and instrument support stages as a major source of sample electrification. In cases where substrate transparency is not a curation requirement, the glass support slide may be replaced with a silicon wafer. Particles retain a high level of visibility on such substrates (especially under coaxial illumination), and triboelectric charging is significantly reduced such that particles between 40 and 100 μm can be reliably manipulated and arranged in arrays without additional charge-mitigation devices. Recently, we have experimented with producing storage receptacles in silicon using focused ion beam (FIB) milling (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). We used an FEI Quanta 3D-FEG Focused Ion Beam (FIB) to mill several shallow (&lt;20 μm) depressions between <inline-formula id="IEq71"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq71_Math"><mml:mn>30</mml:mn><mml:mspace width="0.3em"/><mml:msup><mml:mtext>μm</mml:mtext><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq71_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

A 10 μm particle of CM2 meteorite was placed into one of the FIB-produced wells using a pantograph mechanical micromanipulator. The charge-dissipative nature of the Si chip enabled us to successfully acquire a secondary electron image of the stored particle using a 190 pA beam current at 10 kV. Storage substrates that also enable electron beam imaging and characterization are desirable, as they minimize the need for high-risk microscale particle transfers between storage and analysis substrates. We are currently investigating this technique to produce storage wells in other charge-dissipative substrates that could enable in-situ elemental analyses. <fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Secondary electron image of Focus Ion Beam (FIB)-produced wells in Si chip for particle storage and manipulation</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11214_2019_615_Fig6_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p id="Par102">For instances where the use of transparent substrates is unavoidable, other steps may be taken to minimize frictional contact between insulating materials. For instance, we have constructed slide support frames out of conducting and electrically grounded materials (e.g. miniature aluminum extrusion framing systems). One effective method for minimizing triboelectric charging effects is to restrict small particle processing to times when the ambient humidity is above 60% (Guardiola et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">1995</xref>); however, this method is not viable for microscale samples that are processed in dry GN<sub>2</sub> sample cabinets.</p><p id="Par103">Another extremely effective method for mitigating triboelectric charging effects is the use of a <sup>210</sup>Po alpha ionizing source. Companies such as NRD<sup>®</sup> manufacture commercially available devices designed to reduce static charge via alpha particle emission. Because alpha particles have a short penetration range in air, the sources are most effective when placed within 25 mm of the sample. Tools, substrates, and samples can be periodically exposed to the Po-210 source as sample electrification is observed to worsen; alternatively, if working distance permits, the source can be left in place during particle transfer operations to remove any transient charges as they are produced. Due to the short half-life of Po-210 (138 days), sources must be replaced annually to remain effective. Also, the use of radioactive sources may be prohibited in certain facilities and typically requires specific safety training and security protocols.</p><p id="Par104">JAXA has developed an electrostatically controlled particle manipulation system to handle Itokawa particles in an ultrapure GN<sub>2</sub> sample cabinet (Yada et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR218">2014</xref>). Instead of attempting to neutralize the charge that has accumulated on the particle, they use it to an advantage by attracting the particle with an oppositely charged needle. The system utilizes a quartz needle with an embedded platinum wire; the samples rest on a grounded conductive surface. When voltage is applied to the system, a charge is induced to the needle by applying a voltage to the platinum wire; this charge is used to attract and release particles and transfer them to custom gold SEM mounts for characterization or to storage wells in quartz slides for allocation and archiving. The NASA Curation Office has reproduced the electromagnetic manipulation system (using needles fabricated at JAXA as part of an ongoing international collaboration between NASA and JAXA curation facilities) and is currently investigating applications for the system for its microscale particle collections.</p><p id="Par105">The tools and methods described here represent only a fraction of the techniques and instrumentation currently utilized and under development for microscale astromaterials sample processing and analysis.

Once samples arrive on Earth, the sample environment and how it will be handled will begin to alter the pristine nature of the sample. As stated before, the term “precision cleaning” simply means cleaning materials to a prescribed level of cleanliness, which is measured and verified. Aerospace, semiconductor, pharmaceutical, and optics industries are historically concerned with precision cleaning. Standards for precision cleaning are widespread across industrial processes through trade organizations like the Institute of Environmental Sciences and Technology (IEST) (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.iest.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.iest.org</ext-link>), ASTM International (formerly American Society for Testing and Materials; <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.astm.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.astm.org</ext-link>), SEMI (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.semi.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.semi.org</ext-link>) and others. Since curatorial precision cleaning does not directly align with a single industry’s cleaning standard, curation precision cleaning procedures and protocols for handling astromaterials are derived from many of these established industry standards. NASA also has its own flight hardware precision cleaning standards and are often different and dependent on program and mission. For the NASA Curation Office, precision cleaning standards were mainly derived from the Apollo program and early cleaning recipes and history have been discussed in Calaway et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par107">Currently, precision cleaning at the NASA Curation Office is divided into three categories: PreClean, Final Clean, and Advanced Clean. PreClean is considered gross cleaning when parts arrive from fabrication/machining and/or procurements from a vendor. Final Clean is typically linked to the use of a final cleaning agent, drying, and packaging of the part. During Final Clean, the hardware cleanliness is also measured and verified to meet a certain standard of cleanliness for use. Advanced Clean is a term used for non-routine avenues of cleaning and/or testing of new cleaning methods and techniques. Advanced cleaning is typically done after a routine PreClean and Final Clean process has been completed. This might include techniques that require advanced particulate removal, organic-free cleaning or sterility. Advanced Clean may also use standard or advanced cleanliness verification processes to assess surface cleanliness using a variety of state-of-the-art instrumentation.</p><p id="Par108">In the NASA Curation Office, PreClean and Final Clean support all collections by cleaning the sample processing tools and containers. However, each collection has its own tools and containers, which are cleaned in entirely separate cleaning sessions. All hardware items are put away with the exception of items from the collection being cleaned. The cleaning tanks are cleaned and refilled before starting a new collection. All of this careful effort is taken to mitigate the potential for cross-contamination between the different astromaterials collections. Before attempting gross cleaning, it is important to understand and verify the cleaning chemical compatibility with the material that is to be cleaned. In addition, complex equipment and tools are routinely disassembled, then cleaned and then reassembled in a cleanroom after the precision cleaning is completed. PreClean typically consists of removing any visible grease, dirt, adhesives, or other marks with the use of polyester wipes saturated with isopropanol alcohol (IPA) (70% IPA and 30% UPW), if compatible with IPA. If IPA wiping does not work or is not compatible with the material, other cleaners that will not contaminate the material will be used to remove the visible dirt (e.g., citrus-based solvents to remove silicones, ammonia-based solutions, hexane, and household dish liquid have been used for initial gross cleaning). In addition, mechanical gross cleaning may also be necessary in conjunction with cleaning chemicals, such as razor blades and scrubbers (e.g., Scotch Brite pads and nylon brushes). After all visible material is gone, PreClean uses a gross degreasing procedure to remove any machining oils and grease from manufacturing. This is done by soaking and sometimes sonicating the part in a degreasing detergent or chemical. Brulin 815GD (at 5 to 30% concentration with UPW) is commonly used for stainless steel, aluminum, and titanium metal parts. Freon 113 replacements are also sometimes used for degreasing; for example Honeywell Solstice Precision Fluid, DuPont Vertrel specialty fluids (e.g., Vertrel XF), or 3M HFE 7100-DL. Dilute nitric acid is also routinely used to remove trace metal contaminants, such as lead, from newly fabricated items. After degreasing, the hardware is then cleaned with a surfactant. Mechanical scrubbing with polyester wipes or soft brushes are used in a surfactant bath and then placed into a sonication bath for 5 to 15 minutes. Afterwards, parts are removed and spray rinsed with UPW and air dried.</p><p id="Par109">Final Cleaning of equipment and tools are typically centered on high purity chemicals or cleaning agents. Final Clean also incorporates a verification step to evaluate the cleanliness of the part and certify the level of cleanliness and qualification for use. From 1966 to 1994, the final cleaning agent at JSC was Freon 113. Established during Apollo, Freon 113 was an excellent degreaser and final cleaning solvent. The United States government environmental policies on ozone depleting chemicals phased out chlorofluorocarbon production from 1992–1995 which forced the NASA Curation Office to change degreasers and final cleaning agent. After an in-depth research process, the final cleaning agent was changed to UPW in 1994 and is used currently (see Sect. <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">2.2.2</xref> for details on current UPW purity and system). Final Clean can sometimes redo surfactant cleaning or use of a pre-degreaser, however, most of the time, parts are rinsed with UPW and placed into a UPW cascade bath and sonicated for 5 to 15 minutes. The UPW is often heated to 40 to <inline-formula id="IEq73"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq73_Math"><mml:mn>70</mml:mn><mml:msup><mml:mspace width="0.25em"/><mml:mo>∘</mml:mo></mml:msup><mml:mtext>C</mml:mtext></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq73_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

GN<sub>2</sub> is also used during the end of sonication to remove particulates out of the bath. Parts are then removed from the bath and thoroughly spray rinsed with UPW. If another high purity chemical is used (such as IPA or a Freon 113 replacement), this would be applied at this stage, then spray rinsed again with UPW and dried by GN<sub>2</sub> (sometimes heated GN<sub>2</sub>) to remove all visible water. During the final rinse, run-off aliquots of UPW may be taken for optical particle counts, liquid particle counts, or TOC analyses. It should be noted that traditional non-volatile residue (NVR) mass balance measurements and black-lights used to be used, however, these methods were eliminated since the Final Clean often showed cleanliness below detection limit of those techniques. The part is then either left to continue to air dry or placed into an oven to remove any more water. After drying, parts are triple bagged in FEP Teflon or nylon bags depending on the collection and its material restrictions. Before bagging, precision cleaning verification often entails an optical inspection of the parts. If parts are shown not to be cleaned to the specified cleanliness standard, parts are sent through the process again.</p><p id="Par110">In the NASA Curation Office, the verification of cleanliness reference standard is frequently IEST-STD-CC1246E, <italic>Product Cleanliness Levels—Applications, Requirements, and Determination</italic> (IEST-STD-CC1246E <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2013</xref>).

More recent techniques have relied on bench-top total organic carbon (TOC) analyzers (as a function of ppb vs. surface area) and more time-consuming analytical instrumentation. This standard is useful because it is frequently cited when cleaning hardware for spaceflight, including sample collection devices on spacecraft. However, new missions are generally citing total organic carbon (TOC) and the TOC is not always transferable to the NVR level.</p><sec id="Sec26"><title>Technical Tensions Among Cleaning for Particulate, Molecular Organics, and Sterility</title><p id="Par111">UPW cleaning to remove inorganic particles is a mature process for curation of astromaterials. However, the expanding diversity of requirements for high level organic cleaning and sterility invokes conflicts among cleaning techniques that need to be managed. Management options for reconciling these tensions requires attention to detail, perhaps a complex handling sequence, or subdivision of samples into separate handling tracks such as organic-cleaned vs. metal-free (e.g. metal vs. plastic handling tools and containers).</p><p id="Par112">A simple model of a cleaning process line (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) starts with pre-cleaning followed by UPW cleaning for particle removal. This particle-cleaned product is suitable for inorganic usage or for further cleaning. The product could be further cleaned to high organic cleanliness or to sterility by separate tracks. Selection of a direct separate track may be most efficient and adequate. Greater cleanliness or sterility might be achieved by cleaning for both low organics and sterility. However, due to conflicts in materials, environment, process chemicals, and packaging for high level organic cleaning and sterility, adaptability for specific situations is required. <fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Basic cleaning process for hardware and tools used in astromaterials curation laboratories.

Traditional methods to achieve organic cleanliness, such as solvent extraction and bake-out, can be augmented by UV-ozone cleaning, plasma cleaning, supercritical fluid cleaning, and CO<sub>2</sub> SNOW cleaning (Mickelson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">2002b</xref>; Calaway et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2009</xref>; King et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2010</xref>; Schmeling et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">2013</xref>; Kuhlman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2013</xref>). Assessment of surface cleanliness has included the use of instrumentation such as SEM, TEM, FT-IR, Raman, XPS, SIMS, AMF, LC-MS, DART-MS, TD-GC-MS, LA-ICP-MS, and VDP-ICP-MS. Protocols to remove adventitious carbon must be followed by surface passivation and extreme control of environment, which includes packaging. Packaging materials must not off-gas organics. Thus, maintaining an organic-clean surface after cleaning is challenging. Traditional heat-sealing will not work for organic samples. For example, the Mars 2020 CK collection has used hermetically-sealing bag clips in-place of traditional heat sealing. Techniques for achieving sterility of containers and tools include standard autoclave, dry heat, UV, hydrogen peroxide vapor and gamma irradiation and electron beam (Allen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1999</xref>; Clark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2004</xref>). NASA JSC is currently constructing an advanced precision cleaning lab to further study some of these techniques for future missions.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Development of New Astromaterials Acquisition Capabilities on Earth</title><p id="Par114">The study of astromaterials in the laboratory allows direct analysis of material arising from the full breadth of the history of our Solar System. The continuing advance of technology has improved not only our technological capacity to make measurements but also our ability to minimize contamination and sample modification during collection of freshly fallen meteorites and cosmic dust. Some of these improvements are related to educating the public on proper methods of handling meteorites, but many of the technological advances have focused on improving our ability to track and find materials. In many cases, these improvements result in reduction of exposure time to uncontrolled conditions, which could reduce terrestrial contamination, especially if clean-collection practices are used during recovery operations. Collection of material has been steadily improved by advances in ground-based and satellite sensors, dissemination of information with the growth of the internet and various social media platforms, and especially by the flow of data through freely available data sources. Although the collection of astromaterials may seem, at first, to be a prerequisite of curation, one of the primary goals of advanced curation is aimed at maximizing the science returns of astromaterials samples, and improvements in sample collection techniques has a direct benefit to science. We are in the midst of an exciting period of growth of truly innovative astromaterials sample collection techniques on Earth, and this section illustrates a current snapshot of a rapidly evolving field.</p><sec id="Sec28"><title>New Astromaterials Collection Capabilities for Cosmic Dust</title><p id="Par115">Since inception in 1981, the NASA Cosmic Dust collection has collected interplanetary dust from Earth’s stratosphere using flat-plate, oil-coated collectors. The oil is a high-viscosity silicone (polydimethylsiloxane, (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>OSi)<sub><italic>n</italic></sub>) that is mechanically stiff at collection altitude and temperature but engulfs and protects collected material on return to room temperature. This oil has a long track record of successful recovery of cosmic dust, and recent tests have shown that even oil used for sampling in 1981 retains its original viscosity properties. This is heartening for long-term storage of cosmic dust, but silicone oil has a significant drawback in that it is a contaminant for important studies such as oxygen isotopes, organic species, and amorphous silicates. The community has expressed a desire for at least a subset of samples collected “dry”, without the contaminating oil.</p><p id="Par116">Foam collectors are a promising means to accomplishing dry collection. A small number of foam collectors have been flown as a test of concept, which yielded a few cosmic dust samples (Messenger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2015</xref>). The results were generally acknowledged as positive, and comments to the NASA CD Curator indicate that the scientific community has a strong interest in additional dry collection. To this end, NASA will fly foam collectors as a subset of future collection flights. Collection in foam appears to be straightforward and Messenger et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2015</xref>) claims that the collection rate is comparable with silicone oil (albeit with a short total collection time for reference), but extraction of collected material from foam is a nontrivial exercise. Foam features relatively deep pits in its surface from which the particles must be extracted. This problem is exacerbated by the observation by Messenger et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2015</xref>) that “20–50%” of individual foam cells were broken when observed post-flight, probably by aerodynamic pressure. In order to test identification and extraction methods, NASA Cosmic Dust personnel fabricated an analog foam collector by adhering a <inline-formula id="IEq76"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq76_Math"><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">/</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mn>8</mml:mn><mml:mo>″</mml:mo></mml:msup></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq76_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Small (&lt;20 mm) particles of Bells CM2 meteorite were transferred from a concavity slide into individual foam cells using a MicroSupport AxisPro micromanipulation system and bent glass needles. <sup>210</sup>Po sources were utilized to minimize triboelectric charging effects. Ten particles were implanted into the experimental foam collector apparatus using this technique. The transfer process was then reversed to remove four of the particles from the collector onto cleaned glass slides. None of the particles were lost due to vibration or triboelectric charging effects. Ultimately, foam may be replaced by a more rigid material, but this awaits future work. For the near term, the use of a computer-controlled micromanipulator shows promise in removing material from foam collectors using standard pulled-glass needles.</p><p id="Par117">In addition to dry foam collectors, NASA Cosmic Dust is conducting a project with undergraduate students at Texas A&amp;M to develop a prototype, high altitude balloon-based dust collection platform. The intent of this new system is to supplement existing aircraft-based collection for two major reasons. One, expanding into a new collection platform adds programmatic depth and resilience to CD collection efforts. Should the existing ER-2 and/or WB-57 aircraft become unavailable (either temporarily or permanently), dust collection will continue with a balloon-based platform. NASA balloon flights also regularly operate from both the northern and southern hemispheres, opening up the possibility of CD flights intended to collect material from cometary debris streams, which preferentially impinge on the southern hemisphere. The second reason is to offer new ways to improve CD “timed collection” efforts (Dermott and Liou <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1994</xref>; Messenger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">2002</xref>). “Timed collection” is collection of material in the stratosphere timed to coincide with the settling time of material sourced from a specific meteor shower and thus with a specific parent body. Collection by aircraft is possible and has been demonstrated (e.g. timed collection of comet Grigg-Skjellerup in 2003 and of comet Giacobini-Zinner in 2012), but significant flight time constraints can impede both the total flight time and timing of “timed collection” attempts. Collection by high-altitude balloons may be more accommodating, as NASA long-duration balloons (LDBs) feature flight times of up to 100 days. Cosmic dust collector(s) could fly on long-duration missions and deploy for collection only during the settling time for material from a specific meteor shower, maximizing collection time at precisely defined intervals to maximize the chances of collecting material from a specific parent body.</p><p id="Par118">A cosmic dust collector prototype for use on high altitude balloons was tested in mid-2019 at the NASA balloon research center in Fort Sumner, NM. The prototype is called Cometary and Asteroidal Research of Dust in Near-space Atmospheric Levels (CARDINAL), a name chosen by the students. CARDINAL uses a swing arm with collectors at each end as a low-power means to move air over the collectors, spinning the arm with a small electric motor. Collector size, rotation size, and swing arm length were chosen to produce an estimated one cosmic dust particle per day per collector. While this collection rate is about 1/48th that of aircraft-based collection, LDB flights last up to over 100 days as opposed to the typical tens-of-hours collection time of aircraft-based collection. The lower airspeed of balloon-based collection may also be advantageous for collection using collectors that are free of silicone oil, or “dry” collection. CARDINAL seals the swing arm within its body to protect the collectors from contamination, and remains sealed at all times below a set altitude. The lid is movable to expose the collectors at high altitude. CARDINAL draws power from the balloon gondola, and both housekeeping and operations data are stored by the onboard microprocessor for post-flight analysis. CARDINAL is self-contained with respect to communications, with all flight functions programmed prior to flight and no communications needed with a ground station or other external controller. Testing at Fort Sumner revealed significant performance shortcomings, which prevented the first test flight. A second design, which draws heavily on lessons learned from CARDINAL, is currently in early development. This design will simplify the collector encapsulation design, reduce weight considerably, and feature its own battery and solar power module that will perform double duty as flight trim ballast. Ultimately, the intent of this project is to collect cosmic dust during precisely defined periods when specific meteor showers are active, to attempt to collect material from known cometary parent bodies. Both oil-based and dry-foam collectors will be used as part of the continuing development of dry-foam cosmic dust collection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>New Astromaterials Collection Capabilities for Meteorites</title><p id="Par119">Meteorite falls represent opportunities for the recovery of samples that have been briefly exposed to the oxidative, organic-, and moisture-rich environment at the Earth’s surface, which is also teeming with life. Substantial contamination of freshly fallen meteorites by such exposure can occur in a matter of days to weeks (Burton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2014</xref>; Hilts et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2014</xref>; Kebukawa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2009</xref>). At the same time, advances in curation and contamination knowledge in support of sample return (e.g., Allen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2011</xref>; Dworkin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2018</xref>; Yada et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR218">2014</xref>) have resulted in the establishment of curation facilities that prevent or mitigate against such contamination (Herd et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2016</xref>). Therefore, the present-day challenge is to reduce the amount of time that meteorite samples spend in the field and apply the best methods for their field collection and laboratory curation and handling. The faster the meteorite is recovered and removed to a curation facility, the more scientifically valuable such a sample will be. Rapid collection of meteorites can be seen as strongly complementary to established efforts to collect meteorites from dry deserts such as the Sahara (Grady <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2000</xref>) and Antarctica (Harvey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2003</xref>). These collection efforts produce the large number of meteorites necessary to routinely produce weathered but unusual types such as martian, lunar, ungrouped achondrites, and many others, while rapid collection of fresh falls produces a relatively small number of unweathered meteorites. The combination of both approaches provides a comprehensive approach to meteorite collection, which facilitates study of a wide range of meteorite types with unweathered examples for studying weathering effects, pristine organics and fragile mineral phases (e.g., Haberle and Garvie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2017</xref>), and as ground truth for quantifying alteration due to terrestrial weathering.</p><p id="Par120">Significant technological advances have been made in recent years that enable more precise observations and more accurate modeling of meteorite falls, and thus the more rapid potential recovery of the meteorites. Advances fall into two main categories: improved observation of meteor/fireball phenomena, and characterization and modeling of meteorites in dark flight.</p><sec id="Sec30"><title>Fireball Detection and Tracking</title><p id="Par121">One of the most important “sample return spacecraft” may be the Earth itself. As our planet orbits the Sun, it collects around 40000 tons of extraterrestrial material each year (Flynn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2004</xref>; Zolensky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR225">2006a</xref>; Zook <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR227">2001</xref>), ranging from microns in size to occasional large meteorites (and less frequent large impactors). This material originates from a wide range of parent bodies and so has the potential to inform us about the status and histories of a great many parent bodies. Historically, efforts such as the Prairie Fireball Network (Wetherill and Revelle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR211">1981</xref>), the Meteorite Recovery and Observation Project (MORP) in Canada (Halliday et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">1978</xref>), the European Fireball Network (Oberst et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">1998</xref>), and others (Bland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2004</xref>; Colas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2015</xref>; Cooke and Moser <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2011</xref>; Gritsevich et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2014</xref>; Hindley and Houlden <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">1977</xref>; Kokhirova and Borovička <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2011</xref>; Shiba et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175">1997</xref>; Sullivan and Klebe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185">2004</xref>; Trigo-Rodriguez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR191">2006</xref>; Watson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR206">2009</xref>; Weryk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR209">2008</xref>; Wiśniewski et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR216">2017</xref>) surveyed meteors using networks of cameras and recovered small numbers of meteorites. Perhaps the most scientifically significant outcome of these efforts was their recovery of meteorites paired with calculations of their original orbits. This allowed something new in meteoritics—laboratory studies of the recovered meteorites were given a precise “home” in the Solar System, at least immediately prior to the meteorites’ fall to Earth. The large number of fireballs observed by these networks and need for accurate fall location calculation encouraged the development of meteor dynamics (e.g., Ceplecha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">1998</xref>) and strewn field modeling. Today, improvements in digital imagery, geographical information systems, computational capability, and the growing power of the internet to quickly collate data submitted by the public, have driven the development of new fireball reporting networks (Venton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR199">2017</xref>). A hallmark of these new networks is their emphasis on including the general public in reporting and other forms of participation (Day et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018a</xref>). Another is regular calculation of fireball orbits, such that today the orbits of more than two dozen meteorite falls are known. The Desert Fireball Network (DFN) has used a network of 52 automated digital camera devices to recover four meteorite falls in the period of 2007–2015 (Bland et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2012</xref>; Sansom et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">2015</xref>). All of the falls are associated with pre-atmosphere orbits, as are a larger number of fireballs that have not yet yielded meteorites. Recent funding from the Australian Research Council expands the Australian-based Desert Fireball Network into a Global Fireball Observatory (GFO), bringing the total area covered by all-sky cameras to over 12 million <inline-formula id="IEq77"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq77_Math"><mml:msup><mml:mtext>km</mml:mtext><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq77_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Many eyewitnesses doubtlessly observed meteorite falls from a distance, but the fragmented nature of eyewitness reports and lack of widespread public understanding inhibited collection of fallen material. With the growth of the internet, however, several organizations have begun collating eyewitness accounts into meaningful bodies of data capable of rapidly constraining the site of potential meteorite falls. The non-profit American Meteor Society (AMS) stood up a webpage with this purpose in 2006, allowing individuals to log meteor sighting reports at no cost to the user (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.amsmeteors.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.amsmeteors.org</ext-link>). The sightings are collated into reports of individual fireballs, and automated calculations, based on sighting azimuths, produce an estimated ground track for each event. Similar websites are operated by the International Meteor Organization (IMO) (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.imo.net" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.imo.net</ext-link>), Fireballs in the Sky in Australia (<ext-link xlink:href="http://fireballsinthesky.com.au" ext-link-type="uri">http://fireballsinthesky.com.au</ext-link>), the UK Meteor Network (<ext-link xlink:href="https://ukmeteornetwork.co.uk" ext-link-type="uri">https://ukmeteornetwork.co.uk</ext-link>), and EXOSS Citizen Science in Brazil (<ext-link xlink:href="https://exoss.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://exoss.org</ext-link>). The AMS, for example, recorded 5473 separate fireballs in 2017 and has produced eyewitness-based reports for meteorite falls to include Park Forest, IL (27 March 2003), Battle Mountain, NV (22 August 2012), Sutter’s Mill, CA (22 April 2012) and others. With the increase in public access to the internet, these organizations have seen significant growth and can rapidly provide public notice of new meteorite falls (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). <fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Top-down composite view of weather radar signatures of falling meteorites.

Signatures here record meteorites from 15.5 km down to 5.0 km altitude, and the altitude range can change for different falls based on the observation geometry of nearby radars.

The upside of this is that data is standardized within a national network and many countries maintain archives of their radar imagery. The downside is that public access to weather radar imagery is scant, with most data available in a short-lived image download format, often in the form of a calculated product such as rainfall rate. The United States has, arguably, led the way in free public dissemination of weather radar imagery, with the nationwide NEXRAD network operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). NEXRAD data are freely available in all formats, from lightly formatted data to compiled images and calculated products (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). All NEXRAD data are available online at no cost and are updated in near real time. NEXRAD data are made available on the internet at such a rapid rate that, for a typical meteorite fall lasting 10–15 minutes, at least one set of radar data showing falling meteorites is available online before all of the meteorites have reached the ground. Finding a meteorite fall in weather radar imagery currently requires manual data processing and analysis, but falls have been identified within hours of the event via weather radar imagery (Jenniskens et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2012</xref>) and the possibility exists for more rapid, automated identification of meteorite falls. <fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Eyewitness accounts of individual meteor events collected by the American Meteor Society (AMS), shown by year.

Two researchers, Drs. Marc Fries and Robert Matson, had been investigating weather radar for this purpose without knowledge of the others’ efforts and independently noted the ability of NEXRAD radars to detect falling meteorites and provide their fall location with great accuracy. Ash Creek was also noted by a National Weather Service office in Dallas, TX, who serendipitously noted the fall in the imagery of the KFWS radar. Ash Creek was a perfect test case in that it was a sizable fall that occurred in otherwise clear skies and stands out clearly in radar imagery. Since then, twenty-four recovered meteorite falls have been identified in NEXRAD imagery from 1997 to the present, with an additional thirteen identified that have not been recovered for various reasons (Fries et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2017</xref>). This is an average of 1.8 meteorite falls found per year, with 1.1 per year recovered in the United States and Canada (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). Falls are identified by a combination of factors. Falls occur at the time and location identified by eyewitnesses, progress from high altitude to low over a period of 10–15 minutes, may include short-range turbulence caused by supersonic meteorites, and progress from moderate to high spectral width (a measure of the range of sizes of reflectors in a given image pixel) to low spectral width as the meteorites size-sort on the way to the ground. By contrast, nearly everything else that appears in weather radar imagery—such as weather, birds, insects, and aircraft—move laterally and do not show the other features listed above.

There are significant obstacles to using weather radar to search for meteorite falls to include (1) some national radar networks choose to limit public access to data, (2) many countries do not archive sufficient data to be useful, and/or (3) some countries use proprietary data formats that are difficult for the public to utilize.

Seismometers are typically operated in networks, and those networks are usually regional or local suites of instruments operated by government entities, universities, or other research facilities. The Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) database collates publicly-available seismometer data into a common format and makes it available online.</p><p id="Par127">Sonic booms from meteorite falls often appear as a pair of peaks in signal intensity graphs, or seismograms (Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>).

Additional sonic booms may arrive afterwards, from individual falling meteorites in dark flight. Such signals are usually less intense than the initial signature.

Most of these have historically been lost, although there have been several meteorite falls wherein significant meteorite masses were recovered by people diving after an observed fall. These include Angra dos Reis (the namesake of the angrite clan of meteorites) (Prinz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">1977</xref>), Peña Blanca Spring where the recovered meteorite landed in a pond in front of a group of ranch hands (Lonsdale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">1947</xref>), the main mass of Björbole which was recovered from icy water in 1899 (Martin and Mills <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">1976</xref>), and the main mass of Chelyabinsk which was recorded on video landing in a lake (Popova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">2013</xref>). These were fortuitous recoveries that all feature relatively shallow water and eyewitness(es) who saw the actual point of entry into the water. Recently, attempts have been made to expand this capability by recovering probable meteorite falls from deeper water using Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) and other modern deep-sea technologies.</p><p id="Par129">The Aquarius Project (Bresky and Fries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2018</xref>) is a student project to recover meteorites from Lake Michigan. On 06 Feb 2017, a bright green fireball accompanied by sonic booms heralded a large meteorite fall into the lake. The fall was observed by four radars in the NEXRAD national weather radar network. The meteorites now lie on the lake floor at a depth of around 100 meters. A consortium of Lake Michigan-area institutions was formed, including the Field Museum of Chicago, the Shedd Aquarium, and the Adler Planetarium with assistance from NASA and NOAA. Teenage students from Chicago public schools have worked with the project and assist in the design and testing of original devices used to collect meteorites from the lake floor. Aquarius Project updates are archived online (<ext-link xlink:href="https://openexplorer.nationalgeographic.com/expedition/rovmeteoritehunt" ext-link-type="uri">https://openexplorer.nationalgeographic.com/expedition/rovmeteoritehunt</ext-link>). In July of 2018, the students deployed their equipment to attempt to recover meteorites from the lake bed, recovering small rocks and sediment. This material is currently under examination by Aquarius Project institutions, and additional trips to collect material are planned for 2019.</p><p id="Par130">Another attempt to retrieve meteorite material from an observed fall occurred in early July 2018, targeting a very large meteorite fall that occurred in the Pacific Ocean on 07 March 2018 about 20 km off of the coast of Washington state. Calculations of total meteorite mass based on radar reflectivity indicate that this fall was the most massive fall seen to date by the NEXRAD system since its inception in the mid-1990’s. More importantly, the distribution of meteorite mass is unlike any of the two dozen recovered meteorite falls recorded by NEXRAD. The Washington coast fall features significantly more large, surviving meteorites proportional to smaller size fractions than previous events. This implies a stronger than typical mechanical toughness for this fall, which may in turn come from a slow infall velocity or a meteorite type that is inherently stronger than typical ordinary chondrites. The fall itself occurred during region-wide cloud cover and so was not observed directly, although at least two videos record bright flashes through the clouds. It is scientifically important to understand the reason why this fall produced an atypically large number of large meteorites, both as a planetary defense issue and to allow identification of future meteorite falls of the same type from radar data. For these reasons, a one-day effort was mounted by the Ocean Exploration Trust (OET) exploration vessel E/V <italic>Nautilus</italic> to map the fall site with multibeam sonar and attempt retrieval of meteorite material sufficient to identify the meteorite type. Sonar revealed that the ∼100 m-deep seafloor was flat and featureless. The ROV pair Argus and Hercules performed a seafloor examination/sampling transect along a ∼1.6 km track, collecting one sample with a magnetic rake, five more with a water-jet sediment sampler and one with a scoop. These samples were examined by optical microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and electron beam analysis at NASA JSC. In June 2019, a follow-on team returned to the site aboard the research vessel R/V Falkor, operated by the Schmidt Ocean Institute (SOI).

Over the course of three continuous days of ROV operations, an SOI-developed pair of sediment samplers sifted a large volume of ocean floor sediment but did not recover cm-sized meteorites. A suite of sediment samples was collected, washed, sieved, and searched in a manner identical to the Nautilus samples, in an iterative search for progressively smaller meteorite fragments. This effort was ultimately successful in the size fractions below ∼ 2 mm in diameter. At the time of this writing, over 100 small melt spherules and other fragments have been recovered from a combination of the Nautilus and Falkor samples. Work continues on this project to identify any meteorite type(s) among the spherules and whether they can be definitively linked to the fall event on March 07, 2019.</p><p id="Par131">The public outreach aspect of this effort was a dramatic success, with a large global audience watching in real time via the OET webpage as the Argus and Hercules scanned the seafloor and collected samples. Through the course of eight hours with the ROVs on the seafloor, the crew took questions and narrated the effort for a pan-global audience. Overall, both the Aquarius Project and the Washington coast fall recovery show that modern oceanographic surveying and sampling techniques have made water-borne recovery of meteorite falls a real possibility. These pioneering efforts are yielding a first trip up the learning curve towards optimizing the techniques needed, and have set up a powerful new means of engaging students and the public for meteorite research and recovery.

These satellites provide weather imagery services for most of the United States and parts of contiguous countries. For the first time, the GOES-16/17 satellites feature a lightning mapper instrument—the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM). GLM “stares” at a large ground footprint area, collecting imagery at a rate of up to 500 frames/second. The instrument features sufficient dynamic range to detect lightning during local daytime on the ground, and can discern altitude sufficiently to differentiate cloud-to-ground from cloud-to-cloud lightning. Inadvertently, NOAA built a superb meteorite fall detector with the GLM sensors. While visible and IR-wavelength weather satellite imagery can detect meteorite falls (e.g. Almahata Sitta as described in Borovička and Charvát <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2009</xref> and Chelyabinsk as seen by ESA’s Meteosat-9 and reported in Miller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">2013</xref>), considerable luck is required because the image collection rate is very low. Previous GOES satellites, for example, only collected images once every few minutes and a meteor would have to happen exactly at the moment when the camera was operating to be recorded. GLM’s rapid imaging and sensitivity to bright flashes renders it a very capable meteor detector, as described recently (Jenniskens et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2018</xref>). Jenniskens et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2018</xref>) describe ten separate bolides detected by GLM to include one meteorite fall (British Columbia, Canada, 05 Sep 2017) and has since detected another (Hamburg, MI, 16 Jan 2018). GLM provides location, fireball luminosity, timing, and light curve data for bolides. Presently, both of NOAA’s new GOES satellites are in place (GOES-16 and GOES-17) and their GLM sensors are operating and data is available online (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.class.noaa.gov" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.class.noaa.gov</ext-link>). The two satellites cover the continental United States from locations near the east and west coasts, which may allow stereo observation of some meteorite falls (Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>). This feature may be used to rapidly identify bolides among the lightning flashes that GLM is intended to monitor. Lightning usually occurs below 15 km altitude (e.g., Mecikalski and Carey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">2018</xref>) while meteors produce optically bright signatures between ∼20–90 km (Ceplecha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">1998</xref>). Stereo observation of bolides from the two satellites should yield rapid calculations of the altitude of various events, and finding bolides would be a matter of identifying bright flashes that occur at higher altitudes than that of lightning. The possibility exists that streaming GLM data can be used to identify the location, timing, and potential for producing meteorites from bolides in near real-time. <fig id="Fig12"><label>Fig. 12</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>NOAA graphic indicating the overlapping imaging footprints of GLM sensors on the two GOES satellites, one located off of the US east coast and another off of the west coast.

Historically, even though meteorite falls are far outnumbered by meteorite finds, the light terrestrial alteration inherent in recent falls makes them highly scientifically valuable. Regular and rapid collection of freshly fallen meteorites is possible to an extent that a new possibility exists—dedicated recovery of freshly fallen meteorites by a dedicated recovery team. The nature of such a team can take many forms, to include enlisting the assistance of the general public. This approach takes advantage of the spirit of public inclusivity, which created such endeavors as the American Meteor Society’s eyewitness reporting program and is a powerful opportunity for outreach. A nationwide program could stand up to mobilize meteorite falls as they are detected, using eyewitness accounts and GLM to identify a new meteorite fall, seismic and radar data to calculate the strewn field, and astromaterials experts encouraging and guiding meteorite recovery at the fall site. Impromptu public lectures and media contact shortly after a meteorite fall have a history of enthusiastic reception from the public and tend to promote recovery of meteorites. The possibility exists that a dedicated collection(s) of freshly fallen meteorites could be founded and sustained in this way.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Importance of Contamination Knowledge Strategies for Sample Return Missions to Maximize Science Returns from Samples</title><p id="Par134">The scientific value of the returned samples for all previous sample return missions have benefitted from having an archive of contamination knowledge (CK) materials that could include (1) spacecraft hardware, spares, and flight-like coupons, (2) materials used in the fabrication of spacecraft hardware or construction of a curation lab, and (3) witness materials deployed during ATLO or during construction of the curation lab. The information gained from studying the collected reference materials and witness plates is defined as the CK of a sample collection, and the CK is crucial for verifying and validating scientific results. As part of a sample return mission, these CK samples are archived along with the returned samples and the CK samples are made available for allocation and analysis by the scientific stakeholders of a sample collection. These flown, flight-like, and non-flight reference materials and witness plates provide the scientific community investigating astromaterials with the fundamental ability to reconstruct the contamination history of a sample collection. Furthermore, they serve as a baseline from which to compare tantalizing results attained from the analysis of astromaterials. CK collections are a requirement for sample return missions because contamination control efforts cannot anticipate all possible contamination vectors that can occur during the dynamic activity that is a sample return mission. In fact, all sample return missions have developed non-nominal contamination to some degree, which are highlighted in this section as important lessons learned. In every case, the CK samples have helped to mitigate these unplanned contamination events, improving and, in some cases, enabling scientific returns on the returned astromaterials. The NASA Curation Office has allocated hundreds of samples to scientists in support of gaining contamination knowledge for their respective collections (mainly Apollo, Genesis, and Stardust, and a newly constructed OSIRIS-REx collection). We outline the CK methodology and lessons learned for many completed and ongoing sample return missions and provide insights into best practices for collecting CK when biological contamination from indigenous or exogenous extant life is a possibility.</p><sec id="Sec38"><title>Apollo Program</title><p id="Par135">For Apollo, contamination knowledge has a broader definition and overlaps with contamination control, compared with recent sample return missions, principally because Apollo was a series of missions in which in-lab monitoring of returned samples and hardware resulted in improvements for subsequent missions. Here we cite a 1965 formal report wherein three scientific discipline groups made early recommendations concerning sample collecting materials and procedures relevant to contamination. This is followed by examples of organic and inorganic contamination of samples being measured, by both curatorial staff and by researchers using samples, which resulted in improvements both to lunar surface sampling procedures and hardware and curation handling practices. Thus, contamination knowledge is an ongoing process for returned sample collections.</p><p id="Par136">Early advice on contamination issues was captured through 3 of the 7 discipline working groups convened in 1965 for the purpose of advising NASA on science for a 10-year period (NASA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">1965</xref>). Geochemistry, Bioscience, and Geology Group reports were most concerned with contamination knowledge. For example, top level equipment requirements included: (1) “Sample containers should keep samples sterile and chemically clean. Stainless steel is acceptable. More studies should be completed relative to the use of Teflon in the lunar environment.” It was the Geochemistry Group that emphasized the value of sample analysis and foresaw many of the curation guidelines that are still followed today. The report calls for CK studies to determine the amounts and effects of outgassing of the astronaut suits, the escape of atmosphere from the Lunar Excursion Module (LEM), analyses of possible contaminants in LEM fuel and effects of those contaminants on samples. The Geochemistry Group specified acceptable materials to touch the samples (materials that would not interfere with scientific measurements). In general, this meant use of materials of known and simple chemistry, easily distinguishable from lunar material.</p><sec id="Sec39"><title>Apollo Organic Contamination Knowledge</title><p id="Par137">Apollo organic contamination monitoring conducted in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory (LRL) offers an opportunity to compare the monitoring effort on sample handling equipment to the actual detection of organic compounds in lunar samples by investigators. Apollo planners conducted extensive organic contamination monitoring of the containers, tools, and sample handling facilities. Simoneit et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178">1973</xref>) summarized the potential sources of organic contamination: (1) surface contamination of the lunar-bound rock box and its contents; (2) surface contamination on the Apollo lunar hand tools used to obtain samples on the lunar surface; (3) exhaust products from the lunar descent engine and reaction control system engines (both using unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine and nitrogen tetraoxide); (4) lunar module outgassing; (5) astronaut spacesuit leakage; (6) particulate material abraded from spacesuits or other sources during EVA; (7) venting of lunar module fuel and oxidizer tanks, cabin, and waste systems; (8) venting of spacesuit life support back packs; (9) exposure to LRL vacuum or nitrogen processing chambers; (10) surface contamination of sample processing tools and containers; (11) surface contamination of containers sent to PIs. Items 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, and 11 were considered most serious. Simulations, modeling, and engineering data were used to estimate the contamination contributed by flight items 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 (Aronowitz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1966a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1966b</xref>). Virtually all rocket exhaust products were low molecular weight and rapidly diffused over large areas. Because of their low concentration, this was not predicted to be a major contaminant. The varied organic products included acetylene, HCN, ethylene, formaldehyde, methyl amines, and others.</p><p id="Par138">For laboratory handling operations, measurements of contamination via “monitors” or witness plates were used. Clean coupons of a woven aluminum alloy called York mesh (2024 aluminum alloy) or aluminum foil were processed along with the lunar-bound tools or placed inside the rock boxes bound for the Moon. Upon return, these coupons were analyzed by solvent extraction and subsequent gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Aliquots of clean Ottawa sand, exposed inside sample processing cabinets, were analyzed by direct pyrolysis and mass spectrometry. The solvent rinsings from tool, container, and cabinet cleaning were also analyzed. Some of the most frequently encountered contaminants were hydrocarbons from pump oils and fatty acids. Detected in the vacuum chamber, some of the fatty acids were thought to be from the polishing compound used on the rock boxes. Dioctylphthalate, a common plasticizer additive for polyethylene, was ubiquitous in cabinets and bags.

The presence of diamond and polishing compounds on the surfaces of Apollo thin sections have also been documented by Raman spectroscopy, and these contaminants are likely a common result of the thin-section making process (e.g., Steele et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">2010</xref>).</p><p id="Par141">Keeping samples organically clean in the LRL proved difficult. Thus, a small facility to analyze and repackage a lunar sample collected in a special container was constructed at the University of California, Berkeley (Burlingame et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1971</xref>). The organically clean area consisted of two gloveboxes in tandem preceded by a vacuum entry chamber. The atmospheric nitrogen gas was scrubbed to remove oxygen, water, and organics. The glovebox was equipped with a liquid nitrogen cold finger to remove water generated by the glove operator.</p><p id="Par142">In summary, Apollo organic contaminants were greatly reduced by institution of (1) restrictions on materials allowed contact with, or proximity to samples; (2) isolation of samples in controlled environments; (3) procedures to clean all surfaces in proximity to or contact with samples; and (4) controls on fabrication, processing, and handling of lunar sample hardware.</p></sec><sec id="Sec40"><title>Inorganic Contamination Knowledge</title><p id="Par143">As is the case with organic contaminants, feedback from investigators on inorganic contaminants was essential in improvement. Some materials were selected for use as lubricants or seals because those materials were not predicted to interfere with scientific measurements. Thus, it made engineering sense to use an alloy of 90% indium and 10% silver for the metal knife-edge seal on the Apollo rock boxes. It made engineering sense to use molybdenum disulfide as thread lubricant in curation sample containers. However, these materials were not of sufficient purity for high precision scientific research. Only a few unopened lunar samples remain in indium-silver sealed containers. The use of MoS<sub>2</sub> was discontinued and all containers removed from service. Molybdenum disulfide was replaced with a Teflon thread lubricant Xylan. However, Xylan was not pure Teflon and contained a binding agent, so Xylan was also removed.</p><p id="Par144">Attention to detail is required and compromises made, especially for the fabrication processes, and this is illustrated by engineering selection of surface treatments for the Apollo drive tube cores and drill cores. The materials used for fabrication of the large diameter Apollo drive tubes, anodized aluminum, and the drill core tubes, canadized (a proprietary passivation technique) titanium were selected for engineering reasons. A list of materials would not normally raise contamination flags, unless the reviewer understood the details of the process (and in many cases an engineering requirement might be the best solution anyway). Lead content in amounts compromising science results was found in the anodized aluminum and in the canadized titanium by investigators making extremely low level measurements. The solution in the drive tube case was to physically remove the outer 1 mm of regolith during core dissection, before sample allocation.</p><p id="Par145">One excellent example of institutionalized CK in Apollo sample curation was the construction, completed in 1979, of Building 31N at JSC to house the Apollo lunar collection. The entire design and construction was reviewed in real time by a facility subcommittee of the Lunar and Planetary Sample Team. The committee, comprised of planetary petrologists and geochemists—users of the lunar samples for research—requested chemical analysis for most of the material selections and reviewed the data in detail. Examples are chemistry of paint, floor coverings, adhesives, electrical cords, etc.</p></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>Ongoing Contamination Knowledge Efforts</title><p id="Par146">Collection of CK for the Apollo curation lab continued after construction of the lab and continues to this day. This process is often a joint effort between curation personnel and members of the scientific community that develop in response to interesting, novel, or unexpected results stemming from scientific analysis of the samples. We provide here two notable examples of successful collaboration between curation personnel and the scientific community to better understand the contamination environment within curation facilities at NASA JSC. As mentioned above, Xylan was used on screw threads in the Apollo processing cabinets, tools, and containers to prevent galling. Over time, however, it became evident that the Xylan did not adhere well to the screws because it was flaking off into the processing cabinets and hence served as a potential source of contamination to the Apollo and Antarctic Meteorite samples (Xylan has 45 wt.% C and 4 wt.% N, and it is not removed by step combustion until samples are heated above <inline-formula id="IEq91"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq91_Math"><mml:mn>600</mml:mn><mml:msup><mml:mspace width="0.25em"/><mml:mo>∘</mml:mo></mml:msup><mml:mtext>C</mml:mtext></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq91_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

In response to the characterization of Xylan as a potential contaminant that could affect the analysis of H, C, N, and O in astromaterials samples, Xylan was banned from use in any of the curatorial sample-handling hardware at NASA JSC. More recently, a concern was raised that the stainless steel tools used during the processing of Apollo samples may contribute highly siderophile elements (HSE) to the processed samples (Papanastassiou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">2015</xref>; Tikoo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR188">2014</xref>), given the low abundances of HSE that occur naturally in lunar samples (Walker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR205">2004</xref>). Consequently, the stainless steel tools and sample containers used in the Apollo curation labs were subsampled and analyzed to determine a contamination threshold that would affect HSE analyses of Apollo samples (Day et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2018b</xref>). Day et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2018b</xref>) reported that the potential for HSE contamination from the stainless steel containers and tools was low.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec42"><title>Genesis</title><p id="Par147">Genesis was the first sample return mission since the Apollo program and ended a 32 year hiatus for sample return missions. The Genesis mission launched on August 8, 2001 and traveled to the Earth-Sun Lagrange 1 (L1) point. The Genesis spacecraft was held in halo orbit at L1 outside Earth’s magnetosphere for 2.3 years, and the mission collected solar wind plasma that was implanted into several arrays of high purity materials and subsequently returned to Earth for analysis. Unfortunately, due to an inversion design mistake of the sample return capsule’s (SRC) drogue parachute gravity switch, the SRC experienced a terminal velocity hard landing at the Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR) on September 8, 2004. The impact into the lacustrine sediment breached the science canister and littered thousands of broken high purity collectors throughout the science canister and SRC. Despite this set-back, curation contingency plans were invoked and after much effort decontaminating samples at UTTR and JSC’s curation laboratory, all primary science mission goals were achieved and Genesis is marked as a successful mission. The ability of Genesis to rise from the ashes was in-part due to the fact that at mission inception, the mission had a well-orchestrated CK plan that led to a remarkable CK collection.</p><p id="Par148">Contamination knowledge for Genesis solar wind sample return is captured in archived reference materials and associated documentation of six types, from pre-launch to post landing events: (a) flight-like collector substrates; (b) science canister duplicate components; (c) assembly environment material coupons and process witness plates; (d) post-landing UTTR soil samples; (e) post-landing science canister and sample return capsule hardware; (f) recovery processing tools and containers.

Much effort was expended by the science team in verifying purity and surface cleanliness of candidate batches of collector substrates. Fifteen types of ultra-pure materials were flown as collector substrates. Three hundred passive collectors, mounted in 5 arrays, individually consisted of single crystal silicon (FZ and CZ), sapphire, germanium, and sapphire coated with aluminum, silicon, diamond-like-carbon, or gold. Targets in a concentrator for O, N, and C were comprised of silicon carbide, isotopically enriched polycrystalline diamond and diamond-like-carbon coated on silicon. Additionally, special collectors of metallic glass, gold foil, polished aluminum alloy and molybdenum coated foils were deployed (Jurewicz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2003</xref>). The diversity of the collector materials on these arrays not only provided multiple analytical background choices for optimum specific analyses, but also multiple material choices for the various surface cleaning processes that the hard landing subsequently required. The samples archived for CK served as reference pieces for purity and surface cleanliness or may have been implanted to make calibration pieces during analysis. These materials were also widely used to test surface cleaning protocols before cleaning Genesis-flown samples. It was evident in some cases of solvent application that reactivity of Genesis-flown pieces was different than non-flight reference pieces, presumably due to solar irradiation. To date, allocations of 600 Genesis-flown samples were accompanied by allocations of 300 collector reference materials. The base inventory supporting these allocations is 5000 Genesis-flown collector samples and 2000 non-flown collector reference substrates.</p></sec><sec id="Sec44"><title>Science Canister Duplicate Components</title><p id="Par150">The canister containing the payload of samples for return was cleaned using ultrapure water (<inline-formula id="IEq98"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq98_Math"><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>18</mml:mn></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq98_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Fifty-seven science and technology experiments from nine countries flew on the satellite. The original plan called for the LDEF to be retrieved in March 1985, but because of the destruction of Challenger (the only shuttle with a sufficiently large cargo bay to accommodate LDEF) it was eventually returned to Earth by the newly built <italic>Columbia</italic> in January 1990. LDEF was an early test bed for ideas on micrometeoroid capture. It was carefully placed in orbit and gravity stabilized such that its orientation relative to Earth remained constant. Thus, the trailing side of the satellite would capture micrometeoroids but no space debris and see no secondary impacts from satellite surfaces—completely eliminating the most significant sources of contamination to captured astromaterials. No subsequent spacecraft has repeated this feat.</p><p id="Par156">Unfortunately, shortly after recovery into the still open Columbia cargo bay the shuttle began to rotate end over end, destroying many experiments and causing severe sample contamination. NASA Mission Control chose not to waken the sleeping astronauts and halt the rotations, despite pleas from the LDEF science team. Thus, recovery of LDEF by the Space Shuttle was non-nominal, resulting in contamination and thereby degrading many mission goals. An important lesson is to carefully consider the possible deleterious consequences of using an astronaut crewed platform for sample recovery operations.</p><p id="Par157">Despite these problems, the LDEF mission was successful in guiding scientists to the design of the capture media for the subsequent Stardust Mission. However, one LDEF lesson was not properly learned.

Thus, it came as a surprise when relatively intact cometary organics were recovered from a few captured coma grains. Had we known this was possible, we would have undoubtedly made greater efforts to fly organically-clean aerogel.</p><p id="Par160">It is now clear that some fraction of the impacting comet Wild 2 coma particles survived with little or no alteration, while other portions of the samples were severely heated (Brownlee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2006</xref>; Elsila et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2009</xref>; Sandford et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">2010</xref>; Zolensky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR226">2006b</xref>). Conversion of carbon original to the aerogel, and in the impacting cometary particles, into new forms likely occurred in a similarly variable manner. Thus, before one can assign organics seen in Stardust samples to a cometary origin, it is necessary to consider the possibility that they are either altered cometary materials or materials formed from carbon original to the aerogel. IR absorption difference-maps of individual tracks suggest that impacting Stardust particles do not convert the majority of the original carbon in the aerogel tiles into new chemical forms that remain in the aerogel. However, laser ablation, laser ionization mass spectrometry (L<sup>2</sup>MS) studies demonstrate that at least a small amount of the original aliphatic carbon in the aerogel is converted into aromatic materials in the form of lightweight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Thus, while most of the original aerogel carbon appears to be unaffected by the impact process, the issue of the possible presence of impact converted organics must be considered on a case-by-case basis whenever specific organics are being sought in Stardust aerogel samples.</p><p id="Par161">Additional contaminants found their way into the aerogel during flight. These include materials outgassed from nearby spacecraft components, propellant byproducts, and secondary materials from dust impacts on other parts of the spacecraft, particularly the Whipple shields and solar panels. Cometary particles impacted on the aerogel tiles in the collector tray perpendicular to the forward direction. Thus, any tracks seen with oblique orientations must be either due to strikes by random interplanetary dust particles or to secondary materials from impacts on other parts of the spacecraft. Oblique tracks have, in fact, been found in the flight aerogel tiles, most of which fall in non-random spatial distributions on the cometary collector (Westphal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR210">2008</xref>). The materials in these tracks could include components from both the original impactor and from the spacecraft. Many of these tracks originated from a grazing impact on the central Whipple shield of the spacecraft as the origin of clustered low-angle oblique tracks. In these tracks, the most likely contaminant would be the Mylar thermal protection material that wrapped the edge of the Whipple shields. A second population of high-angle oblique tracks unambiguously originate from a non-cometary impact on the spacecraft bus just forward of the collector. The exact location of this strike on the spacecraft bus is not known, but possible contaminants include materials used for the sides of the spacecraft bus—highly ordered graphite embedded in an epoxy matrix.</p><p id="Par162">In summary, it is clear that the Stardust cometary collector tray was struck by a limited number of secondary particles resulting from impacts on other parts of the spacecraft. Materials in these oblique tracks should be viewed with considerable caution before interpreting their significance as possible cometary materials. Fortunately, the most likely contaminants, Mylar wrap on the Whipple shields and carbon composites from the body of the spacecraft, have distinctive C X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (XANES) that make them relatively easy to recognize. At present, there is no evidence that this process has introduced contamination outside the domain of the oblique tracks themselves.</p></sec><sec id="Sec52"><title>Contamination During Flight</title><p id="Par163">It is possible that contaminants could have been introduced to the Stardust sampling trays directly from the spacecraft during its nearly 7-year flight. This is of special concern for the aerogel collectors since aerogel, with its very large surface area to mass ratio, is an excellent ‘sponge’ for adsorbing contaminants. To assess the extent of on-flight contamination, several ‘witness coupons’ were enclosed in the Stardust SRC (Tsou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR192">2003</xref>). These coupons included 1 cm diameter disks of aluminum and sapphire, and one ‘interstellar’ aerogel tile (2 cm wide × 4 cm long × 1 cm deep). These coupons were located on the arm that deployed the aerogel collector array and were placed low enough that they resided in the shadow of the main Whipple shield. Thus, these coupons were exposed to the same flight environment as the aerogel collectors for the entire mission, but were never directly exposed to the cometary influx.</p><p id="Par164">Examination of the aerogel witness coupon showed no visible signs of adhering materials or stains. Although we know that silicone-based adhesives and lubricants outgassed during the mission (famously coating the cold camera optic surface), none of the exposed surfaces in the Stardust sample return canister showed any signs of the ‘brown stain’ seen on many of the surfaces of the LDEF (Fred Hörz, personal communication, 1990) and Genesis hardware (Burnett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2013</xref>). Analyses of the aerogel witness coupon (i.e., aerogel that was exposed to all environmental conditions as the collector aerogel except the comet) shows similarities to collector aerogel, although the levels of contaminants, when detected, are generally lower and some components (for example, the carrier of the 1700 cm-1 IR C=O feature) are dramatically less abundant. This suggests that contamination associated with the operational environment of the spacecraft during flight was not a major source of sample contamination.</p></sec><sec id="Sec53"><title>Contamination from SRC Recovery and Curation Operations</title><p id="Par165">The accumulation of local soils (mud) from the recovery site was a major issue of concern for the Stardust Science Team prior to recovery of the SRC. Fortunately, integrity of the SRC during landing, the relative inability of the mud at the recovery site to stick to the SRC, and the fact that none of the bouncing impacts occurred at the locations of the two backshell vents greatly decreased the magnitude of this concern. Thus far, there is no indication that soils from the recovery site infiltrated the sample canister or in any way contaminated the returned samples. However, an unfortunate decision was made to place the recovered SRC into a polypropylene bag during the brief helicopter transport from the landing site to a hangar for preliminary deintegration operations. Subsequent detailed analysis revealed that the aerogel soaked up outgassed organics from this bag, providing an additional source of organic contamination to the comet coma grains (Hope Ishii, personal communication, 2007). One important lesson learned from the stardust mission is that recovery operations for the SRC significantly suffered from the lack of a hermetic seal for the samples, probably in many additional ways that will only become apparent in the future. Mission engineers should be pushed to provide truly hermetic seals for future returned samples. Contamination from curatorial operations has been carefully mitigated, although there is some evidence that the Stardust Interstellar aerogel has collected some contamination during handling in various labs during analyses (Bechtel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2011</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec54"><title>Hayabusa Mission</title><p id="Par166">The curation and contamination knowledge of the samples recovered from asteroid Itokawa by the Hayabusa mission (2004–2010) are very well described by Yada et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR218">2014</xref>). In order to limit contamination to the recovered samples, the constituents of the Hayabusa sampler were limited to A6061 aluminum alloy coated with pure aluminum, stainless steel (304), Viton, aluminum oxide glass, and Teflon. Before launch, every part of the sample container was cleaned in 2-propanol using an ultrasonic cleaner, installed in an ISO Class 7 cleanroom. A contamination coupon made of aluminum oxide glass was installed inside the sample catcher to monitor contamination during the mission. In order to minimize ground contamination following Earth return, the sample container was designed to seal the samples, though the mission budget did not permit a hermetic seal. However, terrestrial atmosphere permeating through the double O-rings seal was estimated to be &lt;1 Pa.

These have vertical air flow from the ceiling into a raised, perforated stainless steel floor. All filters used in fan filter units are polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and an additional chemical filter absorbs acid gases such as halogen, sulfate, nitrate, elemental boron, and borate.

The chambers operate at positive pressure to exclude ambient air. Chamber 1, where the Hayabusa capsule was initially opened, can be operated at conditions of ultrahigh vacuum or purified nitrogen. Residual gas expanding into the chamber from the container was collected in bottles made of stainless steel. The lower part of the sample container was maintained in cabinet No. 1 under a vacuum. Chamber No. 1 was also equipped with Viton gloves through gate valves permitting the sample container and catcher to be manipulated with special tools.</p><p id="Par170">After opening, the sample catcher was sent to chamber 2 (in nitrogen) for the extraction of captured Itokawa grains. Both chambers 1 and 2 contain ultraviolet (UV) neutralization lamps to compensate electrostatic charge, which should occur in the pure nitrogen condition. Also, an alpha-ray neutralizer containing a grain of <sup>210</sup>Po is employed for the same purpose—use of this neutralizer was pioneered in NASA’s Stardust and Cosmic Dust Labs. The clean chambers were constructed using stainless steel (304 and 316), aluminum, and A6061 aluminum alloy, quartz glass, PTFE, and Viton. Gold and copper are used for materials in Itokawa grain sample holders, borosilicate glass for containers of less important items, and polyetheretherketone (PEEK) for electric connectors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec56"><title>Measurement of Gas in the Capture Cell upon Initial Opening</title><p id="Par171">Residual gas sampling bottles connected to clean chamber 1 were prepared to capture gas released from the container at the time of its initial opening (on June 23, 2010, 13 days after capsule recovery).

The inner pressure of the sample container was much higher than expected. Possible causes are a small leak of air through the double Viton O-rings seal, larger-than-expected permeability of the Viton O-rings, or a temporary leak of air accidentally happening during deintegration of the sample return capsule.</p></sec><sec id="Sec57"><title>Sample Removal from the Container</title><p id="Par173">On 24 June, 2010, the sample container was transferred to the transportation chamber from clean chamber 1 and the inner lid and the sample catcher were set into a catcher handling container. The inner lid, which was connected to the cover of sample catcher room A (there was also a room B), was removed, and its inner surface was observed and photographed. The catcher was placed into the catcher handling container, and these were transferred to clean chamber 2. The inner surface of catcher room A was observed in detail by optical microscopy, and very few particles larger than a few hundred micrometers were observed inside room A.</p><p id="Par174">Initial attempts to remove Itokawa grains from the aluminum sample catcher were unsuccessful. Without exception, every suspected grain proved to be a small piece of protruding Al metal. Next, a special PTFE spatula was used to sweep the interior surface of catcher room A. Observation of the spatula in the FESEM showed the presence of hundreds of rocky particles 1–30 μm in size, half of which proved to be Itokawa regolith grains (based on EDX spectra, Nakamura et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">2011</xref>). Finally, the inverted sample catcher rooms A and B were tapped with a screw driver, causing a rain of Itokawa and Al grains to fall onto specially-prepared quartz glass disks. The particles were moved from the quartz disks to copper SEM mounts for examination by FESEM-EDS at low kV and no conductive coating. It was thought that particles analyzed by FESEM might be contaminated by vacuum pump hydrocarbons. However, Naraoka et al.

The samples analyzed for the mainstream of initial analyses, including synchrotron X-ray computed tomography and diffraction, FESEM and FE electron microprobe analysis, and a secondary ion mass spectrometry were embedded in epoxy resin and mounted onto glass fibers. They were transported within a stainless steel container filled with nitrogen. Samples for transmission electron microscopy were mounted in epoxy resin in a special nitrogen glovebox and transported within the same containers. In this case, they were processed without exposure to air. Samples for noble gas analyses were set in holes in a stainless steel base in a special flange of stainless steel, which had been baked beforehand to decrease contamination. This process was performed in nitrogen. Samples for organic analyses and instrumental neutron activation analysis were set in holes in a diamond plate with a diamond cover. Each investigation required special sample handling and encapsulation procedures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec58"><title>NASA’s Hayabusa Curation Laboratory</title><p id="Par176">Ultimately, 10% of the captured Itokawa grains will be transferred to NASA, and curated in the Hayabusa Curation Laboratory at JSC, although at the time of this writing less than 100 grains have been transferred to NASA’s care.

All parts of the containers are separately cleaned by JAXA. The samples are placed into the quartz dimple slides using an electrostatically-controlled micromanipulator in clean chamber 2 at JAXA. The flanges are sealed with six screw bolts and oxygen-free copper gasket coated by gold. The sealing was also performed in the clean chamber, so the inside of the container was filled with atmospheric pressure nitrogen in the clean chamber. Only three materials are used for these sample containers: synthetic quartz, gold, and stainless steel. The NASA Hayabusa Cleanroom is a single room, containing at its core a stainless steel and glass cabinet for sample storage. No special sample handling is performed in this lab, as of now.

The planning for CC/CK involved identification of restricted materials and assessment of hydrazine contamination (from monoprop thrusters), ATLO cleanroom and payload faring monitoring, coupon and material archiving, flight system witness plates, and sample container air filter system. All of these activities and categories have led to a detailed understanding of potential contaminants for the collected sample.</p><sec id="Sec60"><title>Materials Restrictions</title><p id="Par178">The OSIRIS-REx team was already aware of several specific and classes of compounds that would need to be avoided or restricted due to contamination concerns such as nylon and organic polymers (e.g., silicones, lubricants, adhesives). However, through open communication channels with engineers, additional materials or components were identified in advance, allowing ample time for identification of substitutes. For example, one process required diamond abrasives while another used a coating that included amorphous silica; both nanodiamonds and amorphous silica may also be present in primitive asteroid materials. The diamond-abraded surface was cleaned and verified diamond-free at JSC via FTIR, and the silica-containing material was removed. Galling (i.e., wear resulting from adhesion between sliding surfaces) is a frequent problem in spacecraft assembly and can be mitigated using various lubricants. This unavoidable use of lubricants is an example where material archiving can be helpful, and indeed the Braycote lubricant was archived for every use on the spacecraft during ATLO. Open communication between the subdiscipline engineers also led to the chemical investigation of products whose chemical makeups were unclear and/or proprietary. Analyses at GSFC and JSC allowed materials of concern to be tested in more detail, including couplants and adhesives, in several cases helping to identify replacement products (Dworkin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2018</xref>).

In addition to the witness plates, the sample canister has a two-way air filter in its lid which protects the sample from external contaminants, but the lid can also trap any volatile or particulate material from leaving the canister after TAGSAM is stowed. The filter performance was tested for moisture, particulate, and organic trapping efficiency during pre-launch activities and also drew heavily on similar filters used for the Stardust mission.</p><p id="Par183">Additional contamination knowledge activities will continue during Phase E of the mission (Sept. 2016 to September 2023) with archiving of materials associated with the cleanroom construction at JSC and materials from the UTTR recovery site (might include soil, air, and other environmental background materials that could pose a contamination risk to OSIRIS-REx samples).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec65"><title>Mars 2020 Rover Mission</title><p id="Par184">Although the Mars 2020 rover mission is not a sample return mission itself, it will be collecting and caching samples from the martian surface that could be picked up by a future mission, and hence Mars 2020 may represent the first mission in an overall Mars sample return campaign. Apart from in situ surface science, the goal of this first mission is to assemble a collection of rigorously documented and returnable cached samples. Contamination knowledge samples from Mars 2020 are in the process of being collected and curated to be part of the overall Mars sample collection if the cached samples are eventually returned.</p><p id="Par185">While there are many aspects of the MSR contamination knowledge samples that will be similar to previous sample return missions, this sample return campaign has presented a number of unique opportunities and challenges. Perhaps the most notable is that due to the possibility of extinct or extant life on the surface of Mars, this sample return mission is designated as restricted by NASA’s Planetary Protection Office. This designation requires more stringent organic contamination control requirements as well as the addition of biological contamination control and CK. Furthermore, this designation requires that the returned martian samples are curated in a containment facility in order to protect Earth from possible martian biohazards. The second notable difference is that the Mars 2020 mission would be part of a MSR campaign. Therefore, not only will the CK collection need to be coordinated between multiple missions, but significant point sources of possible contamination will remain on the martian surface. This mission architecture could make it more challenging to track a contaminant to its source. To minimize this knowledge gap, the CK samples collected will have to be more extensive than traditional sample return mission architectures. Finally, the Mars 2020 mission was not officially considered a sample return mission from its inception, so interaction with curation personnel and/or appropriate curation expertise was delayed and did not occur during the early stages of mission design, which has added an extra complication given the additional costs and time constraints of assembling a comprehensive CK collection.</p><sec id="Sec66"><title>Contamination Knowledge Samples</title><p id="Par186">As with other sample return missions, an array of CK samples will be collected throughout ATLO. These samples will range from high fidelity flight reference materials to airfall witness samples. The flight and non-flight hardware and spacecraft components considered for CK are those items that are a potential contamination risk to the sample intimate hardware during launch, cruise, Mars entry/decent, landing, and rover surface operations. These “line-of-site” items are determined based on the Master Equipment List (MEL) and the Master Material List (MML). The MML will also be utilized to determine materials that have any potential to shed particulates and/or outgas molecular organics, directly or indirectly impacting the sample and caching subsystems. These samples can range from paint samples to flight spares or flight spare equivalents. Given the expanded scope of CK samples, an array of non-flight reference materials could help in tracing contamination. Some of these non-flight reference materials include: facility tools, equipment, and environmental components used during the fabrication, part processing, precision cleaning, and assembly that are considered a potential contamination risk. Witness items (e.g. plates and wipe samples) will be deployed within cleanrooms and on flow-benches during the assembly of the sample and caching subsystem. These witness items are duplicates of the witness items deployed and taken for CC and PP verification. All data collected during CC and PP verification will be tied to the respective CK sample, integrated into the CK database, and made available to the scientific community. Finally, unlike all other CK collections stored in nitrogen at ambient laboratory temperatures, the introduction of biological CK samples add the requirement to curate frozen samples (<inline-formula id="IEq109"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq109_Math"><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>80</mml:mn><mml:msup><mml:mspace width="0.25em"/><mml:mo>∘</mml:mo></mml:msup><mml:mtext>C</mml:mtext></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq109_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Due to organic contamination concerns, all storage bags utilized for organic CK cannot be heat-sealed, so we developed customized bag clips. These two piece bag clips are constructed from 300 series stainless steel and Teflon. These clips will provide a strong seal that will ensure sample safety during shipment and long-term curation, and they will be used for future missions.</p><p id="Par188">For the long term storage of CK samples, a few different storage containers needed to be upgraded or designed from scratch. Due to size constraints, this most high fidelity sample intimate hardware will be stored in a custom 316 stainless steel bolt-top canister with a Teflon seal, plumbed to accommodate an inert atmosphere to ensure sample safety in case of a breach in the primary containment. However, the bulk of the inorganic and organic reference and witness items will be stored within highly customized desiccators. As with the bolt-top containers, this highly customized desiccator is a modified version of the desiccators utilized for the other Astromaterials collections. However, due to stringent contamination control, the construction materials are highly limited. For example, unlike other desiccators that can utilize traditional flexible and highly compressible multi-use gasket material, the organic contamination requirements for Mars 2020 preclude their use. Therefore, a new door gasket design was required. Due to its low outgassing properties, a Teflon gasket was the preferred material. However, the trade-off for low outgassing is low flexibility and low compressibility, which means a whole new door gasket design was required. The new design leverages the slight compressibility of the Teflon gasket material while also utilizing it as a barrier material between a possible contaminant and the samples.</p><p id="Par189">The collection of Mars 2020 CK is an ongoing activity that will continue until the spacecraft is launched from Kennedy Space Center in July of 2020. Full details of the contamination knowledge collection and the laboratories that support these samples will be described in subsequent publications through joint efforts between the Mars 2020 science team and JSC curation personnel after a decision is made regarding the overall MSR campaign, which is expected sometime in 2020.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec68"><title>Preliminary Examination of Samples</title><p id="Par190">The preliminary examination (PE) of returned samples, be they collected from an extraterrestrial body and returned by spacecraft or recovered from a frozen lake or someone’s back yard on Earth, is arguably the first step in their curation. The importance of this step cannot be overstated with respect to either the early identification of the sample type or the careful preservation of planetary materials for the future. Preliminary examination affects both of these, and many activities in between. Simply defined, preliminary examination is the process by which returned samples are documented and characterized to the point that the appropriate scientific research community is provided with enough information to select and request the samples for their individual, PI-led scientific studies. The results of preliminary investigations are typically presented in catalogs or online databases that are publicly available, and preliminary examination is considered to be a science-enabling activity.</p><sec id="Sec69"><title>Steps Involved in Preliminary Examination</title><p id="Par191">The very first steps of preliminary examination of samples may take place before they are even collected. For all returned samples, the astronauts and/or instruments onboard the spacecraft (orbiter, lander, or rover) will gather as much data as possible about the surface of the body from where the samples are gathered. These data will likely include photographs, spectroscopic data, and other possible measurements given the available instruments/crew. For samples collected on the ground, such as meteorites, ideally, a photograph including a scale bar with an indication of compass orientation, a general description of the sample (e.g., percentage of fusion crust, possible rock type, notable physical characteristics), and a description of the site where the sample was found or any other noteworthy features. Care should be taken during these steps to minimize exposure to contamination sources, and any potential contamination should be documented in the collection notes; a list of recommended procedures and materials for collection of freshly-fallen meteorites is provided in Herd et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2016</xref>). Photographs of sample containment vessels may occur during and after collection. At the very least, the type of sample containment/transport vessel should be documented, to inform future sampling and curation documentation as well as subsequent scientific analysis. In all cases, the utmost care should be taken to ensure curation best practices are implemented to minimize forward contamination.</p><p id="Par192">Once samples are received in a curatorial facility, documentation of their current state should be made. These details may include information about the type of materials that the astromaterials samples were transported in, the state of those materials after landing (e.g., are seals intact? are they covered in dust?), and the documentation should include photographs. Any sampling of head gas in sample containment vessels that would be required should be completed and documented before sample containers are opened. Once the sample vessels are breached, information that may be of interest to research will be lost, along with the opportunity to ever gather it on those particular samples again. In addition, any tomographic scanning (e.g., X-ray or neutron) that is required to occur before samples are opened should be completed, and all processes involved in those analyses should be carefully documented.</p><p id="Par193">Once samples are opened and, if applicable, removed from their sample containment vessels, the initial, curatorial steps involved in basic characterization of these materials take place. The main purpose of these efforts is to document exactly how the sample existed when it was opened. A documentation should be made as to the sample mass and its appearance at the time of opening. There should be a written description of the state of the material (intact rock, crumbled rock or sediments, powder, microscopic grains in a gel, etc.), its general attributes (color, grain size, physical appearance) and any notable features that are present (veins, fractures, fusion crust, metal content, etc.). Of utmost importance is photographic documentation (possibly with video, depending on the type of samples). Sample numbers should be assigned during this phase if they were not designated during collection. In short—the initial characterization of samples includes any process that can take place without making changes to the state of the samples other than opening their sample containment device, which is obviously unavoidable. Ideally, these steps should be made without touching the samples with anything other than curatorial tools comprised of materials determined to make contact with the samples without compromising their pristine nature. Determination of appropriate materials to use are based on several factors and typically represents a compromise between functionality and contamination risk, but foremost those materials must not compromise the ability of the samples to be used to answer the primary science requirements for a mission.</p><p id="Par194">After basic characterization is completed, the curatorial phase of preliminary examination of the samples begins. Preliminary examination is distinct from science activities, and its goal is to produce a sample catalog with a level of detail about each sample that is sufficient for members of the scientific community to make informed requests of materials to conduct their PI-led scientific investigations. Preliminary examination of materials can occur for each representative portion of a sample, if needed to produce a meaningful and informative sample catalog. For Preliminary examinations on samples that also have a mission science team, preliminary examination can happen in parallel with science activities, but the goals of these two activities remains distinct. The methods and analytical techniques used during preliminary examination of a sample will be tailored to the primary science requirements for that sample. Furthermore, these processes will be determined based on sample size, sample form, sample vessel, and the need to prevent either forward or backward contamination. Large samples such as meteorites need to be touched with tools/gloves to be weighed, photographed, and described, and they need to be broken with tools to provide material for their classification. The next steps of preliminary examination of meteorites require the classification chip to be processed even further. As part of the U.S. Antarctic Meteorite Program (AMP) the smaller meteorite chip is weighed, placed into a sample container, and sent from NASA JSC to the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History for further visual examination via binocular microscope, chipping, insertion into a sample holder grid, and polishing for energy dispersive spectroscopic (EDS) analyses, and/or made into a petrographic thin or thick section (both of which involve exposure to epoxy and polishing grit). These samples are coated with carbon and analyzed with a scanning electron microscope with EDS and/or an electron microprobe to determine their mineral compositions (namely olivine, pyroxene, and in the case of iron meteorites, FeNi metal). Other collections contain much smaller specimens and require much more careful micromanipulation of materials as discussed previously in the small particle handling section.</p><p id="Par195">Preliminary examination of gas and volatile-rich samples present unique challenges to the curatorial preliminary examination process. In the gas phase, samples cannot be photo-documented or weighed. Condensed volatiles can be weighed, but only as a supplement to total or partial-pressure measurements of the quantity of sample in the gas phase. Whether the sample is condensed or not, total and partial pressures of major species (e.g. H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>, etc., depending on the sample origin) should be monitored using techniques that consume little to no sample. Spectroscopy-based techniques (e.g., FTIR, Raman, cavity ring-down spectroscopy) provide possible non-destructive means by which an initial characterization of the compounds in a sample can be ascertained; however, care must be taken to ensure that the techniques (and wavelengths) used do not pose a risk of altering the sample composition or isotopic distribution. High-sensitivity gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or other high-sensitivity gas analysis techniques can be used to supplement spectroscopy using small quantities (&lt;1 g) of sample.</p><p id="Par196">The concept of a “representative sample” for allocation purposes requires further development for gas and volatile-rich samples. Depending on the temperature at which preliminary examination takes place, some species may be condensed while others remain in the gas phase. Additionally, thorough mixing of a gas-phase sample may be impossible to guarantee, especially while the sample remains sealed in the flight sample container. Therefore, when producing aliquots of gas samples for distribution to the scientific community, homogeneity between aliquots should not be expected. One possible solution is to separate gas-phase compounds by their condensation temperatures, freezing out compounds in a sequence that allows them to be separated by composition. This would limit (and possibly prohibit) bulk compositional analyses, but it would separate the sample into known compositions from which aliquots could be obtained. Regardless of how representative samples are defined, significant development is still required to address this capability gap for future volatile-rich sample return missions. An alternative to conducting preliminary examination of gas samples is to immediately conduct analysis of the gases for scientific purposes prior to preliminary examination. This option would be desirable in any instance where the primary science goals for a sample could be compromised through any preliminary examination processes.</p><p id="Par197">Once the data are collected during preliminary examination, they are compiled and released to the scientific community in various online/digital formats or sample catalogs in order to allow researchers to request them for study. For U.S. meteorites, this is the Antarctic Meteorite Newsletter published in February and September each year (for example, <ext-link xlink:href="https://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/amn/amn.cfm#n412" ext-link-type="uri">https://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/amn/amn.cfm#n412</ext-link>). For other collections, different mechanisms of reporting of available materials are put in place. All NASA curated samples are detailed in the ARES website (<ext-link xlink:href="https://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/" ext-link-type="uri">https://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/</ext-link>), and new samples announced biennially in the Astormaterials Newsletter (<ext-link xlink:href="https://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/newsletter/#n0101" ext-link-type="uri">https://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/newsletter/#n0101</ext-link>). And meteorites from around the world are detailed in the Meteoritical Bulletin (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.lpi.usra.edu/meteor/metbull.php" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.lpi.usra.edu/meteor/metbull.php</ext-link>).</p><p id="Par198">Preliminary examination does not end with the process of reporting data in a newsletter. The curation process regularly involves the subsampling of materials. Each time this occurs, the subsampling process is ideally well documented with photographs, diagrams of subsampling, the weights of both removed and remaining materials, and descriptions of those materials if noteworthy. The process of subsampling larger samples involves exposing new material to the sample surface and to the curatorial environment. These newly exposed materials may require description, and in extreme cases, if they reveal something extraordinary, may necessitate announcement to the scientific community of new sample opportunities. Preliminary examination, unlike initial characterization, will go on as long as there is sample remaining in our collections, and hence sample catalogs are living documents.</p></sec><sec id="Sec70"><title>Who Does PE?</title><p id="Par199">Who should be involved in the preliminary examination of samples depends on the mechanism by which the samples were recovered. For spacecraft missions to planetary bodies within our Solar System, there are numerous stakeholders. These stakeholders include the mission science team that orchestrated and successfully executed the sample return mission, the scientific community at large that will also want to study the returned samples, and future generations of scientists that will want to study these samples with technology that has not yet been invented. It is the responsibility of a collection curator to defend all of these stakeholders and to find the right balance between sample consumption and sample conservation that maximizes science returns on the samples over multi-decade timescales. Given the important role of a collection curator for the safety and long-term viability of returned samples, it only makes sense for astromaterials returned from spacecraft missions to be received, opened, processed, and characterized within a sample curation facility by specially trained personnel under the management of a curatorial authority. That said, the people involved in the preliminary examination of returned materials will not be limited to curation personnel. The people involved in the preliminary examination should include some combination of curatorial processors trained to process and document miniscule samples, collection curators, and members of the sample science team. There may be a healthy tension that develops between the curator and members of a sample science team (i.e., conservation vs. consumption, respectively) because the science team has scientific mission requirements to achieve within a fixed period of time, and the curator must think beyond that time frame to the long-term viability and availability of the samples. To minimize such tensions, it is important to have policies in place prior to the samples being returned that outline how much sample can be consumed by the mission science team to achieve the primary science goals.</p><p id="Par200">With less controlled sample collection, such as meteorite falls recovered anywhere in the world, the very first steps of preliminary examination (i.e., basic characterization) may take place in the field by trained meteorite hunting/recovery programs such as those run by the US (ANSMET), Japan, Belgium, China, South Korea, and the UK. The ANSMET program, for example, documents the field location of each meteorite recovered with a GPS position, a photograph next to a field number, the percentage of fusion crust visible on the sample, an educated guess at the meteorite type, a general description of any other notable features (i.e., it was found in liquid water, it was found half buried in ice, it was broken in half), and anything else that may require comment (i.e., it was accidentally touched with a glove, a bare hand, a snowmobile) and could possibly affect future analyses. Once the field documentation is completed and the samples are sent to a curation facility, preliminary examination largely occurs by curation personnel, and the samples are made available for request without first being analyzed by a mission science team.</p></sec><sec id="Sec71"><title>Where do We Draw the Line Between Preliminary Examination for Curation and Science?</title><p id="Par201">Basic characterization and preliminary examination are, as stated above, the processes by which returned samples are initially documented and sufficiently characterized to provide the appropriate scientific research community with enough information to select and request them for scientific study. A long standing discussion is carried on by curators worldwide as to what constitutes “too much characterization” and where the line is drawn between performing that characterization and conducting research that should be PI-led. The line is particularly difficult to delineate for small particle collections where the entire particle may be &lt;10 μm and almost any observation with an electron beam or laser could alter the sample (e.g., interplanetary dust particles in NASA’s Cosmic Dust collection). However, there are also some examples of disagreement among curators as to which instrumentation and analyses are appropriate for preliminary examination on large samples where subsampling does not negatively impact the availability of the material (e.g., oxygen isotopic measurements, X-ray computed tomography, etc.). Nonetheless, the line between characterization and science is going to be different for each sample type, and that line should be optimally placed such that wasted sample consumption resulting from insufficient information about the samples in a catalog (i.e., the consumed sample did not have the phase of interest) is minimized whilst serendipitous discoveries within the samples during scientific investigations can still occur.</p><p id="Par202">One of the questions meteorite curators commonly ask, for example, is whether or not oxygen isotopic compositions should be determined for meteorite samples returned from Antarctica or elsewhere. These measurements are very much in the realm of PI-led research, but with meteorites coming from a variety of different Solar System bodies, providing the <inline-formula id="IEq110"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq110_Math"><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mn>17</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq110_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Generally, isotope labs in the U.S. have provided the U.S. Antarctic Meteorite Program with these data as needed, but O-isotope analysis should only be used as a characterization tool when other, less destructive, methods cannot be used to uniquely classify the material. Another example is the use of X-ray computed tomography (XCT) as a characterization tool. Having three-dimensional context of samples provides curation personnel with invaluable information about the contents of samples, particularly highly heterogeneous samples like regolith breccias. This information can be used to identify clasts that are not exposed at the surface, and it can be used to make informed decisions about cuts or sample splits during sample processing. However, XCT exposes samples to radiation doses that can have lasting effects on the samples. Thermoluminescence in particular is negatively impacted by XCT analysis of samples (Sears et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">2018</xref>), and studies are underway to better characterize its effect on organic compounds in samples (Hanna and Ketcham <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2017</xref>; Friedrich et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par203">Most curated astromaterials samples today are room-temperature solids; however, as we advance to collecting materials that require cryogenic storage or gas-phase samples, further questions arise as to how to conduct a preliminary examination, especially if the “shelf-life” of the samples prohibit waiting for the technology of tomorrow to analyze the samples. An alternative approach to a preliminary examination for materials that may have a short shelf-life is to organize a large scale consortium study where all stakeholders in the scientific community are given the opportunity to join, either through an “all are welcome” approach like Stardust or competitively through a proposal process if there is a need to limit the number of investigators. Conservation for the sake of conservation is not a meaningful philosophical approach to astromaterials curation. It is important that the goals of maximizing science returns on samples over their viable lifetimes are an integral part of a long-term sample conservation plan.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec72"><title>Looking Forward</title><p id="Par204">Advanced curation is a critical function to the success of sample return missions and Earth-based sample acquisition and plays an integral part in enabling the high precision measurements that are often done on astromaterials samples. Looking forward, advanced curation must prepare for sample return missions from any celestial body within the solar system, including planets, moons, asteroids, and/or comets. The direction and scope of advanced curation research is driven by (1) existing strategic knowledge gaps identified through lessons learned from previous sample return missions and Earth-based programs that collect astromaterials; (2) the emerging needs of the scientific community that study astromaterials samples; and (3) the selection of new targets for sample return missions and the associated curation and sample handling requirements of those missions (e.g., Beaty et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2019</xref>; Haltigin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2018</xref>; McLennan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2011</xref>; Vander Kaaden et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR195">2019</xref>). The primary result of advanced curation is to both reduce and quantify contamination to astromaterials and preserve the scientific integrity of all samples from mission inception and through ATLO, sample collection, curation/preliminary examination on Earth, curation/storage, and secure delivery of the samples to Earth-based laboratories for in-depth scientific analysis. Advanced curation is an interdisciplinary field of research and development and also serves as an important science-enabling activity. The collective lessons learned from previous spacecraft missions and the results of advanced curation research will work in tandem to feed forward into better spacecraft designs and enable more stringent requirements for future sample return missions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported, in part, by NASA’s Science Mission Directorate.
