the use of local materials, in order to reduce launch mass and expand mission capability. Using lunar regolith simulant and heating it within a susceptor-assisted microwave oven, it was possible to manufacture a variety of basaltic glasses. Furthermore, it was possible to shape these glasses by grinding and polishing the surface flat and smooth. Glasses manufactured from different lunar regolith simulants were coated with aluminium or silver, and the reflective properties of the resulting mirrors and uncoated surfaces were measured. It was shown that with a porous and/or smooth surface finish, mirrors could be made that reflect the incident solar light (400 nm–1250 nm) in-between 30% for the worst and 85% for the best samples. The same samples with uncoated surfaces showed to reflect less than 7% of incident solar light in the same wavelength range.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Lunar

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Future exploration missions outlined in the ISECG’s Global Exploration Roadmap—including human missions to the Moon and Mars—will have increasingly demanding payload requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Even with advances in the development of heavy lift systems, such missions will have significant mass constraints on the equipment flown into space. Resupply flights will be limited and in some cases impractical. In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) has been suggested as a solution to this problem since the 1960s and recently new investigations on lunar regolith as a potential building material have been conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Support for manned exploration missions using ISRU is a technology theme identified by ESA in its “ESA Space Exploration Strategy—2015” and NASA in its “NASA Strategic Space Technology Investment Plan—2015”. Within these plans “Space Power and Energy Systems” and “Human Exploration Destination Systems” are areas that have been identified that can benefit from augmentation utilising ISRU. As a result, investigations into combining the need for local energy harvesting by utilising resources—by means of ISRU—are under investigation in this work.</p><p id="Par3">So far no landing site for a lunar mission has been selected, and it is unclear what exact mineralogy the available raw material at any landing site will have. Hence, the ISRU processes in general should be capable of handling a wide variety of permutations of materials. Moreover, due to mass constraints, the systems used for manufacturing, transport and assembly of any mission augmenting item need to be relatively, simple, small and light.</p><p id="Par4">The manufacturing approach presented herein uses a susceptor-based microwave heating method which should function on the lunar surface in a similar manner to how it does on Earth. Using this technology—in a first stage in Earth-like conditions—glass-like substrates were manufactured, polished and coated with reflective materials. This ultimately could lead to a mirror, manufactured of material found in situ on the lunar surface. A set of these mirrors can be arranged in an array to deflect incident sunlight to either an topically shadowed region or concentrate it onto a solar array. Other applications for these mirrors on the surface include solar furnaces, telescopes and thermal insulation/management.</p><p id="Par5">Early work on microwave sintering of lunar soil was conducted in 2005, but suggested that lunar soil simulants are not ideal candidates for microwave sintering not least due to the absence of nanophase iron (3–10 mm) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In 2013 computational modelling and experimental microwave processing of lunar regolith simulant showed that it is possible to use microwaves for processing and furthermore suggested the use of susceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In 2014 and 2015 two more groups showed that microwaves can be used to sinter and melt regolith utilising microwaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Also in 2015, a group of geoscientists determined that microwaves can be used to melt terrestrial andesite within 3–4 min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], suggesting microwave heating to be an energy-efficient way of melting basaltic rocks. Most recently, in 2016 work on supporting long-term surface exploration on the Moon suggested to investigate susceptor-assisted microwave heating instead of direct microwave heating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This would overcome the issues of regolith dependant susceptibility and hence inhomogeneity of heating, leading to thermal imbalance and ultimately to weak mechanical properties in the manufactured part [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This recent development leads to the research presented here on microwave manufacturing of glasses from lunar regolith simulant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Lunar regolith and simulants</title><p id="Par6">The Moon can generally be divided in two different areas, the mare areas which appear darker to the human eye and the highland areas which are brighter. Its surface is covered with a layer of fine dust, the so-called regolith which is up to 10 m thick on the highland surfaces and 5 m in the mare regions. Although the bulk part of the regolith is a fine grey soil, it also contains rock fragments from the bedrock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In order to identify how regolith can be made useful for building glass-like substrates as a basis for solar conversion devices; chemical composition, grain size distribution and mineralogy of lunar regolith needs to be understood. (In particular, how these parameters might impact the manufacturing of such substrates.) Since real lunar regolith is not available for experimentation, available terrestrially sourced regolith simulants have been investigated and used for testing.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Chemical composition of lunar regolith</title><p id="Par7">The average chemical composition of the lunar regolith in comparison with Earth’s crust is shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Average chemical composition of lunar surface regolith.</p><p>Adapted from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>] and the most abundant elements in Earth’s continental crust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Element</p></th><th align="left"><p>Regolith per cent of atoms<sup>a</sup></p></th><th align="left"><p>Regolith weight % of oxides</p></th><th align="left"><p>Earth’s crust weight %</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>O</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>61.0</p></td><td align="left"><p>–</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>45.2</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Si</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>16.3</p></td><td align="left"><p>45.0</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>27.2</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Al</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>9.5</p></td><td align="left"><p>22.3</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>8.0</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Mg</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>4.3</p></td><td align="left"><p>8.0</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>2.8</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Ca + K</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>6.0</p></td><td align="left"><p>15.5</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>6.8</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Fe</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>2.3</p></td><td align="left"><p>7.6</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>5.8</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Ti</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>0.3</p></td><td align="left"><p>1.1</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>0.9</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Na</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>0.4</p></td><td align="left"><p>0.6</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>2.3</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Total</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>100.1</p></td><td align="left"><p>100.1</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>99.0</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>Oxygen stoichiometrically determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p id="Par8">The composition shows that silicon, in the form of silicon dioxide, is the second most abundant element after oxygen for both, Earth and the lunar surface. However, none of the listed elements is found elementally pure on the lunar surface but in form of minerals. All elements occur in the chemically stable oxide form and purification (processes which are non-trivial) needs high amounts of energy for extraction. It is therefore neither practically nor economically viable for an initial base on the lunar surface to consider purification for augmentation. The abundance of silica, however, suggests that the raw regolith might be used directly for manufacture of silica based glasses instead. The regolith composition shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows typical elements other than silicon which are found in the lunar regolith mix, for example Al, Ca, or Mg. These being additives to, for example soda lime glass on Earth, further support the argument of manufacturing glass from regolith.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Lunar mineralogy and geology</title><p id="Par9">This section merely provides a general overview of the mineralogy and geology of the Moon based on the limited number of lunar regolith samples available on Earth. In-depth studies, in the form of prospecting missions and sample return missions, will need to be conducted once a landing site for a lunar base is selected.

Having glass as raw material available in space can have a broad variety of applications, for example as substrate or backplate for semiconductor devices or electronics, windows, pipes/tubes, fibres, formed objects, thermal insulation foams and low-density aerobraking heat shields. In 1979 it was acknowledged that a wider variety of glass can be useful on the Moon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and, for example in 1986, processing of lunar materials by means of microwave melting has been investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Therefore, determining which terrestrial glass manufacturing processes are suitable for the lunar environment and regolith as a raw material is crucial.</p><p id="Par21">For terrestrial glasses, silicon dioxides make up the bulk part of most types of glasses. Other oxides then modify the glass behaviour, such as melting point and colour. On Earth, soda lime glass is the most common glass used and although it is well understood and could be a choice for the Moon, basaltic glass (manufactured from lunar regolith and igneous rocks) will be the only available option on the lunar surface. Generally glass manufacturing can be described as a process sequence of three steps. Melting sand (raw material), shaping the hot glass, and heat treating it to avoid cracking. These three steps are applicable to lunar glass fabrication as well, with the only difference that the available raw material is limited to basaltic sand. Hence, no pure additives or fining agents are available to add to the glass mix and therefore the properties of the glass depend on the composition of the basaltic sand only.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Basaltic glass</title><p id="Par22">Basaltic glass is formed by melting basaltic material and occurs naturally on both Earth and the Moon. The most prominent naturally occurring example on Earth is obsidian. Igneous rock occurring in the form of obsidian is a natural glass which forms due to rapid cooling or quenching of hot volcanic lava. Obsidian is glass like in appearance and harder than regular soda lime glass. It is usually very silica rich (approximately 65–80%), and the usual colour of obsidian is black. It can, however, also naturally occur in brown, red, green, grey or yellow varieties, most of which are influenced by different iron oxide contents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The forming of glass from lunar regolith simulant is hence considered to be similar.</p><p id="Par23">From the list of minerals abundant on the Moon (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), it can be seen that glass found in the lunar Mare regions can get as high as 17 vol% and as low as less than 1 vol%. Similarly, the highland glass volume per cent content can be observed in-between 5 and 25%. Since, in glass fabrication, the content of recycled glass versus new material (e.g. sand) can be crucial to lowering process temperatures and hence the energy required to melt the material, it will be important to gain a better understanding on the role of basaltic glasses content in regolith. In particular, what impact the basaltic glass content in the start mix has on the manufacturing process.</p><p id="Par24">Studies focused on lunar glass are rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and usually focused around the geological history of the Moon rather than the properties of the actual glass. Other available studies on basalt glass most often focus on terrestrial volcanic basalts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], mid-ocean ridge basalts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] or crystallisation behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. More specifically, basaltic glass has been studied on Earth for a variety of applications such as recycling of sewage sludge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], recycling of residues of basaltic quarries and ceramic wastes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] as well as sintering it into thermal insulation blocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] or its behaviour by adding additives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Understanding the composition, structure and processing of lunar basalt is vital in gaining a better understanding of the melting temperature, cooling and annealing behaviour as well as the crystallisation of basaltic glass. Hence, the behaviour of lunar basaltic glasses compared to terrestrial glasses will need further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Microwave processing</title><p id="Par25">Microwave processing is a widely used technology in a variety of terrestrial applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] nowadays, not at least due to its comparable low power consumption.

Utilising a susceptor in microwave processing is called susceptor-assisted microwave heating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] which has been used, for example, for the activation of silicon dopants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] before. Utilising a susceptor-assisted approach to microwave processing regolith has the advantage that the process (compared to regular microwave processing) becomes more independent of the regolith composition. Differences in, for example iron oxide content, can influence processing time or processing temperature. Therefore, using a susceptor as a passive heating element (heated by the microwaves) makes microwave processing more universally applicable and independent of the regoliths’ composition. The disadvantage of this addition to the process is that universal applicability is traded for power efficiency, since the losses of a susceptor-assisted heating process are higher than those of regular microwave heating.</p><p id="Par26">A non-susceptor-assisted microwave heating concept, used as an ISRU technology, is described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].

Aluminium reflects the highest, with on average of more than 90% reflected light over the entire wavelength range (from 0.2 to 10 μm). Hence, aluminium seems to be the most likely choice for a coating which aims at reflecting as much light as possible. Although coating materials like silver may be advantageous compared to aluminium since they reflect a few more per cent of the wavelength spectrum in the infrared range, the ultimate decision for the coating material will hence need to be decided on the actual application the mirror is used in.</p><p id="Par32">However, the selection of the coating material will not necessarily only focus on maximum reflection but might also be, for example, tailored to the absorption spectrum of a (multijunction) solar cells, which could be used in combination with mirrors in a solar concentrator setup.

The available technologies can be divided into two groups physical vapour deposition (PVD) and chemical vapour deposition (CVD). The chosen technique for this project is PVD, which evaporates or sputters a source material, producing a gaseous plume or beam that deposits a film, on a substrate, whereas thermal evaporation evaporates the base material using a resistive heating element. Typically, the raw material is placed into a source like a tungsten boat and temperature is increased to facilitate evaporation of the material. PVD is usually done under vacuum conditions to avoid gases from reacting (e.g. oxidising) with materials such as aluminium. On the lunar surface a high-quality vacuum is already existing which would allow for an even more simplistic version of an traditional evaporator system to be built.

Two samples were manufactured of JSC-2A and three of EAC-1. After filling the crucibles with simulant, they were entered into the microwave kiln and heated in air atmosphere. Details on heating times are listed in Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>. All samples but one (JSC-I-2) were manufactured using a fusing method where the sample remained in the crucible for the whole process. The JSC-I-2 sample was manufactured by heating the material in a first crucible and then casting it into a second, preheated (560 °C) crucible of the same size. The second crucible was preheated and kept in an electric-heated kiln next to the microwave oven. The only other difference for how samples were manufactured was that for sample EAC-I-1, the cold EAC-1 simulant was placed onto a tungsten sheet which lined the bottom of the graphite crucible.</p><p id="Par39">After heating all samples for the times indicated in Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, they were removed from the microwave kiln and introduced in a second, electric-heated kiln at 560°C. After introducing the samples into the kiln, the kiln was switched off and the samples were allowed to cool to room temperature within 2 h. This process was kept constant for all samples and was supposed to release the inner thermal stress that has been built up inside the samples during heating. This should improve strength and durability to a point where the samples would not shatter any more. For lower and/or shorter annealing times, it could be observed that the samples would shatter even when not touched or moved. Since the manufactured samples where never heavier than 20 g the cooling and annealing times could be rather short (order of an hour) as well as annealing temperatures required seemed to be best around 560 °C. Due to non-existent convection forces on the Moon itself, the only heat transfer mechanisms left are conduction and radiation. Hence, cracking on lunar produced samples may be less an issue, since slower cooling rate intrinsic to the lunar environment. It is concluded from those experiments that for up-scaling this process, it will be required to conduct a study on the behaviour of basaltic glass cooling, especially under lunar-like conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Heating and shaping batch 2</title><p id="Par40">For the second batch, four different simulants were utilised (overview in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).

Heating times could be kept the same for all but one simulant, the LHT-3M showed to have a higher melting point than the other three simulants. It was attempted to compensate for this higher melting point by increasing the heating time. The weight loss or gain of the samples was very little in all cases but one, the EAC-II sample lost more than 3% of its weight during heating. This is very likely due to the release of water contained in the simulant.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>SEM images (top) and optical microscopic images (bottom) of lunar regolith sample EAC-II.

As suggested by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], a susceptor-assisted microwave hybrid heating technique at 2.5 GHz frequency can be used to melt regoliths with different mineral compositions using the same hardware setup. This addition to direct microwave heating greatly increases the flexibility by melting different materials, some of which would not melt using direct microwaving.</p><p id="Par47">Nine different glass-like substrates samples listed in Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> were manufactured and did not show any thermal imbalances in the material, in the form of chipping or breaking. Also meaning that all regolith entered into the microwave kiln was melted homogeneously. This is a result of utilising a homogeneous heating pattern created by the susceptor ring in the microwave kiln. Direct microwave heating classically showed inhomogeneous heating behaviour and would lead to thermal stress in the cooled sample.</p><p id="Par48">Differences in geochemical composition of the utilised regolith simulants, as shown in Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, may have influenced the susceptor-assisted microwave heating approach. Since differences in iron oxide and magnesium oxide in general influence the behaviour of the melt, it is likely that those have an impact on the properties of the final sample independent of the heating approach used. Different iron oxide contents, for example, will have an impact on the dielectric properties of the regolith (hence the susceptibility to microwaves) or an increased magnesium oxide content which may lead to a higher melting point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Although the silica content doesn’t differ significantly for the four different simulants types (43.70–49.14 wt%), the alumina content does, with a minimum of 12.60 wt% for EAC-1 and a maximum of 24.40 wt% for the LHT-3M. A higher aluminium oxide content may well lead to higher melting points and pure alumina (aluminium oxide) is often used in high-temperature furnaces as crucible or lining material. This means in turn that even though the heating approach utilised seemed to heat all different simulants equally well, a combination of cooling and geochemistry of the samples will still influence the characteristics of the final sample. This might be optical characteristics or formation of amorphous and crystalline glasses.</p><p id="Par49">From Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> it can further be seen that some of the samples where subject to weight loss during heating. The second batch of samples showed losses as low as almost 0% (JSC-II sample) up to about 3.2% for the sample made of EAC-1 (EAC-II).

The orange areas appear to be pyroxenes (13.34% magnesium, low aluminium (2.58%) and calcium (1.84%)) as, for example, the clinopyroxene augite, which is a common mineral in basalt. The exact reason why those minerals did not melt in LTH-3M is not obvious, but may be that the lower total iron oxide (FeO + Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) content of 4.16%, itself could be the reason. With 10.75 wt% (JSC-2A), 12.00 wt% (EAC-1) and 13.07 wt% (FJS-1) of total iron oxide content, the other three simulants show significantly higher values.</p><p id="Par58">Since the iron oxide is the oxide which is most susceptible to microwaves (due to coupled dielectric heating mode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]), and hence microwave heating, an increase in iron oxide content might improve heating in a microwave kiln. Since the LHT-3M is iron sparse, this additional means of heating the regolith is reduced to a minimum and suggests that the susceptor-assisted microwave heating approach is not performing equally for all input materials. The other possibility is that those particular minerals or the combination of those minerals lead to a higher melting point of the LHT-3M in general. Hence, the microwave heating process achieves its maximum possible temperature with the current setup but is still not capable of heating the sample beyond melting temperature.</p><p id="Par59">Another interesting point about the LHT-3M glass (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) is that it appear distinct green compared to all other glass types. One possibility for the green colour of the glass is the occurrence of traces of chromium, contained in diopside or chrome spinels which would turn a glass melt green. A second possibility would be if the sample contains traces of nickel, within olivines, which would also lead to a green colouring.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Surface topography</title><p id="Par60">The surface features and structures have been measured and characterised by means of profilometery and focus variation microscopy.

Batch 2 samples EAC-II and LHT-II were measured for 40–42 mm and JSC-II and FJS-II for only 18 mm because of their major voids.

The basaltic glass samples have considerably greater deviations than the microscopy slide, within the maximum case 74.62 μm difference to the microscopy slide. Samples JSC-II and FJS-II show the smallest total deviations with less than 15 μm. These samples might be better based on their low porosity or small number of bubbles formed during manufacturing (section “<xref rid="Sec14" ref-type="sec">Heating and shaping</xref>”) which might have lead to the differences in surface quality. Since all nine samples have been treated with the same grinding process and grinding powders/papers, it is unlikely that differences in surface finish relate to the grinding process but are rather due to the materials composition and texture. Additionally, an average deviation of <italic>ζ</italic> = 33.00 μm could be calculated for all batch 1 samples and <italic>ζ</italic> = 20.94 μm for all batch 2 samples. This suggests a better average surface quality for batch 2 samples than batch 1 samples which in return might suggest that the changes in manufacturing and processing time might impact the final surface finish, such as the switch over from manual to semi-automated grinding.</p><sec id="Sec26"><title>Surface roughness batch 1</title><p id="Par67">Depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> are the data of the surface roughness measurements, recorded by the Taylor Hobson Talysurf-5.

Considering that the initial 1.5 mm of the measurement path of sample JSC-I-2 contains multiple surface features deeper than 250 μm, it may seem more interesting to compare only the part of the JSC-I-2 sample which is smoother. Correcting for the voids by discarding the first 1.5 mm of measurements at the beginning of the path, the deviation of sample reduces to 19.41 μm.

For the rest of the sample it is, however, also likely that because of the casting process bubbles, contained in the melt, could escape to the sides, leading to increased surface smoothness. The depth of the majority of bubbles formed in both JSC-I samples is in the range of 40–60 μm, with larger bubbles being as deep as several millimetres.</p><p id="Par70">All surface profiles of the three EAC-I samples show similar surface profiles as well as number and size of voids.

These values describe the distance between maximum and minimum height of the entire measured length of the sample. This is not considering any microscopic voids but rather the entire surface profile itself as it would be without voids.</p><p id="Par76">In all cases, for all nine samples, it appears that the surface of the samples is convex. This can be explained due to the grinding and polishing process which takes off more material at the edges of a samples than it does in its middle. Although a convex shape is not desirable for building a reflector, the diverging effects of these substrates (with a convex shape) are not considered to be relevant for the measurements displayed next. Since the light propagation paths are only 20–100 cm, the losses will be minor for such slight convex shapes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Reflectivity</title><p id="Par77">Achieving a high reflectivity for a coated basalt glass mirror is key to maximising energy that can be harvested or diverted by it. Used in a solar concentrator system or a solar furnace increased amount of reflected light will lead to higher efficiencies of the overall system. Hence, it is of interest to understand which parameters influence the performance of such a mirror and how to maximise its performance. Therefore, the reflectivity of three different surface types has been measured: uncoated, aluminium-coated and silver-coated basaltic glasses. All reflectivity data gathered were recorded on a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 UV–Vis–NIR spectrometer. This machine has its detector handover at 860.8 nm and light bulb change from the deuterium lamp to the tungsten lamp happens at 319.2 nm. Therefore, measurements of the reflectivity close to these wavelengths show discontinuations in the measurements.</p><sec id="Sec31"><title>Uncoated samples</title><p id="Par78">Before coating the samples, it is of interest to know about the uncoated samples’ ability to reflect light. For both batches the amount of reflected light lies in-between approximately 4–13% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>), in the wavelength range from 300 to 1250 nm.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Reflectivity of glass raw samples before coating—batch 1 shown in solid lines, batch 2 in dotted lines</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10853_2018_3101_Fig9_HTML.png" id="MO9"/></fig></p><p id="Par79">The only exception is the sample made of LHT-3M, which is significantly more reflective for wavelengths around 300–900 nm (peak of 28% at approximately 540 nm). This corresponded to its apparent green colour, with green light been part of the visible spectrum and ranging from 490 to 570 nm. Peak reflectivity is observed in this approximate range.</p><p id="Par80">The EAC-II sample has consistently higher average reflectivities compared to the FJS-II and JSC-II samples. This could be explained due to the core of the EAC-II sample being grey in appearance rather than black. These grey areas correspond to the areas where most of the glass has crystallised. This would suggest that crystallisation of the glass is indeed favourable for the reflective behaviour of the raw glass.</p><p id="Par81">Considering the deviation (<italic>ζ</italic>) from Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>, batch 1 samples listed in the order from roughest to smoothest are: JSC-I-2, JSC-I-1, EAC-I-2, EAC-I-1 and EAC-I-3 and for batch 2: LHT-II, EAC-II, FJS-II and JSC-II. This order is, however, not reflected in the measurements depicted in graph 9 where JSC-I-1 performs best, just before EAC-I-3/2 for batch 1. For batch 2, the LHT-II sample outperforms all other samples by more than double, to almost quadrupole for some wavelengths, with second best (of batch 2) being the EAC-II, which is second worst for the deviation/roughness. This is counterintuitive and suggests that surface finish may not be the main metric impacting the reflectivity of the uncoated basaltic glasses. Hence, geochemistry and mineralogy likely have a dominant impact on the reflective properties of the samples.</p><p id="Par82">Since the quality of the glass samples’ surfaces could not clearly be connected to their reflectivity values, Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref> shows reflectivity (averaged for samples of same simulant) versus their iron oxide content (FeO and Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> combined).

Moreover, it is comparably light and cheap and therefore seems a favourable choice as coating material for mirrors on the lunar surface, where weight is an important factor. The reflectivity of all samples was measured on the PerkinElmer spectrometer, and the results are depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>. All nine samples are shown plus reference data from an aluminium-coated mirror (with protection layer) provided by commercial supplier. It can be seen that the performance of all batch 1 samples (aluminium-coated side) is slightly higher than the performance of the silver-coated side. Moreover, the JSC-II sample performed best, as it would have been expected due to its smoothest surface. It may be added that the silver-coated samples performed slightly better in the infrared wavelength ranges, which was expected from the relevant literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>].<fig id="Fig12"><label>Figure 12</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Reflectivity of aluminium-coated side—batch 1 (full lines), batch 2 (dashed lines) and reference mirror (triangles)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10853_2018_3101_Fig12_HTML.png" id="MO12"/></fig></p><p id="Par86">Both batches were partially (batch 1) or entirely (batch 2) coated with aluminium (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Batch 1 samples show on average a reflectivity of 25–50% for most parts of the measured wavelength spectrum. Batch 2 samples exceed expectations with reflectivity values almost as high as 90% for some parts and for most parts in-between 50 and 85%. The worst batch 2 sample was the sample FJS-II with about 65% average reflectivity, the best the EAC-II and LHT-II samples with about 80%.</p><p id="Par87">For the aluminium-coated samples, the trend of all curves seems to be similar to the trend of the aluminium-coated reference mirror (indicated in violet in Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>). This looks similar to the behaviour of the silver-coated samples and makes it seem possible to produce mirrors of a quality good enough to be used in a solar reflector system.</p><p id="Par88">When comparing surface roughness (section “<xref rid="Sec24" ref-type="sec">Surface topography</xref>”), in both batches, it is apparent that higher reflectivity is obtained for samples considered to have low deviations (<italic>ζ</italic>). A plot showing reflectivity over surface roughness of all batches and both aluminium and silver is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>. This is to be expected and true for all samples but the silver-coated side of JSC-I-2 which may be different because of macroscopic surface features. It can be seen that the performance of all batch 1 samples (aluminium-coated side) is slightly higher than the performance of the silver-coated side. This supports the theory that aluminium is the more suitable coating material since it might be more tolerable to low-quality substrates. Moreover, the EAC-II and LHT-II sample performed best, although their surface does not appear to be the smoothest of all samples. Looking back at the surface profiles of those samples, they have a high deviation level because they contain many voids but the surface area in-between those voids is rather smooth.<fig id="Fig13"><label>Figure 13</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Reflectivity of aluminium- and silver-coated sides of both batches versus surface roughness</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10853_2018_3101_Fig13_HTML.png" id="MO13"/></fig></p><p id="Par89">With a decrease in surface quality, the amount of reflected light is also decreasing (Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>). In some cases, with a rather high deviation, it is still possible to achieve a reasonable reflectivity. This finding supports the idea of utilising regolith to manufacture mirrors on the lunar surface utilising uncomplicated technology seems feasible.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec34" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par90">Samples from four different lunar regolith types could successfully be melted in a susceptor-assisted microwave heating approach, utilising a microwave kiln. After cooling and annealing, mostly amorphous glasses were formed that showed smaller crystallised areas. All samples could be turned into approximately 20 × 45 mm size glass or glass-like samples, which were ground and polished. Two different independent batches were manufactured and polished and then measured for their reflective properties. Results indicate that reflective properties of uncoated but polished samples, for all but one sample, are as low as 5–10% in-between a wavelength range of 400–1250 nm. The exception is glass manufactured of LHT-3M simulant, which has a peak of 28% in the green wavelength spectrum which seemed to be related to the iron oxide content of the raw regolith. For all samples the reflectivity could be increased by a factor of 5–10 by coating the surface with silver or aluminium. Reflective peaks of about 90% could be reached in the near-infrared spectrum, which is only a few per cent off the performance of an aluminium-coated reference mirror.</p><p id="Par91">In conclusion, it can be said that melting lunar regolith turning it into glass substrates and coating it with a reflective material for the production of usable mirrors is feasible. Moreover, we feel that these experiments show that the process could produce similar results of the lunar surface. Additionally, the susceptor-assisted microwave heating process used in this work seems to be mostly independent of the input material and may be an option for an energy-efficient and universal heating method which could be deployed on the lunar surface.</p><p id="Par92">Next steps to take this technology further should include improvements to substrates surface quality, up-scaling and testing under lunar-like conditions. In particular, future tests should aim at reducing the formation of bubbles during the melting process, to ultimately increase the surface quality. This may be achieved by improvements to the preparation of the raw regolith, use of different crucible materials, heating methods or grain size distributions. A study on the impact of different mineral compositions on melting points will be necessary to assess the susceptor-assisted microwave heating process further and to assure that it is as universal as required.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Dr. Uwe Wolfram at Heriot-Watt University and his team for the support on the surface profiling, as well as Dr. Geoffrey Bromiley at Edinburgh University for the support on the geological analysis of the samples.</p></ack><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This research was co-funded under the ESA NPI scheme.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement"><title>Compliance with ethical standards</title><sec id="FPar1" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p id="Par93">The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.</p></sec></sec><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Shafto M, Conroy M, Doyle R, Glaessgen E, Kemp C, LeMoigne J, Wang L (2012) Draft modeling, simulation, information technology and processing roadmap.
