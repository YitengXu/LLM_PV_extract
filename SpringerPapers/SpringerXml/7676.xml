With the adjustment of global energy framework, people pay more attention to new energy, and it has to meet more severe criteria: renewable, environment-friendly, high-energy density. Hydrogen meets all requirements above. The credible decarbonized fuel is produced from water, and then water is generated without toxic gas after the fuel combustion for releasing large amounts of energy in a sustainable way.</p><p id="Par3">Harvesting hydrogen energy directly from inexhaustible sunlight with minimal environment impacts offers an ideal way to solve energy and climate crisis. Liking storage solar energy by plants through photosynthesis, semiconductors can store energy in chemical bands by photochemical catalysis. Photoanode materials should have the suitable valence band (VB) that are more positive than the potential of <italic>E</italic><sup><italic>0</italic></sup> (O<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O) for oxygen evolution. Furthermore, photoanode materials must be stable under oxidation and illumination in aqueous. Some metal oxides, including TiO<sub>2</sub>, WO<sub>3,</sub> and ZnO, with the VB that consists of O 2p orbitals meet these requirements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Many p-type semiconductors which have more negative conduction band (CB) than the potential of <italic>E</italic><sup><italic>0</italic></sup> (H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O) are investigated as photocathode materials for H<sub>2</sub> evolution, including GaP, Cu<sub>2</sub>O, p-Si<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The stability of photocathode materials in aqueous is very important, which can provide continuous photocurrent under illumination.</p><p id="Par4">As one of the most promising photoelectrode materials, silicon (Si) has many advantages. Si has gained the extensive acceptance due to the excellent electrical properties, the superior thermostability of electrical properties, low cost, and so on. Owing to the large diffusion coefficient (<italic>D</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> = 34.6 and <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> = 12.3 cm<sup>2</sup>/s for electrons and holes, respectively) and the long lifetime of carries (τ = 130 μs), the diffusion length of charge carriers in Si can reach about 1μm even the doping density as high as 10<sup>19</sup>~10<sup>20</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup>. In recent research, the photocurrent density and efficiency of Si are as high as 30 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> and 4.9%, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">However, the disadvantages of Si as the photoelectrode material are also not negligible. The bandgap of Si is 1.12 eV, which is not large enough for full water splitting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Hence, Si is used as the photocathode since its suitable CB position for hydrogen generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Moreover, a more pivotal problem is that Si is easy to be oxidized in any aqueous photoelectrochemical (PEC) system. It can actively react with water to produce H<sub>2</sub> (gas), SiH<sub>4</sub>, silicate and SiO<sub>2</sub>, since the standard potential of Si is −0.857 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). The thickness of oxide layer on Si depends on the original surface condition, the reaction time, the pH of solution, the dissolved oxygen, etc<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11"> 11 </xref>. In the real application, the cathode bias voltage that generated by illumination is not effective enough to protect the surface of Si from oxidation. Any uncontrollable oxide layer caused by this unavoidable effect will prevent H<sup>+</sup> reduction. Therefore, the performance of Si photoelectrodes will decay quickly.</p><p id="Par6">Recently, nanostructured Si shows enhanced PEC performances, while it also brings more severe challenges of stability in aqueous. One of the main gains for nanostructure is the enhanced surface area, which improves the absorption of light, the collection of charge carriers, the increase of exchange current densities, and the desorption of gas. However, the surface of that nanostructure photoelectrode is more likely to be oxidized. A very thin oxide layer that was presented on the surface of the delicate nanostructure will have an enormous impact on the PEC properties.</p><p id="Par7">Facing above challenges, many strategies have been applied to avoid the disadvantage of Si PEC system. Capping a passivation layer on the surface of Si is one of the most effective methods. Firstly, passivation layers can spatially separate the Si photoelectrodes from the severe working conditions in aqueous. Secondly, the composite structure can adjust the energy band structure vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and the absorption of light. Meanwhile, the appropriate passivation layer itself possesses the high thermodynamically stability in aqueous and good pH-independent stability to be confronted with the rigorous and changeable work conditions.</p><p id="Par8">Different passivation materials have been studied to achieve the highest performance of Si PEC photoelectrodes. Two kinds of passivation materials were especially paid attention. The first one is the insulating material with high dielectric constant, low light absorption. The representative materials are HfO<sub>2</sub>, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, etc. Due to its high thermodynamically stability and high refractive index, HfO<sub>2</sub> becomes the promising candidate as passivation coating for Si. P.K. Singh <italic>et al</italic>. obtained a passivation layer with the surface recombination velocity less than 100 cm/s by atomic layer deposition (ALD) of HfO<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par9">Different from the insulator, the oxide semiconductors have high anode corrosion potential, wide absorption of solar spectra light, and they are another kind of passivation materials. Typical oxide semiconductors passivation materials, e.g. TiO<sub>2</sub>, WO<sub>3</sub>, and SrTiO<sub>3</sub> have ability to adjust energy band structure of composite PEC electrodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. I. Chorkendorff <italic>et al</italic>. used high power impulse magnetron sputtering to deposit TiO<sub>2</sub> on the surface of p-Si photocathode for H<sub>2</sub> generation. Only a small degradation of photocurrent density was observed after a long-term stability test for 24 h<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.

Moreover, there are few reports on the PEC stability studies of HfO<sub>2</sub> passivation layers that covered on Si. Few works were also done to compare the different roles of HfO<sub>2</sub> and TiO<sub>2</sub> in these PEC systems. Figuring out the different passivation mechanisms of these two kinds of layers will help to understand the activities of electrons and holes during water splitting progresses, and then, assist the design of amenable PEC electrodes for practical application in the future. In this paper, the PEC properties of the HfO<sub>2</sub>/nanoporous-Si, represented the insulating layer, and the TiO<sub>2</sub>/nanoporous-Si, represented the oxide semiconductor layer, were analyzed, and compared by electrochemistry measurements, including I–V curves, Motte-schottky (MS) curves, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The stabilities of the HfO<sub>2</sub>/nanoporous-Si and the TiO<sub>2</sub>/nanoporous-Si were also compared by long-term I-t curves.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Morphology</title><p id="Par11">MaCE is a low-cost and simple method to fabricate nanostructured Si, which can control the morphology of nanoporous by changing the etching time, the thickness of Au film, the recipe of etching solution and so on<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16"> 16 </xref>. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> is the planar and cross-sectional SEM images of nanoporous Si (NP-Si).

In theoretically, the charge carrier transfer efficiency can reach the maximum only when the diffusion distance of charge carriers and the thickness of depletion layer are larger than the thickness of hole wall, and the hole depth is larger than the absorption depth of charge carriers.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The planar (<bold>a</bold>) and the cross sectional (<bold>b</bold>) SEM images of the nanoporous Si.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2017_Article_BFsrep43901_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p id="Par12">For non-transparent simples, optical reflection can partially present the light absorption of samples. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows the reflection spectra of the pristine-Si, the NP-Si, the HfO<sub>2</sub>/NP-Si and the TiO<sub>2</sub>/NP-Si with different thicknesses of passivation layers.

The optical reflection spectra of both the HfO<sub>2</sub>/NP-Si and the TiO<sub>2</sub>/NP-Si change a little with increase in the thickness of the passivation layers. However, comparing to the TiO<sub>2</sub>/NP-Si, a low reflection of the HfO<sub>2</sub>/NP-Si is presented from 500 to 1100 nm, which can be corroborated by the smaller reflection index of HfO<sub>2</sub> (n[HfO<sub>2</sub>] = 2.09)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> than that of TiO<sub>2</sub> (n[TiO<sub>2</sub>] = 2.37~2.48)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.

The photocurrent densities of all the HfO<sub>2</sub>/NP-Si and the NP-Si are higher than that of the pristine-Si. The saturated photocurrent density of the NP-Si is nearly 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> higher than that of the pristine-Si, which was benefited from the nanoporous structure. When the thickness of HfO<sub>2</sub> increase from 1 to 3 and 6 nm, the saturated photocurrent densities increase firstly and decrease later. For the insulating and thin HfO<sub>2</sub> film, there are two main mechanisms for forming currents. Within the effective thickness of HfO<sub>2</sub> layer, tunneling effect is the dominate mechanism for the transfer of electrons, and the effective thickness is believed to be less than 3 nm. When the layer thickness is larger than the effective thickness, electrons jumping between defects and penetrating through the layer is the main source of current. In addition, the current decreases with the increase of the thickness of the HfO<sub>2</sub> layer. The highest saturated photocurrent density achieves 33.5 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> with the thickness of 3 nm in the HfO<sub>2</sub>/NP-Si. Then further increase the layer thickness of HfO<sub>2</sub> to 12 nm, the saturated photocurrent densities keep decreasing. In <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3(b)</xref>, saturated photocurrent densities decrease obviously with increase of the layer thickness of TiO<sub>2</sub>. The saturated photocurrent density of 1 nm TiO<sub>2</sub>/NP-Si is 25.7 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, which is lower than that of the NP-Si. It is worth noting that, both for the HfO<sub>2</sub>/NP-Si and the TiO<sub>2</sub>/NP-Si, before reaching the saturated photocurrent density, the photocurrent densities decrease with the increase of the thickness of the passivation layer at the same bias voltage (such as −0.8 V). This phenomenon is because the speed of electrochemical reaction is slower than the speed of charge carriers’ transfer in electrode, which means that the electrochemical polarization dominates the electrode process.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>I–V curves of the pristine-Si (gray), the NP-Si (black), the HfO<sub>2</sub>(x)/NP-Si (<bold>a</bold>), and the TiO<sub>2</sub>(y)/NP-Si (<bold>b</bold>).

The flat band potential of the HfO<sub>2</sub>/NP-Si is elevated to a more negative potential that close to the CB of Si than that of the NP-Si, which means the bending of CB at the interface of the HfO<sub>2</sub>/NP-Si is smaller than that of the electrolyte/NP-Si. With increase in the thickness of HfO<sub>2</sub> layer, the carrier concentrations and flat band potentials of the HfO<sub>2</sub>/NP-Si have a small change. Because the HfO<sub>2</sub> passivation layer is an insulator, the charge is fixed in the HfO<sub>2</sub>. The interface properties of the HfO<sub>2</sub>/NP-Si have larger influence on the carrier concentration and flat band potential than the thickness of the HfO<sub>2</sub> layer. Different from the insulation layer of HfO<sub>2</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub> layer, as a semiconductor passivation layer, can greatly affect the space charge layer at the interface of TiO<sub>2</sub>/NP-Si. Then the carrier concentration and the flat band potential of the TiO<sub>2</sub>/NP-Si are dependent on the thickness of the TiO<sub>2</sub> layer. As presented in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4(b)</xref>, the carrier concentration in space charge layer increases with the thickness of TiO<sub>2</sub> monotonically, the contribution of the carrier concentration is not only from the NP-Si, but also from the TiO<sub>2</sub> layer. The flat band potential is elevated to −0.27 vs. SHE when the thickness of TiO<sub>2</sub> is 6 nm, which is close to the CB of TiO<sub>2</sub>. Benefiting from the deposited passivation layer, the carrier concentration and flat band potential are increased in both the HfO<sub>2</sub>/NP-Si and the TiO<sub>2</sub>/NP-Si. However, the dependence of the flat band positions and the carrier concentrations on the thickness of passivation layers are different.</p><p id="Par17"><xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> is the EIS of the NP-Si, the HfO<sub>2</sub>/NP-Si, and the TiO<sub>2</sub>/NP-Si with the different thicknesses of passivation layers. The EIS reflects the obstruction of charge carriers’ transportation from electrode to reactants in solution. In EIS, more attentions are paid to the front semicircle rather than the following arc or the oblique line, because the former belongs to electrochemical process at high frequency zone, and the latter corresponds to reactants diffusion or absorption processes at low frequency zone. As shown in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5(a)</xref>, for the HfO<sub>2</sub>/NP-Si, with increasing the thickness of HfO<sub>2</sub>, the radius of the front semicircle, i.e. the resistance of electrochemical reaction R<sub>r</sub>, decrease firstly and increase subsequently. The R<sub>r</sub> reflects carriers transport from the deep in Si to the interface of electrode/electrolyte for reacting with reactants. And the recombination at the interface of HfO<sub>2</sub>/NP-Si and tunneling effect will affect R<sub>r</sub>. With increasing the thickness of HfO<sub>2</sub> layer, the recombination rate of carriers is decreased, however the tunneling effect is also weakened. Hence, there is a trade-off between the two effects. The smallest R<sub>r</sub> of the HfO<sub>2</sub>/NP-Si is obtained when the thickness of HfO<sub>2</sub> layer is 3 nm, however it is still a slight larger than that of the NP-Si. While for the TiO<sub>2</sub>/NP-Si, the R<sub>r</sub> keep decreasing with increasing the thickness of TiO<sub>2</sub>. The changes of R<sub>r</sub> are consistent with the variation of photocurrent densities as shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3(a) and (b)</xref>, respectively. It is worth noting that the arc change into an oblique line after the thickness of TiO<sub>2</sub> is larger than 1 nm. This is attributed to the change of reactants diffusion zone in solution. When the speed of carriers transport for reacting with reactants at the interface of electrolyte/electrode (V<sub>ct</sub>) is faster than the speed of reactants diffusion from the region far away from interface to the interface (V<sub>rd</sub>), the V<sub>rd</sub> is equal to the limitation of the diffusion speed of reactants. Then the reactants diffusion zone will keep a fixed thickness to support an ultimate V<sub>rd</sub>. In the meantime, the front semicircle curve extends to an arc in EIS. When the V<sub>ct</sub> is slower than the V<sub>rd</sub>, the reactants diffusion zone in solution turns into a layer that varies with the V<sub>ct</sub>, then the arcs turn into the oblique lines in EIS.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of the NP-Si (gray), the HfO<sub>2</sub>/NP-Si (<bold>a</bold>) and the TiO<sub>2</sub>/NP-Si (<bold>b</bold>) with the different thickness x under illumination.

This is because the defects at interface are the main traps to capture charge carriers. The captured charge carriers are easy to recombine with the photogenerated carriers. The coating of passivation layers on NP-Si can effectively reduce the number of defects and suppress the recombination of charge carriers. The accumulation of photogenerated carriers at the interface can be measured as a function of the open-circuit potential (OCP). Thus, the density of defects at interface will be reflected from the decay speed of OCP. The normalized transient decay profiles of open-circuit potential (OCP) are displayed in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, which can measure the passivation effect at the interface between the passivation layers and NP-Si.

However, on account of the enormous amount of defects on the surface of the NP-Si, the photogenerated carriers rapidly combine with the captured charge carriers in a remarkably short period of time (&lt;0.08 s) when the light is turned off. Then the defects rapidly capture a large amount of thermal excitations carriers, which elevates the open-circuit potential to a stable level in a relative short period of time (~1.2 s). As a result, a sharp protuberance curve is presented in the decay profile of OCP as shown in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>. The passivation layers are the conformal layers, which can effectively reduce the number of defects. Even so, the recombination at surface still fast in the NP-Si, the changes of OCP are very weak after 10 s, due to complex geography that caused by nanoporous structure. With the increase of layer thickness, the decay curves become more and more relaxative in both the OCP decay profiles of the HfO<sub>2</sub>/NP-Si and the TiO<sub>2</sub>/NP-Si.

Then, the smoothed lines (the red line in <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) are used to analysis the changes of the photocurrent densities. The photocurrent density of NP-Si is greatly decrease from 22.4 to 12.1 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> after 12 hours illumination, and the decay ratio of photocurrent density is 46%, which is higher than the 15.5% of the pristine-Si. Although the photocurrent density of the NP-Si increases comparing to that of the pristine Si, the stability becomes worse. Because of its large surface to volume ratio, the photocurrent density of the NP-Si will decrease sharply, when the layer thickness of SiO<sub>x</sub> exceeds the effective thickness of tunneling effect after long time light illumination.
