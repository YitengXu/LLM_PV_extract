The authors concluded that the water-splitting activity of PSII has a minor role in H<sub>2</sub> evolution in nutrient-replete, mixotrophic cultures under hypoxia. However, their results with the PSII inhibitor DCMU also reveal that O<sub>2</sub> or acetate additions promoted acetate respiration over the usually dominant PSII-dependent pathway.

id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par16">The green microalga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> (hereafter referred to as <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>) has been largely investigated for its capacity to generate molecular H<sub>2</sub> (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]). Under anaerobic conditions, chloroplast-located [FeFe]-hydrogenase enzymes (HYDA1 and HYDA2) function as acceptors for electrons derived mostly from the photosynthetic electron transport. This activity prevents the over-reduction of electron carriers in the transport chain under the induction of photosynthesis and ultimately supports ATP formation. H<sub>2</sub> production acts as a safety valve releasing excess reducing power by the cell, and represents a survival strategy under stressful conditions.</p><p id="Par17">The discovery that the lack of nutrients such as sulfur from Tris–Acetate–Phosphate (TAP) medium enhances H<sub>2</sub> production capacity in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> has laid the basis for dozens of papers which describe the elaborate interplay of metabolic routes operating under these conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Electrons feeding the H<sub>2</sub> production process may derive from the PSII water-splitting activity, from mobilization of internal reserves entering the electron transport chain at the level of the plastoquinone (PQ) pool (e.g., starch) or through dark fermentative pathways (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]). Despite great advances in the field, this biotechnology is still far from being applicable. The time-consuming and expensive sulfur-deprivation step and its dependence on acetate limit its feasibility to laboratory conditions, with only three studies in the literature that used solar light and/or outdoor photobioreactors (PBRs) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]).</p><p id="Par18">Another major constraint in the application of nutrient-deprived media is that algal metabolism is highly impacted, leading to cell lysis and death unless the cell culture is re-supplemented with nutrients.</p><p id="Par19">H<sub>2</sub> production can also be induced under nutrient-replete conditions. Upon illumination of dark-adapted cultures, H<sub>2</sub> production is normally limited to few minutes, as the O<sub>2</sub> evolved by PSII in the light ends up irreversibly inhibiting [FeFe]-hydrogenases. Dark anaerobic incubation, i.e., flushing the culture with nitrogen or argon gas for a few hours in darkness, promotes the expression of hydrogenases, and in moderate light H<sub>2</sub> production is extended to 1–2 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Attempts at further prolonging incubation in the light resulted in the establishment of hypoxic conditions, with H<sub>2</sub> production lasting for days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], although at moderate efficiencies as compared to nutrient-deprived cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. While much information has been obtained on the electron transport processes operating in nutrient-deprived conditions, much less is known about hypoxia and the pathways supporting long-term H<sub>2</sub> production under nutrient-replete conditions.</p><p id="Par20">The present Commentary discusses the recent publication by Jurado-Oller et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] describing the process of H<sub>2</sub> production attained at low O<sub>2</sub> concentrations in complete TAP medium, with a focus on the potential electron sources and physiological conditions allowing H<sub>2</sub> production.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Main text</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Acclimation to hypoxia in nutrient-replete conditions and excess reducing power</title><p id="Par21">The first study to investigate the effects of prolonged hypoxia in the light in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> cultures was reported by Degrenne et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] using the wild-type strain 137AH. Establishment of a specific light-illuminated fraction within the PBR notably reduced the O<sub>2</sub> concentration in the culture and allowed H<sub>2</sub> evolution. After acclimation to hypoxia (between 4 and 15 days, depending on the experimental set-up, see Figs. 2B, 3B and 4B in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]), a burst in H<sub>2</sub> production was observed (with light intensities between 50 and 135 µmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>). The 3- to 4-day long H<sub>2</sub> production was accompanied by a reduction in protein content and a strong decrease of PSII photochemical efficiency (F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub>) (Figs. 3C and 4B in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]). The latter value was restored to about 0.3 as H<sub>2</sub> production ceased, along with slowly increasing O<sub>2</sub> concentrations, indicating that photosynthesis was partially recovered (Fig. 3C in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]). The amount of starch did not change over the course of the experiment and its contribution to the process was considered null.</p><p id="Par22">Later on, Scoma et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] tested acclimation to hypoxia under photoheterotrophic conditions using the D1 protein mutant strain L159I-N230Y. Here, low O<sub>2</sub> concentrations were set in the PBR by balancing the photosynthesis: respiration ratio, that is, by incubating dense cultures (between 40 and 80 mg chlorophyll a + b [Chl] L<sup>−1</sup>) at low light intensity (20 µmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>). These conditions are light-limiting for algal cells. Following an initial burst of H<sub>2</sub> production in the first 24 h, acclimation to hypoxia took place in 10 days, after which a constant H<sub>2</sub> accumulation occurred over a period of more than 14 days (Figs. 2 and 4 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]). Reducing power contributing to H<sub>2</sub> production was proposed to arise from PSII activity (biophotolysis) and proteins through photofermentation, with an indirect contribution from acetate. The amount of starch per cell increased over the course of the H<sub>2</sub> production phase, indicating that both biomass and H<sub>2</sub> could potentially be produced at the same time (Fig. 3 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]).</p><p id="Par23">Notwithstanding the different set-up, these two investigations showed some common features for the H<sub>2</sub> production achieved under hypoxic conditions in nutrient-replete media: (1) protein degradation may contribute to the H<sub>2</sub> production process via yet unknown pathways, (2) reduction in PSII photochemical efficiency coincided with the start of sustained H<sub>2</sub> gas production both in the absence and presence of acetate, supplied as an organic carbon source (autotrophy in Degrenne et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and mixotrophy in Scoma et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]). While the transient decrease of F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub> in Degrenne et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] coincided with the 3- to 4-day long H<sub>2</sub> release, in Scoma et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] the effective photochemical efficiency of PSII in the light (ΔF/F<sub>m</sub>′) followed an antiparallel pattern with respect to H<sub>2</sub> accumulation.</p><p id="Par24">These observations support the hypothesis formulated by Scoma et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] that a balanced photosynthesis: respiration ratio is a prerequisite for the establishment of hypoxia, resulting in a reduced PQ-pool and thus a low photochemical operating efficiency. The reason behind this is that electrons are continuously fed to the PQ-pool via respiration, and the plastid terminal oxidase (PTOX) responsible for PQ-pool oxidation is O<sub>2</sub>-dependent; moreover, at low light intensities PSI is also inefficient in oxidizing the PQ-pool. The physiological role of H<sub>2</sub> production in the cell is to act as a safety valve; thus, the over-reduced photosynthetic electron transport chain stimulates the expression of the hydrogenase enzyme (Table 2; Fig. 6 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]), via a high proton gradient around PSI and a reduced PQ-pool ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and references therein). While continuous H<sub>2</sub> production through a PSII-dependent pathway is accompanied by low PSII photochemical operating efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], transient H<sub>2</sub> productions are followed by a (partially) restored PSII efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], possibly due to the transient re-oxidation of the photosynthetic electron transport chain. This mechanism resembles the findings of Antal et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] under sulfur deprivation, with increasing ΔF/F<sub>m</sub>′ values coinciding with the onset of H<sub>2</sub> production.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The contribution of acetate respiration to H<sub>2</sub> production under nutrient-replete conditions</title><p id="Par25">Jurado-Oller et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] investigated the effect of acetate in TAP medium on the H<sub>2</sub> production of the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> strain 704 (cw15 arg7<sup>+</sup> Nia1:Ars mt<sup>+</sup>). Different O<sub>2</sub> levels were set and their impact on acetate consumption, starch accumulation, and H<sub>2</sub> output were compared. In normal, non-aerated cultures kept at low light intensities (12–50 µmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), the cells produced H<sub>2</sub> mostly in the first 24 h, followed by H<sub>2</sub> consumption during the 10-day experiment; at 100 µmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> no H<sub>2</sub> was evolved.</p><p id="Par26">In the earlier report by Scoma et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], adaptation to hypoxia took place in the first 10 days, during which <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> cells underwent critical physiological changes (Fig. 1 and Table 1 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]) that allowed a long-lasting H<sub>2</sub> production. The culture conditions differed slightly between Jurado-Oller et al. and Scoma et al., as the initial Chl content was 10 mg L<sup>−1</sup> in Jurado-Oller et al. (Fig. S1 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]), i.e., four times less than the initial Chl content in Scoma et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], whereas the light intensity was higher (12–100 µmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> vs. 20 µmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> in Scoma et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]). Both light intensity and Chl (or biomass) content affect the establishment of hypoxia in the culture, thereby impacting H<sub>2</sub> production pathways. The high biomass content and low light used in Scoma et al. served three purposes: (1), to reduce the O<sub>2</sub> output; (2), to increase the respiration capacity per volume of PBR thus preventing O<sub>2</sub> accumulation, which results in a more reduced state of the PQ-pool facilitating hydrogenase expression and H<sub>2</sub> production; (3) to slow down growth, thereby channeling the reducing power generated by the photosynthetic electron transport to H<sub>2</sub> production. The co-occurrence of these processes allowed adaptation to hypoxia, after which a sustained 14-day long H<sub>2</sub> production was observed that mostly relied on PSII activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">A dependence of H<sub>2</sub> production on acetate respiration was suggested by Jurado-Oller et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and potential pathways accounting for the acetate contribution to H<sub>2</sub> production were suggested (Fig. 6 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]). The authors surmised that acetate would enter the glyoxylate pathway, generating succinate as metabolic intermediate. The latter would be oxidized by a succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in the chloroplast, reducing FAD<sup>2+</sup> to FADH<sub>2</sub>, which in turn may reduce the PQ-pool and enter the electron transport chain. Alternatively, malate also resulting from the glyoxylate pathway could be oxidized to oxaloacetate by a malate dehydrogenase (MDH) located in the chloroplast, thereby reducing NADP<sup>+</sup> to NADPH, with the latter oxidized by the PQ-pool and entering the H<sub>2</sub> production pathway. Finally, oxaloacetate itself may be oxidized in the dark by a pyruvate:ferredoxin reductase (PFR), entering the dark fermentative pathway as proposed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">The conclusion that acetate respiration contributes significantly to H<sub>2</sub> production was based essentially on two types of experiments by Jurado-Oller et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. When the cultures were “aerated” (i.e., some O<sub>2</sub> was added by opening the vials), the amount of H<sub>2</sub> produced and the rate of acetate consumption increased, which were both essentially DCMU-insensitive (only 10–30% decrease upon DCMU treatment as compared to low light, Fig. 2A and E in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]). The other experiment consisted of adding 8.5 mM acetate to the cultures every 4 days, which resulted in a DCMU-insensitive increase in H<sub>2</sub> production (Fig. 4A and E in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]). Based on these results, the authors conclude that “H<sub>2</sub> production in LL (low light) mixotrophic cultures is mainly via PSII-independent pathways.” The acetate respiration supporting H<sub>2</sub> production may have operated through SDH and MDH, thus producing FADH<sub>2</sub> and NADH. This pathway would be independent of PSII activity, as it only requires photosystem I (PSI) to transfer electrons to the hydrogenase.</p><p id="Par29">Notwithstanding the potential indirect contribution from acetate respiration, this conclusion contradicts their observations that the addition of DCMU to normal non-aerated cultures irradiated with 12 µmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> resulted in a 72.4% decrease in H<sub>2</sub> production (compare Fig. 1A and E in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]). While the authors agree that “the level of inhibition of H<sub>2</sub> production by DCMU is subjected to the specific culture conditions”, they do not recognize that their operating conditions were unfavorable for a PSII-based H<sub>2</sub> production. In cultures with relatively low biomass, exposed to O<sub>2</sub> and high acetate levels, respiration pathways are very likely to be stimulated. These conditions may have lowered the activity of the PSII-dependent pathway. Provided that O<sub>2</sub> was available, acetate respiration and its potential contribution to H<sub>2</sub> production were enhanced. Unfortunately, the photochemical efficiency of PSII (either F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub> or ΔF/F<sub>m</sub>′) was not measured, neither was the in vitro hydrogenase activity. Differences in cellular redox potentials may also explain why cultures tested under identical light regimes achieved 1.9 and 3.2% H<sub>2</sub> partial pressure in the presence and absence of elemental sulfur, respectively (compare low light in Fig. 1A and Fig. S3A in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]). In addition, some cultures consumed H<sub>2</sub> gas although its concentration was below 5% H<sub>2</sub> partial pressure, which has been shown to be the critical threshold between H<sub>2</sub> production and oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Significant metabolic changes may occur once PSII-dependent electron transport is blocked in hypoxia-acclimated cells as by DCMU addition. In Scoma et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], these cells produced H<sub>2</sub> in the light and in the dark (Fig. 4 and Table 2 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]) while consuming acetate and producing a minor amount of formate and ethanol (Fig. 5 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]). DCMU treatment of hypoxia-acclimated cells resulted in no additional acetate consumption, but enhanced succinate, formate, and ethanol production, which were independent on illumination (Fig. 5 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]). These results demonstrate that the contributions of the various metabolic pathways to H<sub>2</sub> production may largely vary depending on the culture conditions. Enhanced respiration rates upon O<sub>2</sub> and acetate addition in cells tested in hypoxia by Jurado-Oller et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] may have altered these fermentative pathways, with DCMU treatment further impacting the intermediate metabolites possibly entering the H<sub>2</sub> production pathway.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par31">H<sub>2</sub> metabolism operating in hypoxic conditions in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> does not appear to be less complicated than the one activated upon sulfur deprivation. Depending on the conditions, competition for reduced ferredoxin in nutrient-replete conditions may favor several electron acceptors other than hydrogenase, driving much reducing power out of the H<sub>2</sub> production pathway. Culture conditions also have an impact on the metabolic routes supporting H<sub>2</sub> production. Since H<sub>2</sub> production is primarily a safety valve releasing excess reducing power, analysis of the cellular redox state may provide critical information on the contribution of the different pathways supporting the process. Addition of specific inhibitors and nutrients may enhance the contribution of pathways that previously had a minor role.</p><p id="Par32">Based on the recent data by Jurado-Oller et al., it can be concluded that during H<sub>2</sub> production in nutrient-replete conditions:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par33">Electrons derived from acetate respiration which are not used for growth may enter the H<sub>2</sub> production process;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par34">The presence of O<sub>2</sub> may result in an increased contribution of acetate respiration to H<sub>2</sub> production.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par35">Jurado-Oller et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] proposed that cell cultures in hypoxia may potentially use two possible pathways for acetate respiration in the light, which involve succinate and/or malate. Metabolomics and/or analysis of the transcriptomic or proteomic response under different culture conditions may clarify which one is responsible for H<sub>2</sub> production. Integration of such data with hydrogenase expression and PSII photochemical efficiency should also highlight which physiological condition triggers one pathway or another under nutrient-replete, hypoxic conditions. In particular, the following questions remain unanswered regarding acetate respiration supporting H<sub>2</sub> evolution:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par36">What is the photochemical efficiency of PSII and the in vitro hydrogenase expression level and activity when acetate respiration contributes substantially to H<sub>2</sub> evolution?</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par37">Which metabolites are actually produced (if any) during H<sub>2</sub> evolution in the light and in the dark?</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par38">What is the acetate-to-H<sub>2</sub> energy conversion efficiency as compared to acetate-to-biomass?</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par39">What are the alternative electron sinks at the PSI acceptor side?</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par40">Based on the available data, the present protocol by Jurado-Oller et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] may represent less stressful conditions as compared to the ones described in Degrenne et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] or Scoma et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and has the potential to be operated for a longer period of time, although H<sub>2</sub> production yields remain still very low relative to cultures deprived of sulfur. However, the usage of photosynthetic microalgae through a PSII-independent pathway may not be a viable option for H<sub>2</sub> production as compared to microbial fermentative biotechnologies using bacterial consortia and biowastes. Therefore, research efforts with oxygenic photosynthetic microbes should be directed at promoting PSII-dependent pathways using water as an electron source.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Authors’ contributions</title><sec><p>AS conceived the project.
