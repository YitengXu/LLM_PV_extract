The paper presents investigation of electric performance of novel chemiresistor NO<sub>x</sub> gas sensors. A novel material was utilized for active sensing layer-conductive copolymer and zinc oxide blend. The main advantage of the presented solution is low-cost and environment-friendly production. A series of this type of sensors was manufactured and tested experimentally. During the tests, the gas flow was controlled and signals of sensor responses, temperature, and humidity were computer-acquired using LabVIEW program. Sensor behavior for different thicknesses of the active layer has been investigated and interpreted. The research revealed that the electrical resistance of the sensors has changed in predictable manner depending on the gas concentrations. A recurrent artificial neural network architecture is proposed as a mathematical model to classify sensor responses to gas concentrations variation in a time-dependent regime. In this research, an enhanced method for gas concentration prediction is proposed using non-linear autoregression model with exogenous input (NARX). The performed simulations show good agreement between simulated and experimental data useful for predictions of sensor gas

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Organic thin films devices have recently attracted significant attention for a wide variety of uses including printing inks, colorants, photoconductors, solar cells, electrochromic, and gas sensors. Microfabrication of gas sensors based on nanostructured materials and very low power consumption are indispensable technologies for modern society. Such sensors are used in various sectors including the mining industry for detection of mine methane, automotive for detection of combustion gases from vehicles, in medical applications for bioelectronic noses that mimics human olfaction, in air quality monitoring for estimation of greenhouse gas emissions. Chemical sensors are also used for the detection of gas, for water and soil pollutants, temperature, speed, magnetic field, and emission control. A chemical sensor is an electronic circuit element that changes in physical and chemical structure, when it absorbs in the surface layer a chemical stimulant. The electrical properties of the sensors are thus changed and subsequently converted into measurable quantities. Main pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), sulfur oxides (SO<sub>x</sub>), hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), particulates matter (PM), lead (Pb), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can negatively impact climate and human health, causing respiratory illness. The industrial and high temperature combustion processes, the indiscriminate hazard chemical poison use in agriculture related to the continuous increase in technological progress, affect atmospheric characteristics leading to air pollution. Urban air pollution related to nitrogen dioxide NO2 is a worldwide concern. Long-term exposure to NO2 results in adverse human health consequences and causes many diseases of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Biological factors and genetic predisposition determine individual vulnerability and susceptibility. Pollution hazards influence individual vulnerability by age, sex, education, socioeconomic status, location residence, and occupation. Air pollution has a negative impact on people’s health and well-being, particularly on the most vulnerable populations such as children, women, and people living in developing countries. The economic costs of air pollution are enormous for sustainable development. Economic growth that accepts air pollution and ignores public health and environmental impacts is unethical and unsustainable. In addition, health care costs due to pollution-related diseases account for 7% of the national health budget [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The release of toxic chemicals and vapors is also an alarming threat to the ecosystems of the biosphere. Clean air and water are important elements for life on Earth, and air pollution also threatens the sustainability of Earth’s environment. The alarming trend of contaminant concentrations requires early detection and monitoring in urban environment. Passive diffusion tube sampling methods have been adopted to study the spatial and temporal variability of NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. The automated measurements applied to pipe extraction, preparation, and co-location are important considerations in assessing the measurements validity. Urban area hotpots for NO<sub>2</sub> pollution provide precise spatial details of surrounding sampling sites and additional information on pollutant distribution, dispersion, and human exposure through urban environments. A single NO<sub>x</sub> diffusion tube approach facilitates the identification of NO<sub>2</sub> hotspots by providing precise spatial details of where air quality is deteriorated through sampling over a 12-month period and covering all seasonal variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A bimodal distribution of NOx concentration and nitric oxide (NO) is related to seasonal variation and daily average [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Comparing trends in concentrations of these pollutants over diurnal or seasonal cycles, the temperature influences the NO<sub>2</sub>/NO<sub>x</sub> ratio. This data ratio is in line with that of several urban areas in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Atmospheric Environment Automated Monitoring Station provides data on temporal and spatial variations useful for the estimation of NO<sub>x</sub> concentrations and their relationships with various pollutants and meteorological factors. A more relevant industrial chimneys and motorized vehicles presence contribute to an high concentration of NO<sub>x</sub> vapor. Diesel vehicle emissions are responsible for large amounts of nitrogen compounds in urban areas, especially when they move slowly and showed a potential increase in damage human health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Many approaches in literature, comparing urban environments, provide an initial air quality and air pollution screening tool to support air quality assessment studies. The application of these empirical models for estimating the conversion rate from NO<sub>x</sub> to NO<sub>2</sub> is the key for improving air quality and to reduce the potential impact on human health and ecosystems with air pollution reduction plans.</p><p id="Par3">The use of accurate monitoring systems and gas sensors has a crucial role for gas detection in industrial environment, but also in buildings where a good air quality is required. These devices are usually equipped with a chemically selective layer that interacts with its surroundings as a sensor layer. As a result of the interaction, the sensing layer changes its properties, e.g., conductivities resulting from the adsorption of the analyte molecule on the surface of such a layer. Organic semiconductor gas sensor based on advanced nano- and microfabrication technology has the advantages in manufacturing, cost and room temperature, compared to other semiconductor gas sensors. The nanotechnologies contribution consists in new materials developing with a large active surface area for the absorption of gaseous molecules to improve sensing performance. Carbon-based nanomaterials such as graphene have been widely used for NO<sub>2</sub> sensors at room temperature. Numerous approaches have confirmed efficiency of electrically conductive polymeric materials and graphene composite due to their excellent conductivity and large surface area, applied to gas sensor but also to electrochemical biosensors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In recent laboratory studies, a series of polypyrrole/graphene oxide reduced and polypyrrole/graphene oxide covalently bound nanocomposites with 4-carboxybenzene diazonium aryl salt nanocomposites have been used to evaluate their resistive sensitivity chemical properties for detecting NO<sub>2</sub> gases at room temperature. The synthesis of the nanocomposite ppy-graphene has been obtained by the addition of graphene in the polymeric solution and in the polymerization reaction process. Graphene and carbon-based nanofillers, in general, have been provided to improve the gas detection properties and to boost both sensitivity and specificity; however, the agglomeration of graphene affects the polymer matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In addition, other compounds have been tested for the same application. Composites of carbon nanotubes and ZnO (CNTs&amp;/ZnO) have exhibited better electrical performance under CO exposure with the improvement of the response time of 60% compared with ZnO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. ZnO nanostructures are ideal chemical compounds for operating sensing and selecting applications due to their multifunctional properties such as as high surface, high crystallinity, and organized molecular structure. In the recent development, ZnO nanocomposites for their temperature, stability, and flexibility have been applied to product NO<sub>2</sub> gas sensors. These features led to many attempts to optimize the semiconductor’s properties for gas sensing applications by creating new morphologies and crystallographic shapes of ZnO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Metal oxides such as ZnO and SnO<sub>2</sub> rather cheap and simple had a considerable diffusion in the past [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Subsequently, alternative oxides were developed as active sensing layers for the detection of gas analytes, starting from oxides such as CuO, Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub>, CoO, and binary systems obtained by coupling of other elements to oxides, such as NiO–Au or TiO2–Pt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, sensors equipped with mixed oxides such as BaT iO2 and non-stoichiometric oxides (Sn1-xT ixO2, Y:Ba:Cu:O, Bi:Sr: Ca:Cu:O) showed greater sensitivity and selectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Semiconductor-based chemiresistor sensors are the most investigated sensor structures for the detection of combustible and toxic gases changing their electrical resistance as a result of the interaction between the semiconductor and the tested gas atmosphere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Two-dimensional layered MoS2 nanostructure-based gas sensor synthesized by a solvothermal method for formaldehyde (HCHO) gas sensing applications and the poly (para-phenylene terephthalamide)—NiO@CuO gas sensor for the detection of NH3 achieved at room temperature were reported in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. For detecting ppb-level NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations at room temperature, and taking advantage from the influence of UV radiation on temperature and resistivity of ZnO layer, a novel sensor regenerated by UV light with suitable material of Sol-gel synthesized Al-doped ZnO was introduced in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A portable gas-sensing system which is periodically irradiated with light from a pulsed ultraviolet light emitting diode (UV-LED) was fabricated for sensing ppb-level NO<sub>2</sub> gas made of a composite iron oxide/multi-walled carbon nanotubes/tungstenoxide (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/MWCNTs/WO<sub>3</sub>) material that was produced by a one-pot polyol method followed by metal organic decomposition (MOD) as reported in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">The artificial neural networks (ANNs) are bio-inspired computing systems for data processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and have found wide a large field of applications related to sensors and sensing techniques, including gas sensors, thermal conductivity, water hybrid nanofluid, tellurite glass system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The most common application are predictions based on sensor arrays input data, e.g., identification of gas mixtures, lubricant content or structure stress and utilizing of ANNs for calibration processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The electronic noses (ENOSE) system is capable of monitoring propane-2-ol, methanol, acetone, ethylmethylketone, hexane, benzene, and xylene using an array of sensors and ANNs in environmental monitoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Similar applications regarding sensor response prediction by artificial intelligence techniques are presented in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. An empirical formulation of the neural network model combines Least Absolute Selection and Shrinkage Operator (LASSO) and Regression and Nonlinear Autoregressive (NARX) models to regulate the data collected by the micro-air quality detector. LASSO-NARX model, is used for testing the correlation between the concentration of air pollutants and its influencing factors highlighting their relationship. The predicted value of each pollutant concentration in the LASSO regression and the LASSO-NARX model is constructed using the NARX neural network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">The following paper presents investigation on a completely innovative material utilized for active sensing layer-conductive copolymer and ZnO blend. In the present research, four chemiresistor gas sensors were fabricated and characterized by different thickness of the active sensing layer based on conductive copolymer and ZnO blend in laboratories of the Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice, Poland (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> presents the microscopic images). All the developed sensor structures in the form of chemiresistors were tested experimentally. Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> is the photograph of the chamber in which the four manufactured sensors were exposed to the flowing gas mixture. For this purpose, a gas server dosing gas analyte with a known concentration was used, through computer-controlled flow meters. The effect of the gas atmosphere on the structures made, manifested by a change in the resistance of the sensor layer, was measured using a precise multi-channel automatic resistance meter. In parallel, parameters of the gas atmosphere such as humidity and temperature were monitored. The entire setup was computer controlled. Sensor behavior for different thicknesses of the active layer has been investigated and interpreted.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The interdigital transducers examined under the microscope Nikon Eclipse E2000 (objective 5 × 0.15) on the left and SEM (Inspect S50, FEI, USA) image of elaborated organic–inorganic sensing layer on ITD substrate on right side</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10854_2022_9318_Fig1_HTML.jpg" id="MO1"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>General view of gas chamber with the inlet and outlet pipes on left side and elaborated chemiresistors on right side</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10854_2022_9318_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par7">The experiments revealed that the electrical resistance of the sensors has changed significantly depending on the gas concentrations. The next step was to investigate the predictability of the developed sensors. The goal was to find a numerical model that would mimic the behavior of the discussed chemoresistive gas sensors. Such model allows to better understand the sensor operation and perform further tests only by simulation. Combining gas sensors performance and data analysis allows to increase the efficiency of the sensing devices utilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">The novelty of the presented research has been addressed in a numerical model that mimics the described new type of gas sensor. A nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) has been trained to mimic the behavior of the considered chemiresistor sensors. Such approach has allowed to have an efficient prediction of the sensor response to the given time-dependent concentrations of NO<sub>x</sub>, temperature, and humidity. The goal was to determine a model that simulates the fabricated sensors as accurately as possible. For this reason, a model optimization procedure was applied. In finding the best possible neural network, hyperparameter optimization was performed considering two criteria: minimizing the mean-square error between the predicted and experimentally measured sensor responses and minimizing the model itself (the number of neural neurons). In this way, relatively simple and accurate predictor was obtained and tested. Tests were performed using data with white Gaussian noise added to ensure the model that had the necessary generalization abilities and was not overfitted.</p><p id="Par9">Details about the fabrication process of the chemiresistor sensors are given in Sect. <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">2</xref>.

Chemoresistor-based array can be integrated as organic transistors and organic semiconducting materials (defined as an organic field-effect transistor (OFET)), made on flexible and stretchable substrates requiring a sensor device structure and flexible transducers for electronic biosensing. In our case, the chemiresistors were prepared on n-doped (0.02 Ω/cm) Czochralski (CZ)-grown silicon wafer with 195 nm thick thermal oxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>). The interdigital electrodes were formed on the top of the dielectric layer by physical vapor deposition (PVD) process. The deposition of thin chromium layer (20 nm) by thermal evaporation was made to improve the adhesion of thermally evaporated gold thin films (100 nm). The interdigitated electrodes were realized by photolithography process. In this work, 3 × 10 µm interdigital transducers were used, in which the electrode width was 3 µm, and the gap between the electrodes was 10 µm.  After the process of washing and preparation of the substrates for the application of the sensor layer, they were inspected under the microscope Nikon Eclipse E2000 with objective LU Plan Fluor 5 × 0.15, and then, the active layer was deposited on the substrate. A conductive comb-graft copolymer called SilPEG H6 was dissolved in chloroform (CHCl3, POCh)—2.5 mg per 1 ml was sonicated and stirred for 30 min. ZnO nanomaterial (1 mg), which was obtained by hydrothermal method, was also dispersed in chloroform (5 ml) for 30 min using the ultrasonic. ZnO and the solution of the graft comb copolymer were mixed together under ultrasonic dispersing for 10 min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The obtained dispersion of the organic–inorganic blend was applied on each substrate using drop coating method in ambient condition. A wire bonder (53XX-BDA, F&amp;K DELVOTEC) was then used to provide electrical connection between the elaborated sensors and the rest of the measuring system, using 25 µm gold wire.

The production involves low-cost materials and well-known laboratory techniques. Experiments revealed that the active layer, based on innovative organic–inorganic material blend, actively changed the electrical resistance for different gas concentrations in a predictable manner. Data acquisition system was used in order to perform electrical and gas sensing characterization to acquire, in real time, the signals of the sensors responses that were dependent on the air and NOx gas flows, as well as on the temperature and humidity in a stainless steel gas chamber. The test stand consisted of digital mass flow controller interface, gas test chamber with the fabricated sensors, pressurized gas cylinders, digital interface, and DAQ system. During the tests, LabVIEW program was developed to control all testing parameters and measurements and to manage the transport gas flow rate. An artificial neural network (ANN) was developed in order to mimic the behavior of the tested sensors as accurately as possible. A robust hyperparameter optimization was performed with two criteria – minimal size of the numerical model and its maximal accuracy. The network chosen for consideration, with 9 neurons in the hidden layer, has proven to be of satisfactory accuracy, both in the training process and in the further testing where noise was added to the inputs. Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref> clearly shows that the obtained network has the ability to generalization and has not been overfitted. The utilized gas sensors' modeling methodology and further strengthening of sensing performances (in terms of sensitivity, response, and recovery time) can ensure the development of large-scale production of sensors to be used for gas pollution detection.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>W.M. acknowledges the National Science Centre, Poland (Grant DEC-2019/03/X/ST8/00405—Application of high-throughput parallel real-time computations using FPGAs and AI techniques) for supporting research stay in the University of Catania, which enabled the execution of the study.
