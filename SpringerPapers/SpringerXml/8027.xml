Recently, along with the raising importance of healthcare, a large number of researches have been conducted to improve the antibacterial feature of nanoparticles. However, the application of certain antimicrobial materials has been restricted due to their lesion or toxicity. Inorganic antibacterial factors have a very high bacterial resistance and thermal stability. In recent years, researchers have highly noticed the Cadmium Oxide, its applications and properties in optoelectronic devices such as: solar cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], optical transistors, glassy electrodes, gas sensors, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These applications of Cadmium Oxide have been resulted from its individual electrical and optical features. Cadmium Oxide nanoparticles have been applied by many scholars up to now. In the same way, we have used Cadmium Oxide nanoparticles to confront bacteria which are pathogenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. <italic>Staphylococci</italic> are Gram-positive sphere shaped cells that generally array in form of irregular groups like grape clusters and grow in many mediums as well. <italic>Staphylococcus Aureus</italic> produces variable toxins and enzymes which are the major reason of bacteria survival; proteins, fats, and carbohydrates breakdown in order to provide necessitate materials, resistance against drugs and the ability of bacteria to cause disease. Some of these enzymes are Coagulase, Hemolysin, Leukocidin, Penicillinase, Lipase, Hyaluronidase, Catalase, and Protease. The enterotoxins of this microbe are dispersed by bacteria cells into the food or medium. The enterotoxin producing <italic>staphylococci</italic> are always able to produce Coagulase, but not all the positive Coagulase <italic>Staphylococci</italic> are usually capable of producing enterotoxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The synthesis of the nanomaterial effective on bacteria with high efficiency can be applied for disinfection and the elimination of environmental and industrial bacteria. It is expected that nanomaterial obtained in a variety of synthesis procedures enjoying different properties; hence, its antibacterial effect is essential. As it is difficult for most people to cope with the rising cost of combating pathogenic bacteria, finding a low price and prompt method to control its development and activity is a matter of the utmost importance. According to the fact that the bacteria are more resistant to prevalent drugs, the use of nanoparticles in hygiene and medicine is putative and they can be appropriate alternatives for traditional antibiotics; moreover, the production cost is lower and their storage is much easier compared to any other medicine. <italic>Staphylococcus Aureus</italic> is one of hospital’s infectious resistant to traditional antibiotics, such as Beta-lactam, and is responsible for Gastroenteritis led by producing enterotoxin in food. Due to the importance of noted issues, in this research, we intend to study the effect of Cadmium oxide nanoparticles on <italic>Staphylococcus Aureus.</italic> We analyze the antibacterial effect of Cadmium Oxide nanoparticles on <italic>Staphylococcus Aureus</italic> bacteria in this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Absorbance spectrums UV–Vis of Cadmium Oxide nanoparticles</title><p>This spectrometry is in regard to the transmissions between the electron scales. Generally, such transmissions are made between bonding orbital or non-bonding electron pairs and non-bonding orbital. Consequently, the link between the absorbance peaks wavelength and bonds emerged in the case study species seems to be feasible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Visible-Ultraviolet spectrums of Cadmium Oxide nanoparticles are appeared in Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Although the wavelength of spectrum is limited by means of the light source, the absorbance band of nanoparticles represents a conversion in color location resulted from the amount of available limitation in the specimen comparing to the Cadmium Oxide nanoparticles. This optical phenomenon represents that these nanoparticles illustrate the level of quantum effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. At the very level, the development of nanoparticles depends on the surfactant and organic solvent, since the Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) surfactant helps to the cohesion of synthesized nanoparticles’ surface. Therefore, as a result of this interaction, stabilizing of particles and balancing the development or growth of the particles’ cores are emerged to achieve a high level of uniformity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The Acetic acid and Ethanol solvent assist the dispersion of particles identically, a deliberate growth of particles in limited sizes, and the prevention of the particles integration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>The UV absorbance spectrum for CdO nanoparticles.</bold></p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/12951_2014_Article_26_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Electron microscope analysis</title><p>The image of synthesized Cadmium Oxide nanoparticles is visible in the Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.

In the other research, the researchers studied antimicrobial effects of CeO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles on <italic>Staphylococcus Aureus</italic>. Their applied nanoparticles size was 37.6 nm and their results showed that the antibacterial effects of CeO<sub>2</sub> depend on applied doses and the inhibition property developed by nanoparticles attested their antibacterial effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In 2009, Ayala et al. could inhibit <italic>Staphylococcus Aureus</italic> by Ag nanoparticles. They could also verify the antibacterial effect of Ag nanoparticles by well diffusion method protocol, subsequently, they could define minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of which by macro dilution method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In research by Rafie et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] in Egypt, they could control <italic>Staphylococcus Aureus</italic> and <italic>E.Coli</italic> by using Ag nanoparticles inside cotton crop. In a research, the researchers studied the effect of Titanium Oxide nanoparticles on <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> and they concluded that those have descent antibacterial effect on this gram positive bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] of which the same results of present study have achieved in antibacterial effect. Experiments were done to study the CrO nanoparticles toxicity on gram positive bacteria of human immune system and gram negative bacteria such as <italic>Shigella</italic> that their results imply the toxic nature of CrO nanoparticle for variable microbial systems and human T-lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In 2011, researchers studied CrO and CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles impacts on <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> and the results showed that CrO has higher bacterial killing power against <italic>Staphylococcus Aureus</italic> in comparison with CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and in general, both nanoparticles have antibacterial effect; however, CrO had a better function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] showing what we approved in the antibacterial effect of Cadmium oxide nanoparticles in this research. As for the high toxicity of Cadmium oxide nanoparticles, they are used to eliminate <italic>Staphylococcus Aureus</italic> in vitro and to eradicate the environment bacteria as well as cleaning medical supplies and equipment contaminated by that bacteria.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the recent study, along with the elevation in Cadmium Oxide nanoparticles concentration, the antimicrobial property augments and the bacteria growth rate declines being in line with the other researches about the nanoparticles effect on microorganisms. It can be concluded that at the presence of nanoparticles the cell destruction prompts. It is proposed to use cadmium oxide nanoparticles in elimination of environmental bacteria resistant to traditional antibiotics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Two different methods were used to analyze the sensibility of <italic>Staphylococcus Aureus</italic> to Cadmium Oxide nanoparticles in order to confirm the results. Different concentrations of each nanoparticle were separately cultured on <italic>Staphylococcus Aureus</italic> (according to half McFarland) in the Mueller Hinton Agar bearing different Cadmium Oxide nanoparticles. No nanoparticles medium was used for control group. The bacteria grew in 37°C for 24 hours. Then, the number of colonies was compared with the specimen, and to enumerate a hemocytometer, a scaled lam with definite volume was used. Subsequently, the number of bacteria in the spaces of lam was enumerated, next, 9 ml of the medium suspension was mixed with 1 ml of methylene blue and it was found that the bacteria took the color and converted to blue. In the second method, the bacteria in Trypticase™ Soy Broth were placed separately. The number of bacteria was measured every one hour. Optical density (<italic>OD</italic>) in the wavelength of 600 nm was applied by the absorbance of foregoing solutions in the spectrophotometric device to measure the concentration of bacteria. The number of bacteria was compared with the control group in variable times and turbidimetric analysis was carried out for enumerating the bacteria in the medium. In this method, some of the bacteria were posed in cultured suspension in a test tube with definite diameter and the tube in was placed the optical beam of spectrophotometer with 600 nm wavelength in a way that, initially, 100 ml of nutrient broth sterile was added to any of 11 sterile tubes and then 100 μl of nanomaterial suspension was added to the tube no. 1. After shaking the content of the tube, 1 ml of the material was transferred to the tube no. 2. In the same way, we provided the dilution series up to the tube no. 9 and shook the content of each tube subsequently. The tubes no. 10 and 11 were considered as the evidence. The tube no. 10 was considered as the evidence for nanoparticles suspension (containing bacteria and no nanoparticles) and the tube no. 11 as the evidence for the medium (with no bacteria cells and nanoparticles). By addition of 100 μl of the bacteria suspension to serial dilution tubes and heating the tubes to reach a concentration of half McFarland in 37°C, the minimum of growth inhibitory concentration was determined accurately for each bacterium.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Preparation and the method of Cadmium Oxide nanoparticles analysis</title><p>To produce Cadmium Oxide nanoparticles in this study, in one experiment, the first solution sample with 0.06M Acetic acid and 0.03M Cadmium Sulfate was provided with 40 mg Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) as the surfactant in 1 liter of double distilled water. Subsequently, the first solution was added to the second one and the obtained sediment was filtered by the Whatman filter paper, then, it was dried out in hot air stove of 80°C for 1 hour approximately. In the next level, it was transmitted to Silica crucible (41°C) and burned in 400°C about 2 hours, then, the resulted powder was cleansed with Ethanol to eliminate the impurities available in the particles for 3-4 times. The characteristics of obtained nanoparticles were studied by the use of X-ray diffraction, visible Spectroscopy absorbance - Ultraviolet, and it was utilized in order to study its antibacterial characteristics. Morphological analysis and the observation of synthesized Cadmium Oxide nanoparticles were carried out with the visible Spectroscopy-Ultraviolet device, double beam TU-1901, X-ray diffraction device D/Max-RA employing CuKα radiation and composite Electron microscope JEM-200CX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Selection, separation and cultivation of clinical specimens</title><p>To provide clinical specimens, the <italic>Staphylococcus Aureus</italic> bacteria were separated from urine culture of the hospital remedial ward.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Provision of bacteria and cultures</title><p><italic>Staphylococcus Aureus</italic> bacteria were provided from Shiraz University of Medical Sciences and approved by means of microbiological common methods.
