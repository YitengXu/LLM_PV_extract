The status of renewable and non renewable sources as well as load is obtained through the multi-agent system (MAS) to regulate a controllable source as per the deficit between demand and supply. The message interchange in the MAS is considered to be compatible with a user data gram protocol/internet protocol-based network. The present study implements the application of MAS to control a smart microgrid in a Matlab/simulation environment. The simulation results reveal that the present MAS can provide the persistent transition from microgrid when disturbances occur. This indicates the effectiveness of MAS as a technology for controlling the microgrid process. A fractional order (FO) based controller is employed and its parameters are optimized through gravitational search algorithm. The FO controller demonstrates enhanced performance in contrast to the integer order controller under linear as well as nonlinear operating conditions. Furthermore, the proposed controller additionally exhibits its superiority in terms of robustness against parameter changes and disconnection of various components.</p></abstract><kwd-group

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">For the recent hundreds of years, Fossil fuel is the principle source to create power. As we realize that fossil fuel isn’t accessible in plenteous. It gives the trouble flag to create and utilize new sustainable power sources. Energy condition in developing countries is exceptionally crucial and most of the power units are operated by natural gas or other natural resources. Therefore, the natural reserve has tumbled to its impediments and it might keep going for further couple of years. So the age of power from elective sources has turned into the need for world. One of the essential requirements for financial advancement in any country on the planet is the accessibility of reliable power supply system with low carbon impression levels. Microgrid system which utilizes sustainable sources may be a compelling arrangement of this power emergency. Solar and wind energies are considered as the most suitable solution to the present situation. As both are pollution free and available in abundance. Renewable energy sources nowadays play an important role in eco friendly electric power generation systems. Microgrid is a viable solution to incorporate renewable sources into distributed network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Besides controlling of non controllable sources is the challenging assignment. Inferable from the presence of non controllable power sources, there is dependably an issue of demand and supply in a microgrid. The solution for such problem, one is to furnish microgrid with diesel generator/gas alternator/battery/energy component to cross over any barrier between the power created by the sustainable sources and loads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However the working expense and emission level of such system are altogether high contrasted with environmentally friendly power sources. Hence microgrid should employ control schemes to resolve the power quality issues like stability due to the practical varying input energy and load while augmenting the utilization of the sustainable resources. The performance of microgrid is influenced by the controller parameters and indulgence of renewable energy sources. Recently, optimal control of microgrid has become the challenging field in research area. Various optimization search methods like genetic algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], particle swarm intelligence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], self-organizing migrating algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and electromagnetism algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] have been used for controller tuning in microgrid to suppress interruption. Intelligent frequency control techniques using fuzzy logic too shows tremendous improvement in system performance against load changes and disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Research based on fractional calculus has been gaining attention due to its flexibility and effective solution to the control design application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Podlubny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] proposed a fractional controller where the fractional integral and fractional differential terms with controller gain were used. Since then, there is lot of research work has been done on fractional order PIDs (FOPIDs) and employed in numerous domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Various research papers for tuning of FOPID can be found in the literature such as Ziegler–Nichols-type rules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], optimal tuning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], tuning for robustness control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], auto-tuning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and tuning based on reducing the number of parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In the same line, various advanced control strategy based on FOPID controllers were proposed. For example, Smith indicators structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], internal mode controller [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], hybrid control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], gain scheduling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and many others. Latest surveys in the evolution of FOPIDs can be viewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Furthermore, some usages of fractional calculus are also reported in field of Biomedical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], electro-hydraulic system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], robotic manipulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], Pneumatic position servo system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], Industrial process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and water level control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Incorporation of computational intelligence with fractional calculus has led to considerable attention of many researchers in the field of power system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">The fundamental operation of any power system depends upon control design. The control design comprising of hardware and software units is used for communicating system status and control signals. In ordinary electric power system, this is executed by Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. In recent time, the controlling and supervision activity of electric power system are done by automated agent system, which is commonly known as a multi-agent system. A MAS is a combination of few agents working together to achieve the objective of the system. The MAS has now turned into a useful tool in creating complex frameworks owing to the properties of autonomy, sociality, reactivity and pro-activity. The MAS is self-governing in the sense that they work without human interventions. The MAS also has social ability as they are associated with different agents by means of some sort of operator communication protocol. The agents see and respond to their conditions. Finally, the MAS are proactive because they can show objective oriented behaviour by taking activities. The exhaustive details of centralized microgrid control operation of multi agent system (MAS) can be found in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. A centralized microgrid control system is economical because it reduces the number of individual controller for each energy storage system and hence improves the performance which declines due to complex loop connections. Further, there is no need of tuning each controller separately.</p><p id="Par4">This research work has proposed a centralized fractional order frequency controller based on the concept of MAS. Different components of microgrid interact through user data gram protocol/internet protocol (UDP/IP). The five parameters of FOPID controller, namely proportional gain constant, integral time constant, differentiator time constant, integral order, and differentiator order has been considered for tuning. The proposed controller parameters have been optimized by gravitational search algorithm (GSA). Moreover, GSA has been successfully implemented in many fields like AGC of interconnected power systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and in optimal controlling of DC microgrid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Since it needs just two parameters and has capability to discover global optimum, therefore it gives better outcomes when compared with other nature enlivened algorithms. Inferences from the above points of interest make this research work actualize the GSA for tuning the parameters of controller. The outcomes as far as performance indices, robustness against parametric variations, nonlinearities and disconnection of different components exhibit the viability of FOPID controller when contrasted with standard FOPI/PID/PI controller.</p><p id="Par5">This study is structured as in the subsequent way.

Section <xref rid="Sec14" ref-type="sec">3</xref> briefly introduces the FO controller Sect. <xref rid="Sec17" ref-type="sec">4</xref> describes the optimization technique.

In this study, microgrid consists of WTG (0.5 p.u), SPV (0.15 p.u), AE (0.002 p.u), FESS (0.01 p.u), UC (0.7 p.u), BESS (0.003 p.u), DEG (0.003 p.u), and FC (0.01 p.u). This study considered (1 − K<sub>n</sub>) fraction of total power of wind source and solar source is used by AE and rest of power given to microgrid where K<sub>n</sub> is equal to 0.6. The total load is estimated to be 1.0 p.u. under nominal circumstances and isolated micro grid is operated in 100% self sufficient mode. To accomplish the main objective of frequency control, we have employed the Multi Agent System concept into the microgrid. Each component of microgrid has been considered as an agent with IP address as given in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The designated IP address assists the server utilized as microgrid central controller (MGCC) to create a bidirectional data path between agents and the MGCC. Information collection from each load and source is achieved through multiple sensor and internet. MGCC works as a server, which gets the information from each source/load and generates the appropriate control signal according to the available information. The MGCC also maintains the status of loads as well as sources. The UDP/IP is used for information exchange between MGCC and the components of microgrid. Each agent sends and receives information through UDP send and UDP receive module. UDP send module conveys an input vector as a UDP message over an IP network. It also contains the information regarding receiver IP address as well as port address by which information will pass to the concerned agent. In the same way UDP receiver module contains the information regarding sender IP address as well as port address by which information are to be obtained by the receiving agent. The observed data are detected utilizing reasonable sensors and changed over to a digital data by analog to digital (A/D) converters and transmitted to the communication channel. On the other hand than a digital to analog (D/A) converter will interpret the information conveyed by the MGCC to the agents.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Block diagram of smart microgrid</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/42452_2019_1548_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig><table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>IP addresses of different agents of microgrid system</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Microgrid component as agent</p></th><th align="left"><p>Sending port address</p></th><th align="left"><p>Receiving port address</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>System agent</p></td><td align="left"><p>10.64.5.601/40101</p></td><td align="left"><p>–</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Load agent</p></td><td align="left"><p>10.64.5.601/40102</p></td><td align="left"><p>–</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Solar photo voltaic system agent</p></td><td align="left"><p>10.64.5.601/40103</p></td><td align="left"><p>–</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Wind turbine generator agent</p></td><td align="left"><p>10.64.5.601/40104</p></td><td align="left"><p>–</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Aqua Electrolyser (AE)</p></td><td align="left"><p>10.64.5.601/40301</p></td><td align="left"><p>–</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="3"><p><italic>Control unit</italic></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Fuel cell (FC)</p></td><td align="left"><p>10.64.5.601/40401</p></td><td align="left"><p>–</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Diesel engine generator (DEG)</p></td><td align="left"><p>10.64.5.601/40501</p></td><td align="left"><p>10.64.5.601/40203</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Flywheel energy storage system (FESS)</p></td><td align="left"><p>10.64.5.601/40601</p></td><td align="left"><p>10.64.5.601/40204</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Ultra capacitor (UC)</p></td><td align="left"><p>10.64.5.601/40701</p></td><td align="left"><p>10.64.5.601/40205</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Battery energy storage system (BESS)</p></td><td align="left"><p>10.64.5.601/40801</p></td><td align="left"><p>10.64.5.601/40206</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par7">The values of parameters of the various sources of microgrid are presented in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Microgrid components with their nominal parameter values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Block name</p></th><th align="left"><p>Nominal values</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Wind turbine generator (WTG)</p></td><td align="left"><p>K<sub>WTG</sub> = 1, T<sub>WTG</sub> = 1.5</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Solar photo voltaic system (SPV)</p></td><td align="left"><p>K<sub>PV</sub> = 1, T<sub>PV</sub> = 1.8</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Diesel engine generator (DEG)</p></td><td align="left"><p>K<sub>DEG</sub> = 1/300, T<sub>DEG</sub> = 2</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Battery energy storage system (BESS)</p></td><td align="left"><p>K<sub>BESS</sub> = −1/300, T<sub>BESS</sub> = 0.1</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Flywheel energy storage system (FESS)</p></td><td align="left"><p>K<sub>FESS</sub> = −0.01, T<sub>FESS</sub> = 0.1</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Ultra capacitor (UC)</p></td><td align="left"><p>K<sub>UC</sub> = −0.7, T<sub>UC</sub> = 0.9</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Aqua electrolyser (AE)</p></td><td align="left"><p>K<sub>AE</sub> = −0.002, T<sub>AE</sub> = 0.5</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Fuel cell (FC)</p></td><td align="left"><p>K<sub>FC</sub> = 0.01, T<sub>FC</sub> = 4.0</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Wind turbine generator</title><p id="Par8">The WTG is represented in first order transfer function as<disp-formula id="Equ1"><label>1</label><alternatives><mml:math display="block" id="Equ1_Math"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">WTG</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mfenced close=")" open="("><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">WTG</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">WTG</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">WTG</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math><tex-math id="Equ1_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> reveals that the overshoot is more visible in PI/FOPI controller than PID/FOPID controller when undue load variations occur during period t = 77 s to 85 s. It reveals that PID controller makes fast reaction to disturbances. Although from frequency deviation curve, it is difficult to find which controller is doing better than the other. Numerical values of J<sub>min</sub> associated with FOPID/PID/FOPI/PI are 2.45/2.5660/2.981/3.098 respectively as given in Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. It clearly indicates that FOPID is performing better than PI/PID/FOPI controllers. Moreover, control signal fluctuation is less in FOPID controller than PI/PID/FOPI controllers.

The GSA has been employed to search the optimized values of parameters of the controllers. It is discovered that the dynamic execution of the microgrid with FOPID controller is superior to PID controller for variation in renewable power generation. The study has been done in terms of deviation in frequency, control signal, robustness against parameter variations of ultra capacitor, robustness against by disconnecting the different components of micro-grid. The system performance has also been observed by including the nonlinearities like GRC in energy storing and generating components. The reliability of the system is substantiated by the fact that only one time controller is tuned under nominal condition. It is also apparent from the results that the multi agent based microgrid control system can fully meet the requirements of supply and demand.</p></sec></body><back><sec
