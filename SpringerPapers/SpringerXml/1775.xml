To be able to properly screen and predict the potential toxicity of ENMs, sensitive and reliable in vitro assays need to be developed as soon as possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Ideally, such assays should be relevant to a real life exposure scenario, be cost effective to allow for massive ENMs screening, and measure common modes of cellular responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. An approach like this will provide researchers with consistent and accurate tools for comparing cellular responses to various ENMs, identify properties of materials causing the response and provide insights into the mechanism of toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">However, before developing such methods we need to have a clear strategy as to how to address ENMs risk in relevant cellular models. There are several different cell types that are targeted by ENMs through common routes of exposure: lung epithelium, skin fibroblasts and adipocytes, gastrointestinal tract epithelia, and cells belonging to the reticuloendothelial system such as macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Since all of these cells have unique functions in tissues and organs, there is no universal strategy for ENMs hazard assessment. As such, we should strive to develop appropriate assays for each cell type based on their specific functions. Another important aspect of ENMs safety evaluation lies in the understanding of how to distinguish between hazardous and safe concentrations and how to ensure that the proposed assays reveal a complete view of cellular changes induced by ENMs.</p><p id="Par26">The current paradigm of ENMs hazard assessment is based on analysis of big data collected using high throughput screening (HTS) methods. However, the set of standard assays used for HTS assessment, only targets the symptoms of the cellular impairment such as decreased proliferation, changes in mitochondrial activity, or excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). This approach allows for collection of secondary cellular responses to ENMs and limits our ability to detect earlier cell damage. The novelty of the proposed hazard assessment method is the detection of fundamental changes in early cell function. This approach is extremely sensitive and allows for detection of changes at earlier time prior to any damage detectable by the aforementioned standard assays. This approach also addresses proliferation and spreading of cells with impaired functions that might potentially cause the cascade of long term health problems. We believe that incorporating cell function based assays in the hazard assessment protocols will significantly reduce the number of long-term studies making the assessment process both, cost and time effective.</p><p id="Par27">In this paper we use human ADSCs as a model to demonstrate that at low concentrations of ENMs, assays such as ROS, LDH, and cell proliferation, typically used for ENMs hazard assessment, reveal no damage. In contrast, other assays detect impairment of important cell functions. For this study we used two concentrations of TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs, one that does not show an effect and another that significantly increases both ROS and LDH.</p><p id="Par28">We chose TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs for this study because of their abundance and availability. Previously, it was estimated that by 2015 more than 200,000 metric tons of TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs will be manufactured annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. We investigated two most abundant forms of TiO<sub>2</sub>, rutile and anatase, that have a tetragonal crystal structure but different atomic arrangement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Considering, that these NPs are currently being used in products such as pharmaceuticals, personal care, cosmetics, toothpaste, sunscreens and food additives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] it makes the possibility of human exposure guaranteed. Recently, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified the TiO<sub>2</sub> particles as ‘‘<italic>possibly carcinogenic to humans</italic>’’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Hence, there is an urgent need for a proper environmental and health hazard assessment of these NPs with respect to concentration and route of exposure.</p><p id="Par29">Human skin is in constant contact with the external environment and is one of the most important routes of exposure to TiO<sub>2</sub>. It is also the predominant organ exposed to high concentrations of TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs used in sunscreens and personal care products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Even though, the latest FDA regulations of over-the-counter sunscreen products for human use allow up to 25% of TiO<sub>2</sub> as an active ingredient, there are no regulations with regard to the size of the TiO<sub>2</sub> or labeling of sunscreens for the inclusion of NPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Not surprising, recent tests of different sunscreens revealed TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles in each of them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Similarly, tests performed by the Australian government showed that 70% of the sunscreens formulated with TiO<sub>2</sub> in nanoparticulate form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Studies from other countries also indicated that NPs are being used in sunscreen regardless of labeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Adipose tissue is an abundant, accessible and rich source of adult stem cells suitable for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The ADSCs are adult mesenchymal stem cells that can be isolated from subcutaneous adipose tissue (bottom layer of skin) and have a preadipocyte characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. They can also be induced to differentiate into adipocytes, bone marrow, neurons and other cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The main function of these cells in their non-differentiated state is healing of cutaneous injuries while in their differentiated state, to contribute to fat depot maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">Even though several research groups showed that nanosized TiO<sub>2</sub> can penetrate through the skin in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], the majority of reports showed that after application on skin, TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs mostly reside in the stratum corneum and do not reach living skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The 2013 Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety stated that the use of TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs as a UV-filter in sunscreens, pose no adverse effects in humans when applied on healthy, intact or sunburnt skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Therefore, this manuscript aims to begin filling the knowledge gap that exists regarding the effects of TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs on compromised skin (due to various diseases or trauma) which enables NPs to penetrate down to the subcutaneous adipose tissue layer. This presents a realistic scenario since exposure to sunlight is known to aggravate skin diseases such as psoriasis, dermatitis, eczema, and acne with daily application of sunscreen recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Moreover, TiO<sub>2</sub> is a common ingredient in topical medications (ex. Sorion and Novasone cream) for the aforementioned conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] with a recommended daily application. Here, in addition to the standard ROS, LDH, and proliferation assays, we focused on the effects of TiO<sub>2</sub> exposure on distinct functions of ADSCs: wound healing ability and intracellular lipid accumulation. Altogether, the current study indicates that specialized assays exhibit greater sensitivity in detecting damage induced by TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs in ADSCs as compared to the current set of standard assays. Hence, we propose that for proper ENMs assessment, the standard set of assays needs to be expanded and include tests examining the impairment of characteristic cell functions. Moreover, such approach may establish appropriate guidelines and identify safe concentrations of ENMs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par32">Anatase and Rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs were purchased from US Cosmetics.

The first step in hazard assessment should be proper characterization of ENMs in “as synthesized” state (e.g. in water) and, more importantly, in relevant environment or “as administrated” (e.g. in cell media for in vitro experiments). This will help to obtain meaningful and reproducible results and correlate ENMs properties with their potential toxicity in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par69">In this paper, we explored the range of TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs concentrations by testing one concentration that has no effect on cellular behavior based on a standard set of toxicity assays (ROS, LDH, and proliferation) and with another concentration that demonstrates their hazardous potential. In addition to standard assays, we performed tests addressing the TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs effects on cell function that are characteristic for the chosen model cell line. We successfully demonstrated that for sufficient safety assessment of NPs in ADSCs cultures these assays are necessary as they exhibit greater sensitivity and may be used for identifying the guideline for safe concentrations.</p><p id="Par70">The TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs chosen for this study have chemically unmodified negatively charged surface. It is known that the adsorption of proteins on the surface of the NPs changes the overall particle charge. Both basal and adipose induction medium used in this study were supplemented with 10% FBS that contains significant amount of albumin protein which has high affinity toward TiO<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. As a result, we observed that protein corona adsorbed on the surface significantly increased the surface charge of both rutile and anatase. These findings are in agreement with previous reports by several research groups who showed that decrease in the surface charge of TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs results from adsorption of albumin and apolipoproteins from media supplemented with FBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Such a protein corona plays a critical role in NP stability and in the absence of albumin TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs sediment rapidly, as opposed to stable suspension that forms in the presence of albumin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Similarly, in our experiments all media-based TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs suspensions exhibited prolonged stability as compared to water-based suspensions.</p><p id="Par71">Since TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs are suspended in basal or adipose induction medium prior to ADSCs treatment, it is important to determine the size of their aggregates. Therefore, to identify these parameters for in vitro cytotoxicity, we performed TiO<sub>2</sub> NP aggregation assessment by DLS. This is a standard method used to measure the Brownian size of NPs in colloidal suspensions. The average hydrodynamic diameter (secondary TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs size) of anatase aggregates was similar in all conditions revealing small aggregates of 2–3 particles each. On the other hand, aggregates of rutile in both, basal and induction media were determined to be smaller as compared to suspensions in Milli-Q water, indicating the stabilizing effect of the media due to the protein adsorption on the particle surface. This is in agreement with previously reported findings by multiple research groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p id="Par72">Once suspended in liquid, TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs form fractal agglomerates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] decreasing the total number of free particles, and as a result, the total surface area available for bio-interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Our measurement of TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs “effective density” confirmed that agglomerates are porous, and contain media trapped inside [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] as their density was significantly smaller than the density of primary particles. Such findings are in alignment with previously published assessment of NPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] where authors demonstrated a similar trend; effective density of various NPs agglomerates in culture media is decreased as compared to the density of the material.</p><p id="Par73">Since cells only respond to the NPs they come in contact with, we calculated the actual dose of NPs causing the effect—“delivered dose of NPs”. It is known that rates of NP sedimentation, diffusion and agglomeration depend not only on their size, density, but also on surface physicochemistry and media characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. All these properties determine the transport of NPs and significantly affect the delivered dose. Recently, a computational model of particokinetics and dosimetry for non-interacting spherical particles has been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This ISDD model accounts for Stokes sedimentation and Stokes–Einstein diffusion and was demonstrated to have accurate predictions for particles of different sizes and densities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Our calculations indicated that after 19 h of exposure 100% of administrated TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs mass comes in contact with cells. Therefore, we speculate that the observed toxicological response of the ADSCs treated with 0.1 and 0.4 mg/mL TiO<sub>2</sub> is equivalent to the response to 10 and 40 µg/cm<sup>2</sup> of TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs applied for 56 h in an in vivo study. It is important to note that according to FDA recommendations the amount of sunscreen that needs to be applied on the skin to achieve labeled SPF rating is 2 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Since the FDA approves 25% by weight of TiO<sub>2</sub> in sunscreens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], the amount of TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs in contact with skin can be as high as 0.5 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>. Hence, the TiO<sub>2</sub> doses tested in this study are more than tenfold smaller than what is approved by FDA and thus reflects a real life scenario. Moreover, the FDA recommends re-application of the sunscreen every 2 h, in this case during 8 h of exposure (outdoor workers or sunbathers) the amount of TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs in contact with skin can reaches 4 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>. In addition, since sun exposure as well as medical treatment of skin diseases is likely to be a continuous process requiring at least daily application of sunscreen or medicine for a prolonged time, the exposure time used in our study is certainly representative.</p><p id="Par74">Various research groups reported that TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs aggregates enter cells mainly via endocytosis and reside in the vacuoles and cell cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] Interestingly, in our study, the mechanism of intracellular sequestration appears to be different for rutile and anatase TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs. Close inspection of TEM images reveals that rutile NPs are stored in a few large vacuoles (~2.7 µm) within the cytoplasm, whereas anatase NPs are sequestered in great number of much smaller vacuoles (~290 nm) that distributed uniformly across the cytoplasm. Also, similar to previous findings in other cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], we found that TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs did not enter the nucleus or any other organelles. However, TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs penetrated lipid droplets in the differentiated ADSCs, raising the question whether such disruption can cause lipid leakage and contribute to the overall decrease in intracellular lipid accumulation. Similar case of TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs penetrating lipids was reported in the in vivo study where authors observed that TiO<sub>2</sub> NP penetrated oil storage droplets in water flea <italic>Daphnia magna</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Similar to our case, these storage cells mainly contain lipids such as triacylglycerol that are used by <italic>D. Magna</italic> in periods of low food resources. In another report analogous changes were observed in the terrestrial isopod <italic>Porcellio scaber</italic> exposed to TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Lastly, it was recently reported that TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs have an affinity to triglycerides and easily absorb them on their surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].</p><p id="Par75">The cellular uptake of TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs was confirmed by cell granularity measurements using flow cytometry. Previously, increases in the side scatter intensity (SSC) and decreases in forward scatter intensity (FSC) were shown to correlate with changes in the refractive index of cells containing TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Our results reveal shifts in SSC and FSC proving TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs uptake by ADSCs. Specifically, we found that cultures treated with higher concentrations of TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs have a larger increase in SSC as compared to ADSCs exposed to lower amounts of NPs. This trend is expected and related to the larger number of NPs inside the cell that can scatter more of the laser beam. Similarly, the larger increase in SSC intensity for anatase containing cells as compared to those with rutile can be explained by the fact that, unlike rutile NPs that are stored in the few vacuoles, anatase is stored in large number of small vacuoles that are much more uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm and thus increases the scattering. It has been shown that SSC provides information on internal structures and organelles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], therefore, increase in SCC indicates TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs uptake rather than adhesion to the cell surface. As FSC measures the amount of the laser beam that passes around the cell it can be correlated with relative size of the cell, therefore, a slight decrease in FSC intensity that we observed indicates that cells are roughly the same in size and hence are not apoptotic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].</p><p id="Par76">Our assessment of TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs cytotoxicity through the ROS, LDH, and proliferation assays revealed the dose-dependent toxic effects on ADSCs. No cytotoxic effects were observed in cultures treated with 0.1 mg/mL TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs regardless of crystal structure. In contrast, higher concentrations (0.4 mg/mL) of both, rutile and anatase TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs, were sufficient to generate oxidative stress and cause LDH release—two hallmarks of NP cytotoxicity. These observations are in agreement with previously reported findings. For example, Shukla et al. reported increased ROS generation in human epidermal cells exposed to TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs for 6 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], similarly other research groups reported concentration dependent increase in ROS in human bronchial epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], brain neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], and human amnion epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. It is interesting to note, that on day 3 of culture treatment with 0.4 mg/mL TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs the proliferation profile of ADSCs was not affected even though we detected significant changes in ROS and LDH. Our data revealed a decrease in the cell numbers only after 4 days of exposure to high TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs concentration confirming greater sensitivity of ROS and LDH assays as compared to a proliferation test.</p><p id="Par77">Similarly, we observed TiO<sub>2</sub> NP dose-dependent impairment of ADSC wound healing ability. This important cell function was studied using a migration assay and a three-dimensional collagen gel contraction model. Culturing cells in collagen gels is a standard procedure used to evaluate multiple aspects of wound repair and tissue remodeling. This model is used to reproduce behavior of mesenchymal cells and fibroblasts in a “tissue-like” environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. In the gel, cells attach to the matrix by integrin-mediated mechanism, exert mechanical tension and contract the matrix mimicking the wound repair process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Our findings of decreased migration speed and collagen gel contraction in cultures exposed to high TiO<sub>2</sub> doses can be correlated and interpreted as a reduction of wound healing rates since these cells are required to move into the wound, deposit collagen, and eventually close the wound by contracting the collagen fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Such impairment could contribute to ineffective tissue repair and in turn increase chances of bacterial infection. These findings are in agreement with a previously reported decrease in migration and collagen gel contraction in dermal fibroblasts exposed to TiO<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Other nanoparticulate materials, such as SiO<sub>2</sub>, gold, and carbon nanotubes were also reported to have inhibitory effects on collagen gel contraction and migration of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>].</p><p id="Par78">The importance of interaction between cells and the ECM for regulating proliferation, survival, migration, and differentiation is well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. It is also known that alteration of ECM composition can have a profound effect on cell behavior, including cell migration. For example, previous studies showed that migration of different cell types is promoted by expression and secretion of collagen type I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Therefore, our findings of decreased collagen I production in cultures treated with 0.4 mg/mL TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs may explain the observed reduction in cell migration speed. Collagens are the most abundant structural components of the ECM that support a vast array of cell and tissue functions, including adhesion, migration, differentiation, morphogenesis, and wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. It is interesting to note that moderate increases in fibronectin expression alone (in cultures exposed to 0.1 mg/mL TiO<sub>2</sub>) is not enough to alter cell migration. Alternatively, disturbance in the collagen to fibronectin ratio leads to ECM fibrils enriched with fibronectin that makes it softer. Such change in the ECM’s mechanical properties might be partially responsible for suppression of cell migration and collagen contraction. It is well documented, that cells have difficulty to exert proper adhesion and traction forces on softer ECM fibrils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Similarly, alteration of collagen/fibronectin ratio was previously found in human dermal fibroblasts exposed to gold nanoparticles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Further, the role of ADSCs in wound healing was also studied by Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>] where he identified secretion of various growth factors by ADSCs as being the essential event that promotes wound closure and re-epithelialization through a paracrine mechanism. For example, different cues secreted by ADSCs activate dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes which accelerate wound healing in vivo by stimulating collagen expression and migration of dermal fibroblasts, and also protect dermal fibroblasts from oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. Therefore, we would like to suggest that changes in ADSCs observed in our study may have more profound effects on the wound healing process in vivo due to the complexity of cell–cell interactions and increased secretory load of ADSCs.</p><p id="Par79">Another essential physiological function of ADSCs is their ability to differentiate into adipose tissue and store energy via accumulation of lipids. Adipocyte differentiation is a complex process that occurs via a chain of transcriptional and post-transcriptional events that coordinate changes in cell morphology, hormone sensitivity and gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. In this study, we found a delayed lipid accumulation and adipokine secretion in ADSCs that demonstrate the inhibitory effects of TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs on cell differentiation. Our findings are in agreement with previous reports (including our own previous data) demonstrating similar inhibitory effects of various nanomaterials on adipogenic conversion of ADSCs and mesenchymal stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. A recent study evaluated the cytotoxic effects of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorods in mesenchymal stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>], however, no changes in adipogenic differentiation were observed. These results may be explained by the low concentration of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorods chosen for the study (10 µg/mL).</p><p id="Par80">Since adiponectin is an important mediator of many physiologically relevant processes that help regulate whole body energy expenditure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>], its reduction in various fat depots could potentially generate profound local and systemic effects.

In addition, adipogenesis of dermal adipocytes occurs following injury where during the proliferative stage of the healing process adiponectin-expressing adipocytes repopulate skin wounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. Therefore, reduced adipogenesis of ADSCs exposed to TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs may also adversely affect skin wound healing in addition to previously observed alterations in ECM expression, migration, and collagen contraction.</p><p id="Par81">The transition of ADSCs from fibroblast-like state to an adipocyte phenotype is a complex event guided by remodeling of the ECM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>] and as such, we studied two main structural proteins of the ECM—fibronectin and collagen during the adipogenic differentiation process. A hallmark of this transition is the degradation of ECM and moderate decrease in fibronectin and collagen amounts. Even though we only observed small fluctuations in fibronectin and collagen content in the control samples, we observed sufficient increase in the amount of both proteins in cultures differentiated in the presence of TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs. The overproduction of ECM may explain the delayed differentiation observed in the cultures treated with rutile and anatase. On the other hand, such a change in the collagen/fibronectin ratio during differentiation results in stiffer collagen enriched ECM which has been previously reported to limit adipocyte growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. It is interesting that abnormal collagen deposition is a hallmark of fibrosis development in adipose tissue and is tightly linked to tissue inflammation due to infiltration of immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. Moreover, increased ECM deposition combined with its decreased flexibility were recently shown to cause adipocyte metabolic dysfunction and obesogenic adipose tissue remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec32" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par82">The discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo cytotoxicity tests results is a bottleneck in developing efficient screening methods to address the safety of a constantly growing number of ENMs. Thus, evaluation of ENMs cytotoxicity based on delivered doses should help to eliminate this difference and enable efficient and reliable in vitro screening methods.
