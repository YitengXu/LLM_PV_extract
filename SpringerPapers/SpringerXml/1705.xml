The nanosheets grew directly on a fluorine-doped tin oxide substrate without a seed layer or a buffer layer. The nanosheets had a thickness of 5–10 nm and an in-plane size of 100–1600 nm. Moreover, the large flat surface of the (101) facet was metastable. The thickness of the SnO<sub>2</sub> (101) nanosheet assembled film was approximately 800 nm, and the film had a gradient structure that contained many connected nanosheets. TEM results revealed that the predominate branch angles between any two connected nanosheets were 90° and 46.48°, corresponding to type I and type II connections, respectively. These connections were consistent with the calculations based on crystallography. Crystallographic analysis clarified the characteristic crystal growth of the SnO<sub>2</sub> (101) nanosheet assembled film in the aqueous solution. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the metastable (101) facet can be exploited to control the rate of crystal growth by adjusting the etching condition.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Portfolio</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>11304</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>20</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2021_Article_90939.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Metal oxide nanostructures have been developed on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates for various devices such as chemical sensors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In particular, a photoelectric conversion molecular sensor was recently proposed by combining a metal oxide nanostructured film with FTO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The mechanism of the sensor was based on photoelectric conversion and the antigen–antibody reaction. The FTO substrate possessed high transparency, which was essential for the transmission of excitation light. Moreover, its high electrical conductivity of 9.3–9.7 Ω/square (ohm/square) was suitable for producing photocurrent. Compared to an indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) transparent conductive film, the FTO film had a large surface roughness and a high surface area, which were effective at increasing the adsorption of dye-labeled monoclonal antibody. In addition, FTO was effective at facilitating specific adsorption for this sensor. Therefore, FTO was selected as a substrate in this study.</p><p id="Par3">A photoelectric conversion molecular sensor has been developed using TiO<sub>2</sub> nanostructured films on a FTO substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The nanostructured anatase TiO<sub>2</sub> film was deposited on the FTO substrate in an aqueous solution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The film was an assembly of acicular TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals, where the crystals grew along the <italic>c</italic>-axis to produce needles that oriented in a direction perpendicular to the substrate. The nanostructured TiO<sub>2</sub> film showed high dye adsorption capacity, which was approximately 6 times higher than that of a particulate film constructed of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (commercial TiO<sub>2</sub> P25, Degussa)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The nanostructured TiO<sub>2</sub> film, covered with dye-labeled proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, showed high photoluminescence and a photocurrent of 4 nA under an excitation light of 633 nm in wavelength. Thus, the combination of a nanostructured TiO<sub>2</sub> film and FTO has high potential in molecular sensor applications.</p><p id="Par4">The SnO<sub>2</sub> (101) nanosheet assembled film has been applied in a molecular sensor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The high surface area and internal nanospace of the SnO<sub>2</sub> (101) nanosheet assembled films were effective at enhancing the performance of the molecular sensor. Additionally, SnO<sub>2</sub> had the advantage of suppressing nonspecific adsorption of molecules. The photoluminescence intensity from the SnO<sub>2</sub> (101) nanosheet assembled film was up to 16 times larger than that from the bare FTO substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. A high photocurrent of 5.5 × 10<sup>−6</sup> A and a high signal-to-noise ratio of 29 were achieved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The SnO<sub>2</sub> (101) nanosheet assembled film has also been applied in a cancer sensor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The film was modified with dye-labeled monoclonal antibody that reacted with human alpha fetoprotein in the blood serum of a hepatocellular cancer patient. Photoluminescence and photocurrent were detected from the film under red light excitation. The photoluminescence was 2600 times greater than that from the SnO<sub>2</sub> (101) nanosheet assembled film with unlabeled prostate specific antigen. The photocurrent reached 603.7 nA. Therefore, the sensor can be used for the detection of hepatocellular cancer.</p><p id="Par6">Moreover, cancer marker gas sensing has been demonstrated with the SnO<sub>2</sub> (101) nanosheet assembled film<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The (101) crystal facet of the SnO<sub>2</sub> nanosheet was utilized as a sensitive membrane to adsorb and oxidize 1-nonanal molecules. The sensitivity (Ra/Rg) was evaluated from the sensor resistance in air (Ra) and sensor resistance in a target gas (Rg). A low concentration of the 1-nonanal gas (550 ppb) was clearly detected with a high sensitivity of over 10, and the sensitivity increased with increasing gas concentration. The SnO<sub>2</sub> (101) nanosheets also showed high sensitivity for detecting lung cancer markers.</p><p id="Par7">The SnO<sub>2</sub> (101) nanosheet assembled film has been applied to H<sub>2</sub> gas sensing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The sensitivity increased with increasing H<sub>2</sub> concentration in the range of 5–5000 ppm. Specifically, the sensitivities at 5, 50, 500, and 5000 ppm were 1.6, 3.2, 12.8, and 31.8, respectively. Indoor air containing various components and moisture was used for the evaluation, and the H<sub>2</sub> sensor was demonstrated to work in real environments. The SnO<sub>2</sub> nanosheet assembled films also showed high potential for alkene gas sensing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The SnO<sub>2</sub> nanosheet showed high sensor response to alkene gases such as C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, or 1-C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub> compared with alkane gases such as CH<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>, or n-C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>. Gas selectivity is an important property of the sensor. Alkene/alkane gas selectivity of the SnO<sub>2</sub> nanosheet was higher than that of a typical commercial sensor (TGS2602, FIGARO). Additionally, sensor response increased with increasing molecule weight of alkene gases or alkane gases. Alkene/alkane gas selectivity is one of the characteristics of the (101) crystal facet of the SnO<sub>2</sub> nanosheet. The SnO<sub>2</sub> nanosheet showed sensor response of 7.5 to H<sub>2</sub> gas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. It was more than two times higher than that of the SnO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticle (response: 3.0), which is covered with the most stable (110) crystal facets. The (101) crystal facet and nanosheet structure were effective for H<sub>2</sub> gas sensing. Additionally, H<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> gas selectivity of the SnO<sub>2</sub> nanosheet was 5.8 (= 7.5/1.3). It was more than two times higher than that of the SnO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticle (H<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> gas selectivity: 2 = 3.0/1.5). The 90% sensor response time of the SnO<sub>2</sub> nanosheet was 6 s for H<sub>2</sub> gas. It was three times faster than that of the SnO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticle (response time: 18 s). Response time of the SnO<sub>2</sub> nanosheet for CH<sub>4</sub> gas was 18 s, which was also faster than that of the SnO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticle (response time: 24 s). Fast response is attractive for sensor applications. It is one of the advantages of the SnO<sub>2</sub> nanosheet.</p><p id="Par8">Theoretical calculations of the (110) or (101) facet revealed the effect of different surfaces on the device properties. Zakaryan et al<italic>.</italic> studied the adsorption process of CO on the (110), (100), (101), and (001) surfaces of SnO<sub>2</sub> with density functional theory (DFT) calculations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The electronic density of states combined with a Bader charge analysis showed that the (101) and (001) surface orientations gathered more electrons than the other orientations, such as (110). They concluded that the (101) or (001) surface of SnO<sub>2</sub> was a better platform for CO gas sensing. Jiang et al<italic>.</italic> conducted theoretical calculations of the SnO<sub>2</sub> (110), (101), and (221) facets for NO and NO<sub>2</sub> gas sensing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The optimized structures of the NO molecule adsorbed on the (110), (101), and (211) facets were obtained. The total energy was calculated with DFT to investigate the adsorption of the molecules. The exchange and correlation energies were calculated with the Perdew–Wang (PW) functional with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), and a double numerical plus polarization basis set was used (DNP). The configuration of the adsorbed NO molecule was more stable in the nitrogen orientation than in the oxygen orientation on the (101) crystal surface. The adsorption energy (binding energy) of NO on the (110) facet was the lowest and that on the (211) facet was the highest. They concluded that the (101) facet was the most beneficial among the three crystal surfaces to both NO and NO<sub>2</sub> gas detection based on the determined adsorption energies and electron transfer. Abokifa et al<italic>.</italic> investigated the sensing mechanism of SnO<sub>2</sub> for ethanol and acetone at room temperature with first principles DFT calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. They concluded that both the ethanol and acetone molecules had a stronger interaction with the pre-adsorbed O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> species on the reduced (101) surface than on the reduced (110) surface at room temperature. The most cited sensing mechanism model was the interaction with the ionosorbed O<sup>−</sup> species that possessed high activity for oxidizing target gas molecules. However, the less active superoxide molecule (O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>) constituted the majority of the pre-adsorbed oxygen species on the SnO<sub>2</sub> surface at room temperature. Both the ethanol and acetone molecules could not exothermically bind at the pre-occupied vacancy location and showed no interactions with the pre-adsorbed O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> species on the reduced (110) surface. On the other hand, the oxygen vacancy site simultaneously accommodated the O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> species together with the ethanol or acetone molecule on the reduced (101) surface, which forced the pre-adsorbed O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> species to release the minor charge back to the surface. AIMD simulations demonstrated that both molecules first preferred to bind at the unoccupied oxygen vacancy sites (i.e., at the undercoordinated Sn4c). Once all the oxygen vacancy sites were filled with pre-adsorbed oxygen from the ambient atmosphere, the target molecule tended to momentarily share the preoccupied vacancy with the pre-adsorbed oxygen molecule before eventually binding at a surface Sn5c site. Therefore, the adsorption configuration resembled stoichiometric surfaces. They also reported that adsorption was generally stronger for ethanol than for acetone due to the bipolar nature of the hydroxyl group (on ethanol) that interacted with the surface via two distinct charge transfer modes. The results suggested that the sensing mechanism of SnO<sub>2</sub> for polar VOCs at room temperature can be explained by their direct adsorption on the surface rather than through their oxidation by ionosorbed oxygen species. Feng et al<italic>.</italic> investigated the relationship between morphology and the humidity sensing property of SnO<sub>2</sub> with DFT calculations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The calculations indicated that the {101} facets adsorbed more water molecules than the {110} facets. This result was consistent with the experimental data in which the nanosensor based on three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical SnO<sub>2</sub> dodecahedral nanocrystals (DNCs) exhibited superior humidity-sensing performance including fast response and recovery times, narrow hysteresis loop, high sensitivity, great linearity response, and good stability compared with the 3D hierarchical SnO<sub>2</sub> nanorods (NRs) and SnO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (NPs). They concluded that the enhanced sensing properties of the DNCs were attributed to the peculiar 3D open nanostructures and high chemical activity of the exposed {101} facet. In summary, the 3D open nanostructures can promote the penetration and diffusion of water molecules, and the exposed {101} facets can improve the adsorption ability of water molecules.</p><p id="Par9">The SnO<sub>2</sub> (101) nanosheet assembled films have been applied to molecular sensors and gas sensors as described above.

The FTO substrate (SnO<sub>2</sub>:F, Asahi Glass Co.

The FTO substrate was covered with paper, stacked, and stored in air at the factory. The FTO surface was hydrophobic with a water contact angle of 96° and was modified with VUV exposure to become a super hydrophilic surface with a contact angle of less than 1°. This was because the VUV exposure decomposed the attached organic molecules that were present in very small amounts on the surface of the FTO substrate. The super hydrophilization effect of VUV exposure has been reported for studies on the modification of a hydrophobic organic monolayers into super hydrophilic hydroxyl groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.

The reaction conditions such as temperature and ion concentration were uniform regardless of the location within the solution. The uniformity of the reaction conditions resulted in uniform nanosheet formation, which is one of the advantages of the solution process. In addition, film formation was realized at room temperature and atmospheric pressure in the aqueous solution with an open-air system. Therefore, the method used in this study can be applied to film formation on the meter size scale or to substrates with complicated shapes, such as uneven substrates, particles, fibers, or meshes. Furthermore, sintering at temperatures of the order of ~ 100 °C, which is usually required in the synthesis of ceramics, was unnecessary. Therefore, this method is applicable to film formation on low heat resistant plastics, carbon materials, metals, glasses, organic materials, biomaterials, etc. because of the room temperature process.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Surface (upper) and cross-sectional (lower) SEM images of the SnO<sub>2</sub> (101) nanosheet assembled film.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2021_90939_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Crystallographic analysis of the SnO<sub><bold><italic>2</italic></bold></sub> (101) nanosheet assembled film with plane observed TEM images</title><p id="Par14">Plane observed HAADF-STEM images of the SnO<sub>2</sub> (101) nanosheet assembled film showed a network of the nanosheets (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a).

The initial nuclei were randomly oriented and thus grew into nanosheets with random orientations. The nanosheets that were tilted to the interface reached another nanosheet. The crystal growth parallel to the interface was suppressed by this attachment to the other nanosheet. On the other hand, the SnO<sub>2</sub> nanosheets that aligned perpendicular to the interface grew to form large nanosheets since they had enough space to grow in the region far from the interface. This is one of the formation mechanisms for the gradient structure of the SnO<sub>2</sub> (101) nanosheet assembled film. The other mechanism is the decreasing ion concentration. Sn ions were used for the nucleation and crystal growth of the SnO<sub>2</sub> nanosheets, and the supersaturation degree gradually decreased as the synthesis progressed. A large number of SnO<sub>2</sub> nanosheets were formed during the initial stage, but the rate of nanosheet formation decreased as the synthesis progressed. Therefore, the depleted ion concentration and reduced supersaturation degree of the solution prevented the formation of the SnO<sub>2</sub> nuclei at the late stage. The crystal growth of the SnO<sub>2</sub> nanosheets progressed to form large nanosheets in a dilute solution, and the color of the solution changed with time in support of this mechanism.

Sodium was detected in the glass (Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>c, Na) and was also detected in the FTO layer near the glass. Therefore, sodium was slightly distributed to the FTO layer from the glass. A high concentration of sodium was observed in the glass near the gray layer of 13 nm in width. Spherical areas with a high concentration of sodium were observed in the glass substrate; one such area overlapped with the scale bar and the other area was below the label of sodium (Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>c, Na). Their positions were the same as the light gray spherical areas in the HAADF-STEM image (Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>c, HAADF), indicating that the light gray spherical impurity areas in the HAADF-STEM images corresponded to the glass with a high concentration of sodium.

The (110) crystal facets are the most stable facet, as discussed above. They are also highly stable to etching by fluorine ions in SnF<sub>2</sub> solutions. Therefore, SnO<sub>2</sub> grows along the direction perpendicular to the (110) crystal plane into stacked (110) crystal planes. On the other hand, the (101) crystal facets are metastable. A surface zig-zag structure of Sn–O–Sn in which the oxygen ions are at the outermost surface decreases the chemical stability of SnO<sub>2</sub>. The bridging oxygen ions are unstable and easy to remove. The (101) crystal facets are etched by the fluorine ions in the SnF<sub>2</sub> solution. Both etching and growth occur on the (101) crystal facet to achieve slow crystal growth of SnO<sub>2</sub> along the direction perpendicular to the (101) crystal facet to produce stacked (101) crystal planes. The difference in the crystal growth speed along the direction perpendicular to the (110) crystal facet and the (101) crystal facet causes anisotropic growth to form the nanosheet with large (101) crystal facets.</p><p id="Par37">Precise control of the balance between crystal growth and dissolution can be realized with the proposed facet controlled growth method. Therefore, crystals with metastable crystal facets can be obtained. The anisotropic crystal growth by this method can be applied to various crystal morphology control. An etching agent other than fluorine ions can be also used for etching. In addition, etching can be performed by a change in pH, temperature, raw material, concentration ratio, additives, etc. It can be utilized for anisotropic growth control and morphology control of various crystals including inorganic crystals, organic crystals, biocrystals, metal organic frameworks, etc. to facilitate the development of devices using novel crystal planes and morphologies.</p><p id="Par38">Experimental studies are available to support the mechanism of anisotropic crystal growth for the nanosheet mentioned above. Choi et al<italic>.</italic> revealed that there were many oxygen vacancies (V<sub>o</sub><sup>··</sup>) and non-stoichiometric Sn<sup>2+</sup> on the (101) facet of the SnO<sub>2</sub> nanosheets compared with the (110) facet of the SnO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The oxygen vacancies indicated that the bond strength between oxygen and tin on the (101) facet was low. In addition, it was suggested that oxygen ions on the (101) facet were easily released and etched. The ratio of the O component bound to Sn<sup>2+</sup> to the O component bound to Sn<sup>4+</sup> was 0.1% for the nanoparticles and 9.7% for the nanosheet. The unstable Sn<sup>2+</sup> site on the (101) facet was easily etched and was one of the sites of etching. In addition, the presence of Sn<sup>2+</sup> indicated the presence of oxygen vacancies. They also reported that the oxygen component ratio of lattice-Sn<sup>2+</sup>:lattice-Sn<sup>4+</sup>:deficiency:chemisorption was 4.3:43.8:30.0:21.9 for the nanosheets and 0.0:7.4:1.4:91.2 for the nanoparticles. The ratio recalculated with the total of lattice-Sn<sup>2+</sup>, lattice-Sn<sup>4+</sup>, and deficiency normalized to 100 was 5.5:56.1:38.4 for the nanosheets and 0.0:84.1:15.9 for the nanoparticles. Therefore, the (101) facet of the nanosheet contained 2.4 times (= 38.4/15.9) more of the stronger oxygen peak component due to oxygen deficiency than the (110) facet of the nanoparticles. The oxygen vacancies caused crystal imperfections and weakened the Sn–O bonds on the (101) facet of the nanosheet, thereby accelerating the etching of the (101) facet. The (110) facet of the nanoparticles contained 4.1 times more of the stronger oxygen peak component due to chemisorption than the (101) facet of the nanosheet. Therefore, the nanoparticles were covered with an adsorbed oxygen layer, which acted as a barrier to protect the oxygen and tin ions of the (110) facet.

Thus, fluorine ions continuously dissolve the (101) facet while the tin ions in the solution stack the (101) atomic layers to promote crystal growth perpendicular to the (101) facet. The crystal growth rate in the direction perpendicular to the (101) facet is determined by the competing dissolution rate determined by the fluorine ions and growth rate determined by the tin ions. The controlled crystal growth rate in the direction perpendicular to the (101) facet was very slow under the conditions in this study. On the other hand, the dissolution rate of the most-stable (110) facet caused by the fluorine ions was low. Therefore, the crystal growth rate in the direction perpendicular to the (110) facet was maintained at a high rate to balance the dissolution rate determined by the fluorine ions and the growth rate determined by the tin ions. The rate of crystal growth perpendicular to the (101) facet was much slower than that perpendicular to the (110) facet due to the difference in stability between the two facets.

Dendritic growth governed the crystal growth of the SnO<sub>2</sub> (101) nanosheet assembled film in which the branch angle of the connected nanosheets was determined by the crystal structure and growth direction, resulting in two types of connections, which were defined by the branch angle of either 90° (type I) or 46.48° (type II). Dendritic growth of the branch structures enabled the formation of the SnO<sub>2</sub> (101) nanosheet assembled film, which possessed a characteristic network of the nanosheets with a high surface area and internal nano spaces.</p><p id="Par44">Furthermore, the mechanism of anisotropic crystal growth of the nanosheet was discussed.
