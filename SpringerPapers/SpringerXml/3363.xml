Therefore, thermal and hydropower plants consume water to produce various energy carriers. Considering that Iran is suffering from water stress, the nexus of water and energy becomes very important. This paper frames a comprehensive structure for Iran's energy subsystem within the Water, Energy, and Food (WEF) nexus system. The energy subsystem's supply and demand side in the proposed framework are formulated using data and physic-based equations. The presented framework addresses most interactions between WEF subsystems in a dynamic and adaptive setting. It is shown that through analysis of binding interactions between WEF, different management scenarios can boost the flexibility of the supply and demand side of the energy subsystem. In addition, by incorporating this framework, the water subsystem will manage the allocated and consumed water on the supply side and arrive at the most desirable outcome for the water sector. Also, the optimal cropping pattern could be evaluated based on energy consumption.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Portfolio</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>6289</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2023_Article_33385.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Global resource demand is growing due to climate change, urbanization, and population growth.

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) developed the "Twin approach" to solve food shortages in the 2000s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Various approaches to their comprehensive management were proposed regarding water resources, including Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), but none examined their relationship with other resources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. One resource has a separate management policy from the other two, resulting in contradictory results. Also, competition is higher because WEF resources are considered their critical interactions. Earlier approaches, such as the Twin approach and IWRM, are now criticized as incomprehensive in the new environment where the population overgrows, lifestyles change, and demand for resources increases dynamically<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>WEF nexus system approach emergence</title><p id="Par6">Several studies have determined that management solutions tailored to WEF resources individually lead to unsustainable use of these resources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. So, it may have been possible to achieve water security through policies, but food and energy security might have been neglected, and it was the first time that has been mentioned in the world<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. For instance, in this regard, while Qatar has attempted unsuccessfully to reduce its reliance on food imports by adopting self-sufficiency policies, the water and energy security of the country has been severely affected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Management approaches must undergo a paradigm shift to meet current needs and future sustainable development goals.

Water resources are significantly affected by thermal and chemical pollution associated with energy production. Water scarcity makes energy vulnerable because it is dependent on water availability. Water and energy are closely related, so ensuring a sustainable supply requires a nexus approach. The energy sector accounted for 3% of total water consumption and 10% of total withdrawals in 2014<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Almost 64% of the consumption and 12% of the withdrawals, the water was used to extract energy sources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, and the rest was used to generate power (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Water consumption and withdrawal for energy production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2023_33385_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par9">The energy subsystem consumes a lot of water, according to statistics. Therefore, it is necessary to manage the energy subsystem's water consumption using the WEF nexus management approach to see the effects of different actions under different scenarios.</p><p id="Par10">Much energy is used in agriculture. Agricultural activities use energy directly or indirectly. Machines, agricultural equipment, fertilizers, and pesticides are indirect consumers. The food subsystem uses 30% of the world's energy, and 6.6% is used to produce primary products, livestock, and fish. Many mechanized operations exist in modern agriculture. Most of the work is mechanized, and agricultural operations like tillage, planting, irrigation, and harvesting are efficient.

Modeling the interactions between different sources in the WEF nexus system and examining the relationships between different elements can help managers and decision-makers make accurate and appropriate decisions to integrate the mentioned challenges among diverse stakeholders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Different studies have been conducted to model the relationship between WEF subsystems on regional, national, and local scales, including the WEF Nexus Tool 2.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, (Multi-Scale Integrated Analysis of Societal and Ecosystem Metabolism) MuSIASEM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, and (Nexus Simulation System) NexSym<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Previous WEF nexus system simulation literature focusing on energy subsystem</title><p id="Par12">The WEF nexus models developed before were used in different case studies. Some WEF nexus models evaluate primary component connections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. The ANEMI model, which utilizes a system dynamics approach, was created as a WEF nexus model to consider the feedback relation between climate, biosphere, and society<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. The ANEMI model includes water quality, land use, population, water demand, surface water, climate-carbon cycle, and economy modules. The ANEMI model simulates module feedback and answers 'what-if?' questions. ANEMI is not used to simulate each module in detail. In this model, the energy subsystem was not as comprehensive as water, focusing on water rather than the other two subsystems.</p><p id="Par13">To some extent, some problem of the energy subsystem in the ANEMI was resolved. MuSIASEM was developed as an integrated model in that the interconnections among WEF are modeled<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. It was applied to assess the alternative energy (biofuel production) in Punjab, India, and electricity production in the Republic of South Africa. The WEF nexus is modeled in this framework by evaluating features of the metabolic patterns of WEF. Unlike the ANEMI model, this model managed to consider the supply side of the energy subsystem, but it could not thoroughly consider the supply side of energy.</p><p id="Par14">In 2015, WEF Nexus Tool 2.0 was developed, and the energy subsystem's supply-side and demand-side were considered<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In this model, WEF requirements are modeled on a multiscale to achieve food self-sufficiency. With this model, restricted resource feedback evaluation is determined. This model was used in a national case study to evaluate scenarios for sustainable resource management in Qatar. It is crucial to realize and consider the interactions between essential WEF nexus components, but in this model, the water and energy required to produce energy carriers and some primary demand and supply-side components are not stated.</p><p id="Par15">Subsequently, in 2017, the NexSym model was developed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. It is a new system dynamics-based model. NexSym uses technological, ecological, and consumption components to assess WEF supply and consumption. This model analyzes supply and consumption holistically but locally. The energy supply side lacks thermal power plants and hydropower due to its small scale, so it cannot be implemented on a large scale.</p><p id="Par16">In 2021, a WEF nexus simulation model was built using a Stock-Flow Diagram (SFD) of WEF Security in a local context to analyze the effects of three proposed policy interventions in Karawang Regency, Indonesia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. The SFD and simulation were constructed through the STELLA Professional software, based on a previously established qualitative causal loop model of the same system (the Karawang WEF Security (K-WEFS) model). The supply side of this model included a solar power plant, while thermal power plants and the demand side of the energy subsystem were not modeled.</p><p id="Par17">In 2022, the BJ-FEW model was developed using the STELLA platform, a system dynamics model that incorporated both production and consumption aspects of WEF systems into a single system-of-systems model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. This model considered the interactions between WEF sectors within and beyond the urban economic system and was run for Beijing over 2000–2050 to simulate changes in WEF demands and supply. The energy subsystem section of this model omitted the water consumption of thermal power plants and the net head of hydropower as nexus variables to implement interactions; however, the demand side of this subsystem was modeled comprehensively.</p><p id="Par18">Previous models' flaws were resolved by the WEF Nexus Simulation Model (WEFSiM) and WEF-Sask model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. By analyzing resource interactions, these models could consider supply and demand on a national scale. The energy demand section of the energy subsystem is a database because it is based on resource production intensities. Demand-side components like groundwater pumping should be simulated to consider interaction variables. The energy subsystem needs water subsystem variables to calculate pumping energy demand. The water subsystem determines nexus variables. Nexus variables are exchanged between subsystems to calculate a variable.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Contribution of study</title><p id="Par19">In most previous WEF nexus models, supply and demand were not modeled adequately and holistically. As a result, the energy subsystem lacks a comprehensive framework that can be applied on a large scale and considers WEF nexus model interactions. Previously, WEF nexus system models did not separate the amount of water withdrawn and consumed by thermal power plants. The amount of water withdrawn and consumed by thermal power plants varies based on their type. Furthermore, the net head of reservoirs and the amount of water flowing through turbines were not considered in the section on hydropower plants. It is impossible to adequately consider the interactions between the energy and other subsystems when the mentioned nexus variables are not considered. In general, the energy subsystem's supply and demand sides have not been accurately modeled and modeled with complete accuracy in WEF nexus system modeling. In the WEF nexus model, energy subsystem frameworks can consider different scenarios and answer 'what-if' questions. This study proposes a holistic framework for Iran's energy subsystem in the context of the WEF nexus system by collecting data and relations from existing literature.</p><p id="Par20">Fragmented energy data for food and water and water data for energy subsystems require a single comprehensive database and equations for Iran's WEF nexus system approach. The literature was used to identify energy- and water-intensive activities within the energy subsystem and starting points for reducing energy and water consumption. By using these data and equations, sustainability analysis tools can assess and secure the environmental performance of the entire energy subsystem, including supply and demand.</p><p id="Par21">Unlike the energy frameworks used within the previous WEF nexus models that were mostly databased, our framework is based on the combination of data and equation-based to formulate the supply and the demand side of the energy subsystem in national and sub-national scales to meet the WEF nexus system's requirements. All the needed statistical data must be gathered to accomplish such a framework, including energy for water, food, energy for energy, and water for energy. Thus, in this paper, we explored works of literature in-depth to create a comprehensive framework for the energy subsystem.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>WEF resources condition in Iran</title><p id="Par22">Managing water and the environment effectively is a pressing issue in Iran<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. As water demands continue to rise due to declining natural water supply and newly developed surface water and groundwater resources, the country's technological approach addresses water shortages through an extensive network of dams, inter-basin water transfer projects, and groundwater withdrawal has proven inadequate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. As a result, Iran is struggling with a state of "water bankruptcy" that endangers the future of one of the world's oldest and most prosperous civilizations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. The country's water management problems will likely worsen as water stress rises. Extensive drying up of water bodies, frequent sand and dust storms, widespread groundwater table decline, deteriorating water quality, and increasing competition and conflict over limited water resources all point to water security becoming a primary concern from a national security standpoint<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Prolonged droughts have contributed to the political unrest and social instability that have plagued countries like Syria in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par23">There is little to no cost for access to water in Iran because the government regulates it. As a result, Iran's agricultural expansion policies have relied heavily on easy access to low-cost energy and water (both surface and groundwater). Agriculture accounts for roughly 10% of GDP and employs around 20% of the population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. This sector also consumes over 90% of Iran's total water withdrawals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Due to severe water shortages, as evidenced by low surface water levels and a significant drop in the groundwater table, agricultural activities are effectively limited rather than prevented by prohibitive water and energy prices. Variable water scarcity can be attributed to the country's highly variable climate, which ranges from arid and semi-arid in most regions to subtropical in the narrow strip of land that borders the Caspian Sea (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

Energy equivalents of the whole inputs applied in crop production have been illustrated in Table <xref rid="Tab19" ref-type="table">19</xref>.</p><p id="Par74">The energy consumed by agricultural machinery in different stages of production, such as planting, planting, and harvesting, is considered as direct energy consumption. In this section, the area under cultivation of crops is considered a nexus variable for the energy subsystem. In other words, by receiving the cultivated area variable from the food subsystem, the energy subsystem can calculate the energy consumption in each simulation time step.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par75">The country of Iran is essential in terms of energy production and consumption, and the economy of Iran is mainly dependent on energy revenues. On the other hand, in the agricultural sector in Iran, energy is consumed by agricultural inputs in different parts of production, i.e., the use of machinery and agricultural inputs. Therefore, thermal and hydropower plants consume water to produce various energy carriers. Considering that Iran is suffering from water stress, the nexus of water and energy becomes very important. Also, to provide different cultivation patterns, their energy consumption should be estimated in addition to the water requirement of the crops. Therefore, to evaluate the energy system in Iran with the nexus approach, it was necessary to provide a framework.</p><p id="Par76">Currently, no comprehensive framework for energy subsystems has been proposed which can be applied at a large scale and can consider the binding interactions in WEF nexus models. The supply and demand side of the energy subsystem was not captured in most of the previous WEF nexus models. Unlike the energy frameworks used within the previous WEF nexus models, which were primarily based on data, our energy framework utilized data and equations to formulate the energy subsystem's supply and demand sides. This study proposed a new energy subsystem framework based on the nexus system approach by reviewing existing literature. All the necessary data and equations must have been gathered to develop such a framework, including energy for water, food, energy for energy, and water for energy. In fact, by collecting the required data and relations, the energy subsystem was categorized into two parts: supply and demand. The energy subsystem can easily interact with the water and food subsystems in the supply and demand sectors using the information collected from the literature.</p><p id="Par77">It should be noted that the supply and demand side of the energy subsystem will be given more flexibility by considering binding interactions between WEF. In addition, this framework provides a mechanism by which the water subsystem manages the allocated and consumed water, leading to a policy decision with the best outcome. Furthermore, by constituting the demand side of the energy subsystem considering the WEF nexus system approach, the food subsystem can provide optimal cropping patterns based on energy consumption within the WEF nexus system.</p><p id="Par78">One of the limitations of the research was that the quality of water returned from power plants had not been evaluated due to the lack of access to data, while it is one of the critical factors in the energy subsystem that affects the quality of water resources. Also, at the watershed scale, the energy system's boundary does not match the two subsystems of water and food, and this causes inconsistency in the modeling of the nexus system. Working on modeling water withdrawal and consumption of thermal power plants with heat rate changes as research suggestions. Heat rate changes in each time step of the simulation cause the amount of water withdrawal and consumption to change and obtain a more accurate amount in the WEF nexus system.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>M.V., first author; data curation; conceptualization; methodology; investigation; formal analysis; resources; roles/writing—original draft.
