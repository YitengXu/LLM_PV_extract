Under the high pressure of the primeval, carbon dioxide-dominated atmosphere ZnS could precipitate at the surface of the first continents, within reach of solar light. It is suggested that the ZnS surfaces (1) used the solar radiation to drive carbon dioxide reduction, yielding the building blocks for the first biopolymers, (2) served as templates for the synthesis of longer biopolymers from simpler building blocks, and (3) prevented the first biopolymers from photo-dissociation, by absorbing from them the excess radiation. In addition, the UV light may have favoured the selective enrichment of photostable, RNA-like polymers. Falsification tests of this hypothesis are described in the accompanying article (A.Y.

animated earth</italic>.</p><p>Erasmus Darwin, <italic>Temple of Nature</italic>, 1802 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]</p><p>The problem of the origin of life is central to biology. It has been repeatedly addressed by scholars, including the above-quoted Erasmus Darwin and his famous grandson Charles, who wrote in his letter to J.D. Hooker of February 1, 1871: "<italic>It is often said that all the conditions for the first production of a living organism are now present, which could ever have been present. But if (and oh! what a big if!) we could conceive in some warm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, light, heat, electricity, &amp;c., present, that a proteine [sic] compound was chemically formed ready to undergo still more complex changes, at the present day such matter would be instantly devoured or absorbed, which would not have been the case before living creatures were formed</italic>" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Fifty years later, Oparin has suggested, in the first comprehensive scenario of the abiogenic origin of life (abiogenesis), that the primordial reducing atmosphere could have favoured the <italic>spontaneous</italic> formation of proteinaceous bodies that could aggregate into coacervates (protocells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Independently, Haldane, building upon the achievements of virology, proposed that the life started from bacteriophage-like molecules synthesized under the influence of the Sun's radiation in the primordial "hot dilute soup" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It has been repeatedly demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] that simple building blocks such as amino acids or nucleobases could form from simpler compounds, provided that energy was delivered as UV light or electric discharges (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] for surveys of research on the origin of life, and a section below devoted to the more detailed consideration of particular concepts).</p><p>The initial, rather general Oparin-Haldane's concept of abiogenesis has been gradually replaced by a mosaic of specific hypotheses that either emphasize the "replication first" principle or build upon the "metabolism first" assumption. The "replication first" concept implies that the emergence of the first replicating entities (replicators) preceded metabolism; it is represented by the RNA World scenario that implies that RNA-like molecules capable of both self-reproduction and simple metabolism were the first inhabitants of Earth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. The "metabolism first" idea suggests that life started as a system of interacting chemical cycles and the first replicators appeared later, see refs. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>] for consideration of the controversy between the two concepts. Elsewhere, we have argued that the "replication first" and "metabolism first" concepts complement rather than contradict each other and have suggested that life on Earth started with a "metabolism-driven replication" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. We have also emphasized that the virtually unlimited number of tentative scenarios of the origin of life can be dramatically reduced by the simultaneous consideration of a variety of external constraints (boundary conditions) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>].</p><p>Here I invoke further (bio)energetic, physical, and geological constraints that are related to abiogenesis. As a solution that satisfies these constraints, I put forward an evolutionary scenario in which life on Earth emerged, powered by solar irradiation, within porous edifices of hydrothermal origin that were built of photosynthesizing zinc sulfide (ZnS) crystals, in the "Zn world".</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Energetic, physical, and geological constraints on abiogenesis</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Energetics: Requirement for utilizable energy flow(s)</title><p>Living organisms can exist only when supported by energy flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. Because of the obvious requirement for energetic continuity, the energy flows that deserve attention in an evolutionary context are those that remain constant on the evolutionary relevant, geological timescale. This consideration discounts the evolutionary importance of occasional energy inputs such as impact bombardment, atmospheric electric discharges, and shock waves. The primordial atmosphere on Earth is assumed to be dominated by carbon dioxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. Hence, energy was initially needed to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> to organic compounds that could participate in prebiological syntheses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Currently, the fixation of CO<sub>2</sub> by living organisms is supported by two energy fluxes: the communities at the Earth's surface depend, via photosynthesis and its products, on solar light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>], whereas the biotopes at the sea floor can also exploit the redox potential difference between the reduced hydrothermal fluids and oxygenated ocean waters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. Accordingly, some scholars have considered solar radiation to be the driving force of abiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>]. Others have hypothesized that chemical or redox disequilibria at the sea-floor hydrothermal vents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>] or at the surface of sea-floor iron minerals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">130</xref>] could have driven the emergence of the first organisms. As argued in more detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>], a direct analogy between primordial life and modern deep-sea biotopes is not possible, since the redox energy span of &gt; 1 eV between the reduced compounds of hydrothermal fluids and the sea-dissolved oxygen became exploitable only after the ocean waters – only 2 Ga ago – were saturated by oxygen, a by-product of cyanobacterial photosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">131</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">132</xref>].</p><p>The very lack of oxygen in the primordial atmosphere should, however, favour light-driven chemical syntheses. Without the ozone shield, the solar light reaching Earth contained a UV component that was 10–1000 times stronger than it is today [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">133</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">134</xref>] and could have driven diverse chemical reactions, in particular carbon fixation. The major constituents of the primordial atmosphere (CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and water vapour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]) let UV rays with λ &gt; 240 nm through [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">133</xref>]. The fossils of phototropic communities, which apparently flourished as far back as 3.4–3.5 Ga [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">135</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">139</xref>], also indicate that the primordial atmosphere was transparent to solar light. Hence, no other known energy source could compete with solar irradiation in terms of strength and access to the whole of the Earth's surface.</p><p>Mauzerall has introduced an important additional constraint by noting that the energy requirements of the first living beings had to be compatible with those of modern organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>]. He argues that "<italic>the ur-cell would be simpler, but it would also be less efficient</italic>". More rigorously speaking, the intensity of the energy flux(es) that supported the emergence of life should be either comparable with the intensity of modern life-supporting energy flows or stronger. At least two UV-driven abiogenic processes of CO<sub>2</sub> reduction are known to proceed with an efficiency comparable to that of modern photosynthesis. On the one hand, the photo-oxidation of ferrous iron ions in solution can lead to the reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]; for example, Borowska and Mauzerall have observed a light-driven formaldehyde formation in the presence of dissolved ferrous hydroxide with a quantum yield of 2–3% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">140</xref>]. On other hand, a UV-driven synthesis of diverse organic compounds from CO<sub>2</sub> has been demonstrated at the surface of broad-band semiconductors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">141</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">149</xref>]. Such semiconductors not only photoreduce CO<sub>2</sub> but, depending on the initial substrates, can also photocatalyse a wide set of diverse organic reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">144</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">150</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">152</xref>]. Several naturally occurring minerals, in particular TiO<sub>2</sub> (anatase/rutile), WO<sub>3</sub> (wolframite), MnS (alabandite), and ZnS (wurtzite, sphalerite), possess the properties of broad-band semiconductors and can photoreduce CO<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">143</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">151</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">153</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">158</xref>]. The highest quantum yield of 80% has so far been reported for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction to formate at the surface of colloidal ZnS particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">144</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">145</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Physics: Photostability of nucleotides</title><p>RNA and DNA are polymers of similar sugar-phosphate units, with each sugar moiety (ribose in RNA or deoxyribose in DNA) carrying one of four different nitrogen bases (nucleobases). The specific feature that is shared by all nucleobases is their unique photostability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">159</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">165</xref>]. Since this trait is not related to the storage of genetic information, several authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">133</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">159</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">164</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">165</xref>] have noted that this property could have been of some use when the UV flux at the surface of primordial Earth was much stronger than it is now [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">133</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">134</xref>]. Nucleobases apparently can absorb excess energy quanta from sugar-phosphate moieties and protect them from photo-dissociation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">166</xref>]. This feature explains why the UV damage to the backbones even of modern RNA and DNA molecules is 10<sup>3</sup>–10<sup>4</sup> times less frequent than destruction of nucleobases themselves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">159</xref>].</p><p>Based on a Monte-Carlo simulation of primordial photochemistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>], we have proposed an evolutionary scenario in which the relative enrichment in increasingly complex RNA-like polymers could be attributed to their higher photostability in a UV-irradiated environment, with UV-quenching nucleobases protecting the sugar-phosphate backbones from photo-dissociation. It was posited that the photostability could increase further owing to the stacking of nucleobases and the formation of Watson-Crick pairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>], see also below.</p><p>In modern organisms, the continuous victimization of nucleobases is a well-known problem that is counteracted by sophisticated repair systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">167</xref>]. At the earliest steps of evolution, repair systems were absent, so the photodestruction of nucleobases could have hindered the selection of the first replicators. The photodestruction of nucleobases could be, however, prevented by radiation-absorbing templates. Many minerals can take up radiation energy from the adsorbed photoactive compounds. For example, montmorillonite particles have been shown to protect catalytic RNA molecules (hairpin ribozyme 1) from UV-induced damage: after a UV-irradiation, the self-cleavage activity of the montmorillonite-adsorbed ribozyme molecules was three times higher compared to that of the molecules irradiated in the absence of montmorillonite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">168</xref>]. With ZnS crystals, the excitation transfer from adsorbed dye molecules to a template has been shown to proceed within picoseconds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">169</xref>], i.e. much faster than the typical intrinsic characteristic time of photodestruction (e.g. ~20 μs for adenosine monophosphate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">170</xref>]). Hence, in the evolutionary context, the first photostable RNA-like polymers had better survival chances at the surfaces of those minerals that could efficiently absorb the radiation energy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Geology: Requirement for hydrothermal settings</title><p>In addition to abundant chemical elements such as carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen, biological systems contain a number of microelements, often at levels far exceeding those in the surrounding environment (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">171</xref>] for a comprehensive survey). In particular, transition metals are often involved in enzyme catalytic centres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">172</xref>]. The concentration of such metals in modern cells is many orders of magnitude larger than that in sea water (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>); the ion accumulation is accomplished by sophisticated transport systems and demands ion-tight membranes to prevent the escape of trapped metal ions out of the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">173</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">174</xref>]. However, the ion-tight membranes, as argued elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175">175</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR176">176</xref>], seem to be a relatively late evolutionary acquisition. Here we encounter a paradox. On the one hand, the emergence of metal-containing RNA and protein domains – as a result of their eventual stabilization by available transition metal ions – implies an abundance of these ions. On the other hand, the <italic>equilibrium</italic> concentration of such ions in sea water is very low (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This paradox is routinely resolved by invoking hydrothermal settings as potential cradles of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR177">177</xref>]. In such systems, which currently cluster around the mid-ocean ridges and deep-sea submerged volcanoes (seamounts) – where hot magma chambers occur near the seabed – water circulates down into the crust, becomes heated, and then rises up. When water is overheated to more than 400°C, it can leach metal ions from the crust.

The more complex molecules would, generally, have absorbed more light and been more vulnerable to UV quanta. Still, in certain cases, the increase in chemical complexity may have been accompanied by an increase in photostability.

However, if the absorbed energy is spread over many bonds, then the probability of bond cleavage drops dramatically. Such a spreading of excitation energy occurs in systems that contain conjugated bonds (so-called π-systems with alternating single and double bonds); the spreading is facilitated by a ring-like (aromatic) molecular structure.

Both the gradient of light and the interlayer metabolite exchange are typical of modern stratified, seashore phototrophic communities (e.g. stromatolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">139</xref>]).</p><p>Those consortia of replicators that were able to couple useful syntheses with exergonic chemical reactions could have became relatively independent of upper, photosynthesizing layers and could penetrate the depths of their porous habitats. This penetration can be considered the first wave of the Earth's colonization by living organisms that eventually evolved from replicating zymes. This colonization would have been supported by exchanges of metabolites between the illuminated strata and those that were deeper and darker. In the darkness, direct contact between the RNA-like "bodies" of replicators and the radiation-absorbing ZnS template was no longer crucial, so that the replicators could evolve into life forms that were enclosed in protein envelopes resembling modern viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR219">219</xref>].</p><p>The energetics of these communities consisted in the interplay between the continuous ZnS-mediated photosynthesis and the increasingly complex heterotrophy of the first organisms.

After that, ZnS-rich hydrothermal edifices could persist only deeply at the sea floor, ultimately clustering around the mid-ocean ridges. The organisms that remained confined to the sub-aerial settings would have found alternative ways to reduce CO<sub>2</sub>.

In view of this obstacle, Wächtershäuser [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR227">227</xref>] has suggested that the hypotheses on the origin of life could be validated by rigorous application of Karl Popper's principles of testing scientific theories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR228">228</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR229">229</xref>].

One outstanding feature, however, deserves preferential treatment since it is crucial for almost every one of these steps. This feature is the unique ability of ZnS crystals to store radiation energy (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">144</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR230">230</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR233">233</xref>] for reviews). This property manifests itself in phosphorescence (afterglow), so that ZnS – widely known as "phosphor" – is used in numerous devices, from various types of displays to 'glow in the dark' items. ZnS is a broad-band <italic>n</italic>-type semiconductor with a gap band energy of 3.2–3.9 eV (depending on the particular crystal structure). When radiation strikes such a semiconductor, it may excite an electron and consequently leave a "hole" (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). If the energy of the radiation quantum is larger than the band gap energy, the electron reaches the so-called conduction zone and can move inside the crystal. Ultimately, the electron can recombine with the hole. However, if the electron gets into an energy trap (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), then the recombination can proceed only slowly, under the condition of thermal activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR234">234</xref>]. In pure ZnS, the atoms at the surface can trap electrons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR234">234</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR235">235</xref>], particularly if the semiconductor interacts with a polar solvent such as water. At the surface, a photoexcited electron loses part of its energy owing to the interaction with the molecules of the solvent and, accordingly, is prevented from returning into the bulk of ZnS. In addition, recombination may be prevented by prompt replenishing the hole with an electron coming from a potent electron donor ("hole scavenger"). The trapped electron then remains confined to the surface until an external electron acceptor, e.g. a molecule of CO<sub>2</sub>, picks the electron up, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">144</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR190">190</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR234">234</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR236">236</xref>] for reviews.</p><p>Small nanocrystals of ZnS and of its chemical "twin" CdS have been found to behave as quantum dots – systems with physical properties intermediate between those of bulk materials and single molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">144</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR234">234</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR237">237</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR242">242</xref>].

The question that is crucial for the Zn world scenario is whether atmospheric pressure was in the range of 10–100 bar when life on Earth emerged (at this pressure range, hot hydrothermal fluids surging at sub-aerial settings would have been enriched in Zn; see above). It is generally accepted that life on Earth was unlikely to emerge before the end of the impact bombardment 3.9 Ga ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. Since reliable biogenic fossils are dated to 3.4–3.5 Ga [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">135</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">139</xref>], life is believed to have emerged from 3.9 to 3.5 Ga [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. Concerning the primordial atmospheric pressure, the following estimates have been put forward. Atmospheric pressure before condensation of the first ocean ca. 4.4 Ga ago has been estimated as ≥200 bar; this ocean condensation would have lowered the pressure to about 100 bar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. Accordingly, each evaporation of ocean that may have been caused by massive bombardment from 4.3 to 3.9 Ga would have transiently increased the atmospheric pressure. Atmospheric pressure 3.3 Ga ago has been estimated to have been in the range of 2–6 bar, depending on the assumed concentration of methane in the atmosphere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. It is remarkable that these estimates are compatible with the atmospheric pressure values in the range from ca. 100 bar to ca. 10 bar in the time window from 3.9 to 3.5 Ga. Hence, the time window when the hydrothermal ZnS could precipitate at sub-aerial settings overlaps with the time window when life is believed to have emerged on Earth.</p><p>The conditions under which the first cells emerged could be read from the chemical composition of cellular cytoplasm that apparently tends to maintain the ancient chemical milieu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. Archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic cells all show elevated concentrations of potassium, magnesium, phosphate, and certain transition metal ions (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Therefore the radiation energy could be transferred from the adsorbed nucleotides to a ZnS template (and thus contribute to the CO<sub>2</sub> reduction), but not in the reverse direction. Hence, the quanta directly absorbed by the ZnS templates would not damage the adsorbed RNA-like replicators.</p><p>Besides nucleobases, the primeval RNA-like polymers may have contained ribose and phosphate entities. Ribose may have been abundant as one of the products of the autocatalytic "formose" reaction, which was discovered by Butlerov in 1861 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR304">304</xref>] and which yields a mixture of pentoses and hexoses from formaldehyde. Although Butlerov's reaction remains the only known autocatalytic reaction that does not require specific catalysts, the importance of this reaction for prebiological syntheses has been questioned since the yield of ribose in the product mixture is usually low. Recent studies have shown, however, that the yield of ribose can be selectively enhanced by the presence of phosphate in the reaction medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR305">305</xref>], by UV illumination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and by conducting the reaction in the presence of catalytic mineral templates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR306">306</xref>]. More recently, it has been demonstrated that the yields of pentoses increase to 60% and those of the ribose proper rise to 20% in the presence of a zinc-proline complex as a catalyst [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The Zn world settings may have favoured autocatalytic ribose formation from photosynthesized substrates by providing mineral templates, UV irradiation, and plenty of Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions as catalysts.</p><p>It has been argued that biological stereoselectivity (homochirality), i.e. the utilization of only particular optical isomers by living organisms, could have begun from the selection of a particular D-isomer of ribose – since nucleobases and phosphate groups are non-chiral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR307">307</xref>]. Generally, homochirality cannot be completely explained in the framework of the "primordial soup" concept [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], because stereoisomers are chemically indistinguishable in a homogenous solution. At a surface, however, the properties of two stereoisomers could differ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR307">307</xref>], as first pointed out by Goldschmidt, who has suggested that mineral surfaces were involved as templates in abiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR308">308</xref>]. The two other tentative mechanisms of primordial stereoselectivity are (i) photoselection by polarized UV light (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR309">309</xref>] and references therein), and (ii) enantiomeric autocatalysis (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR310">310</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR311">311</xref>] for reviews). An example of this latter mechanism is the Soai reaction, where heteroaromatic aldehydes react with organo-zinc compounds, yielding respective alcohols, which in turn serve as asymmetric catalysts for their own formation. If one of the substrate enantiomers is present even in small excess, the autocatalytic reaction can yield the corresponding product with up to 95% enantiomeric excess [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR312">312</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR314">314</xref>]. Although the mechanism of the Soai reaction remains unclear, Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions might be important – zinc-proline complexes were also shown to mediate stereoselective catalysis of aldole reactions in water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR315">315</xref>]. At this point it is appropriate to mention that the Zn world settings could support all these mechanisms of stereoselectivity by providing (i) electrically charged surfaces with regular patterns of positive and negative charges, (ii) Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions that could build potentially catalytic complexes with diverse organic compounds, and (iii) UV light that would become polarized after passing through the ZnS crystals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR316">316</xref>]. These factors resemble strikingly the aforementioned features that increased the ribose yield in the autocatalytic Butlerov's reaction. Although the relative importance of the above-named features for prebiological stereoselective and/or autocatalytic syntheses of D-ribose and other sugars remains unclear, they can be experimentally tested: the stereoselective (photo)catalysis of diverse organic reactions at the surface of ZnS is an established approach in photochemistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR191">191</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR317">317</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR320">320</xref>].</p><p>Turning to the suggestion that the primordial waters were enriched not in phosphate but in the better soluble phosphite, it is worth noting that phosphate and/or phosphite groups may have catalyzed prebiotic syntheses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR305">305</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR321">321</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR322">322</xref>], serve as bridges upon connecting nucleobases with metal sulfides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR279">279</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR323">323</xref>], participate in UV-driven photochemical reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR324">324</xref>], prevent hydrolysis of the first oligomers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR325">325</xref>], and interact with diverse organic molecules, yielding their phosphorylated derivates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR252">252</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR326">326</xref>]. It is tempting to speculate that the oxidation of phosphite ions, as hole scavengers, upon ZnS-mediated photosynthesis (see above) may have been coupled with their involvement in polymerization reactions as catalysts, yielding surface-confined oligomers connected by phosphate groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR252">252</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR255">255</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR327">327</xref>].</p><p>The Zn world concept is consistent with a direct assembly of polynucleotides at ZnS surfaces either from stacked nucleobases, ribose molecules, and phosphate/phosphite linkers or, perhaps, even from simpler parts (as exemplified by Sutherland and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]). It is plausible that diverse (photo)synthetic pathways may have been realized at the ZnS surfaces with the output being essentially determined by photoselection of most stable compounds.</p><p>The light-induced energy transfer between adsorbed organic dyes, single nucleotides, and polynucleotides on the one hand, and ZnS/CdS templates on the other hand, has been intensively studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR242">242</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR244">244</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR247">247</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR328">328</xref>]. In one case at least, it has been quantified that an organic dye <italic>fac</italic> tris(2-phenylpyridine) iridium, when adsorbed on a ZnS surface, can serve as an antenna and increase the amount of quanta captured by ZnS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR329">329</xref>]. This result supports the possibility of a positive feedback between the number of UV-light-absorbing zymes in a ZnS compartment and the yield of photosynthetically produced metabolites.</p><p>DNA and RNA are capable of long-range energy transfer along stacked nucleobases, over tens of nucleotide pairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR330">330</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR333">333</xref>]. In the context of the primordial Zn world, this property could have been useful: if a UV quantum hit a nucleotide having no direct contact with an energy-absorbing template, then, owing to the coupling between the stacked and paired nucleobases, the excess energy would still have promptly sunk into the ZnS substratum.</p><p>The suggestion that RNA-like polymers could bind, via negatively charged phosphate groups, to ZnS surfaces is supported by the ready adsorption of nucleic acids on the ZnS/CdS nanoparticles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR243">243</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR247">247</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR328">328</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR334">334</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR340">340</xref>] The assembly of RNA-like polymers at the ZnS surface should be greatly facilitated by the complementary match between the patterns of electrically charged groups at the surfaces of polynucleotides and ZnS, respectively. Such a matching was shown for the CdS nanoparticles, which formed spontaneously from added cadmium salts in the presence of polynucleotides as templates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR341">341</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR342">342</xref>]. This match may have a straightforward explanation: the distance between the positively charged Cd<sup>2+</sup>/Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions of 0.58/0.54 nm, respectively, in the nanoparticles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR343">343</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR344">344</xref>] is similar to the distance of 0.58–0.59 nm between the phosphate groups in the RNA backbone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR345">345</xref>].</p><p>Wächtershäuser has suggested that a regular mesh of electric charges at the surface may have made the primeval polymerization thermodynamically more favourable by attracting reactants and arranging them appropriately relative to each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>]. De Duve and Miller have countered him by noting that if the polymerization at the surface was thermodynamically more favourable than in the bulk solution then the polymers could not detach without "paying" the respective energy fee and would have remained confined to the surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200">200</xref>]. As argued above, such confinement would have prevented photodestruction of the polymer molecules and favoured their interactions at the ZnS surfaces. It is worth noting that a mechanism of thermodynamic confinement is actually exploited by nature upon the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate by membrane ATP synthases. While the free energy of ATP synthesis in water is about +50 kJ/mol, molecules of ATP build up spontaneously in the enzyme active site, the reaction being facilitated by a positively charged arginine residue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR346">346</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR347">347</xref>]. The molecules of ATP, however, remain tightly bound: they can leave the catalytic pocket only after the free energy of membrane potential is used to open the pocket and to reorient the arginine residue; ATP can then dissociate into the water phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR346">346</xref>]. The phosphate group in ATP is linked by a phosphoester bond that is similar to those connecting the nucleotides in RNA and DNA. Hence, as compared to a reaction in a bulk-water phase, the formation of phosphoester bonds can indeed be favoured when the reactants are appropriately arranged and a positive charge is present nearby.</p><p>Orgel and co-workers have studied the polymerization of guanosine 5'-phosphorimidazolide on a polycytidylic acid template in the presence of a variety of metal salts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR198">198</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR348">348</xref>].

A specific role of Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions in shaping the proper 3'-5' linkages follows also from the recent work of Hadley and co-workers. They selected deoxyribozymes that could ligate RNA and found that the native 3'-5' linkages were built only by those deoxyribozymes that were dependent on zinc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR349">349</xref>]. In addition, mostly 3'-5' bonding has been observed upon the radiation-driven polymerization of nucleotides at the surface of volcanic rocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR350">350</xref>].

Recently, the physical background of this higher photostability has been clarified. For the nucleotides that form a Watson-Crick pair, the lifetime of the excited state has been estimated to be as low as a few femtoseconds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR355">355</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR356">356</xref>], i.e. ca. one hundred times shorter than that of single bases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">159</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">163</xref>].

A primeval RNA machine capable of making peptide bonds has been recently unveiled by Bokov and Steinberg based on a detailed analysis of the structure of the modern ribosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. As the first protein synthases most likely began by generating random polypeptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>], it might be useful to consider – in a search for tentative sequence-independent functions of the first proteins – the traits that are common for all polypeptides. To perform sequence-independent functions, the first polypeptides should have been able to interact with polynucleotides via their backbone atoms. Carter and Kraut have suggested that a protein chain can fit into the minor groove of an RNA helix, with hydrogen bonds being formed between the ribose 2'-hydroxyls and carbonyl oxygen atoms of peptide bonds, in an interaction that is RNA-specific and is not possible in the case of DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR365">365</xref>]. Indeed, hydrogen bonding between the protein backbone oxygen atoms and the ribose 2'-hydroxyls has been found in many RNA-protein complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR366">366</xref>]. This ability of proteins to block the 2'-hydroxyls of ribose entities may have increased the life span of primordial RNA polymers. The aforementioned ability of Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions to catalyze the formation of proper 3'-5' linkages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR198">198</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR349">349</xref>] implies the ability of Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions also to catalyze cleavage of these linkages. Butzow and Eichhorn have noted that the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-catalyzed cleavage of RNA starts from the binding of a Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion between the 2'-hydroxyl group of ribose and the phosphate group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR367">367</xref>]. It is tempting to speculate that the first polypeptides could protect the RNA molecules from metal-catalyzed cleavage by preventing the binding of Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions to the 2'-OH groups of ribose.</p><p>The (photo)stability of polynucleotides and proteins, as argued by Sobolewski and Domcke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">164</xref>], is ensured by reversible proton relocation within picoseconds between the Watson-Crick-paired nucleotides and along the protein hydrogen bonds, respectively. In other words, the reshuffling of protons along hydrogen bonds can promptly split a large "captured" energy quantum into many small, non-hazardous heat quanta, both in nucleic acid polymers and in proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">164</xref>]. In a UV-irradiated environment, this feature should favour the selection of structures with many intrinsic hydrogen bonds, such as paired RNA or DNA strands, protein α-helices and β-sheets, as well as hydrogen-bonded RNA-protein aggregates. Turning to the previously discussed relation between the stability of polymers and their ability to perform work, the shuttling of protons along hydrogen bonds might be considered as a kind of <italic>work</italic> that could be carried out at picoseconds, i.e. much faster than any bond dissociation could take place.

As discussed above, at least one type of polymer should have been continuously emerging under primeval settings to enable a selection of first catalytic entities that could gradually develop an ability to synthesize other types of polymers. Based on the aforementioned arguments, these primary polymers could be related to modern RNA. The synthesis of RNA and DNA molecules in modern organisms is driven by the hydrolysis of ATP molecules and carried out by sophisticated enzyme systems. Turning to the primordial Earth, one has a typical "chicken and egg" paradox: on the one hand, high-yield polymerization would seemingly have required specific machinery for coupling with exergonic reactions, yet, on the other hand, this machinery was likely to have been absent before the first catalytic polymers have emerged. One of the virtues of the Zn world scenario is the possibility to funnel UV energy into polymerization reactions. In addition, the thermodynamically very favourable oxidation of phosphite to phosphate could potentially provide free energy. Furthermore, the polymerization at ZnS surfaces could be more favourable than in the bulk-water phase (see above). Nevertheless, it is unclear whether these factors alone could have been sufficient for maintaining a notable steady-state population of RNA-like polymers – needed as starting material for further evolutionary transformations. The results of our earlier Monte-Carlo simulations of primordial photochemistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>], suggest one more, rather paradoxical, way to channel external energy into the synthesis of increasingly complex compounds.</p><p>The aim of the simulations was to quantify the significance of the UV protection mechanism for the evolution of primordial RNA-like polymers by computer modelling of the polymerization of sugar-phosphate monomers in the presence of nucleobases.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>"Dark" simulations (with "virtual" UV light switched off and a polymerization constant of &gt; 1) yielded polymers that, as expected, did not carry nucleobases, since the equilibrium constant of their attachment to the sugar-phosphate units was taken, in accordance with the actual situation, as &lt;&lt;1 (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>] for further details). Despite a high polymerization constant, the elongation of polymers was not unconstrained. The explanation as suggested by D. Cherepanov (personal communication) is the following: if a linear polymer contains <italic>n</italic> monomers, the binding of new monomers can proceed only at the two terminal positions, while dissociation can implicate any bond, i.e. it can proceed at (<italic>n</italic>-1) positions. Hence, the probability of dissociation should increase with the value of <italic>n</italic> and prevent the formation of excessively long polymers. This straightforward consideration, as well as the simulation results, discount the common belief that the longer polymers could have built up solely by means of their postulated higher stability against hydrolysis as compared to shorter polymers (see e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR386">386</xref>]).</p></list-item><list-item><p>After turning the virtual UV light on and in the absence of UV protection, with UV quanta being able to cleave the sugar-phosphate bonds, the polymerization yield dropped severely, and the extent of nucleobase incorporation in the polymers remained close to zero.</p></list-item><list-item><p>With the UV protection "switched on" (so that the binding of a nucleobase to a sugar-phosphate unit decreased the probability of UV breakage by a factor of 30), the length of formed polymers increased dramatically.

However, the increase in the relative fraction of longer, nucleobase-carrying polymers solely in response to switching on the UV protection (result no. 3) is not trivial at all, because in this case the utilization of radiation energy for synthesis was not "permitted". Here, the increase in the fraction of complex polymers was due to the breakage of the less photostable molecules by the virtual UV light. Since the number of molecules in the Monte-Carlo simulation was limited, the relative fraction of more photostable and, accordingly, more complex polymers increased. Therefore – and this is the key point – the enrichment in more complex RNA-like polymers was driven by the photo-dissociation of their less stable counterparts, in the absence of any direct coupling between the energy flow and the synthetic reactions.</p><p>From the experimental viewpoint, the results of this modelling might be related to the aforementioned finding of Sutherland and co-workers that prolonged UV illumination of the reaction medium containing a set of pyrimidine nucleotides and nucleosides led to the enrichment of photostable natural nucleotides on account of non-natural compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. From the theoretical viewpoint, the described mechanism of "indirect" energy utilization might be related to the so-called Landauer principle. Rolf Landauer, while working for IBM, demonstrated that, contrary to common belief, information <italic>per se</italic> could be created in a reversible way, i.e. "for free". Further analysis has shown, however, that energy would then be required to erase all the intermediate steps of such a reversible computation from the computer memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR387">387</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR390">390</xref>]. Accordingly, the creation of information requires energy in any case, but the energy can be utilized in two different ways: (i) for creating the information itself and/or (ii) for erasing the "garbage" from the system. It is noteworthy that the need for "erasing energy" arose because Landauer had considered a physically realistic computer with a limited number of memory units. At least on this point, Landauer's formalism corresponds to our Monte-Carlo simulation that also invoked a limited number of building blocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>].</p><p>Several authors have argued recently that the physical model of Landauer might be related to biology, in particular to creating and maintaining increasingly complex life systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR391">391</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR393">393</xref>]. As noted by Danchin, "<italic>creation of information requires many steps, it starts from a given complex of dynamic interacting entities, that progressively transforms into variants, among which some have a higher information than that of the original complex</italic>" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. It would seem that this quotation is equally applicable to computation processes and to the evolution of first RNA-like polymers on primordial Earth. Then, however, the emergence of increasingly complex RNA-like polymers could be driven by the energy-consuming, selective erasing of less "perfect" variants. Danchin writes that this type of selection process has to "<italic>actively discriminate between entities that are in some degree functional and those that cannot function. This is because the process needs to avoid destroying the elements that carry increased information, and this is where energy comes in. Energy has to be consumed to make innovations stand out, in a discriminant process: energy is used to prevent degradation of functional entities, permitting destruction of the non-functional ones</italic>" (quoted from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]). It is noteworthy that Danchin has invoked Landauer's formalism to describe the aging phenomena. Still, this approach seems to be applicable to the primordial RNA-like polymers in the Zn world, provided that we consider the more photostable constructs as "functional" ones and the solar UV radiation as the selecting and erasing energy input. In fact, since the more complex, longer polymers have more opportunities to fold or aggregate with the formation of UV-stable double strands, the increase in photostability should be coupled with the increase in complexity and, accordingly, in the information content (see also below). Incidentally, the interplay between supporting and erasing energy fluxes, which is apparent in the case of photostable RNA-like molecules, might represent the physical essence of biological evolution (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR394">394</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR395">395</xref>] for related discussions).</p><p>In any case, the competition between the RNA-like oligomers should have been tough in the primeval Zn world. The ZnS compartments (pores) could accommodate only a limited number of polymers, so that the enrichment of more photostable polymers – driven by the photo-dissociation of the less fit ones – must have been pronounced. In addition, the survival of a molecule depended not only on possession of apt UV quenchers but also on binding to a mineral template capable of absorbing excess radiation energy, so that primordial polymers would have competed for free surface patches. In this competition, the RNA-like polymers that, as argued above, could match the ZnS surfaces electrostatically would have gained an advantage.</p><p>It is possible to conclude that in the Zn world the energy of solar UV radiation may have been utilized in three different, although complementary, ways, namely: (i) for a high-yield, ZnS-mediated photosynthesis of diverse organic compounds, (ii) for fortuitous photopolymerization events, and (iii) for relative enrichment of the photostable, surface-adsorbed RNA-like polymers via the systematic photo-dissociation of more labile molecules.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Reproduction and replication in the Zn world</title><p>A few authors have noted that the origin of life could be a two-step process, with the emergence of the first replicators being facilitated by the pre-existence of out-of-equilibrium settings favouring their formation (see e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR396">396</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR397">397</xref>] and references therein). Dyson has hypothesized that the emergence of the first life forms capable of error-free <italic>replication</italic> may have been preceded by simpler <italic>reproducing</italic> systems where interacting chemical cycles, supported by external energy sources, could reach homeostasis and persist over time. He has even speculated that such reproducing systems could have evolved and attained complexity comparable to that of modern cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR398">398</xref>]. The Zn world settings can be considered out-of-equilibrium <italic>and</italic> reproducing, with their persistence being guaranteed by the hydrothermal activity of Earth and by solar energy. The precipitation of ZnS around hot springs would have led to a continuous <italic>reproduction</italic> of new, empty compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR176">176</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR219">219</xref>] where the selection of replicators could proceed on a geological timescale. In such settings, photostable compounds could have continuously emerged and undergone photoselection for millions of years, until their particular mutual interaction yielded an aggregate capable of robust self-replication. The emergence of life can therefore be considered not as an accident, but as a natural outcome of the interplay between solar radiation and particular geothermal processes on primordial Earth.</p><p>The role of reproducing, illuminated ZnS settings may have been in enabling the (photo)selection of the first replicating entities. Hence, this solar-powered selection may have been a link between abiogenic reproducing systems and the first replicators.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>The origin of meaningful complexity in the Zn world</title><p>Since the organisms, and not the polynucleotide molecules, are the subjects of evolution, some authors have noted that nucleotide strings (e.g. the genes that code particular proteins) are meaningless unless the machinery that translates the DNA/RNA-coded information into the final products is explicitly taken into account, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR399">399</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR401">401</xref>]. The Zn world scenario suggests how the biological meaning could emerge gradually, being driven by (photo)selection, with the more photostable systems gaining selective advantage upon each step. Indeed, if we could trace, in a UV-irradiated environment, the fate of two RNA-like polymers of the same length and the same information content (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR402">402</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR403">403</xref>] for surveys of relevant definitions), we may find that the polymer that could fold into a structure with more double-stranded segments and/or to bind tightly to an energy-absorbing template could endure more hits by UV quanta. Therefore each polymer could be characterized by its (i) intrinsic complexity related to the probability of its emergence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR402">402</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR403">403</xref>] and (ii) extrinsic complexity, the value of which would reflect its survival chances in given settings and could change depending on conditions. The more stable constructs, with higher complexity, would have had longer lifetimes and be steadily present in relatively larger numbers. Hence, they would have had more chances to interact with other stable constructs to form even more elaborate aggregates. At the moment when one such aggregate begins to replicate itself, the complexity of its constituents, thus far related to their survival chances in a UV-irradiated environment, becomes biologically meaningful. At the very same moment, the nucleobases – which were hitherto acting solely as efficient UV-protecting units – become the letters of the genetic alphabet. In this framework, the "meaning", in the biological sense, is intrinsically coupled with the survival chances under given circumstances and thus can precede the emergence of the translation machinery (that could have gradually developed later; see e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>] for tentative scenarios).</p><p>Since polynucleotides do not last long in nature, replication can be considered as a way to preserve (accumulate) information before an information carrier – a polynucleotide strand – eventually breaks down because of thermal fluctuation or (photo)cleavage. It is likely that the first replicating systems invoked linear polymers because the replication of branched polymers – as a logical alternative – may have been mechanistically impracticable.</p><p>In summary, we have an example of a Darwinian function co-option [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR404">404</xref>]: the "irreducible complexity" of the first replicators can still be reduced by suggesting that their simpler "ancestors" underwent selection for a different, less structurally demanding aptitude (namely for their ability to survive in a UV-irradiated environment).</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Physical continuity of life</title><p>Living organisms are routinely considered as systems that sustain themselves by converting "few" high-quality energy quanta into "many" low-quality, thermal quanta, this process being accompanied by entropy production, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR209">209</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR405">405</xref>]. These high-quality (or high-energy) quanta are those that contain portions of energy large enough to drive chemical reactions, such as the quanta of light in the UV and visible ranges or the energy portions that are released upon redox reactions. In such a framework, biological evolution could be understood as a way to optimize the utilization of high-energy quanta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR209">209</xref>].</p><p>The evolution of energy conversion at the earliest evolutionary stages, e.g. in the RNA world, as well as the driving force(s) beyond this evolution have remained, however, undefined. In modern organisms, the conversion and storage both of the energy of light and of chemical energy are carried out by membrane enzymes that catalyze sophisticated chains of redox reactions (see e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR176">176</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR406">406</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR408">408</xref>] for reviews). It is noteworthy that (known) natural ribozymes cannot store either the energy of light or the redox energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Not surprisingly, the traditional concept of the RNA world has circumvented the question of exploiting the external energy fluxes.</p><p>Before addressing this question, it is useful to realize that the ability of high-energy quanta to drive chemical reactions does not require these reactions to be useful. For a living organism, the outcome from capturing a UV quantum may have been hazardous rather than beneficial. In the Zn world, where surface-confined photosynthesized molecules could not escape solar UV light, the first RNA-like polymers may have initially been selected not for their ability to exploit the high-energy quanta but for the ability to discard them promptly or, in other words, to "process" them without undergoing photodamage. The ability to discard the energy quanta is less structurally demanding than the ability to exploit them, so, as argued above, this ability may already have been inherent in simple organic molecules. It is tempting to suggest that the common energetic denominator of living organisms – throughout the whole evolutionary time span – may have been, not the ability to exploit high-energy quanta, but the ability to "deal" with them – in a general sense.</p><p>This suggestion makes it possible to follow a continuous evolutionary thread from the origin of life event to the modern struggle of mankind for energy. At the beginning of this thread, the first RNA-like polymers could have emerged as systems capable of discarding potentially hazardous high-energy quanta without undergoing damage. The energy requirements of the first replicators could have been covered by the breakdown of "nutrients" produced in photosynthetic but abiogenic reactions. The first heterotrophic organisms, while retaining the ability to discard excess energy, could have gradually developed abilities to control the high-energy quanta and to use them. It is plausible that solar energy, besides serving as a selective factor, may have occasionally promoted chemical reactions (e.g. as happens in natural photolyases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR409">409</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR410">410</xref>] or in an artificial deoxyribozyme with photolyase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR411">411</xref>]). The funnelling of high-energy quanta into useful reactions may have been profitable <italic>per se</italic> and, in addition, could have prevented undesirable overheating and denaturation. However, only the emergence of biogenic dielectrics, namely proteins and phospholipid membranes, enabled the storage of the energy of light in the form of charge-separated states, physically analogous to those involved in ZnS-mediated photosynthesis (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and the accompanying article [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR226">226</xref>]). This development may have paved the way to the first phototrophic organisms in which membrane-embedded, energy-converting systems could have developed, supposedly, from the UV-protecting membrane proteins of the first cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR226">226</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR412">412</xref>]. It is noteworthy that modern chlorophyll-carying proteins, besides being involved in the storing and utilization of solar energy, retain the ability to protect cell DNA from the residual UV component of solar radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR413">413</xref>], thus resembling the nucleobases that, in addition to serving as the letters of genetic code, continue to protect DNA and RNA backbones from UV damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">159</xref>]. In this framework, the gradually attained ability to exploit high-energy quanta of light can be considered as an evolutionary younger, as compared to their deactivation, and more sophisticated way of dealing with them. As the accessible energy assets ran out, living organisms had to "acquire new powers" (quotation from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]), i.e. increase their complexity, if they wanted to access and exploit new energy sources (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR209">209</xref>] for detailed considerations of this point).</p><p><italic>In summary</italic>, the emergence of life on Earth may be traced to the successful attempt of particular (hetero)cyclic molecules to overcome, in a joint effort, the hazards of solar UV rays that they could not escape.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Relationship to other hypotheses on the origin of life</title><p>The suggested scenario invokes elements from different, even seemingly contradicting, hypotheses on the origin of life. This should not be surprising, since each of these hypotheses builds upon empirical data and/or certain theoretical bases. Accordingly, these empirical observations and theoretical considerations have to be accounted for by any scenario that claims to serve as a platform for further discussions in the field.</p><p>Oparin's hypothesis of a heterotrophic origin of life implied that the initially established metabolism could have resembled fermentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The rationale behind this supposition (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] for further development of this view) was straightforward: fermentation is a simple mode of metabolism that is inherent in the most primitive anaerobic organisms. We now know that catalytic chemistry beyond the breakage or formation of covalent bonds is indeed the least structurally demanding; in most cases only acid-base catalysis is involved, often enhanced by metal atoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR368">368</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR371">371</xref>]. Not surprisingly, reactions of this type can be catalyzed even by ribozymes, unlike many other chemical transformations that can be performed only by proteins. The Zn world scenario builds on this rationale and suggests that primordial metabolism, as catalyzed by the first ribozymes and enzymes, constituted a set of chemically simple transformations where reactions of bond breakage were coupled with reactions of bond formation, perhaps being mediated by group transfer events. Oparin, however, did not treat primordial energetics explicitly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The formation of the first polymers was suggested to proceed spontaneously, without coupling to energy flow. Without such coupling, however, an unsupported formation of long polymers would contradict the laws of thermodynamics, as routinely noted by critics of Oparin's idea (see e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]). In contrast, the Zn world scenario invokes solar UV light as an energy source both for prebiological syntheses and for (photo)selection.</p><p>Haldane, in addition to a fermentation-like metabolism, which he postulated independently of Oparin, suggested that "<italic>the first living ... things were probably large molecules synthesized under the influence of Sun radiation</italic>" (quoted from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]). Hence, on this point Oparin's and Haldane's hypotheses differ. In addition, Haldane argued that the complexity of the first organisms should be compatible to that of bacteriophages, thus anticipating some aforementioned modern views related to the RNA world concept [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR219">219</xref>]. On all these points, there is an agreement between the Zn world concept and Haldane's hypothesis. Nonetheless, Haldane suggested that life emerged in the homogenous phase (it was he who mentioned the "<italic>hot, dilute soup</italic>"). In contrast, the Zn world concept considers primeval life as a surface-confined phenomenon.</p><p>The Zn world concept is in accord with the RNA world (RNA life) hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]; the RNA-based life forms may have inhabited the photosynthesizing, porous ZnS edifices that could help to (photo)select first RNA organisms, provide a shelter and nourish them. RNA organisms most likely inhabited the Zn world only in the beginning, being followed by RNA/protein life forms. Concerning RNA research, the involvement of ZnS surfaces suggested here implies that, upon modelling or simulating primeval events, electrically charged ZnS surfaces may be explicitly invoked as supporting (photo)catalytic templates (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR414">414</xref>]). With their assistance, replication could have been carried out by relatively simple aggregates of RNA-like polymers. In addition, the first systems of protein synthesis, owing to supporting ZnS templates, may have been fundamentally simpler than their modern counterparts (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]). The gradual decoupling from the ZnS surfaces and the emergence of enclosed organisms would have required more complex devices, such as primeval ribosomes, which, however, had time to evolve gradually from more simple predecessors – by recruiting new parts to functionally replace the ZnS baseplates.</p><p>The Zn world scenario incorporates elements from some "metabolism first" concepts, in particular from the "Pyrite world/Pioneer organism" concept of Wächtershäuser, who put forward a detailed concept of a two-dimensional primordial life on iron disulfide (FeS<sub>2</sub>, pyrite) surfaces at the sea floor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">130</xref>]. The Zn world scenario exploits the suggestion of Wächtershäuser that the mineral surfaces may have promoted the abiogenic syntheses of the first polymeric molecules. In addition, the Zn world model builds upon the idea of Russell and co-workers on porous chimneys of the deep-sea hydrothermal vents as incubators for the first life forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>]. In contrast with these two concepts, the Zn world scenario considers zinc sulphide – instead of iron sulfides, which can generate potentially harmful hydroxyl radicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR223">223</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR224">224</xref>] – as the "mineral of life", and locates the first life settings at the illuminated surface of Earth. Moreover, the suggested metabolism in the Zn world, which combines abiogenic photosynthesis with the primitive heterotrophy of the first replicators, is fundamentally different from the (bio)chemical mechanisms that were postulated for the two "iron-sulfide" worlds and based upon iron-catalyzed redox reactions (see the accompanying article [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR226">226</xref>] for more details on this point).</p><p>Kuhn and Waser have noted that the pores of primordial rocks could have served as compartments upon the evolution of the first RNA molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. A related attempt to merge the FeS compartments with the RNA life has recently been performed by Martin and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR219">219</xref>], who have suggested that "<italic>within a hydrothermally formed system of contiguous iron-sulfide (FeS) compartments, populations of virus-like RNA molecules, which eventually encoded one or a few proteins each, became the agents of both variation and selection</italic>" (quoted from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR219">219</xref>]). Experimental evidence of polynucleotide accumulation in simulated pore systems has been provided by Braun and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR415">415</xref>]. The idea of porous natural settings as incubators for the first RNA-like life forms is used in the Zn world scenario. It, however, suggests that the function of "honeycombed" ZnS settings was not limited to compartmentalization but also included photosynthesis of metabolites, (photo)selection of most fit polymers, and (photo)catalysis of diverse reactions. In addition, the Zn concept implies that colonization of these settings by first life forms proceeded from the illuminated, photosynthesizing top to the bottom, in contrast to the scheme of Martin and co-workers in which life propagated from the bottom, "secure" part of the deep-sea hydrothermal FeS vent to the surface.</p><p>A few authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR416">416</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR417">417</xref>] have stressed the potential importance of high radioactivity on primordial Earth for the origin of life, albeit without suggesting how the energy of ionizing radiation could be used for biochemically relevant syntheses. The Zn world scenario incorporates such a mechanism: ZnS crystals can trap and transiently store, in a form of charge-separated states, diverse kinds of radiation energy, namely X-rays, electrons (as in displays), α-particles (ZnS was introduced as the first inorganic scintillator by Sir William Crookes in 1903), and so on. The excited electron(s) could then drive the CO<sub>2</sub> reduction at the surface of ZnS crystals. Hence, ZnS crystals show a unique ability to convert diverse kinds of energy into the chemical energy of organic compounds. Taking into account the high radioactivity level on primordial Earth, the ZnS edifices would have worked as natural converters of radioactive energy into reduced carbon and nitrogen-containing metabolites. The high-energy radiation could have penetrated deeper into the ZnS edifices than the solar UV light and, in addition, could have supported the ZnS photoreactors during the night hours.</p><p>Nonetheless, it is necessary to emphasize that the major source of energy for primordial life was solar light, since its energy, according to available estimates, was many orders of magnitude larger than that of ionizing radiation (see e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>]).

Mulkidjanian and M. Galperin are a useful contribution to this long human effort (and a basic essential human need) to understand who we are and how we got here. The effort goes back at least to the ancient Greeks and with more modern developments starting with Louis Pasteur's demonstration of the absence of "spontaneous generation" of life in our time and then 75 years later A. I. Oparin taking some colloid physical chemistry and making for the first time a plausible scientific model of the Origin of Life. Then the Miller and Urey experiments (here in Chicago) with electrical sparks as energy showed one can synthesize small organic amino acids and other basic building blocks of biopolymers by abiogenic mechanisms, given the required energy.</p><p>There were three stages of the origin of life that should be defined better than Mulkidjanian does:</p><p>(a) Pre-biotic or abiotic, "pre-cellular" synthesis of building subunits of future biopolymers. This is not really the Origin of Life but something abiotic, a bit earlier and eventually leading to life, which starts with The First Cell. That is what is discussed in these papers. There are basically two current models for prebiotic small molecule organic chemistry and physical chemistry (which all agree is all that is needed) to progress to life. These can be divided roughly in to metabolism-first or self replication-starts-Darwinian evolution.</p><p>(b) The First Cell comes next and was (in our replication-oriented thinking) a ribozyme surrounded by a liposome (neither of which alone is alive). A source of external energy – undoubtedly metal cation redox derived – was the third requirement for the first cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Once the early Earth had these replicating primitive cells, Darwinian evolution and selection would lead inevitably to metabolism and the diversity of living cells we recognize today. The current authors disagree, but it is unclear whether the disagreement is fundamental or merely a matter of emphasis. This has been a field of multiple ideas but no consensus for most of the last 50 years. As one example lack of consensus, our 2005 paper seems to have had no influence on others thinking along alternative pathways. The First Cell lacked ribosomes, and therefore lacked proteins (e.g. The First Cell had no enzyme catalysts and no metabolism, as we understand now that these). It lacked ATP and other familiar high-energy phosphate-bond small intermediates. The early ZnS structures hypothesized by Mulkidjanian would be outside the First Cell, and might indeed contribute importantly to prebiotic accumulation of macromolecular precursors. However, once the primitive First Cell arose and evolution started, the cell membrane would block ZnS from the early cytoplasm.</p><p>(c) To go from The First Cell to The Last Universal Ancestor of Bacteria, Archaea, and then the first Eukaryotic cells (which formed by fusion of a couple or more prokaryotes) required evolution and invention of all of the familiar macromolecular nucleic acid and protein synthesis machinery and metabolism that is common to all current living cells, over the relatively brief period of a couple hundred million years, a short time back then over 3 billion years ago. The Genetic Code needed to evolve. Therefore Mulkidjanian is wrong on a small point that his ZnS photosynthetic mechanisms would do anything at all toward explaining how the three domains of life split, after basically all cell biology was invented by evolution. One should be clear and explicitly state that the "photosynthesis" referred to here is unrelated to biological photosynthesis, which came much later; early life was dependent, however, on metal ion redox chemistry; and was either utilized light (i.e. was photosynthetic) or not.</p><p><bold><italic>Author's response</italic></bold>: <italic>The three stages in the origin of life, as envisioned by the Reviewer, might serve as an instrumental model in some cases; the respective article</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]<italic>is cited in the revised manuscript. Generally, however, the evolution of life seems to be a more complex phenomenon. For example, viruses do not fit into this scheme at all. The very existence of viruses, which on the one hand are mostly built of nucleic acids and proteins but not lipids, and on the other hand seem to precede cellular life forms in evolution</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], <italic>challenges the idea of the First Cell that lacked proteins. This is one of the reasons why I base the Zn world hypothesis upon the "standard" sequence of events, namely RNA → proteins → membranes</italic>.</p><p><italic>It seems plausible that the zinc-rich settings could directly affect the first life forms even after the emergence of membranes. The transition from membrane-lacking to membrane-encased life forms is connected with the following "chicken and egg" paradox: while a lipid membrane would be useless without membrane transporting systems, the respective membrane proteins would need membranes to evolve. We have tackled this paradox by combining structural and phylogenetic analyses and have suggested that the evolution of membrane transporters started from simple amphiphilic proteins capable of being incorporated into the membrane and of forming oligomeric pores and that chemiosmosis, particularly the proton-based type, was an evolutionary latecomer</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175">175</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR176">176</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR421">421</xref>]. <italic>The porous membranes would still be leaky to Zn</italic><sup>2+</sup><italic>ions.

Orgel (1927–2007), who worked and thought productively and long on these questions. Orgel helped establish reluctantly and unintentionally that there never has been agreement of among the (accurately said by Mulkidjanian to be) "many scenarios" for the Origin of Life. It is implausible and unlikely to think that this new additional model of "A Zinc World" will add to or replace the currently popular RNA World [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] or that it will simplify and make the current alternatives fewer. Mulkidjanian is also wrong if he thinks one can experimentally "falsify" (as Karl Popper hopefully, but erroneously influenced a generation of mostly-British and German scientists) what happened nearly 4 billion years ago by current efforts mostly of analysis and argumentation, and not direct experimentation. The situation concerning understanding of the Origin of Life seems more like Thomas Kuhn taught us about other realms of science: ideas disappear only when the people who like them die and are replaced by younger people with differing ideas. A contemporary of L.E. Orgel, H. Morowitz together with younger colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] has a new popular report that lays out the issues nicely and also demonstrates that the current two efforts by Mulkidjanian and Galperin will not succeed in simplifying the alterative ideas. Trefil, Morowitz, and Smith [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] agree with Mulkidjanian and Galperin that metabolism came first, before hereditary polymer replication (this is where we primarily disagree) and they quote Albert Szent-Gyorgi (1893–1986) that Life is nothing but an electron looking for a place to rest. Redox chemistry and electron transport along pathways that conserve energy are essential to the Origin of Life as to contemporary life: on that we all agree.

It seems necessary to emphasize here that the "replication first" models, such as the RNA world, leave biologists happy but cannot completely satisfy those with a background in physics or physical chemistry who realize that RNA life would be thermodynamically implausible unless coupled to some utilizable energy source. In contrast, the "metabolism first" schemes are favoured by some physicists, chemists, and geologists, but these cannot convince the majority of biologists who simply cannot accept life without replication.

In contrast, if we still can have archives, then we could start from <bold>extant</bold> metabolism. This was the idea of Sam Granick and later on of Gunter Wächtershäuser (who ignored Granick, which made difficult uncovering his remarkable work: it took me several years to stumble upon that work). Here, the idea is to remark (which the author apparently ignores) that <bold>anabolism</bold> is very special in that it is essentially made of molecules carrying negative charges, often phosphate.

This is however, to my view, one of the most indisputable scenarios explaining how life could have led to a constructive metabolism. Granick, Wächtershäuser and I should include myself, argue very strongly for that step as the basis of <bold>selection</bold> (much needed to avoid the poisonous broth) and or <bold>polymerisation</bold>. True that Miller and De Duve (for reasons which are obscure to me, except that surfaces led to much less interest in sparks and the like) tried to discard the idea of surfaces by stating that chemical reactions on a surface would simply preclude separation from the surface of the polymers: this is a completely far-fetched argument, ignoring (purposedly?) that the polymerisation is not driven, in most cases by enthalpy, but by entropy (because of elimination of a water molecule, which goes in the solution: exactly the opposite of what would happen in the solution, where polymers would tend to be unstable unless the medium is highly compartmentalised, with a role on water activity). Their argument cannot be retained. Worse, I think that De Duve should have, on the contrary, built up his theory (which is excellent) of the role of thioesters, on surfaces: 4-phosphopantetheine would be the swinging arm to make many complex compounds <bold>including the much wanted long fatty acids</bold> !!!

In contrast, I build upon the works of Wächtershäuser in this respect and argue that the syntheses of polymers could proceed at ZnS surfaces where the first RNA-like polymers were protected from photodamage. In the Zn world, therefore, the selection was not a one-step process but a two-step process: first, electrostatically preferred molecules adsorbed at the ZnS surfaces and could participate in diverse photochemical reactions, and next, those product molecules that were particularly photostable (e.g. oligonucleotides) were photoselected. As noted above, a photoselection of natural nucleotides has just been experimentally demonstrated by Sutherland and co-workers</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. <italic>Thus, I consider the surface confinement of first polymers as a pre-condition of their survival in a UV-irradiated environment</italic>.</p><p><italic>I do not think that it is possible to rebuff the argumentation of De Duve and Miller</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200">200</xref>], <italic>because their reasoning was based on a straightforward application of energy conservation law. The mechanism of the membrane ATP synthase – as is considered in the article – exemplifies that, if the free energy (ΔG) of a particular synthetic reaction differs in two environments, then a portion of free energy – equal to the difference between the two respective ΔG values – should be "invested" to transfer the reaction product between the two environments. But, and this is the point that I have tried to emphasize, the displacements</italic><italic><underline>within</underline></italic><italic>the particular environment can proceed "for free". In other words, the polymers would not remain bound at the sites of their polymerization (as De Duve and Miller have envisioned), but rather could diffuse along the surface and interact with other polymers</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>Reviewer 3</title><p>So much for these points: if I go on, I will write a new book! Just one final point: the author writes " The living organisms are evolving, dissipative systems that can exist only being supported by energy flow ", this is either trite or wrong (or both) and this rests on a completely wrong view of the way entropy fluxes are involved in Nature. The author (and I can send him the paper) should read the remarkable paper of Rolf Landauer " Inadequacy of entropy and entropy derivatives in characterizing the steady state " published in Physical Review A, in august 1975.

I have been long aware of this controversy between Prigogine and his opponents, and therefore these ideas of Prigogine were not even mentioned in the original manuscript. I refer to Prigogine in another relation. Prigogine has repeatedly argued, in his many articles and books, that the emergence of ordered complexity in nature requires continuous supporting energy flow and out-of-equilibrium settings. Since some hypotheses on the origin of life simply ignore this point, I find it worthy to emphasize that life could not emerge either "for free" or in an equiponderated primordial soup – and cite Prigogine in this respect. Nevertheless, I have somewhat changed the respective wording to avoid any misinterpretations</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec42"><title>Reviewer 3</title><p>Now, I come to his opinion about zinc as central to the origin of life. This is based on an idea, worth investigating, placing light at the centre of energy management. Why not, this certainly happened with cyanobacteria and before. Why not very early on. I have no major objection to the generality of the idea. However I do not think that the way the author involves nucleobases is convincing. Light needs to be, indeed, coupled to energy, and electron transfers are cases in point. This may place heme or related molecules in the limelight, but also ... iron. Certainly not nucleic acids. In contrast, I would certainly accept ZnS (but I did not have access to the second paper, where falsification tests are proposed). Photosynthesis in a Zn world, why not, and this apparently would happen as a mineral surface metabolism (so that I did not really understand why the author was so much against the idea). But I would not easily accept nucleobases as primitive: as I stated above I think nucleotides must be made more or less directly, and I proposed a scenario which sees them as a leak of a general process of nitrogen fixation. This might well work in a Zn world.</p><p><bold><italic>Author's response</italic></bold>: <italic>While being quite happy that the Reviewer has no major objection to the idea of abiogenic ZnS-mediated photosynthesis, I would like to reiterate that I am not against the idea of surface "metabolism" (see above)</italic>.</p><p><italic>I readily agree that it is difficult even to imagine a spontaneous formation of nucleotides in the "primeval broth" from occasionally formed nucleobases, ribose molecules, and phosphate groups. The Zn world concept, however, does not require the formation of single nucleotides in solution. The concept implies that polynucleotides could directly assemble at the ZnS surfaces from simpler building blocks. In the aforementioned work of Sutherland and co-workers, the viability of such syntheses has been experimentally demonstrated</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. <italic>In this way, the step of mononucleotide synthesis could be bypassed. The survival of the entire polymeric constructs could then be guaranteed by their extreme photostability. In this framework, single nucleotides could have first appeared as cleavage products of the polynucleotides</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec43"><title>Reviewer 3</title><p>Second, I would urge the author to think of replication as secondary to metabolic reproduction, where peptides were present first (this is what I tried to demonstrate in my "The chicken and the egg" book (see above)). Also, the author, once again, needs to think of the origin of coenzymes! This can certainly be included in his scenario. Nucleic acids are latecomers, they came first as surface substitutes, then discovered that rather than being <bold>substrates</bold> they could become <bold>templates</bold>. There I am interested by the idea that Zn favors formation of 3'-5' bonds (which is indeed a very difficult feat, normally favoured by the presence of peptides).</p><p><bold><italic>Author's response</italic></bold>: <italic>In fact, I think (and write) about replication as a phenomenon that was secondary to the reproducing, steady-state flows of energy and matter (although I think the word "metabolism" might be misleading in relation to abiogenic processes)</italic>.</p><p><italic>The "metabolism first" models, however, have certain difficulties in explaining the transition to the first replicating entities. For example, Dyson has suggested a multistep model with the reproducing but not replicating cells emerging first and followed by nucleotide-based replicators initially as parasites of these cells and then as their symbionts</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR398">398</xref>]. <italic>However, neither the (bio)chemical origin of the replicators nor the selection factors that could favour their emergence were addressed. In contrast, the Zn world model considers photoselection as a force that, by driving the emergence of photostable entities built of stacked and paired nucleotides, could have paved the way to the first self-replicating systems</italic>.</p><p><italic>Therefore, I cannot agree that nucleic acids were latecomers. In the literature, many arguments are in favour of RNA-first scenarios, the majority referring to the ability of RNA molecules, but not proteins, to replicate; I do not want to repeat this argumentation here. One more argument, based on selection criteria, can still be invoked. One can presume that nucleobases, as well as amino acids, could be selected for their particular tasks because of specific properties that were useful under given circumstances and were shared by all nucleobases and amino acids, respectively. The common property of nucleobases is their extreme photostability. Hence it has been repeatedly hypothesized that they were selected because of this property (see</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">159</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">165</xref>] <italic>and references therein). The respective selective factor, solar UV irradiation, is abiotic, so that the selection could have started before the origin of life. The common property of amino acids is the presence of amino and acidic groups that allow them to join into polypeptide chains. The selection for this property, however, implies the existence of devices that could connect amino acids by peptide bonds. In modern organisms, this function is routinely performed by RNA-based machines (ribosomes); it is even now becoming clear how these machines could evolve from simpler RNA constructs already capable of peptide bond formation (see</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>] <italic>and references cited therein). This consideration, in my opinion, strongly supports the RNA-first schemes</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec44"><title>Reviewer 3</title><p>Finally, a word about the quotation by the author of the work of Rolf Landauer. It happens that I was lucky enough to meet him before he passed away, and to discuss much of the questions involving entropy and information (he showed to me how Prigogine was completely wrong, for example, see his paper cited above). The important point here is to see that if creation of information is not a real problem, accumulation of information is. And this requires an energy source. It is most likely, to my view, that this was originally performed by a mineral such as polyphosphate, which is quite metastable, and later on perhaps by nucleotides and polynucleotides (such as what is seen in the management of energy in the degradosome today, see my Phylogenetic view of ribonucleases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR423">423</xref>]).</p><p><bold><italic>Author's response</italic></bold>: <italic>The energetics of the accumulation of information is a very important point. Since polynucleotides are not eternal, replication per se can be considered as a means to preserve (accumulate) information before an information carrier – a polynucleotide strand – eventually breaks down because of thermal fluctuation or (photo)cleavage. In the manuscript, several tentative energy sources for replication are considered. Initially, the replication could be supported by the thermodynamically coupled cleavage of available polynucleotides – "failed" information carriers, in the given context. The cleavage of inorganic polyphosphates, as suggested by the Reviewer, could provide energy as well; chemically, this reaction is similar to the cleavage of polynucleotides. This possibility is now mentioned</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec45"><title>Reviewer 3</title><p>Well.

However why then are the bases constructed such that they absorb UV radiation with good efficiency at all? The absorption cross section is so large that it is even used for DNA quantification. I would guess that one could probably readily design molecules which would combine both a lower UV absorption and – if they do still absorb one – get rid of the energy with similar mechanisms. Am I missing something here?</p><p><bold><italic>Author's response</italic></bold>: <italic>Lower UV absorption of a chemical compound means that a passing UV quantum is captured not by the first molecule on its way but, say, by the tenth molecule. But then this tenth molecule still has to cope with the entire energy of the UV quantum. As long as organic molecules are considered, deactivation of a UV quantum requires prompt spreading of its energy over many bonds (therefore conjugated bonds are needed) and an efficient sink for energy (here several diverse mechanisms might be involved</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">164</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">165</xref>]). <italic>In the absence of conjugated bonds, the energy of UV quanta will "gather" at the "weakest" bond and eventually break it. As a result, the quantum yield of photodamage might be much higher for a compound with low absorption of UV than for a compound with high UV absorption and many conjugated bonds. Goosen and Kloosterboer</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">166</xref>]<italic>have shown that the release of phosphate in response to 254 nm light was 10 times slower in the case of adenosine monophosphate (AMP, a highly UV-absorbing compound) than in the case of glycerol 2-phosphate (which barely absorbs at 254 nm). It would seem that, in a kind of trade-off, the increased absorption cross section was over-compensated by increased photostabilty in the case of AMP. In this framework, all means that increased the spreading of excitation energy without increasing the absorption cross section would be strongly favoured by evolution. The stacking of nucleotides, as well as their pairing, would result in the spreading of excitation energy over a larger number of chemical bonds without increasing the absorption cross section</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec54"><title>Reviewer 4</title><p>It would be useful if the author could also comment on the "Lost City" type vents as his arguments on page 10 apparently only applies to so called "black smokers".</p><p><bold><italic>Author's response</italic></bold>: <italic>Lost City-type vents were found at depths of ~700–800 m (see</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]<italic>for a review).
