In this limited class of nanocrystals, CdSe/CdS core/arm tetrapods exhibit the unusual trait of two-colour (red and green) multiexcitonic emission, with green emission from the CdS arms emerging only at high excitation fluences. Here we show that by synthetic shape-tuning, both this multi-colour emission process, and blinking and photobleaching behaviours of single tetrapods can be controlled. Specifically, we find that the properties of dual emission and single-nanostructure photostability depend on different structural parameters—arm length and arm diameter, respectively—but that both properties can be realized in the same nanostructure. Furthermore, based on results of correlated photoluminescence and transient absorption measurements, we conclude that hole-trap filling in the arms and partial state-filling in the core are necessary preconditions for the observation of multiexciton multi-colour emission.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">CdSe/CdS tetrapods exhibit the unusual trait of two-colour multiexcitonic emission.

Barrier-mediated dual emission in tetrapods involves two red-emission bands associated with the CdSe core<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Specifically, in single-tetrapod studies conducted at cryogenic temperatures, two red-colour emissions were observed and attributed to emission from direct and indirect exciton states, respectively. The former involves radiative recombination of a CdSe-localized electron–hole pair, or exciton, whereas the latter involves recombination of either a CdSe-localized hole and a CdS-localized electron (type II band alignment) or a CdSe-localized hole and a delocalized electron (quasi type II band alignment)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The ability of the direct exciton state to coexist with the indirect exciton state was attributed to the presence of a strain-induced interfacial barrier inhibiting electron relaxation to the CdS shell (type II structure) or delocalization into the CdS shell (quasi type II structure). The two red emissions (direct, 2.045 and indirect, 2.020 eV) were observed at all excitation pump fluences and afforded typical random spectral diffusion and fluorescence blinking behaviours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">In contrast, the second type of dual emission observed in QD-seeded tetrapods appears only at high excitation pump fluences. Under such conditions, green emission from the CdS arms can emerge in addition to CdSe-core red emission. This constitutes a multi-excitonic emission process as intense optical excitation results in the formation of multiple excitons that contribute together to the observed PL and, although the exciton states that produce these red and green emissions are spatially separated between the core and an arm, respectively, they are electronically coupled. This is in contrast with excitonic states responsible for dual emission in core/shell/shell QDs, which are both spatially and electronically decoupled<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In tetrapods, photoexcitation creates excitons in the core and the arms in proportion to their relative volumes and absorption cross sections. High-energy carriers (electrons and holes) generated during excitation in the arms can relax or migrate as excitons into the core-localized states, whereby tetrapod arms effectively function as a light-collecting antenna for the core. A previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> has concluded that at sufficiently high pump levels core electronic states can get filled, thus blocking further relaxation of carriers (or migration of excitons) from the CdS arms to the core. Under these conditions, the arm states can potentially contribute to tetrapod PL. Concurrent suppression of non-radiative Auger recombination (Auger recombination is a many-body process whereby the energy of electron-hole recombination is transferred to a separate electron or hole that then relaxes from its excited state to the ground state non-radiatively by dissipation of heat) was also cited as a prerequisite for this type of two-colour PL. Tetrapod volume was identified as the key structural feature determining whether Auger processes were sufficiently suppressed, with long-arm (55 nm) tetrapods affording sufficiently large volumes in contrast with short-arm (28 nm) tetrapods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">To date, multi-excitonic two-colour emission has been studied for ensembles of tetrapods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Here we investigate room-temperature PL properties at the single tetrapod level. We study the blinking, photobleaching and quantum optical properties of the multiexcitonic dual-emission process, and we do so as a function of both tetrapod arm length and arm thickness. In this way, we are able to differentiate effects of nanostructure volume from those of tetrapod arm length or thickness. We also elaborate on the role of Auger recombination in this system, distinguishing between two types of Auger processes—those active in the core and those in the arms. We show that Auger recombination in the CdSe core determines the extent to which PL blinking can be suppressed, whereas Auger recombination in the CdS arms probably determines the prevalence of two-colour red and green emission. We further show that large volume is an insufficient condition for achieving the necessary suppression of Auger recombination in the arms for strong dual emission and, instead, tetrapod shape plays the key role, with arm thickness defining Auger processes in the core and arm length dominating processes in the arms. Significantly, we take advantage of recent advances in tetrapod synthesis, as well as exploiting alternative methods for tuning tetrapod arm thickness, to prepare a comprehensive tetrapod-shape series that allows the direct assessment of ‘geometry’ effects on single-tetrapod PL properties from photostability (blinking, bleaching) to colour complexity. In this way, we determine the structural parameters for intentionally ‘engineering’ unprecedented performance metrics of blinking-suppressed two-colour multiexcitonic and even tricolour PL.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Synthesis and characterization of a tetrapod shape series</title><p id="Par8">Using 4 nm CdSe zinc-blende QDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> as seed material, we synthesized a series of tetrapods characterized by differences in both arm thickness and arm length. We employed the seeded growth approach of Fiore <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> with modified surfactant chemistry for enhanced monodispersity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The resulting tetrapods were as follows: thin/short (TP1: 6.3 nm±0.5 nm/24.8 nm±2.3 nm), thick/short (TP2: 10.9 nm±0.8 nm/27.6 nm±2.9 nm), thin/long (TP3: 8.2 nm±1.3 nm/40.7 nm±3.8 nm) and thick/long (TP4: 10.6 nm±2.4 nm/41.3 nm±4.6 nm) (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). (Note: TP diameters were measured at the arm base.) TP1, TP3 and TP4 were prepared exclusively using the recently developed syntheses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, whereas TP2 tetrapods were fabricated from TP1 tetrapods using the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method to controllably add CdS shell monolayers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Despite the complex shape of the tetrapod TP1 ‘core’, SILAR growth proceeded roughly as expected, with the number of predicted shell monolayers (calculated based on the amount of precursor added; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM457">Supplementary Note 1</xref> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM457">Supplementary Information</xref>) approximately matching the number of shell monolayers obtained in the synthesis, as determined by measuring the arm-thickness increase from transmission electron microscopy images. Specifically, nominally five monolayers of CdS were added (one monolayer=0.3375, nm) by the SILAR technique and the resulting arm diameter increased by ∼4.1 nm compared with a predicted 3.4 nm. Interestingly, however, CdS deposition was not conformal. As-prepared, tetrapod arms adopt a truncated cone shape<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, but SILAR-thickened arms were cylindrical (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> compared with <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>), implying that SILAR growth was more rapid at the thinner arm tips than at the thicker arm bases. In all cases, tetrapod volume is dominated by the relatively large CdS arms compared to the relatively small CdSe core. Specifically, the volume of the CdSe core is ∼35 nm<sup>3</sup>, whereas total tetrapod volumes (calculated using dimensions measured from transmission electron microscopy images and the volume of a truncated cone as an estimate of arm shape for TP1, TP3 and TP4, and that of a cylinder for TP2; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM457">Supplementary Note 1</xref>) are much larger: ∼2,660 nm<sup>3</sup> (TP1), 10,330 nm<sup>3</sup> (TP2), 6,840 nm<sup>3</sup> (TP3) and 12,270 nm<sup>3</sup> (TP4).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Electron microscopy images and ensemble optical properties for a nanoengineered tetrapod shape series.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>–<bold>d</bold>) Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of four tetrapods (also shown schematically) differing in arm diameter (measured at the base of 3 arms for 30–40 tetrapods in each case) and arm length (also measured for 3 arms of 30–40 tetrapods for each of the tetrapod geometries), respectively—(<bold>a</bold>) TP1: 6.3 nm±0.5 nm and 24.8 nm±2.3 nm; (<bold>b</bold>) TP2: 10.9 nm±0.8 nm and 27.6 nm±2.9 nm; (<bold>c</bold>) TP3: 8.2 nm±1.3 nm and 40.7 nm±3.8 nm; (<bold>d</bold>) TP4: 10.6 nm±2.4 nm and 41.3 nm±4.6 nm (scale bar, 20 nm (in <bold>a</bold> applies also to <bold>b</bold>–<bold>d</bold>)) (<bold>e</bold>) Absorbance and PL spectra for each of the tetrapod geometries (TP1 (magenta), TP2 (ochre), TP3 (turquoise) and TP4 (blue)) showing the large effective Stokes shift between absorption positions and PL maxima (∼160 nm; indicated by arrow).

The higher bandgap CdS arms contribute more to the total particle volume and thereby dominate absorption spectra, whereas PL derives from exciton recombination in the CdSe core, effectively separating the processes of absorption and emission. A significant red-shift in tetrapod PL (centred at ∼645–655 nm) from that of the starting CdSe ‘seed’ QDs (605 nm) is also observed.

In contrast to a type I arrangement of core and shell conduction and valence band levels, in a quasi type II structure, the electronic wavefunction is not completely confined to the core<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, affording partial electron–hole spatial separation and the observed PL red shifting. The strong influence of the quasi type II band alignments on PL energies is in contrast with single-composition tetrapods, for example, CdTe tetrapods, whose PL energies depend instead on quantum confinement or diameter-size effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The PL energy shift induced by electron–hole separation is similar for each of the CdSe/CdS tetrapods, with the larger TP4 exhibiting only a slightly ‘redder’ emission compared with the others (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>; 655 nm PL maximum versus ∼645 nm in the case of TP1, TP2 and TP3). The differences in full-width-half-maxima (FWHM) of the ensemble PL peaks, where longer-arm tetrapods afford broader emission (∼70 nm versus ∼35 nm FWHM), can be attributed to a broader size distribution (∼16–23% compared with 7–8% variation in tetrapod arm diameter in long- versus short-arm tetrapod populations, respectively), as well as intrinsic properties of the longer-arm tetrapods (see discussion pertaining to dual-red emission below).</p><p id="Par10">The effect of tetrapod geometry is also apparent in PL decay-time trends. PL lifetimes were shown previously to increase with tetrapod arm length<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Comparing TP1 and TP3, we obtain a similar result, as decay times are clearly longer for the longer-arm TP3 (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). Furthermore, we observe that TP3 and TP4, which share similar arm lengths but differ in arm diameter, have similar PL lifetimes to each other. Taken together, these results suggest that the enhanced spatial separation between CdS-generated excitons and CdSe-core emissive states afforded by arm lengthening is the dominant factor increasing PL decay times. Interestingly, however, time-resolved PL results for short-arm TP2 tetrapods appear to conflict with this conclusion, as TP2 structures provide the longest PL decay times (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). In all cases, the decay curves are multiexponential and difficult to fit with a significant degree of confidence. Nevertheless, the marked increase in PL lifetimes observed for TP2 tetrapods suggests that shell/arm thickening and perhaps the shape change induced by SILAR growth have a significant impact on exciton decay dynamics. This may result from increased type II character or from reductions in contributions from fast non-radiative recombination processes, such as surface carrier trapping or Auger recombination (see discussion below).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Shape-dependent blinking suppression</title><p id="Par11">An important photophysical property that is not accessible through characterizations of ensembles of nanocrystals is that of blinking.

Upon returning to an uncharged condition, the tetrapod emits at its full brightness with a longer PL lifetime.

For this, a quantitative assessment is needed of the actual number of electron–hole pairs in the core during various stages of excitation. First, the number of excitons formed in the core and in the arms of each tetrapod was estimated based on excitation fluence and core and arm absorption cross-sections, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM457">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM457">Supplementary Table 4</xref>).

A significant number of the carriers generated in the arms can migrate into the core either by direct relaxation into core band edge states or by exciton transfer or migration. However, the efficiency of the arm-to-core carrier/exciton transfer process, competing with carrier trapping and Auger recombination in the arms, is currently unknown.

Using the relaxation dynamics of the core bleach, normalized at long time delays (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>, main panel), the average number of excitons per CdSe core at different excitation fluences can be determined from the ratio of the signal magnitude at the peak and at long delays where only the radiative decay is contributing to the relaxation (<italic>a/b</italic> ratio in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>.

Significantly, however, our results also indicate that complete core state-filling (on the order of 30 electron–hole pairs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>) is not required to realize green arm emission.</p><p id="Par22">A direct comparison of the TA bleach relaxation dynamics at the green (470 nm) and red (640 nm) wavelengths reveals that there is no significant delay between the excited states located in the CdS arms and the CdSe core. This suggests that the CdSe core is not populated by a transfer or migration of the band-edge exciton from the CdS arm, but rather that the fraction of electron–hole pairs generated within the arms relaxes directly into the CdSe core during intraband cooling (that is, from high-energy arm excited states to band-edge core states). What is the fate of the rest of the carriers formed in the CdS arms? This question can be addressed by considering, for example, the results for low power excitation, that is, 13 μJ cm<sup>−2</sup> per pulse. At this pump fluence, ∼20 excitons are generated on average in a tetrapod (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM457">Supplementary Table 4</xref>) but no green PL is observed. According to TA data &lt;1.5 excitons on average relaxes through the core (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>, main panel, green trace). This means that the majority of the generated excitons relax in the arms, as confirmed by the large CdS bleach observed in TA spectra at ∼470 nm (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>, main panel). However, no arm emission is observed in the single-tetrapod spectra at this pump fluence, which indicates that the arm excitons decay only through non-radiative channels.</p><p id="Par23">To determine relative contributions from possible non-radiative channels—carrier trapping and Auger recombination—we consider both the appearance of the bleach signal and the bleach relaxation kinetics. First, the typical signatures of carrier traps (broad tail/band to the red of the main bleach) do not significantly contribute to the TA spectra (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>, main). As shown previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, in the case of cadmium chalcogenides the TA signal is mostly sensitive to electron dynamics, rather than hole dynamics. Therefore, in further analysis we will assume that this observation pertains primarily to electron traps. Second, the TA bleach relaxation dynamics of the excitons in the arms (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>, inset) for the 13 μJ cm<sup>−2</sup> per pulse data (green trace) show ∼20% drop in signal intensity within 1 ns. This fast relaxation is attributed to the decay of carriers trough non-radiative channels, that is, trapping and/or Auger recombination. As even at this low fluence ∼20 excitons are generated on average in the arms of a tetrapod, the Auger process probably contributes, at least in part, to the observed fast relaxation. This means that &lt;20% of the relaxation can be attributed to an electron trapping process. However, as no arm PL (proportional to the product of the number of electrons and holes) is observed at this fluence, this result implies that non-radiative relaxation is dominated by hole trapping, whereby band-edge electrons recombine non-radiatively with the trapped holes.</p><p id="Par24">The above analysis indicates that the observation of dual red and green emission in CdS/CdSe tetrapods requires at least partial filling of hole traps in the arms and partial state-filling in the CdSe core. With the two relaxation channels partially or completely blocked (for example, through state filling or electrostatic repulsion) radiative decay in the arms becomes kinetically competitive and both red core emission and green arm emission are observed. The requirement of multi-level (but not complete) filling of the CdSe core states implies that the observation of dual emission is likely to be only when both the core and the arms are populated with multiple excitons. As in this regime radiative decay must compete with the non-radiative Auger process, the optimization of the dual PL requires effective suppression of Auger recombination in both the core and the arms of the tetrapod.</p><p id="Par25">It has been shown that Auger recombination is strongly suppressed in thick-shell CdSe/CdS QDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, which are similar to the CdSe/CdS tetrapods in both their electronic structure (quasi type II band alignment) and physical structure (tetrapod arms effectively overcoat the CdSe core, aided further in the TP2 tetrapods by secondary shell/arm growth). We suggest that these structural similarities can account for the varying degrees of core Auger recombination suppression evidenced by both blinking statistics and evolution of multiexcitonic emissions (TP1&lt;TP3∼TP4&lt;TP2). With respect to arm Auger recombination processes, prior work indicates that the transition from 0D (QD-like) to one-dimensional (1D; rod or wire-like) structure induces suppression of Auger-mediated decay of higher order multiexciton states (&gt;2 electron–hole pairs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. For this reason, in the 1D-like tetrapod arm radiative recombination can effectively compete with non-radiative relaxation associated with the multiexcitonic states. Interestingly, the strongest green-arm emission is obtained from the longer-arm tetrapods, TP3 and TP4. As noted above, this observation is in contrast with the previously proposed simple volume dependence, and highlights the importance of arm length in reducing the efficiency of the arm Auger recombination process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Two-colour blinking suppression and tri-colour emission</title><p id="Par26">The practical effect of designing a nanostructure for both blinking suppression and two-colour emission is realizing the unique property of dual blinking-suppressed emission (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).

Some individual structures exhibit dual red PL (at ∼600 nm and ∼650 nm, respectively) at low pump power and, therefore, ‘tri’ emission at high pump powers, with the addition of green PL (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref>). As we describe in the introduction, dual red PL has been attributed to the existence of two distinct processes: direct core emission and spatially indirect (quasi type II) core/shell emission resulting from the presence of a potential energy barrier at the core/arm interface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM457">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. We assign the peak at ∼600 nm to the direct emission process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM457">Supplementary Note 2</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, which becomes more competitive with increasing pump power. We find that a longer arm length is needed to observe dual-red emission at room-temperature and speculate that the added strain induced by arm lengthening enhances the ‘barrier’ effect that underlies this process. Thus, a design criterion for increasing the probability of observing dual red PL at room temperature and, thereby, tri-emission at high pump fluence, is to further increase tetrapod arm length, with the caveat that simultaneous arm thickening would also be required to ensure optimal photobleaching and blinking characteristics.</p><p id="Par28">In summary, using advanced seeded-growth and SILAR shell-growth techniques, we synthesized a tetrapod geometry series with which we showed that arm-diameter and arm-length engineering can be combined to control both multi-colour emission and photostability at the single-tetrapod level. The relative complexity of the asymmetric tetrapod heterostructure affords this added degree of control compared with non-blinking core/shell QD counterparts. By studying PL properties in single tetrapods, we showed that red and green emissions indeed derive from the same nanostructure and that dual emission is more commonly found in longer arm tetrapods compared to short-arm counterparts irrespective of arm thickness; the latter result implies that a large tetrapod volume is an insufficient condition for realizing dual emission. In addition, we showed that larger-diameter CdS arms, especially those thickened by SILAR shell growth, can afford significantly suppressed single-tetrapod blinking and photobleaching. We show that the mechanism for red CdSe core blinking in tetrapods is Auger-mediated charging/discharging intensity fluctuations. We also show that core emission transitions from purely excitonic to multi-excitonic/charged-state emission in the two-colour PL regime. To the extent that blinking is suppressed and that multiexcitonic emission is observed, Auger recombination in the core is necessarily suppressed. In addition, we describe the mechanism responsible for the observation of dual red-core and green-arm emission. Namely, processes of hole-trap filling in the CdS arms and partial state-filling in the core set the stage for two-colour PL, but partial suppression of Auger recombination in the arms is also required, which we attribute to the 1D character of the rod-like CdS arms. Thus, we demonstrate that the QD-seeded tetrapod is an ideal platform for exploring and tuning radiative and non-radiative excited-state processes for unprecedented blinking-suppressed multicolour multiexcitonic emission.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Synthesis</title><p id="Par29">Zinc-blende CdSe QDs (4 nm diameter) were synthesized according to a previously reported method and as described in detail in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM457">Supplementary Note 1</xref> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>).

Samples were imaged under continuous wave 405 nm laser excitation in a home-built wide-field (40 × 40 μm) optical microscope. PL signal was recorded over 1 h using liquid N<sub>2</sub>-cooled CCD detector with 0.1 s integration time per frame. Average fluorescence intensity of the individual tetrapods versus time data represents the relative tendency of each type of tetrapod to either remain emissive or to photobleach over the long 1 h interrogation period (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, insets). Individual tetrapods were also assessed for their respective tendency to produce emission above the threshold value as a function of time. The resulting blinking behaviour for individual tetrapods was used to create on-time fraction histograms (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Single-photon counting experiments</title><p id="Par31">To measure <italic>g</italic><sup>(2)</sup> values and lifetimes of single tetrapods, a 405 nm pulsed laser (∼80 ps pulse width) and a laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a 100 × , 0.85 numerical aperture objective were used to excite the tetrapods. PL from single tetrapods was collected by the same objective lens and then directed to two APDs forming a Hanbury–Brown–Twiss spectrometer. This allowed for the identification of single nanostructures via determination of single-photon emission behaviour of the low-energy emission under low excitation power density (<italic>{N}</italic> &lt;&lt; 1). For measurements of single tetrapod lifetime, <italic>g</italic><sup>(2)</sup>, and most spectra, the repetition rate was 1 MHz. For the high-power single tetrapod spectra measurement, the repetition rate was chosen to be 3 MHz, to enhance excitation of multiexcitons. To identify dual-emitting tetrapods, switchable 510 nm short-pass filters and 610 nm long-pass filters were installed in front of the two APDs. With different filters before the two APDs, a quick dual-channel scan identifies emissive spots that radiate strongly at both short band and long band simultaneously.</p><p id="Par32">To obtain increasing fluences of 13, 38 and 116 μJ cm<sup>−2</sup> per pulse for power-dependence measurements, the same single tetrapod was investigated at each power, beginning with the lowest power. The laser power was then adjusted to increase the measured power at the sample for each subsequent measurement. Low-frequency excitation was performed at 1 MHz, whereas high-frequency excitation was performed at 3 MHz. Spectra were recorded by dispersing the collected single tetrapod emission onto a CCD array using a Princeton Instruments Acton SP2300 Spectrometer. Single-tetrapod data were collected by averaging three spectra that were integrated for 30 s each.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>TA spectroscopy</title><p id="Par33">The TA spectra were recorded using a commercial pump–probe TA spectrometer (Helios, Ultrafast Systems). The femtosecond pump pulses at energy of 3.1 eV (400 nm) were generated by focusing a portion of the 800 nm output from 1 kHz regenerative amplifier (Spectra Physics) onto a BBO crystal. The probe pulse, a white light continuum, was generated by passing the second portion of the 800 nm output through a delay line and a 2 mm sapphire crystal. The instrument response time of the system is 220 fs (FWHM). The diameter of the probe beam focused onto the sample was ∼0.1 mm. The pump fluence was varied from 13 to 250 μJ cm<sup>−2</sup> per pulse. To minimize the potential effects of photo-degradation and local heating, the sample solution was continuously stirred during the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Data availability</title><p id="Par34">The data sets generated during the current study are available from the corresponding authors on reasonable request.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Additional information</title><p id="Par35"><bold>How to cite this article:</bold> Mishra, N. <italic>et al</italic>.
