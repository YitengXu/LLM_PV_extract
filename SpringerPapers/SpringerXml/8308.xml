DG means interconnection of mini or micro on-site distributed energy resources (DERs) generation with the main grid at distribution voltage stage. DERs primarily incorporate renewable and non-conventional energy resources such as solar photovoltaic (PV), hydro, wind, tidal, fuel cell, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Several energy market liberations and advancement in electronics and communication techniques have facilitated the operation of these geographically dispersed DERs through improved SCADA. These interconnected DERs possess the capability of operating both on-grid as well as off-grid mode.</p><p id="Par3">The classical structure of distribution system was passive in nature i.e. it has always considered power flow from higher voltage level to lower voltage level. Active distribution network includes addition of DERs that are locally integrated into the low voltage distribution system that alters the network architecture and operation, rendering the classical consideration to be less applicable. The active distribution network differentiates from the passive in terms of bi-directionality of power flow, power electronics converter based generation, high fault level variability, etc. Plethoric DG penetration as well as DER placement has notable impacts on protection, operation, reliability and control of the power system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These issues must be critically dealt with before permitting DG market participation for smooth operation of existing power structure along with some additional benefits like active reserve, interruptible loads, load- following, restoration, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">One of the major obstacles in redefining the existing grid structure to a smart grid structure in terms of sensitivity and stability is the concern of islanding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Islanding is defined as the situation in which a fragment of the utility system is powered by one or more DG sources while that particular fragment of the system is isolated electrically from the rest of the utility system as depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Concept of islanding</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41601_2017_75_Fig1_HTML.gif" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par5">Island area 1, 2 and 3 is formed by opening of circuit breaker 1, 2 and 3 respectively. In light of this, the paper gives a review of IDM available in the research literature to manifest the transition of islanding detection research strategies with time. The methods have been broadly classified into classical and modern methods. A systematic analysis of these techniques is executed to bring to surface the merits and demerits of individual IDM. The rest of the paper is categorized as follows. Section <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">2</xref> deals with the technical issues and concerns of islanding. The ID standards and criteria of IDM are explored in section <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">3</xref> and section <xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">4</xref> respectively. Section <xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec">5</xref> lays down the underlying theory, working principle and relevant equations of individual IDM. Besides, it also examines and compares various types of IDM. Finally, the work is inferred in section <xref rid="Sec22" ref-type="sec">6</xref> and the future trends are discussed in section <xref rid="Sec23" ref-type="sec">7</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Technical issues with islanding</title><p id="Par6">Islanding can be divided into inadvertent or unintentional and deliberate or intentional islanding. Inadvertent islanding is the scenario in which islanding occurs without the prior knowledge of the utility supply or the Independent Power Producer (IPP). The grid disconnection in inadvertent islanding occurs in the following conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par7">A fault that is detected by the protection mechanism of the grid but not by the protection devices installed in the grid connected DG</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par8">Equipment failure causing accidental disconnection of the normal grid</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par9">Human mistake or malpractices</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par10">An act of nature</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par11">In case of unintended islanding, the recent generalized industry standard is disconnection of all the DGs from the islanded portion as quickly as possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, some IPP like BC Hydro, Canadian utility have their own requirements to comply with [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The undesirable consequences of unintentional islanding are as listed below which illustrates the need of unintentional ID for effective integration of DGs into existing power system topology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par12">Distributed generations are typically “weak” supplies that are incapable to handle transients efficiently.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par13">After re-closure of the protective relays, the DGs may not be properly synchronized with that of the main grid resulting in considerable damage to the DGs as well as the utility and consumers.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par14">If loads do not match to the supply characteristics, then the DG’s behavior may be unpredictable.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par15">Utility workers may be oblivious to the fact that the lines disconnected from the main grid are still energized by the DGs making them prone to health hazards.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par16">There will be confusion between IPPs and utility for the culpability for degraded power quality.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par17">Intentional islanding is the process of intentionally splitting the grid into separate controllable islands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Deliberate islanding is primarily implemented for averting cascading and blackouts- the two perils to the security of power system. Intentional islanding negates the losses of inadvertent islanding. Intentional islanding may be employed to enhance the voltage profiles and decrease power losses, improve the overall efficiency of the system by controlling the congestion of distribution and transmission system. Therefore, intentional islanding operation can be a viable option if enforced through a proper envelope of research. Various researchers are working on the issues related to intentional islanding in order to eliminate its shortcomings making it practically applicable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Islanding in the correct time and in the correct manner has inspired many works. After proper islanding, the frequency and voltages should be within the prescribed limit to avoid further blackouts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Moreover, intentional islanding will have a significant effect on the electricity prices in the dynamic market [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. During intentional islanding, several islands will have their own price and the producers can take unconscionable advantage by spiking the prices. Hence these practices should be properly checked. However, they may also give choice to customers whether to buy electricity or not under this condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Test systems, standards and test conditions</title><p id="Par18">Unfortunately, there is no specific benchmark test system for islanding operation of microgrids. Various countries have installed their own test systems to study about the reliability and feasibility of islanding which are completely distinct from each other. Some of them are based only on one type of DG and some on hybrid generation. IEEE Std. 1547–2003, IEEE Std. 929–2000, Korean Std., VDE 0126–1-1 and UL 1741 are some of the international standards that the IPPs and utility must comply with for effective islanding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows a generic system for islanding study in accordance with UL 1741 and IEEE 929 as well as IEEE1547. The load inside the potential island (local load) is designed as a parallel RLC circuit as these types of loads pose the greatest difficulty in ID. Specifically, RLC loads possessing a high quality factor are the most problematic element in ID as these have low inductances and high capacitance and/or large resistance. The resonant frequency is considered same as main grid frequency. Mathematically, the load parameters can be stated as in (1)–(4). The RLC load definition is for unity power factor condition. The worst scenario of inadvertent ID occurs when there is no power mismatch between the DG output and load.<disp-formula id="Equ1"><label>1</label><alternatives><mml:math display="block" id="Equ1_Math"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mtext mathvariant="italic">LOAD</mml:mtext></mml:msub></mml:math><tex-math id="Equ1_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The basic logic of DT is explained in Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>. The first step involves splitting of the root node (i.e. the node representing the entire data set) into child nodes on the basis of a predictor variable. The node that possesses the purest data is selected as the child node that can further be split. A node that cannot be further split is called leaf node. The DT performs the splitting process for classification until a leaf node is reached.
