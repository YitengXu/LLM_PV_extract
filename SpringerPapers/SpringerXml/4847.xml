However, the reasoning behind this observation is unknown. In this work mixed Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> were prepared and characterized for the OER using ex situ and operando spectroscopy techniques in order to initiate the understanding of why mixed TMO/MXene materials show better performances compared to TMO only catalysts. This work shows that the improved electrocatalysis for the composite material compared to the TMO only catalyst is due to the presence of higher Co oxide oxidation states at lower OER overpotentials for the mixed TMO/MXene catalysts. Furthermore, the presence of the MXene allows for a more mechanically robust film during OER, making the film more stable. Finally, our results show that small amounts of MXene are more advantageous for the OER during long-term stability measurements, which is linked to the formation of TiO<sub>2</sub>. The sensitivity of MXene oxidation ultimately limits TMO/MXene composites under alkaline OER conditions, meaning mass fractions must be carefully considered when designing such a catalyst to minimize the residual TiO<sub>2</sub> formed during its lifetime.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>EC | EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation H2020 | H2020 Priority Excellent Science | H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (H2020 Excellent Science -

Water splitting can be powered using renewable intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. During the water splitting process, H<sub>2</sub>O is split into hydrogen and oxygen by applying an external current. The hydrogen can be then used as an energy carrier in a fuel cell to create electricity to power automotive vehicles and infrastructure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Furthermore, if the hydrogen is not needed at that time, it can be stored as a liquid or gas in tanks for later use.</p><p id="Par3">In a water splitting device, i.e., an electrolyzer, hydrogen is produced on the cathode; this reaction is deemed the hydrogen evolution reaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. However, the opposite reaction at the anode, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), is the most kinetically demanding reaction in water splitting, hence to efficiently produce hydrogen the OER needs to be made more kinetically favorable.</p><p id="Par4">One route to explore to accomplish this, is to design active and stable OER catalysts compared to the current state-of-the-art materials utilized for this oxidative reaction. In alkaline media, the state-of-the-art catalysts for the OER are nickel-based materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The performance of the nickel catalysts in the anion-exchange membrane (AEM) do not reach that of the IrO<sub>2</sub>/Pt catalysts in a proton-exchange membrane (PEM) device. These materials also exhibit stability issues under intermittent usage which is a major disadvantage when coupled with solar or wind renewable energy for large scale deployment.</p><p id="Par5">First row transition metal oxides (TMOs) are notably one of the most studied classes of materials in the bid to replace the current state-of-the-art OER catalysts. These first row TMOs are also considerably less expensive than current catalysts utilized for the OER. TMOs are an exciting group of materials that possess various intriguing physical properties that can change depending on the oxidation state of the material and are known to be relatively active water splitting catalysts (i.e., they exhibit low OER overpotentials). Furthermore, it has been shown that the shift in the oxidation state of a metal oxide can significantly increase the OER performance of the initial metal oxide under study.</p><p id="Par6">For example, Risch et al. prepared a Co(II) oxide film by electrodeposition of metal salts, and using operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) were able to determine that two or more Co(IV) sites are present to make a O–O bond for O<sub>2</sub> formation in alkaline media<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. When comparing pure Ni oxide and NiFe oxides, the latter are widely known to be a better OER catalysts. Nocera et al. reported that the superior OER performance of the NiFe oxides is due to the formation of Ni(IV) as a result of the presence of Fe(III)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The Fe(III) promotes the Ni(III)/Ni(IV) redox transaction by increasing the acidity of the aqua/hydroxo OH<sub>x</sub> groups of the Ni. Hence, this increases the oxy-group presence, which in turn increases the O–O bond formation at lower potentials. The active site of Ni oxide has also been reported to be Ni(IV), i.e., γ-NiOOH, however the pure Ni oxide is a less active material than the NiFe oxide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. From these studies, it is logical to state that certain oxidation states of a metal oxide can promote the OER and the OER activity of pure metal oxides can be boosted by the addition of other materials.</p><p id="Par7">As of late, reports on the addition of MXene materials to TMO catalysts for the OER have emerged. MXene materials are derived from MAX (M = transition metal, A = Al or Si, X = C and/or N) phases by various exfoliation and delamination processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. MXene materials have many characteristics that coin these materials as “OER compatible”. MXenes are highly conductive, exhibit a high surface area and are hydrophilic, however, they do not contain any active OER metals such as Co or Ni<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. On the other hand, TMO materials are not very conductive as they are semiconducting by nature. Hence, the addition of MXenes to the TMO in theory could result in an active, conductive, and hydrophilic OER catalyst. The research into these two materials in tandem for the OER is very much in its infancy, however, a TMO/MXene hybrid seems promising.</p><p id="Par8">Various reports have shown that TMO materials in conjunction with the most common MXene, Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>, exhibit much improved OER performance than the pure TMO and the pure Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup><sup>.</sup> Unfortunately, no operando experiments were conducted to try to understand the reasoning behind the enhanced OER capabilities of the TMO/MXene hybrids. Interestingly though, Lu et al. showed that the ratio of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>:Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> in the hybrid materials influences the OER. The study by Lu et al. showed that a 10% MXene hybrid outperforms other TMO/MXene hybrids with higher MXene concentrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par9">The OER stability of TMO/MXene hybrid catalysts was also investigated by Lu et al. and Yu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Lu et al. multi-cycled their Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>:Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> catalyst for 2000 cycles in the OER region. The Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>:Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> lost a significant amount of activity (~1000 mV) over the 2000 cycles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Furthermore, Yu et al. conducted chronopotentiometry for 60 h of a FeNi-LDH/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> material on Ni foam and showed that the potential required to reach a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> decreased by ~500 mV in the 60-h testing window<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Hence, to make these hybrid materials more stable, a more thorough investigation of these hybrid materials during the OER needs to be carried out.</p><p id="Par10">In this work, we will try to understand why these TMO/MXene hybrid materials exhibit better OER activity compared to their pure counterparts. To investigate the OER activity of the hybrid materials, operando Raman spectroscopy will be utilized. The effect of the ratio of the TMO/MXene will also be explored, and in conjunction with various material characterization techniques we will elucidate how the ratio influences the OER activity of the active material.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Synthesis and characterization of the electrocatalysts</title><p id="Par11">In this work, the aim is to understand the reasoning behind the already known enhancement that the TMO/MXene hybrid exhibits.

While the TMO component will be Co hydroxide as it is a known active OER material.</p><p id="Par12">Before the composite was prepared, the pure Co oxide was synthesized by a low temperature precipitation method and will be denoted as “pure Co” from here on in. Briefly, cobalt nitrate, NaCl, hexamethyltetramine and H<sub>2</sub>O/EtOH were added to a reaction vessel and heated at 90 °C for 1 h. Additionally Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>, the MXene component, was prepared by the “mild” HCl and LiF MXene synthesis route<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In this work the hybrid TMO/MXene composite was fabricated by mechanically mixing pure Co oxide and Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> in a H2O/EtOH solution.

As MXenes are known to degrade under oxidative potentials, XPS analysis of the high resolution Ti2<italic>p</italic> core level region was undertaken on the pure Co, 1% MXene and 10% MXene to detect any degradation of the MXene component in the hybrid materials.

There was also no titanium species detected in the 1% MXene catalysts (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10b</xref>), which correlates with the SAED measurements (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e, f</xref>). For the 10% MXene, there were clear MXene peaks detected before OER (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>c)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par36">Then after OER, as expected, again no Ti species were detected for the pure Co species (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10d</xref>). However, for the 1% and 10% MXene TiO<sub>2</sub> was present on the surface of the catalyst (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10e, f</xref>). This is an interesting result regarding the 1% MXene, as the XPS analysis of the 1% MXene before OER shows no signs of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> on the surface of the hybrid catalyst. However, the degradation product (TiO<sub>2</sub>) of the Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> is visible after OER (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10e</xref>).</p><p id="Par37">For the 10% MXene, there is a larger amount of TiO<sub>2</sub> detected after the OER when compared to the 1% MXene (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10e</xref>). This would cause the hybrid catalyst to lose stability when compared to the 1% MXene as TiO<sub>2</sub> is an insulator. It is now evident from the XPS analysis that the lighter brown color of the 10% MXene film is due to the higher amount of TiO<sub>2</sub> formed from the oxidation of the MXene as the initial ratio of Co:MXene is higher than the 1% MXene film. This higher amount of TiO<sub>2</sub> in the film is evidently the reason behind the 10% MXene exhibiting poorer OER performances in terms of overall long-term activity.</p><p id="Par38">The stability of the hybrid materials clearly depends on the amount of MXene in the composite, which is due to the oxidation of the MXene to TiO<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, less MXene in the hybrid is essential to prepare a catalyst with better long-term OER capabilities. Further studies on how the ratio of the MXene:metal oxides effect the OER, along with using other MXene materials, e.g., Nb<sub>2</sub>C, Ti<sub>2</sub>C, Mo<sub>2</sub>CT<sub>x</sub>, for the OER, will be undertaken by our group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par39">This work has helped to establish a greater insight into the relationship between MXene and TMO components in active OER composite catalysts. There is no question that the addition of a small amount of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> MXene as a conductive additive can have a positive effect on the initial water splitting capabilities of a Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> electrocatalyst, demonstrated here via polarization and Tafel slopes. This research gives evidence of two principal effects of MXene integration on the performance. Firstly, the enhanced conductive matrix allows for the coordinated Co metals to reach a higher oxidation state at lower input potentials, demonstrated using operando Raman spectroscopy on electrocatalytically active electrodes. The high oxidation state Co(IV) stimulates reactivity at the catalyst surface with a lower overpotential compared to the pure catalyst. Secondly, this work suggests a mechanical enhancement in the bi-component catalyst evidenced by the robust observable film formed by the 1% MXene sample after electrochemical cycling, both in terms of cohesion of the film, and adhesion to the ITO surface.</p><p id="Par40">With the inclusion of a MXene component, it is always necessary to consider stability for any practical application. Here, a “shut down/powering on” protocol is used by cyclic voltammetry around the expected onset potential for the cell, to simulate the response to intermittent electrolysis rather than constant current/potential experiments. As such, the tests were able to show superior response of 1% and 10% MXene composite catalysts to the “shut down/power up” input compared to the pure Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> catalyst. Increasing the TMO:MXene ratio from 1% to 10% in the catalyst sees no improvement in the performance, in fact the performance over time is slightly decreased for the 10% MXene sample. After extensive cycling, MXene oxidation begins to become a factor as evidenced by ex situ XPS data, with a more negative effect experienced by the 10% MXene catalyst.</p><p id="Par41">This work clearly demonstrates that the addition of small amounts of MXene material to metal oxides are advantageous for the preparation of OER catalysts. These TMO/MXene materials could provide alkaline water electrolysis systems with new, inexpensive, conductive and active OER catalysts needed to bring this technology to the forefront of sustainable energy for the masses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> synthesis</title><p id="Par42">In a glass beaker, Co(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O (Merck), NaCl (Merck) and hexamethyltetramine (Merck) were dissolved in a mixture of water and ethanol (9:1% v/v) giving a final concentration of 10, 50 and 60 mM, respectively.
