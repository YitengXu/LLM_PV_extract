2030 by different policy actors (i.e. International Maritime Organization, hereafter IMO), the EU) in order to improve the ecological performance of maritime shipping, and will face more so in the future. Many of these regulations concern the reduction of air pollution of vessels both globally and in particular in so-called Emission Control Areas (ECA’s).</p><p id="Par2">In this research, the economic impact of alternative technologies in order to reduce the Sulphur emissions in existing ECA zones is analyzed both from the perspective of the vessel owner, as well as for the evaluation of generalized chain cost, hence from the shipper point of view.</p><p id="Par3">The container carriers can choose different methods to comply with the new regulations, such as switching fuel types (Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), Marine Diesel Oil (MDO)) or opting for innovative technologies like installing scrubber systems.</p><p id="Par4">The goal of this research is twofold: first, to discover alternative available technologies to mitigate Sulphur emissions according to the literature; second, to evaluate economically the selected technologies both from vessel owners and shippers perspectives.</p><p id="Par5">In order to study this, an update of an existing model is used. The added value of the extended model is threefold: calculating the generalized chain cost of transporting a container from the origin (US and Asia) to a destination in the EU, incorporating in the model the different ECA zones in the world and integrating more detailed fuel cost calculations and capital cost for different engine types or technologies used.</p><p id="Par6">The methodology used in this research is an extension of an existing model which is updated for the purpose of this research. This update includes a new functionality to allow calculating the vessel owner cost for different fuel types and propulsion systems (Heavy Fuel Oil or HFO, MDO and LNG). Next to that, more maritime distance data is collected containing the distance sailed in ECA zones. This means that for each port-to-port combination, in the total maritime distance database in the model, this additional information is added. Based on this information, the fuel cost can be calculated when a vessel is sailing in ECA zones using either MDO, LNG or HFO (including a scrubber).</p><p id="Par7">The research is particularly interesting for logistics operators, legislation regulators and academia. The extended model allows calculating the best economic solutions for selected routes. For logistics operators and in particular for shippers, the results allow making the most rewarding investments from an economic point of view and affirm the importance of different technologies on the generalized chain cost. The results indicate that the price of the different fuels (and the spread between them) displays an important factor in the overall outcome.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Alternative fuels</kwd><kwd>LNG propulsion</kwd><kwd>Scrubber system</kwd><kwd>Marine diesel oil</kwd><kwd>ECA zones</kwd><kwd>Maritime cost</kwd><kwd>Chain cost</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Green shipping: Governance &amp;

Shipping is responsible for 90% of international transport and in 2017, freight rates improved across all markets, with the exception of tankers. The container freight market improved considerably. Global container demand grew by 6.4% in 2017, taking total shipped volumes to an estimated 148 million TEUs. Moreover, global dry bulk trade grew by about 4% in 2017, bringing total volumes to 5.1 billion tons. However, Crude oil seaborne trade expanded at a slower pace – 2.4% in 2017 – compared with stronger growth – 4% – in 2016 (UNCTAD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">International marine shipping is a large contributor to Nitrogen Oxide (NO<sub>x</sub>) and Sulphur Oxide (SO<sub>x</sub>) emissions, representing a share of 13% and 12% of global emissions respectively (IPCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2013</xref>; Stevens et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2015</xref>) and according to IMO estimates, in 2012, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from international shipping accounted for 2.2% of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions. Moreover, emissions from shipping due to the burning of the Sulphur content of marine fuels contribute to air pollution in the form of SO<sub>x</sub> and particulate matter (Sys et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par10">Relevant regulations have been considered under the auspices of IMO, including the adoption in 2011 of a set of technical and operational measures to reduce emissions from international shipping and related guidelines (UNCTAD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2011</xref>; UNCTAD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2012</xref>). In April 2018, IMO adopted an initial strategy to reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions from ships by at least 50% by 2050, compared with 2008 – a particularly important development. With regard to air pollution, the global limit of 0.5% on Sulphur in fuel oil used on board ships will come into effect on January 1st, 2020 (UNCTAD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>). This means that the maximum level of pollution of SO<sub>x</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> globally and in particular within Emission Control Areas (ECA’s) is set (IMO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2011</xref>; McGill et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">ECA’s are sea areas in which stricter controls are established to minimize airborne emissions from ships as defined by Annex VI of the 1997 MARPOL Protocol. Within ECA’s in which more stringent controls on SO<sub>x</sub> emissions apply, the Sulphur content of fuel oil must be no more than 0.1% (1000 ppm) from January 1st, 2015. According to UNCTAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>), with regard to ship-source air pollution, the global limit of 0.5% on Sulphur in fuel oil outside ECA’s will come into effect on January 1st, 2020. The first two Sulphur Oxide ECA’s were established in Europe, in the Baltic Sea and the North Sea, and took effect in 2006 and 2007, respectively; the third was established in North America and took effect in 2012; and the fourth was established in the United States Caribbean Sea, covering waters adjacent to the coasts of Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, and took effect in 2014 (UNCTAD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>).

The subsequent publication of a Chinese regulation designating the Pearl River and Yangtze River Deltas, and the Bohai-rim Waters as ECA’s places a cap on the Sulphur content of fuel oil in the ECA’s at 0.50% and is considered an important step to achieve these pollution prevention goals. Eleven ports within the ECA’s are designated “key ports”:

In the study, vessel owners opt to use MDO in order to mitigate pollutants in the ECA’s in the North Sea. The same authors analyzes two different routes: one from Asia to the EU and one from South America to the EU. From the performed analysis, van Hassel et al., (van Hassel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2016a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2016b</xref>) conclude that the competitive position of the HLH ports is not affected by the establishment of the ECA’s. Moreover, it was also found that the impact differs per route.</p><p id="Par18">In the present research, the focus of the analysis shifts from the port range to the vessel owner and the shipper viewpoint. The main purpose of this research is to determine which of all the available options to comply with the ECA regulation is economically most suitable for the vessel owner and the shipper. The research questions that will be investigated are:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par19">What are the best alternative options to comply with the ECA regulation according to the literature?</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par20">Of those selected technologies, what are the maritime costs from a vessel owner point of view and what is the impact of new technology on the generalized chain cost?</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par21">In the pages that follow, three alternative fuels or technologies are considered: Marine Diesel Oil (MDO), Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and scrubber technology. Based on alternative fuel used inside and outside ECA’s, three diverse scenarios are discussed with two different maritime routes: one from Asia to Europe and the second one from the US to Europe, with different ship sizes for each maritime route.</p><p id="Par22">In order to answer these two research questions, a two-step approach is used. In the first step, an extensive literature study is conducted to determine which alternatives are the most suitable to use. In the second step, for the selected alternatives, a cost modeling approach is applied. Following van Hassel et al. (van Hassel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2016a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2016b</xref>), this analysis uses a model designed for both calculating the total vessel owner cost as well as the generalized cost of transporting a container from an origin to a destination. It can simulate both the total vessel owner cost as well as the generalized cost of a supply chain for transporting goods from a point in hinterland A (for instance in the US) to another point in hinterland B (for instance in Europe). To study the impact of the implementation of the considered, implemented technologies to fulfill to the new types of legislation, this model will be extended with more detailed maritime distance data (ECA distances) as well as a more detailed cost calculation which includes the three above-mentioned options. In addition, external costs of pollutants such as SO<sub>x</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub>, CO<sub>2,</sub> and PM are considered in the calculation.</p><p id="Par23">This paper is structured along the following parts. Section 2 reports the literature review regarding available alternative fuel options and economic comparison of different technologies is reported. Section 3 discusses the modeling methodology. Section 4 provides an overview of the collected data and explains the details of scenarios, maritime routes and vessel sizes taken into consideration for each scenario. Section 5 reports the results obtained for total maritime cost and chain cost. Finally, the last section outlines the main outcomes and conclusions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Literature review</title><p id="Par24">The literature review is structured into four sub-sections. Firstly, a short overview of the main legislation literature is given. Here, the main focus will be on the ECA zones and Sulphur reduction legislation. Secondly, the different alternative fuels are analyzed, while in the third section, the Exhaust Gas Treatment Systems are examined. The last section gives an overview of the selected fuels and technologies that will be further analyzed.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Emission legislation</title><p id="Par25">Different international organizations (i.e. IMO) and institution policies impose international environmental standards on their member states to limit the emission of greenhouse gases (Sys et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2015</xref>). International maritime legislation is shifting towards lower levels of permitted exhaust gas Sulphur oxide emissions from ships (Lahtinen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2016</xref>). The regulation stems from concerns about “regional and global air pollution and environmental problems” in regard to the shipping industry’s contribution. In July 2010, a revised and more stringent Annex VI was enforced in the Emission Control Areas with significantly lowered emission limits (McGill et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2013</xref>). Based on the literature, there are some emission legislations for international shipping in order to reduce SO<sub>x</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> pollutants. New and existing regulations derived from the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) affecting the SO<sub>x</sub> emissions from ships are summarized in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

Ships operating in a Sulphur Emission Control Area (SECA) need to use distillate fuels in these regions, or a technology that can reduce emissions to an equivalent level, as of January 1st, 2015. There are several options available to comply with the new limits, including Marine Gas Oil (MGO), LNG and Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) and scrubber (den Boer and Hoen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2015</xref>). According to Semolinos et al., (2013), vessel owners have only three realistic alternatives to achieve compliance with the SO<sub>x</sub> regulations: using MDO, installing scrubbers on board the ships, or convert ships to run on LNG. To meet the NO<sub>x</sub> regulations, only an LNG solution will, in theory, comply with Tier III. Ships will need to install systems to reduce NO<sub>x</sub> (like selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems) if running on MDO or HFO in any case.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Alternative marine fuels</title><p id="Par29">The use of HFO as a marine fuel poses serious environmental and economic risks (Roy and Comer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2017</xref>). In 2013, McGill et al. stated that the large part of the marine fuel consumption (approximately 77%) is of low-quality, low-price residual fuel also known as heavy fuel oil, which tends to be high in Sulphur. With stricter emission rules and more public focus on maritime transport, reducing emissions in a cost-efficient way has become a necessity for shipping lines (Lindstad et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2015</xref>). Market penetration by alternative fuels has already begun with shipbuilders, engine manufacturers and classification bodies by introducing greener ships running on cleaner fuels (Moirangthem and Baxter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par30">There are growing numbers of shipboard applications of new, alternative fuels such as low-Sulphur fuels, gas fuels, and biofuels in the global maritime transport (Kolwzan and Narewski <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2012</xref>). Aronietis et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2015</xref>) state that there are three approaches in order to avoid SO<sub>x</sub> in shipping. The first approach is to use Sulphur-free fuels which can be done through some alternative options; the first alternative is the usage of the more expensive MDO with a low-Sulphur content but also with lower viscosity, while the second alternative is using LNG as a fuel. The second approach is to remove the Sulphur from the exhaust gasses by continuing to use the cheap HFO and clean the exhaust gasses on board by means of a scrubber. The third approach is to reduce the required fuel volume. An example of this is optimizing the Power Take Off (PTO) on the main gearbox.</p><p id="Par31">The alternative fuels that are most commonly considered today are LNG, Electricity, Biodiesel, and Methanol. Other fuels that could play a role in the future are Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), Dimethyl Ether (DME), Biomethane, Synthetic fuels, Hydrogen (particularly for use in fuel cells), Hydrogenation-Derived Renewable Diesel (HDRD) and Pyrolysis Oil. Additionally, fuels such as Ultra-Low-Sulphur Diesel (ULSD) can be used to comply with the regulations and support the transition to alternative fuels (Moirangthem and Baxter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2016</xref>). Gaseous fuels are divided into oil, industrial and natural gas. According to the state, the gas is divided into LPG, Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and LNG (Žaglinskis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2018</xref>). However, according to McGill et al., (2013), other fuels which are not included for practical, economic, or safety-related limitations of ships are as follows: nuclear fuels (Thorium, Uranium, Plutonium, H<sub>3</sub>), wind or solar power (sails, kites, wind turbines, photovoltaic cells), solid boiler fuels (coal, coke, peat, lignite), gas turbine or spark ignition engine-specific fuels (kerosene, ethanol, gasoline), gasification fuels (wood and other cellulosic biomass, sludge and other organic wastes) and electrochemical fuels (hydrogen, batteries).</p><p id="Par32">In this paper, among all the possible above-mentioned alternative solutions, LNG propulsion, MDO, and scrubber technology are considered and discussed in detail as the best transition solutions.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Liquefied natural gas (LNG)</title><p id="Par33">LNG is one of the options seen as an alternative fuel for deep sea, short sea and inland navigation ships (Aronietis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2015</xref>). Among the technologies that are currently evaluated, the possibility for ships of switching to LNG as a main fuel has raised significant concerns during the last few years (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par34">Natural gas reduces local air pollutants compared to traditional maritime fuels. LNG in marine transportation is likely to be incentivized where economics favoring natural gas are coupled with air emissions public policy targets (Thomson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2015</xref>). Moreover, gaseous fuel available for marine use is natural gas which is not only very low in Sulphur content but it also combusts lower NO<sub>x</sub>, PM, and CO<sub>2</sub> (McGill et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2013</xref>). The general characteristics of LNG propulsion are very important to consider this option as a sustainable or transit solution for emission reduction. In the following part, some of the main positive and negative features of LNG propulsion are summarized according to different sources.</p><p id="Par35">It can be observed from Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> that different advantages and disadvantages mentioned for LNG are not the same for all the papers and it depends on the research conducted by each author. Regarding the advantages of LNG, reduction of pollutants such as SO<sub>x</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub>, and PM is the most significant factor mentioned by the majority of the authors. Then, cost competitiveness with distillate and residual fuels and energy density are the second and third important features respectively. However, the negative aspects of LNG propulsion are categorized firstly as the problem with compatibility with existing engines which increases the operational and retrofit costs and requirements of more space and weight. Following that, methane slip from engines burning gas and limited bunkering infrastructure are other important disadvantages of LNG propulsion considered by most authors.

Port authorities, for their part, can only invest meaningfully in such facilities if they have a rough idea of potential demand for LNG bunker from deep sea, shortsea and inland navigation, as LNG is increasingly substituted for HFO and/or MGO. Moreover, an important aspect in the choice for the use of LNG or low-Sulphur fuel are the current day bunker strategies of the shipping companies (Aronietis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Marine Diesel oil (MDO)</title><p id="Par37">According to van Rynbach et al., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2018</xref>), the simplest option for meeting the upcoming low-Sulphur limits is to burn MGO with Sulphur content at or below 0.1% in the ECA zones or 0.5% worldwide starting in 2020. Moreover, they state that this solution has no effect on the NO<sub>x</sub> emissions and would require some additional technology to reduce NO<sub>x</sub> for ships that have to meet Tier III levels. A negative aspect of MGO is the higher price compared to other fuels (Semolinos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2013</xref>; Granskog <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2015</xref>). There have been some difficulties in existing ships with the change over from heated HFO to cool MDO when entering or leaving ECA zones. Semolinos et al., (2013) state that, the level of investment needed is much lower than for LNG and the feasibility, therefore, is higher.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Exhaust gas treatment systems</title><p id="Par38">Another option to lower emissions and comply with regulations within ECA zones is by installing “scrubber” technology. Scrubbers allow ships in the ECA’s to continue to burn traditional bunker fuel, yet still benefit from the savings created by the price difference between (cheaper) traditional bunker fuel and the low-Sulphur diesel that would be required without scrubber technology (Stulgis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2014</xref>; Lahtinen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2016</xref>).

According to table 4, reduction of pollution is the main advantage mentioned by majority of the authors. However, increasing fuel consumption or power consumption is the main disadvantage of using scrubber technology.  Since MGO is more expensive than HFO, scrubbers have received attention over the last years and the number of scrubbers installed onboard ships has increased (den Boer and Hoen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2015</xref>).

Each aggregated hinterland is served by at least one and usually by several ports. Each port is built up of a set of terminals, all of which have their own set of characteristics. From each port terminal, the hinterland connections via road, rail, and inland waterways (if applicable) to all the disaggregated hinterland regions are incorporated into the model.

In the Chain Cost Model, it is possible to build a container loop for which a database of 70 different ports can be used. Secondly, a specific vessel needs to be selected to sail the specific loop. The main standard input parameters related to the ship are a sailing speed of 22 knots and capacity utilization of 80%. The capacity utilization of inland vessels and trains is assumed to be 80%. All other input parameters are taken from port and terminal websites and other sources such as Drewry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2015</xref>) for the terminal throughputs.

This analysis will be done for both the chain cost and for the vessel owner cost. Therefore, given the specific objective of the present paper, the base model needs to be adjusted.</p><p id="Par50">Firstly, the model has been extended with functionality to allow calculating the vessel owner cost. This means that the total cost for operating a container vessel, on a given loop, can be calculated. These costs include all the vessel-related cost such as running cost, voyage cost (including the cost in ports) and fixed cost. All these costs are calculated for a total round trip.</p><p id="Par51">Secondly, more maritime distance data is collected from MarineTraffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2018</xref>) containing the distance sailed in ECA zones. This means that for each port-to-port combination, in the total maritime distance database in the model, this additional information is added. The maritime distance database is a 80 by 80 matrix. Furthermore, in the model, 20 different container vessel sizes are included, ranging from 500 TEU load capacity up to 20,000 TEU. The vessel data is collected from RINA (1992– <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par52">Based on this information, the fuel cost can be calculated when a vessel is sailing in ECA zones using either MDO, LNG or HFO (including a scrubber).</p><p id="Par53">The time that a vessel is sailing in ECA zones is determined by the speed of the vessel and by the distance sailing in the ECA zones. The fuel consumption of the vessel, using different measures to mitigate the ECA regulations is then determined by the following formula.

The aim is to figure out how the maritime and chain costs are affected by changing the price of fuel.

Similar to the base fuel price situation, the LNG system remains the cheapest and the cost saving of this system is higher than under the scrubber scenario.

On the route from Shanghai to Brussels (the lowest generalized chain cost is obtained via the port of Zeebruges), most of the cost is made up of maritime cost, because the hinterland cost is relatively low, which states that the largest cost saving is for Brussels compared to the other cities. However, by transporting the cargo from Shanghai to Munich (the lowest generalized chain cost is obtained via the port of Bremerhaven) or Berlin (the lowest generalized chain cost is obtained via the port of Hamburg), the hinterland distances are longer; and consequently, the hinterland cost in larger. Therefore, the maritime cost contribution to the overall cost mainly depends on the hinterland distance.</p><p id="Par86">Moreover, comparing the cost savings of the LNG scenario at 90% of the speed (Figs. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) shows that the effect of using alternative fuel technology is higher for the vessel owner than for the cargo owner. For example, the cost savings for the vessel owner deploying a ship of 9115 TEU equals 14%, while this impact from a chain cost perspective reduces to 4%. In the case of a 13,892 TEU ship, the cost savings drop from 18% to approximately 5%. In other words, the impacts are relatively high for cost savings from the vessel owner point of view for LNG propulsion, but from a supply chain perspective, this effect is lower.

However, for the scrubber technology, the cost savings remain approximately unchanged compared to the base fuel price (a small change in cost saving). For both base and alternative fuel prices, the LNG propulsion leads to higher cost savings and reflects the better economic option compared to scrubber technology.

The maritime cost reduces gradually for both the reference and scrubber scenarios. However, for the LNG system, the maritime cost increases for all the vessel sizes, which leads to the reduction of the cost savings of the LNG system with respect to the base fuel price situation. For example, for the ship type of 4600 TEU and for 90% of speed, the cost savings diminish from 22% to 13%, by changing the price of LNG. This fact is valid for ship types 5466 TEU and 9115 TEU by decreasing the cost saving from 12% to 8% and from 19% to 10% respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that, by changing the fuel price, LNG becomes a less economic option but still has the highest cost savings compared to the scrubber system and is considered the cheapest fuel alternative.</p><p id="Par93">In addition, the cost savings of the scrubber scenario is negative for all the vessels, which means that it is a more expensive option with respect to LNG scenarios.

In order to respect the legislation, there are some alternative options for vessel owners, such as LNG propulsion, MDO, and scrubber technology. In this research, the mentioned alternative solutions are assessed economically not only form a vessel owner point of view but more importantly, from a shipper perspective by evaluating the generalized chain cost. The latter assessment shows how alternative options will affect the generalized chain cost and which option will provide the lowest generalized chain cost, which affects the policymaking process and provides a great view for logistics operators in order to deploy the best alternative solutions.</p><p id="Par99">From a theoretical perspective, this research develops a new approach of the economic evaluation of using alternative technologies by assessing the generalized chain cost. By doing so, not only the impact on the vessel owner is assessed, but also the perspective of the shipper is taken into account, which is novel. According to the literature review accomplished in this research, LNG is seen as an alternative solution to be used in maritime shipping. LNG is considered one of the promising solutions which shows better economic evaluation and has lower level of emission. The second-best option is scrubber technology. The findings of this study confirm that LNG can be considered an alternative and possible solution to replace HFO in maritime shipping as it shows the lowest maritime cost compared to the other alternative technologies (also for different HFO - LNG spreads).</p><p id="Par100">This research has two research objectives; first, the evaluation of the cost for the vessel owner and second, the assessment of chain cost of some types of containerships for three alternative fuel options, being LNG, MDO and scrubber technology. For this purpose, a chain cost model is used and adapted. The obtained results for different fuel technologies are compared to each other in order to figure out which option would be the best from an economic point of view. The fuel alternative technologies such as LNG propulsion and scrubber system have been compared economically to a reference case using MDO within the ECA zones and for some types of ship, trading between Europe, the US, and China. The economic comparison is made with three different scenarios of engine types and the fuel used inside and outside the ECA zones. Moreover, this comparison has been put forward by using two different levels of fuel prices by increasing the fuel price of LNG by 70 [euro/ton] and decreasing the price of MDO by 80 [euro/ton] to realize the effect of fuel price on the maritime and chain costs. In this model, the external costs of pollutants such as SO<sub>x</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub>, CO<sub>2,</sub> and PM are taken into consideration.</p><p id="Par101">Based on the performed analysis, firstly, it was found that the LNG system has the lowest maritime cost compared to the reference and scrubber scenarios for both Asia and the US to EU routes. Secondly, the cost savings of the LNG scenario are higher than for the scrubber scenario with respect to the reference scenario, while the cost savings of the scrubber scenario are negative for all the vessels for both vessel owner maritime cost and supply chain cost. The results show that for both Asia-EU and US-EU routes, LNG propulsion is the most economical option by demonstrating the lowest vessel owner cost and generalized chain cost compared to the scrubber technology and reference scenario. In addition, by comparing the maritime cost of the vessels for all three scenarios and both routes, it is observed that as the percentage of design speed is decreasing, the cost of maritime transport decreases as well. Besides, the maritime cost increases as the size of the vessel increases.</p><p id="Par102">By analyzing the obtained results, it can be derived that the supply chain impact depends not only on ship size but more significantly on the maritime distance. It can be interpreted that, in a longer maritime distance from Asia to Europe, the maritime cost is relatively higher compared to the shorter maritime distance from the US to Europe and in this case, the majority of costs are related to hinterland costs.</p><p id="Par103">By performing sensitivity analysis and increasing the LNG price and decreasing the MDO price, it is observed that the LNG system remains the most economical alternative solution, however, the cost savings reduce significantly compared to base fuel price. The reason is that the maritime cost of LNG increases significantly by increasing the fuel price of LNG and at the same time, the maritime cost of the reference scenario decreases by diminishing the fuel price of MDO, which leads to the reduction of the cost savings of LNG propulsion. Moreover, the cost savings of the scrubber scenario with respect to the reference scenario do change slowly.</p><p id="Par104">Therefore, it can be concluded that by changing the fuel price, the LNG scenario becomes a less economic option but still has the highest cost savings compared to the scrubber system and is considered the most economical fuel alternative. By comparing the alternative fuel costs with base fuel price situation, it is found that the maritime cost is influenced by the price of fuel in which for LNG propulsion this influence is much higher and more significant. Moreover, the effect of using alternative fuel technology is higher for the vessel owner rather than the cargo owner. In other words, the impacts are relatively high for the cost saving from the vessel owner point of view for LNG propulsion, but from the supply chain perspective, this effect is lower. This fact reveals that the price of fuel plays an important role in order to choose an alternative fuel option, besides features such as installation cost, crew cost, and maintenance cost, that are other significant factors.</p><p id="Par105">The obtained results are relevant for both logistics operators (shipping companies, shippers, freight forwarders, etc.) and policymakers. For logistics operators, the findings are relevant, as they allow making the economically most rewarding investments, taking into account potential internalization of external costs. For governments, it is important to know which solution gives the best socio-economic cost returns.</p><p id="Par106">The scope of this study was limited in terms of the choice of ship types and investment cost. Firstly, only containerized vessels are taken into account. Secondly, the average investment cost for LNG propulsion and scrubber systems varies based on the ship type and vessel size. In this research, the average investment cost is considered according to the literature which means that by increasing the size of the vessel, this average cost in increased accordingly; however, in reality, the exact investment cost of each vessel size might be different.</p><p id="Par107">In order to extend the research objectives regarding this topic, further research might be done by including other types of vessels such as bulk carriers, Ro-Ro vessels and etc., taking into account the reduction of other pollutants such as CO<sub>2</sub> for further analysis. Moreover, other maritime routes might be considered such as South America to Europe.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We like to thank the green shipping project for the financial support for the development of this research.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors’ contributions</title><p>SAM performed the literature review, performed the analysis and wrote the first draft of the paper.
