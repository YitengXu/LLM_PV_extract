They consist of several multienzyme subunits that must interact with each other in a highly controlled manner to facilitate efficient chain transfer, thus ensuring biosynthetic fidelity. Several mechanisms for chain transfer are known for NRPSs, promoting structural diversity. Herein, we report the first biochemically characterized example of a type II thioesterase (TE<sub>II</sub>) domain capable of catalysing aminoacyl chain transfer between thiolation (T) domains on two separate NRPS subunits responsible for installation of a dehydrobutyrine moiety. Biochemical dissection of this process reveals the central role of the TE<sub>II</sub>-catalysed chain translocation event and expands the enzymatic scope of TE<sub>II</sub> domains beyond canonical (amino)acyl chain hydrolysis. The apparent co-evolution of the TE<sub>II</sub> domain with the NRPS subunits highlights a unique feature of this enzymatic cassette, which will undoubtedly find utility in biosynthetic engineering efforts.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Non-Ribosomal Peptide Synthetases (NRPSs) are responsible for the construction of many types of natural products.

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) are a structurally diverse class of secondary metabolites produced by large multimodular enzymes known as nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. During biosynthesis, NRPSs utilize a modular thio-template mechanism, typically consisting of multidomain enzymatic subunits that must interact with each other in a tightly controlled manner during chain translocation events to ensure biosynthetic fidelity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The reactions catalysed by catalytic domains within each module fulfil a cycle of peptidyl chain elongation using at least three domains; adenylation (A), condensation (C), and thiolation (T)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The A domains selectively activate and load amino acid extender units onto a 4’-phosphopantetheine (Ppant) moiety, which is post-translationally appended to each T domain in the corresponding module, and the C domains typically catalyse chain extension reactions between the growing peptidyl chain and the downstream amino acid. During the biosynthetic process, the growing peptide intermediates remain covalently tethered to the T domains via a thioester linkage. Chain release of the nascent peptide chain is then achieved by either hydrolysis or intramolecular cyclization to generate either a linear or cyclic peptide, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">While aminoacyl/peptidyl chain transfer events are commonly mediated by C domains, whereby the upstream T-bound intermediate unit is transferred to the downstream T domain through the formation of a peptide bond (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, Nature has evolved several other mechanisms of chain translocation to downstream pathways. For example, ketosynthase (KS)-mediated chain transfer of T-tethered intermediates are often found in NRPS-PKS/fatty acid hybrid pathways. This is exemplified in the biosynthesis of pyrrolomycin C <bold>1</bold>, where the first KS domain of Pyr25, a multidomain PKS complex, is proposed to catalyse aminoacyltransfer between a Pyr28-tethered chlorinated pyrrole intermediate and the downstream acyl carrier protein (ACP)-bound acyl unit (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. An alternative mechanism is to use a TE<sub>II</sub> enzyme to hydrolyse the T-tethered substrates which creates a pool of a given specialised amino acid dedicated for an A domain in the downstream NRPS. An example of this phenomenon can be found in the biosynthesis of barbamide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> Here, the didomain NRPS subunit, BarA, activates L-Leu, and a T domain-tethered Leu residue is then subjected to three chlorination events at the unreactive methyl group, followed by transamination to generate BarA-tethered α-ketotrichloroisocaproic acid. Subsequent hydrolysis catalysed by the TE<sub>II</sub>, BarC, yields the corresponding chlorinated α-ketoacid which will be loaded onto the main NRPS assembly line, BarE (Fig.<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Mechanisms of aminoacyl chain translocation to downstream thiotemplated pathways.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Intrasubunit chain condensation/translocation catalysed by a C domain in type I NRPSs. <bold>b</bold> Ketosynthase (KS) domain-mediated chain translocation in the hybrid PKS-NRPS responsible for the biosynthesis of pyrrolomycin C <bold>1</bold>. <bold>c</bold> Chain translocation via TE<sub>II</sub> domain-mediated acyl-thioester hydrolysis followed by reactivation by a dedicated A domain during the biosynthesis of barbamide <bold>2</bold>. <bold>d</bold> AT domain-mediated aminoacyltransfer between T domains in the biosynthesis of coronamic acid <bold>3</bold>. <bold>e</bold> Spontaneous transthiolation between PacP and PacH has been observed in the in vitro pathway reconstitution of pacidamycin S <bold>4</bold>. <bold>f</bold> A new aminoacyl chain translocation occurring between T domains catalysed by a TE<sub>II</sub> orthologue in the production of legonindolizidines <bold>6</bold>.

This particular approach can be found in the biosynthesis of coumermycin A<sub>1</sub> where CouN7 transfers a pyrrole acid unit to ultimately assemble the pyrrole-based product<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. A rather unusual case of AT domain-catalysed chain translocation was found in the biosynthesis of coronamic acid <bold>3</bold> where an AT-like domain, CmaE, shuttles the substrate between T domains of different NRPS enzymes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The didomain NRPS, CmaA, activates isoleucine, followed by aminoacyltransfer from CmaA to a standalone T domain, CmaD, catalysed by CmaE. CmaD delivers the substrate to the subsequent enzyme for the conversion to <bold>3</bold>. Such CmaE-mediated aminoacyltransfer is essential for the biosynthesis, as the downstream enzymes cannot accept CmaA-tethered substrates. CmaE-like AT homologues are also found in the biosynthetic pathways of syringomycin E<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and zorbamycin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Another example involves spontaneous transthiolation between T domains which was observed in pathway reconstitution of the antibiotic natural product, pacidamycin S <bold>4</bold> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. PacP is an A-T-TE<sup>0</sup> tridomain NRPS, of which the TE<sup>0</sup> domain was believed to be inactive due to lack of the typical catalytic triad of TE domains. Incubation of PacP-tethered substrate with PacH, a standalone T domain, resulted in high transfer efficiency of an aminoacyl group from the T domain of PacP to PacH, indicating that the transthiolation occurs spontaneously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Legonmycins <bold>5</bold> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>) belong to a group of bacterial pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.

Unlike the biosynthetic pathways of other bacterial PAs, which have canonical NRPS complexes, the pathway for the assembly of legonmycins is rather unusual.

The A<sub>1</sub> domain in LgnB and A<sub>2</sub> in LgnD were predicted to activate L-Thr and L-Pro, respectively (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1b</xref>). It was proposed that the biosynthesis of legonmycins <bold>5</bold> is initiated by the activity of LgnB and LgnD, utilising L-Thr, L-Pro, and acyl-CoAs to generate the final NRPS-bound acylated-dehydrobutyrin(Dhb)-Pro intermediate, which is likely followed by a TE-catalysed ring closure, leading to the key intermediates, legonindolizidines <bold>6</bold> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1b</xref>).

The Ser<sub>77</sub> residue of LgnA was then mutated to Ala in order to yield the inactive variant, LgnA(S77A). Addition of LgnA(S77A) in the pathway reconstitution assays abolished the production of <bold>6</bold> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">19a</xref>) when compared to the authentic standard of <bold>6</bold> and the control reaction, as observed in HPLC and LC-MS analysis (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">19a</xref> and b). Chemical capturing in these reconstitution experiments also indicated the absence of key intermediate cystamine adducts, <bold>9</bold> and <bold>11</bold>, in the reaction with LgnA(S77A), compared to the control (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">19c</xref> and d). These snapshots of our intact MS analysis together with site directed mutagenesis (SDM) and chemical capturing experiments strongly demonstrated that LgnA transfers an L-Thr residue from LgnB-T<sub>0</sub> domain to LgnD-T<sub>1</sub> domain via an L-Thr aminoacyl LgnA intermediate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>LgnA hydrolyses the aberrant T<sub>0</sub>-tethered IV-Thr units</title><p id="Par21">While we had managed to elucidate the aminoacyltransferase role of LgnA, the canonical hydrolytic activity of TE<sub>II</sub> domains had not been probed.

Addition of IV-CoA into the reaction mixture resulted in observation of an IV-Thr unit attached to LgnD-C<sub>1</sub>-T<sub>1</sub> as the stalled intermediate due to the absence of the downstream NRPS machinery (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">20iv</xref>), consistent with our chemical capturing results that show IV-Thr is correctly formed on LgnD-T<sub>1</sub> domain. Interestingly, in the same assay, IV-Thr is also found tethered to LgnB-A<sub>1</sub>-T<sub>0</sub>. This is probably due to full occupancy of the LgnD-T<sub>1</sub> domain with IV-Thr units, leaving the nonselective C<sub>1</sub> domain to catalyse the formation of IV-Thr on LgnB-T<sub>0</sub> domain. Again, this is in agreement with our previous chemical capturing results in the assay between LgnB and LgnD-C<sub>1</sub>-T<sub>1</sub> didomain (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">16</xref>).

First, the activated L-Thr must be transferred by the standalone TE<sub>II</sub> orthologue, LgnA, from the LgnB-T<sub>0</sub> domain to the LgnD-T<sub>1</sub> domain for the downstream dehydration reaction. Our observations of a highly specific chain translocation event in NRPSs expands the catalytic scope of the TE<sub>II</sub> enzyme family beyond canonical (amino)acyl chain hydrolysis. Second, the biosynthetic pathway involves an unusual dehydration reaction on L-Thr that must occur at the T<sub>1</sub> domain to provide the Dhb residue. Third, LgnB is an A<sub>1</sub>-T<sub>0</sub> didomain, separated from the core megasynthetase, LgnD. The consequence of this is that the TE<sub>II</sub> orthologue, LgnA, has been recruited to serve as an adapter to bridge LgnB-T<sub>0</sub> and LgnD-T<sub>1</sub> domains in order to maintain biosynthetic fidelity.</p><p id="Par31">Standalone TE<sub>II</sub> domains are a common feature in many of PKS, NRPS and PKS-NRPS hybrid pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.

Our data show that the standalone TE<sub>II</sub> domain, LgnA, catalyses an unprecedented transaminoacylation reaction that shuttles LgnB-T<sub>0</sub>-tethered L-Thr to the LgnD-T<sub>1</sub> domain of the downstream megasynthetase (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). This is necessary, because the nonselective condensation reaction between IV-CoA species and a L-Thr unit can occur at the LgnB-T<sub>0</sub> domain. LgnA hydrolyses the aberrant intermediate, LgnB-T<sub>0</sub> tethered IV-Thr to liberate the “blocked” T<sub>0</sub> domain (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). Despite the aminoacyltransfer and editing roles played by LgnA, it is possible that the mis-programmed NRPS-tethered IV-Thr (presumably T<sub>2</sub>-tethered-IV-Thr-Pro), stemming from the nonselective condensation domains, may still accumulate (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>), thus blocking the assembly line, as observed in our time-course experiments (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Overview of the essential role of the bifunctional TE<sub>II</sub>, LgnA, in the legonindolizidine A <bold>6</bold> NRPS assembly line.</title><p><bold>a</bold> LgnA catalyses L-Thr unit transaminoacylation reaction between LgnB-T<sub>0</sub> and LgnD-T<sub>1</sub> domain.

With this knowledge in hand, we used phylogeny-based, mechanism-guided conserved genomic analysis to identify BGCs containing LgnA-like open reading frames (ORFs), and therefore biosynthetic pathways likely involving this TE<sub>II</sub>-mediated chain transfer. This led to the identification of multiple BGCs encoding multidomain NPRSs and standalone LgnB-like NRPSs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">34</xref>).
