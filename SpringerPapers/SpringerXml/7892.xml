Many people in Ethiopia are dependent on eucalypts as a source of fuel and house building material. The use of trees, especially eucalypts, as a living bank account, to be harvested when there is a need for cash, is widespread. This being the reality, the arguments for and against planting eucalypts in Ethiopia has been mounting from time to time, especially associated with water use, soil fertility, soil erosion, allelopathic effects, understory vegetation and plant diversity as well as wild animals. The paradox of reforestation using eucalypts results, mostly, from inappropriate species-site matching and poor management rather than the inherent biological characteristics of the species. Therefore, the debate on eucalypts under the pretext of concern for indigenous species and natural forests should shift to how both plantations established using eucalypts and indigenous species as well as natural forests can help in the enhancement of the socio-economic development and environmental conservation of countries, such as Ethiopia. Despite the claimed negative impacts of eucalypts, farmers in Ethiopia have utilized their traditional knowledge and experience in establishing and managing eucalypt stands. In addition, the available reports in Ethiopia are in favour of planting eucalypts since the authors acknowledge that: (i) the negative impacts can be minimized provided that the choice of species and site as well as the management of the stands are appropriate, (ii) the benefit derived can offset the losses that can occur from such plantations, (iii) no other species seems to replace them to bridge the ever-widening gap between demand and supply of wood and (iv) the profit derived from eucalypt plantations is considerably higher than cultivating crops. However, the choice of eucalypt species should be based on many criteria, for example maximum wood production, ecological sustainability, marketability of the planted species and usefulness of the species to the local populations. All these criteria involve not only a choice of species planted, but also a choice of plantation management methods from initial planting to final cutting of the trees. Careful selection of appropriate species and matching them with appropriate sites must be taken as prerequisite, and the right management practices should be employed.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Allelopathic impact</kwd><kwd>hydrology</kwd><kwd>plant diversity</kwd><kwd>soil fertility and erosion</kwd><kwd>wild animals</kwd><kwd>policy implications</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Addis Ababa University</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007941</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">GSR/1242/07</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>BioMed Central</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>11</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/42055_2021_Article_44.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>ReviewPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Environment</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Environment, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Earth and Environmental Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">There has been an enormous increase in forest plantations in the tropics since the 1960s, and almost 40% of the global estate of 187 million ha of plantations was in the tropical and subtropical areas by 2000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The factors driving the expansion of forest plantations include past and continued destruction of natural forests, leading to huge gaps between demand and supply of forest products, e.g. in Ethiopia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], socio-economic and environmental benefits, unsatisfactory regeneration and failures of management in natural forests, land availability to establish forest plantations, high productivity of plantations per unit area, need to reverse deforestation and forest degradation through rehabilitation and restoration as well as carbon storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">Evans and Turnbull [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] have summarized the major socio-economic benefits of plantation forestry as: (i) creation of a resource to meet demand for wood products and provide environmental services, (ii) development of flexible resources able to yield many kinds and sizes of product for internal consumption, export or both, (iii) using land often of little or no agricultural value, (iv) providing employment in rural areas, (v) enabling use of skills already common in agriculture and (vi) bringing development of an infrastructure of roads, communications, services, houses, shops and schools, often, to remote areas. Forest plantations also play a role in stabilizing soil, preventing soil erosion, controlling water runoff in catchment areas, providing shelter from wind and heat as well as against sand and dust storms.</p><p id="Par4">One of the major challenges facing Ethiopia in striving for development is environmental degradation, manifested in the degradation of land, expressed in terms of soil erosion and loss of soil fertility, and water resources as well as decline or loss of biodiversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Deforestation is one of the major factors contributing to land degradation by exposing the soil to various agents of erosion. This has already led to the use of dung and agricultural residues for fuel instead of natural fertilizer.</p><p id="Par5">In response to the decline of natural forest areas, Ethiopia started large scale industrial plantations with the primary purpose of supplying industrial round wood to produce sawn wood, wood-based panels and wood pulp in the early 1970s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The area of forest plantations was estimated at 189,000âha in 1990 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and it increased to 216,000, 419,000 and 972,000âha in 2000, 2005 and 2010, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Of the total area of plantation forests, about 20% were classified as commercial plantations that produce timber for sawn wood and poles while the remaining 80% were non-industrial plantations, mainly woodlots and trees on farm. These plantations produce fuelwood and construction timber as well as non-timber forest products. They are mainly composed of exotic tree species with only a few indigenous trees, and the main species in these plantations are <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> spp. (hereafter referred to as eucalypt and eucalypts for singular and plural, respectively)<italic>, Cupressus lusitanica</italic>, <italic>Juniperus procera</italic>, <italic>Pinus patula</italic> and other species.</p><p id="Par6">Eucalypts have become the most planted species in the world, although reliable global estimates of areas of planted eucalypts are difficult to obtain. Published reports suggested that there are at least 12 million ha of eucalypt plantations all over the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Over 90% of these forests have been established since 1955, and from about one million ha in 1960, planting has approximately doubled each decade until the end of 1980s when the plantations covered about seven million ha, with variable annual planting estimated at about 175,000 to 200,000âha. A large number of eucalypts have been planted throughout the tropical zone, and about 55 species of eucalypts have been reported from cultivation in Ethiopia, of which between five and ten are widely planted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">The major reasons that contributed to the widespread cultivation of eucalypts in various parts of the world include: great genetic diversity, availability and easy propagation of seeds, relative ease of plantation establishment and management, fast growth even on relatively harsh sites, efficient conversion of solar energy, superior performance than indigenous and most other exotic trees, when planted in the right situation, producing wood for poles, pulp and fuel more rapidly, tolerance to wide environmental conditions, e.g. drought resistance and tolerance to sites of low inherent nutrient status (require little fertilizer), wood of high specific gravity and calorific value, high coppicing ability, exceptional hardiness and other fine qualities of their timber, superior short-length fibre for paper making and excellent charcoal, un-palatability or tolerance of most species to browsing/grazing (easy to protect), relative tolerance to diseases and pests, good economic returns, usefulness for shelter belts, erosion control, land reclamation and drainage as well as provision of non-timber forest products, e.g. honey and essential oils. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Owing to these advantages, eucalypts are seen as ideal trees for both rural woodlots and larger plantations.</p><p id="Par8">The decarbonization of the global economy has a high priority for the global economy. One of the core strategies is to offset carbon by reforesting landscapes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Such reforestation is always controversial as it involves so many other factors, especially if the reforestation is using exotic species. This paper looks in particular at how Ethiopia has reforested its landscape over many decades using eucalypts and what can be learned from assessing the various controversial factors that have become associated with this reforestation. The application to other countries, especially emerging economies, is of considerable relevance to the climate change agenda as well as the Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p id="Par9">Eucalypts have been blamed for issues, including the drying-up of water courses, adverse effects on nutrient cycling and soil properties, the suppression of other vegetation and inability to control soil erosion. These are accusations made by authors from many countries, and they have tended to overshadow the benefits of the eucalypts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">No single fact should be taken as sufficient evidence to promote or to discourage the planting of eucalypts, though the results from several studies taken together may yield valid generalizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. There is no question that trees in general and the eucalypts in particular utilize large amounts of water and nutrients, but the returns that can be realized in terms of biomass production per unit of input must also be considered, and all the other potential side effects examined.</p><p id="Par11">Similarly, Davidson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] argues that the criticisms would equally apply to other exotic trees planted in many countries, not just the eucalypts though eucalypts have been very successful species for reforesting many parts of the earth. Therefore, any balanced argument should compare the potential negative outputs from the exotic species as well as the potential economic gains, which are driving such investment. In the controversy over eucalypts, there has been a tendency for the negative aspects of the genus to be highlighted. In the following sections of the paper each of these factors, namely hydrology, soil (fertility, erosion and allelopathy), biodiversity (understory vegetation, wild animals and plant species diversity) and policy implications are reviewed based on the available literature before making some conclusions about the value of reforestation for socio-economic development without compromising both the biological and physical environmental well-being.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Hydrology and eucalypts</title><p id="Par12">Eucalypts have been used to reforest vast areas of the world due to their ability to grow rapidly and provide a good source of wood for multiple economic purposes. The rapid growth means that they consume large amounts of water and most eucalypt species consume, on average, 785âl of water to produce kg<sup>ââ1</sup> of biomass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This raises fears over water resources and eco-hydrological effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Bewket and Sterk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and Zerga [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>] indicated that among other types of land use changes, eucalypts and land degradation in the highlands of Ethiopia lead to decline in stream flows, especially in the drier season. Similarly, Chanie et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] reported farmersâ responses as eucalypts having dried up springs in the highlands. Eucalypts are known for their high transpiration rates ranging from 0.5 to 6.0âmmâday<sup>ââ1</sup>, and it has also been believed that eucalypt plantations may extract water from shallow ground water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Even though eucalypt species are claimed to consume more water than any other tree species and agricultural crops, some studies showed that this is far from the reality. They have greater water use efficiency (i.e. they consume less water per unit of biomass produced) than most agricultural crops, conifers, acacias and broad-leaved tree species ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] TableÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Indeed, the water consumption of a tree is directly proportional to its ability to produce biomass; hence, it is essential to choose trees for reforestation based on their water consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. This is especially important if the trees are for offsetting carbon.

Eucalypts have deep spreading roots. Thus, in low rainfall areas, eucalypt species may suppress other plants by competing for water, but this is unlikely to occur in areas of high rainfall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. If the planting is not well planned, it may reduce the groundwater level, thereby, affecting the water supplies of local people.</p><p id="Par16">Based on research conducted in the Ethiopian highlands, Pohjonen and Pukkala [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] reported that <italic>E. globulus</italic> converted energy and available water into biomass more efficiently than exotic coniferous tree species. Therefore, although some species of eucalypts may consume more water, which may lead to reduced water availability for other crops growing in association with the trees, they are more efficient in terms of converting water into biomass.</p><p id="Par17">Davidson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] also reported that at Nekemte (Western Ethiopia) with annual rainfall of 2158âmm, <italic>Eucalyptus saligna</italic> Sm. and <italic>E. grandis</italic> W. Hill could produce 46.6âm<sup>3</sup>âha<sup>ââ1</sup>âyr<sup>ââ1</sup> without drawing on water reserves (rainfall only) compared to 16.4, 16 and 12.4âm<sup>3</sup>âha<sup>ââ1</sup>âyr<sup>ââ1</sup> biomass production for the coniferous, acacia, and broadleaved species, respectively. These figures reveal that for the same amount of water consumed, eucalypt produces a higher amount of biomass, which is economically profitable and acceptable for reforestation.</p><p id="Par18">In swampy areas, the groundwater level is near or at the surface, and some species of eucalypts have been used to drain the water away by drawing it up through their roots. Mosquito-breeding swampy areas can sometimes be controlled in this way. But, if the work is not well planned, it may cause adverse effects in adjacent land by reducing domestic water and irrigation supplies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].

There are some cases where reforestation with eucalypts (or other tree species) has led to reduced water run-off and supply of streams or changes in water table levels, especially in regions with limited rainfall. However, in many well documented cases, eucalypt plantations do not have any significant negative impacts on hydrology. Key findings of many hydrological experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] have revealed that eucalypts are highly effective in regulating their water consumption relative to available supplies and regulate their growth accordingly.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Eucalypts and soils</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Eucalypts and soil fertility</title><p id="Par20">The effects of eucalypts on soils have been studied in several countries over many years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].

A comparative study of eucalypts in a mixed plantation has revealed that eucalypt has three times more fine-root biomass in surface soil, which indicated that planting crops in association and adjacent to eucalypts should be avoided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, dismissing eucalypt species as not being suitable for agroforestry misses the full scientific picture that they can extend nutrient cycling from deeper ground soil where other trees and crops do not have access [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Thus, the management of eucalypts in agroforestry becomes the main issue.</p><p id="Par21">A study focusing on wetland conversion has indicated that there is significant difference between wetlands and converted land to dominantly eucalypts by reducing major nutrients from the converted land [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] also reported that the soil under eucalypts becomes water repellent, and the perceptions of the local farmers agreed with the experimental findings by reducing the crop productivity of the land. In contrast to the above, Tadele and Teketay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] have found that the maize dry matter production and grain yield planted on cleared felled eucalypts stand were significantly higher than the adjacent field. According to Hailu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], eucalypts do not overexploit the soil than the traditional fuel usage, such as litter and cow dung collection. Similarly, the study has indicated that due to non-browsed characteristics of eucalypts than other fodder trees, they are well-fitted for soil protection purposes if they are incorporated with avoidance of litter and bark collection in places with overgrazing practices. Generally, there is lack of clear scientific evidence that shows the impacts of eucalypts on soil nutrients that lead to soil degradation. It could be legitimate to raise such concerns under poor management where there is lack of species-site matching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Eucalypts cope with such variability through a root system that has intimate contact with the large volume of soil.

That is why the nutrient requirements of eucalypts are significantly lower than those of many agricultural crops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. As a result, the species flourish with sustainable high yield without fertilizer on red ash and degraded land.

If it were a closed system, nutrients would have been recycled from decomposing litter back to the tree and increase the nutrient bank [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].

This means that the nutrient capital of the soil could be diminished.

Some studies have concluded that eucalypts can worsen soil erosion as an indirect result of frequent disturbance from repeated harvesting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Others argue that eucalypt plantations can help control soil erosion on sloped or degraded sites, but their efficacy depends on environmental factors, such as intensity of rainfall, soil condition, slope and the presence of ground vegetation and litter cover. Though few Ethiopia-specific case studies exist, the limited evidence available suggests that eucalypts may be ineffective choices for erosion control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Rather, eucalypt trees are generally expected to lead to an increase in soil loss due to the reduced understory cover in densely planted eucalypt areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">The litter, which accumulates under most eucalypt plantations, can help to form a protective barrier against erosion, but in many places the litter is collected for fuel or removed to reduce fire hazard.

However, under eucalypt stands around Addis Ababa and very big towns, the accumulation of litter is very low as a result of human and livestock disturbances. People take away most of the litter and cattle and foot traffic compact the soil. If the litter had been left on the site, it would have been incorporated into the soil system to slow down runoff and improve infiltration, and a substantial amount of nutrients would, then, have been able to pass to the soil system, thereby, improving soil fertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. However, as a result of litter collection, the ground under the trees is left bare, and the soil is exposed to erosion. Therefore, litter should be allowed to accumulate where possible, particularly on sites that are easily eroded.</p><p id="Par28">A common theme in eucalypt reforestation outlined in this paper is that scientific management of the forest can achieve much to alleviate problems that have started to prevent further reforestation initiatives using eucalypts. A realistic assessment of each area to be planted is needed to decide whether erosion will be aserious problem, and if so, whether it can be controlled. Some places may not be suitable for plantation establishment. Eucalypt plantations on steep slopes can provide effective erosion control if careful techniques, such as contour planting are used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].

Erosive resistance (physical characteristics) of soils is more important than crop management and crop management is more important than the type of tree crop. Since, in nearly every example where the litter is removed, erosion increases substantially, it is important to focus more on ground cover and ground-level activities (cultivation, compaction by foot traffic, livestock grazing, trampling and harvesting/logging damage) rather than on the species of trees planted. On erosion-prone slopes, it is better to use a periodic, partial harvesting system based on cutting of trees along lines around the contour or removal of small patches in a mosaic pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Allelopathy and eucalypts</title><p id="Par30">Allelopathy is the release of chemicals from leaves or litter that inhibits the germination or growth of other plant species and, consequently, reduces the output of crops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

Allelopathic exudates from eucalypt tree components have shown an inhibiting effect on undergrowth vegetation regeneration and growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].

The magnitude of the negative effects is likely to be influenced by rainfall. Although it is likely that allelo-chemicals do accumulate in the soil, they are highly soluble and rainfall is likely to leach them out, and the effects of allelopathy are, thus, likely to be negatively correlated with rainfall. It has been noted that allelopathic effects are more severe in low rainfall regions prone to soil erosion than in drier regions. However, the hampering effect on growth of understory or adjacent intercropped crops may more often be the result of strong competition for water and nutrients than allelopathy. Farmers in the highlands of Ethiopia linked this effect to competition for water and nutrients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">The potential allelopathic effect of <italic>E. camaldulensis, Cupressus lusitanica, E. globulus</italic> and <italic>E. saligna</italic> on seed germination and seedling growth was investigated with four crops: chickpea, maize, pea and tef [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].

Eucalypts are usually taller than other plants of equal age due to their rapid growth as outlined above. This rapid production of a canopy determines the comparative gap that would be available for sunlight to penetrate through its canopy. When planted at high density, the shade created has adverse influences on the understory environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. The consequence could be an understory vegetation-free surface. Dense stands of eucalypts not only affect the growth of colonizing woody species, but also nearby crops given the added competition for water and nutrients; so yields from crops close to eucalypts may not be as good as those farther from the edge. Therefore, it is not eucalypts rather the lack of sound management that is to blame [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. On the other hand, not all eucalypt species cast heavy shadow to discourage understory plants.

The natural ecosystems are very diverse while the biodiversity of eucalypt plantations is limited, but can be used to encourage return of much more diversity if managed for that purpose.

The source of seeds for the naturally regenerated native woody species is the adjacent natural forest.</p><p id="Par51">Many of the allegations on eucalypts and other exotics, e.g. the allegation of hampering flourishing of native biodiversity, have been disproved by many recent research findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Rather, eucalypts are considered as a potential foster species that can nurse the rapid re-colonization of native species when planted close to seed sources, e.g. secondary forests, and designed and managed properly.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Policy implications of reforestation with eucalypts</title><p id="Par52">As Janz and Persoon (2002) expressed, there are serious shortcomings in the supply and use of information needed for policymaking in the forest sector, particularly those of developing countries. It should be underlined that for a successful forest policy process, it is often necessary to know, among several other things, more about plantations and their role for rural communities. There is a general prejudice against forestry operations, particularly against fast-growing tree plantations, compared with agriculture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, there is a global and local need for reforestation of landscapes and, hence, a more sustainable earth will need to carefully manage the information on how to make such reforestation programs effective, resulting in multiple benefits.</p><p id="Par53">This is particularly important in Ethiopia, which has such a long history of reforesting its landscape with eucalypts after hundreds of years of degrading the land [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The current policy environment regarding plantation establishment of eucalypts in Ethiopia does not favor of the species. There is no encouragement to raise eucalypt seedlings in government nurseries and distribute them to smallholder farmers. The policy practice of discouraging and, in some cases, banning planting of eucalypts by farmers needs rethinking. Considering the dwindling natural forests in Ethiopia, it would be necessary to encourage deriving charcoal, poles and firewood from plantations of fast-growing species, such as eucalypts<italic>,</italic> to prevent further loss of natural forests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">There is a need for care when comparing policy and actual practice because stated intentions in policy documents, sometimes, bear no relation with how policies are interpreted and applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. In another concern, interventions to support market prices for the products of tree growing and to ensure producers have access to markets may be as effective as or more effective than subsidies. Agricultural policies should be complementary to tree growing. Subsidies for credit, price supports and incentives, including measures affecting land and tree tenure, should be seen in parallel to both agricultural crops and tree growing, such as eucalypts, by farmers to avoid policy measures that are likely to distort decisions and favor one at the expense of the other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">Eucalypt trees have been a major part in recent Ethiopian history, and the species will continue to figure prominently in the life of both rural and urban people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The paper has shown consistently that poor management should be blamed rather than eucalypts for the various issues examined, including water, soil fertility, erosion, toxic exudates, and impacts on wild animal and biodiversity<italic>.</italic> Many countries, including emerging nations, like Ethiopia, are facing the impacts of climate change while needing to feed a growing population and creating a more equitable society. The harmonization of forest and agricultural policy unquestionably helps combat food insecurity and poverty, but it can be a major tool in combatting the impacts of climate change and, at the same time, achieving the SDGs. Hence, its justifiable place in the development policy of the country means that individuals and communities can be encouraged to accelerate the establishment of commercial exotic plantations, such as eucalypts, while sustainably managing, utilizing and conserving natural forests, which together can help create a more sustainable earth.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par56">Eucalypts have become the most preferred species for plantation establishment by farmers due to their economic benefit, and the huge demand of fuelwood and construction materials. In Ethiopia, eucalypt plantations constitute 58% of the total plantation followed by <italic>Cupressus lusitanica</italic>, <italic>Juniperus procera</italic> and pines. In recent years, planting of eucalypts has been associated with controversies and criticisms based on ecological and socio-economic arguments in Ethiopia and elsewhere. Hence, eucalypts have been blamed for some problems, including the drying-up of water courses, adverse effects on nutrient cycling and soil properties, suppression of other vegetation, allelopathic effects as well as the inability to support biodiversity and wild animals. Whether these criticisms are based on facts and empirical evidences or arise from deliberate bias or, even, lack of accurate information may be questioned.</p><p id="Par57">The paradox of reforestation using eucalypts results, mostly, from inappropriate species-site matching and poor management rather than the inherent biological characteristics of the species. Therefore, the debate on eucalypts under the pretext of concern for indigenous species and natural forests should shift to how both plantations established using eucalypts and indigenous species as well as natural forests can help in the enhancement of the socio-economic development and environmental conservation of countries, such as Ethiopia. It is very interesting and encouraging to observe that despite the claimed negative impacts of eucalypts farmers in Ethiopia have utilized their traditional knowledge and experience that have accumulated over the years. For instance, the farmers plant dense stands and periodically coppice only part of the stand at a time so that there is a multi-layered canopy, and they allow grass to grow beneath [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Farmers in Ethiopia plant large numbers of eucalypts on small areas of land and manage them to yield a variety of products, including leaves and small branches for fuelwood, and poles and posts for house building and other</p><p id="Par58">farm uses. Farmers who have insufficient land to have woodlots often grow a few large trees, which can be harvested and sold when cash is required. The use of trees, especially eucalypts, as a living bank account [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], to be harvested when there is a need for cash, is widespread. Many people in Ethiopia are absolutely dependent on eucalypts as a source of fuel and house building material. This being the reality, the arguments for and against planting eucalypts in Ethiopia has been mounting from time to time.</p><p id="Par59">As pointed out by Teketay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], despite the growing concern against planting eucalypts, most of the reports available on eucalypts in Ethiopia are in favour of planting them since the authors acknowledge that: (i) the negative impacts can be minimized provided that the choice of species and site as well as the management of the stands are appropriate, (ii) the benefit derived can offset the losses that can occur from such plantations, (iii) no other species (be it indigenous or exotic) seems to replace them in the near seeable future to bridge the ever-widening gap between demand and supply of wood and (iv) the profit derived from eucalypt plantations is considerably higher than cultivating crops. However, the choice of eucalypt species for plantations should be based on many criteria, for example maximum wood production, ecological sustainability, marketability of the planted species (e.g. commercial production of timber) and usefulness of the species to the local populations. All these criteria involve not only a choice of species planted, but also a choice of plantation management methods from initial planting to final cutting of the trees.</p><p id="Par60">From the foregoing discussion, it appears that there does not seem to be any profound reason why eucalypt planting should not continue in Ethiopia until such time that alternative species are discovered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. The establishment of eucalypt plantations could take different forms, e.g. huge number of small woodlots, groups, belts, lines and single trees scattered throughout the rural, but also urban areas. However, it has to be strongly emphasized that careful selection of appropriate species and matching them with appropriate sites must be taken as prerequisite, and the right management practices should be employed.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Addis Ababa University for financial support and Wolkite University for providing support in transportation.
