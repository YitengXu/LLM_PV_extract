Now, however, because of the realisation that nonrenewable (e.g. gas and oil) reserves are still superabundant, a different emphasis is appearing. This involves utilizing both nonrenewable and renewable feedstocks in an environmentally responsible manner. One important recent development involves the drive to utilize feedstocks, such as pyrolysis oil, microalgae and general bio-waste, like sawdust and other nonedible products from lignocellulose. Another is the aim to ensure that CO<sub>2</sub> can be converted to fuels or useful materials, thereby diminishing its concentration in the atmosphere. This paper focuses on these themes; but it also addresses other important specific questions. Among these, the following are of particular interest: (i) How may catalytic cracking be made more environmentally acceptable? (ii) The emergence of single atom catalysts as means of effecting important chemical reactions.</p></abstract><kwd-group

notes-type="PresentedAt"><p>Contribution to the KOPRC Forum, University of Oxford, 24 August 2015.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">For a variety of reasons, the title of this article is significantly different, and so is its content, from the lecture I (JMT) gave on <italic>âSome of Tomorrowâs Catalysts: Actual and Desiredâ</italic> at the KOPRC Forum in August, 2015. In the relatively short interval that has elapsed since that Forum, many significant new developments have occurred in the fields circumscribed by the title of this article. Also, I have been the author or co-author of other related articles, which have appeared, or are shortly to appear, that address many of the questions raised by this broad field. Moreover, even before presenting my KOPRC talk at Oxford, I had reviewed in detail the many facets that arise in considering how humankind is going to cope with powering the planet in an environmentally responsible manner in the next 50Â years and beyondâsee, for example, Refs. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. See also the definitive review by Centi and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] published in 2015, and references therein. Hence, the situation pertaining to all of the topics relevant to those touched upon or implied by the title of this paper is rapidly changing. For example, I did not know until late October 2015 that there is now perceived to be enough natural gas available in the world to serve the needs of the planet for an estimated 230Â years! So the frequently repeated mantra [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] that it is necessary to seek more renewable sources of energy is simply not true. For example, as recently as 9 January 2016, it was announced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] that Australia is increasing natural gas production by roughly 150Â % over the next 4Â years.</p><p id="Par3">In addition to these macro developments, progress in the evolution of new catalysts, especially for the processing of CO<sub>2</sub>, continue to be reported. Furthermore, the agreement reached in the UN meeting in Paris, December 2015, calls for further action to be taken, not only to stabilize but to decrease the amount of anthropogenically produced CO<sub>2</sub> in the Earthâs atmosphere if the target of keeping the temperature rise of the Earth to less than 2Â Â°C by 2030 is to be met.</p><p id="Par4">In predicting and pontificating about what catalysts are likely to be needed and used to fulfil the desiderata implied by the title of this paper, it is salutary to recall that numerous, well-intentioned predictionsâoften made by experts of unimpeachable credentialsâtend to fall short of realisation. As in my Oxford lecture, I recall here that the Commission set up by President Roosevelt to advise him on scientific and technological developments in the foreseeable future, missed many seemingly obvious developments when they reported in 1937. They made no mention of the future, expected use of antibiotics, despite the fact that Alexander Fleming had discovered penicillin in 1928. They also did not find it pertinent to mention that, in future, devices such as the fax machine (invented in the early 1840s) or the fuel cell (also first described and tested in the 1840s) would ultimately be in popular use.</p><p id="Par5">Given the fact that there is still an abundance (almost a superabundance) of fossil-based feedstocks, and also that there is public clamour for the operations of a civilized life to generate less CO<sub>2</sub>, all kinds of socio-political, as well as technological, initiatives are constantly being pursued.</p><p id="Par6">What is absolutely necessary is that more efficient ways are needed of utilizing nonrenewable feedstocks. To give an interesting recent example, aircraft manufacturers are <italic>ârethinking the airplane for climate sakeâ</italic>. (This statement figured as the title of an article in the <italic>International New York Times</italic> in January 2016). In essence, the concept called distributed propulsion is one of several being studied by the NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center in California, to develop technologies that could lead to completely new and far less polluting aircraft designs. For example, future planes may be powered by batteries or hybrid gas-electric systems, and have lighter wings that can quickly change shape so as to handle better the stresses brought on by turbulent air.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Converting carbon dioxide to fuel and other products</title><p id="Par7">It is well known that the French worker, Sabatier, over a Century ago, demonstrated how methane could be produced synthetically by passing a mixture of CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> over a supported Ni catalyst:<disp-formula id="Equa"><alternatives><mml:math display="block" id="Equa_Math"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mtext>CO</mml:mtext><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mspace width="0.333333em"/><mml:mtext>4H</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">â</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mspace width="0.333333em"/><mml:mtext>CH</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mspace width="0.333333em"/><mml:mtext>2H</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mtext>O</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:math><tex-math id="Equa_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Nowadays, it is not the thermally activated Sabatier reaction that is attracting the attention of those chemists devoted to the diminution of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> but its photocatalytic equivalent. At present, there is no proven, highly active and desirable photocatalyst that has been discovered to convert CO<sub>2</sub> to CH<sub>4</sub> in a sustained manner and with high efficiency. The quest for such a photocatalyst, discussed by workers such as Corma et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and Ozin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] is likely to last for a long time.</p><p id="Par9">For several decades CO<sub>2</sub> has been used as a feedstock to produce salicylic acid (a precursor in the manufacture of aspirin), and urea, the most compact form of soil fertiliser. But these industrial processes, although they utilize CO<sub>2</sub> as a feedstock, are far from being carbon neutral. It is gratifying to note, however, that many of the polymeric products previously synthesized from nonrenewable sources can now be readily prepared in an entirely sustainable manner. The case of polyurethane is a good example. Langanke et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] have shown how CO<sub>2</sub> can be used as feedstocks in copolymerizations using epoxidesâsee Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

The latter amounts, at present, languish in the megaton range per annum.</p><p id="Par11">A constructive development is the use of CO<sub>2</sub> (sunlight and water) as a feedstock for the growth of algae using genetically enhanced cyanobacterias to generate ethanol and O<sub>2</sub>âsee Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. This work is carried out by the Algenol Biofuels Company, which, in its facility in Florida, utilizes CO<sub>2</sub> gas liberated from an industrial plant. At present, this Company produces 8000Â gallons of ethanol per acre per year, and they quote a solar energy conversion of 2â3Â %. When their plant grows to occupy 2000Â acres (at the seashore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]), the Algenol Company will produce ca. 14 x 10<sup>6</sup> gallons of ethanol per annum. An important advantage possessed by producing ethanol from algae rather than corn is that no land is used up that could otherwise have been used to produce food.

Rubisco chemistry has also influenced the recent, ingenious work of Kanan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These workers set out to emulate natureâs strategy for CâC bond formation, which is to deprotonate CâH bonds to form carbanions and then to trap these intermediates with CO<sub>2</sub> to form CâCO<sub>2</sub> moieties. They use a purely inorganic approach, which has the advantage of circumventing the need to select the appropriate, robust enzyme co-factor, and some other complications associated with the approach of the synthetic biologist.</p><p id="Par18">What is commendable about what Kanan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] accomplish is their ability to synthesize ethylene glycol and ethanol using only CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>. Their work leads to the ready synthesis of polyethylene furandicarboxylateâalso designated polyethylene furanoate, PEFâwhich is a viable substitute for polyethylene terephthalate (PET) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and is used extensively as a container material for portable water and mineral drinks.</p><p id="Par19">The H<sub>2</sub> required for the preparation of ethylene glycolâa powerful chemical building block for other materialsâmay be produced by either wind-powered or solar-powered water-splitting, using either wind or photovoltaic power for electrolysis.

It is, therefore, relevant to note that an apartment block in Hamburg (Germany) has been built that uses microalgae placed within the faÃ§ade to generate heat and biomass.

The merit of their system (see Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">17</xref>) is that the individual atoms of Pd are so firmly anchored to the nanoporous walls of the C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> that they exhibit minimal tendency to migrate and coalesce to form nanoclusters. This catalyst was shown to be active in a three-phase hydrogenation of alkynes in flow mode, and both its selectivity and activity surpassed those of nanoparticulate Pd. Apart from C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, there is now great interest focused on another âindentedâ (holey) nitrogenous graphene-like carbon of empirical formula C<sub>2</sub>N. Recent theoretical work done on this catalyst support for single atoms of members of the 3d transition metal series, using an augmented wave version of the density functional theory approach, indicates that Cr and Mn single atoms would catalyse the conversion (by an EleyâRideal mechanism) of CO and O<sub>2</sub> to yield CO<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].<fig id="Fig17"><label>Fig.Â 17</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<italic>Top</italic>) Schematic of a single atom Pd catalyst comprising isolated Pd atoms on a solid support of carbon nitride (C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>; carbon, <italic>grey</italic>; nitrogen, <italic>purple</italic>), which acts as a catalyst for hydrogenation reactions. Strong bonds to the nitrogen atoms firmly anchor the Pd atoms in roughly triangular pores in the stacked, two-dimensional layers of the support. There is approximately one roughly triangular cage per 50Â Ã<sup>2</sup> in each layer, and it is estimated that up to 10Â % of them are occupied by a single Pd atom.

Each small spot here is the image of a single metal atom. Christopher and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] have also studied isolated metals, in their case, supported on TiO<sub>2</sub>. They found significant differences in catalytic selectivity between individual atoms of Rh and nanoparticles of the same metalâsee Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig19" ref-type="fig">19</xref>. In an elegant assessment of the energetics of single atoms and nanoparticle metal catalysts, namely of Cu on the (111) face of CeO<sub>2</sub>, Campbell and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] were able to arrive at quantitative values of the chemical potential of this metal from the single atom extreme to the bulk state, as shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig20" ref-type="fig">20</xref>.
