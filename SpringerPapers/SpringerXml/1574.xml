It has now completed 74 glorious years after inception and entered into its 75th year, i.e. Platinum Jubilee Year. To commemorate its 75th Foundation Day, the CSIR-NPL organized a National Metrology Conclave (NMC) on January 04, 2021. On this auspicious occasion, the Honourable Prime Minister of India, Mr. Narendra Modi dedicated the National Atomic Timescale and Bhartiya Nirdeshak Dravya (BND<sup>®</sup>)—CRMs to the nation. He also laid the foundation stone of National Environmental Standard Laboratory. He addressed the august gathering in the gracious presence of Honourable Union Minister of Science and Technology, Dr. Harsh Vardhan. Honourable Prime Minister inspired, motivated and appreciated the strides made by Indian Scientists for nation building, especially the role of CSIR-NPL and impact of metrology for self-reliant India. Honourable Minister, Dr. Harsh Vardhan, inaugurated the exclusively designed poster gallery, displaying accomplishments and importance of metrology in the CSIR-NPL campus and released a book entitled, “Metrology for Inclusive Growth of India”. Several of the world metrology leaders also presented their visions, in the NMC, on the role of metrology in societal and industrial growth through online virtual platform. The main emphasis was placed on the importance and impact of the metrology in the success of several initiatives of Government of India, namely ‘AtmaNirbhar Bharat’ (Self-Reliant India), ‘Make in India’, ‘Digital India’, ‘Skill India’, ‘Vocal for Local’, etc. During all these years, the journey of the CSIR-NPL has been wonderful, splendid and magnificent on several aspects of celebrations, pride, recognition, global visibility and its services for the national cause. It has achieved many milestones, developed technologies of national eminence, organised many memorable events, successfully participated in various national missions’ time to time and published considerable amount of literature for knowledge generation in the form of research papers, patents, copyrights, books, monographs, technical peers, Calibration and Measurement Capabilities (CMCs) and study reports, etc. The successful journey of these glorious years though looks easy, simple, normal and customary but in actual sense, lot of pain staking efforts, huge work, vicissitudes are behind all these accomplishments. The glimpses of the journey of CSIR-NPL from its inception to recently held NMC and the excerpts of addresses made by the dignitaries are also summarized in detail in this article.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Metrology</kwd><kwd>Platinum jubilee of CSIR-NPL</kwd><kwd>National metrology conclave</kwd><kwd>National atomic

infrastructure of any country, metrological standards and related activities are essentially required. Metrology plays a central role as an engine of industrial revolution and inclusive growth. It plays a vital role in support of the sustainable development because metrology is essential to protect the planet, ensure the dignified and quality lives for all people, and attain wide-ranging economic growth and opulence. It is a primary pillar for trade, scientific research, novelty and promising technologies, technical collaboration, or even simple exchange of information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. For the scientific and industrial advancement of any nation, the NMs play significant and unique role in the progression of metrological fields and associated technologies. Each nation requires a strong metrology scheme in place to provide the metrological traceability to stakeholders in each of segment of the economy. This exercise is obvious for maintaining the parity in all the measurements to attain sustainable developments at various front like science, engineering, technology, industry, commerce, business trade, etc., which eventually enables to accomplish the goal of self-reliance. It is also requisite for the NMIs world over to constantly upgrade and maintain their measurement systems at par with the other NMIs and as per the new technological advancement and challenges arising in the international scenario.</p><p id="Par3">The CSIR-NPL, being NMI of India, is also playing exceptional role since its inception on January 04, 1947, taking the metrology field to masses through its invaluable metrological services to stakeholders; educational, awareness, training and academic activities and campaign for students, industry, academicians, policy makers, regulators, etc., and providing time to time need-based solutions, services, technologies and advises to all the stakeholders and government agencies etc. Recently, CSIR-NPL has celebrated its 75th Foundation Day, which was attended and graced by a galaxy of political and science leaders. In order to commemorate its glorious journey of 74 years, it was considered appropriate to make a concise go over of the events which eventually resulted in the formation of this wonderful leading laboratory of the country; its major accomplishments of national and international relevance; excerpts of inspiring and motivating speeches/messages of some of the eminent political and science leaders, specially the most stirring peroration of Honourable Prime Minister of India Mr. Narendra Modi; and the summary of various activities held during National Metrology Conclave (NMC-2021) organised on the Platinum Jubilee Foundation Day, i.e. January 04, 2021. The CSIR-NPL has not only been playing its primary role of establishing and disseminating the national measurement standards in the country, but also formulates and advises the India specific policies, guidelines and gives recommendations on evolving advanced metrology programmes for the government organizations, institutions, regulators, industries and other stakeholders. It is also helping Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and Department of Legal Metrology in the formulation of written standards and assisting National Accreditation for Calibration and Testing Laboratories (NABL) in many ways in accreditation of calibration and testing laboratories. We hope that the brief reassess thus published as a feature article would be useful for the readers involved/interested in metrological activities as a historical and up to date source of information.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Historical Aspects</title><p id="Par4">Historically, metrology is not a new concept in India and it dates back to ancient times. However, with times, era, civilization, culture and geographical areas, the uses, types and names of the standards, units, measurement techniques, etc., continued to change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The <italic>Harappa</italic> civilization, which is considered one of the highly developed civilizations (about 5000 years old), had witnessed several admirable examples of developed dwellings and township having planning and architecture, which would have not been possible without metrology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The identical size of the bricks used in the structure is one of the beautiful examples. Around 2400 years ago, there existed a distinct system of weights and measures in the <italic>Maurya</italic> era [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Later on in the <italic>Mughal</italic> era, the emperor Akbar had introduced a unit of length ‘guz’, which was widely used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It is still in use in countryside even after the introduction of the metric system in India in 1956. Illustrations of the equal arm balances found in the art of <italic>Ajanta</italic> cave and beams of steelyard balances are other beautiful examples, which were discovered during eighth century. Some of these examples evident that the measurement system is an integral part of each civilization/era.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Creation and Establishment of Scientific Institutions Responsible for Metrological Activities</title><p id="Par5">The Railway Board established the National Test House (NTH), formerly known as the Government Test House (GTH) in the Kolkata (then Calcutta) in 1912 to fulfil the requirements of the Indian Railways as import substitution. The Indian Industrial Commission (IIC) recommended for the formation of an Indian Stores Department (ISD) during the year 1916–1918. Later on, the NTH was merged with ISD for doing regular testing of the general stores of the Government Departments including defense for a long time. During the year 1934, Government of India formed the Industrial Intelligence and Research Bureau (IIRB), which later on renamed as Industrial Research Bureau (IRB), which is the origin of the present CSIR. The IRB formed and nurtured in NTH for conducting the Research and Development (R&amp;D) for the indigenous development of raw materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">During British era before independence, the Institution of Engineers (India) (ISEI), situated in Calcutta was given the mammoth task giving recommendations for building up the industrial infrastructure in the country and the ISEI had prepared the first draft of the constitution of an institution which could take up the task of formulation of <italic>National Standards</italic>. This leads to the establishment of Indian Standards Institution (ISI) through a memorandum issued on September 03, 1946, by the Department of Industries and Supplies. The ISI finally came into existence on the January 06, 1947. The ISI became Bureau of Indian standards (BIS) on April 01, 1987 through an act of parliament dated November 26, 1986. Through this change over, the Government aimed to building a quality infrastructure, awareness and more participation of stakeholders in the formulation and implementation of the national standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">In order to initiate, a laboratory accreditation program in India and provide the accreditation services to the testing and the calibration laboratories, the Department of Science &amp; Technology (DST), Government of India, in the year 1982 set up the National Coordination of Testing &amp; Calibration Facilities (NCTCF). The NCTCF started providing accreditation to testing and calibration laboratories with the cooperation of CSIR-NPL (NMI of India) as well as having its office in CSIR-NPL. Subsequently in 1993, the NCTCF was renamed as National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL). The NABL was registered under society Act on August 12, 1998, with the objective of maintenance, implementation, promotion, guidance, coordination, etc., of an accreditation system for laboratories. In the year 2017, NABL merged with Quality Council of India (QCI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Establishment of CSIR-NPL</title><p id="Par8">The Government of India through Legislative Assembly recommended the objectives of CSIR, New Delhi, on November 14, 1941, for the purpose of fostering industrial development in the country. The CSIR was established on September 26, 1942, under the leadership of Sir Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar. In the year 1943, the governing body of CSIR decided to establish 5 national laboratories—National Physical Laboratory (NPL), National Chemical Laboratory (NCL), National Metallurgical Laboratory (NML), Central Fuel Research Institute (CFRI; now CIMFR) and Central Glass &amp; Silicate Research Institute (CGSRI; now CGCRI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. One of the objectives in the <italic>CSIR-Bye Laws—2018, Para 2, (b)-vii clearly stipulates the need of </italic>“maintenance of national physical standards and a library of standard reference materials” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Keeping in view the importance of NMI in the socio-economic and industrial growth of the country, our former visionary leaders worked hard for establishing the CSIR-NPL to work for the establishment, custody, maintenance, upgradation of national standards of measurements, primary standards linking them to SI units and other standards in terms of derived units. Historically, the foundation of CSIR-NPL was laid down exactly 74 years ago on January 04, 1947, before India became independent by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, then Vice President of Interim Government of India. The former Deputy Prime Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel formally opened it on January 21, 1950. During this period, India didn’t have the statutory acceptance from the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) as well as well-equipped laboratory to take-up the measurement standards activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Legal Identity, Framework and International Linkages</title><p id="Par9">The Government of India enacted the “Standards of Weights and Measures Act” for the first time in 1956 to ensure that every citizen has an access to uniform standards of weights and measures those are traceable to the SI units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. During the year 1957, India became member of the General Conference of Weight and Measures (CGPM), BIPM, an International Intergovernmental organisation constituted by diplomatic treaty, i.e. ‘The Metre Convention’. Being NMI of India and to fulfil the mandate, Dr. K. S. Krishnan, the then Director, CSIR-NPL signed the ‘Metre Convention’ on behalf of Government of India in the year 1957 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Subsequently in the year 1957, BIPM provided CSIR-NPL the Copies No. 57 and No. 4 of International Prototypes of the Kilogram (IPK) and the platinum-iridium (Pt–Ir) Metre bar, respectively, to realize the SI base units ‘kilogram’ and ‘metre’[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

The use of the national prototype of the metre, was discontinued after the establishment of laser-based primary length standard as national standard of length. However, the national prototype of the kilogram is still in use as national standard of mass. Recently, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), Government of India, has designated CSIR-NPL as a national agency responsible for carrying out the certification for the instruments and the equipments for monitoring emissions and ambient air through a gazette notification issued on August 22, 2019, under Section 3 of the Environment Protection Act, giving CSIR-NPL the authority to certify instruments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">In the year 1977, the Commonwealth Science Council (CSC) and the CSIR-NPL along with 9 Commonwealth countries formed a cooperation whose main objective was to form a Regional Metrology Programme of joint projects to link each National Measurement System into a collaborative network, which later on became Asia Pacific Metrology Program (APMP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The APMP presently comprises of 45 full members. India signed the International Committee on Weights and Measures Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA) in 1999 and CSIR-NPL initiated the implementation of Quality Management System (QMS) based on the international standard ISO/IEC 17025 to establish the international measurement equivalences for barrier-free trade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The CIPM MRA responses to the growing need for an open, transparent and comprehensive system to give users reliable and quantitative information on the compatibility of national metrology services and to provide technical basis for the wider agreement for the international trade, commerce and regulatory affairs. CSIR-NPL has been maintaining the quality system based on ISO/IEC 17025 for the various parameters under Physico-Mechanical, Electrical and Electronic standards since 2003. The BIPM has authorised CSIR-NPL to use CIPM MRA logo on the calibration certificates issued by it within the currently approved 236 CMCs registered in KCDB of BIPM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The calibration activities in these areas have been peer-reviewed during 2003–06, 2009–11 and further under the peer review process during 2020–2022 to fulfil the requirements of the CIPM MRA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Adoption of Redefined SI Units</title><p id="Par12">Recently, in a landmark and historic decision, the ground breaking R&amp;Ds by the world’s scientific and technical community, resulted into <italic>acceptance and adoption of redefined SI units by CGPM at BIPM on November 16, 2018 by 60 member states</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. <italic>Dr. D. K. Aswal, Director of CSIR-NPL, also voted for this landmark revision of the SI units.</italic> The new definition of SI units successfully replaced the artefact-based units and aptly opened up the new era for quantum world by linking all the seven base units, i.e. the kilogram (kg), metre (m), second (s), ampere (A), kelvin (K), mole (mol) and candela (cd) to constants of nature, which are invariants of time and space. Worldwide, the redefined SI units have been implemented on May 20, 2019, i.e. the ‘World Metrology Day (WMD-2019)’ in terms of physical constants. Since fundamental constants are inherently stable, these are chosen so that the redefined SI need not be modified again in near future to accommodate the possible improvements in the realization of base units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Further during WMD-2019, CSIR-NPL introduced redefined SI Units to the nation through a series of events and released 11 posters, policy document, recommendations and souvenirs.

On this auspicious occasion, Honourable Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi, dedicated the <italic>National Atomic Timescale</italic> to the nation as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> (Top right). CSIR-NPL realizes and maintains the Indian Standard Time (IST™) traceable to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) with an uncertainty of ± 2.8 ns. A bank of ultra-stable atomic clocks are used to realize the National Primary Timescale, IST™, and its dissemination across the Indian subcontinent is done through the network time service and satellite links. CSIR-NPL is on the mission of “<italic>One Nation One Time</italic>” to synchronize all the clocks in the country to IST™ for digital transformation and cyber security. The IST™ traceability to ISRO’s timing centres located at Bengaluru and Lucknow is already established for their space programme. The CSIR-NPL is establishing five traceable secondary timing centres at RRSLs across India at five centres, namely Faridabad, Bengaluru, Bhubaneshwar, Ahmedabad and Guwahati for Department of Legal Metrology, as regional timing centres for providing IST dissemination services to the various sectors and stakeholders in realizing the mission of safe digital India. Sectors like telecommunication, cyber security, cyber-physical systems, ISRO for the crucial NavIC program, air traffic control, secure banking and stock transactions, geodesy, deep space navigation, radio telescopespower grids, etc., increasingly require precise time synchronization. An estimate shows that an economic impact of IST synchronization in these sectors is more than 10% of GDP.</p><p id="Par31">Various technologies, such as time dissemination through telephones, NTP, PTP, CV/AVGNSS &amp; TWSTFT, are available for the time and the frequency synchronization. Along with time realization and dissemination services, CSIR-NPL also pursues R&amp;D on primary standards. India’s first Caesium fountain (NPLI-CsF1), approved by BIPM as a primary frequency standard, was indigenously designed and developed at CSIR-NPL. The focussed and concentrated efforts are being placed on the design and development of a single trapped Ytterbium ion-based optical frequency standard, which would possibly be used for redefinition of SI second. CSIR-NPL will become ready for adopting and implementing the redefinition of SI second, which is expected in 2026.

Mr. Narendra Modi also dedicated the “<italic>Bharatiya Nirdeshak Dravya (BND</italic><sup>®</sup><italic>)</italic>” for the nation for self-reliance and to support the testing and calibration laboratories across the country for quality assurance at par with International Standards as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> (bottom left). Reliability of the laboratory results depends upon the traceable calibration through certified reference materials (CRMs). These CRMs are used to calibrate the testing equipment with utmost accuracy. These CRMs traceable to SI units are produced under the stringent conditions following the international standards for quality assurance and the data as per international acceptance. These CRMs are also used for calibration, testing, quality control, method validation purpose, assigning the values to other tested materials and finally to maintain or establish traceability to conventional scales. The Indian CRMs are registered as Trademark name Bhartiya Nirdeshak Dravaya (BND<sup>®</sup>). These BNDs are used by industries, government sectors and academia to ensure the best accuracies with minimum uncertainties in measurement through calibration of instruments, validity of measurements and method validation for quality assurance. As on today, India imports CRMs worth several hundreds of crores. Being the NMI, it is the responsibility of CSIR-NPL to overcome this flow of foreign exchange and produce as many CRMs and become self-reliant. In order to cater the demands of Indian Industries and huge potential of CRMs production, CSIR-NPL has started a massive mission mode programme in association with Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MoC) for indigenous production of CRMs/BNDs. Many MoUs have been signed with several Reference Material Producers (RMPs). Such coordinated and sustained initiatives taken by CSIR-NPL would surely entail a significant change in the socio-economic structure of the nation through an effective and reliable quality control and assurance programme. This would help enhancing barrier-free export and import of goods, services and CRMs as well as saving foreign exchange.

This material ionizes the water molecule at room temperature. Those ions are being collected at two different electrodes. Thus, due to flow of ions electricity generates. Hydroelectric cell would be a good alternative to the solar cell and fuel cell.</p></sec><sec id="Sec46"><title><bold><italic>Technology for Converting Waste Plastic into Tiles</italic></bold> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]</title><p id="Par67">India generates approx. 10 million tonnes of plastic waste every year and as per Environment Ministry, nearly 40% of which is not collected back for their safe recycling. In general, this waste plastic is dumped in open space that not only adds unwanted environmental pollution in different forms but also poses serious health hazards to living beings.</p><p id="Par68">Disposal of plastic waste has been a major challenge because of its non-biodegradable nature and it consists of low-density polyethylene. Disposal through burning of these waste plastic bags causes environmental pollution. In this direction, a process technology was developed by CSIR-NPL for useful recycling of plastic waste into designing materials, paver, roof tiles and interlocks, for their rugged and waterproof applications in pathways, gardens, lanes, footpaths, false ceilings etc. This novel transformational technology not only presents a safe disposal of plastic waste but also presents an eco-friendly conversion of plastic waste into useful alternatives, at the same time, to fulfil the societal needs and mitigate environmental problems, caused due to plastic waste. This technology has been well accepted and transferred to several industries and start-ups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec47"><title><bold><italic>Solar Photovoltaic (PV) System</italic></bold> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]</title><p id="Par69">CSIR-NPL has established the secondary standard facility for efficiency validation of solar cells. A major program is taken up for the establishment of primary standard in collaboration with PTB Germany. India has targeted the PV installations of 100 GW by the year 2022 under the National Solar Energy Mission. CSIR-NPL has a vibrant photovoltaic group in the country with a rich history in silicon based photovoltaics since last four decades. CSIR-NPL has developed silicon solar cells, for the first time in the country, in mid 70’s. CSIR-NPL is the first laboratory to demonstrate the complete process ‘from metallurgical grade silicon to solar grade polysilicon and fabrication of solar cells. Recently, CSIR-NPL has initiated the work on recycling of silicon solar cells/modules.</p></sec><sec id="Sec48"><title>Methane Emissions</title><p id="Par70">After economic liberalisation of India in the year 1991, the industrial developments started growing manifold with the investment of several multinational companies, which set up manufacturing units in India. This industrial growth also brought the increment in the emission of several pollutant gases out of different sectors like sewage plants, chemical industries, sugar factories, power generation stations, etc. Indian scientists proved the actual methane emissions from the Indian paddy fields is only of the order of 3.46 Tg/year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] against the controversy over the large methane emission from paddy fields in India (which was earlier estimated as 37.4 Tg/year). This calls for the preparation of methane standard and it was successfully developed by the CSIR-NPL at the time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec49"><title>Carbon Technologies</title><p id="Par71">The advanced carbon products/materials, magnetic and thermoelectric materials developed at CSIR-NPL are catering the need of the country in the industrial, health, energy as well as strategic sectors like defense, aerospace and nuclear power. Some of the recently developed carbon technologies are, activated carbon, flexible multi wall carbon nanotubes bucky/paper for Li batteries, single layer graphene by CVD, torrefied rice straw pellets for thermal power plants, high density nuclear grade graphite, CNT yarn and CNT based body armour materials to name a few [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec50"><title>Visitors of CSIR-NPL</title><p id="Par72">The CSIR-NPL has always been the centre of interest, importance, relevance and place of attraction for the visitors from various fields across the globe.

The establishment of CSIR-NPL as NMI of India and its crucial role in the inclusive growth of the country over the years is outlined, as also highlighted by the Honourable Prime Minister of India in his NPL Foundation Day Speech and Honourable President of India in his Presidential Address of Joint Parliament Session on January 29, 2021. His Excellency mentioned, “Our very own Navigation Satellite System 'NavIC' is also enhancing the prestige of the country. Thousands of fishermen are now benefitting from it. New standards have been set in the form of National Atomic Timescale and Bhartiya Nirdeshak Dravya Pranali, which were dedicated to the nation recently. These indigenous solutions will help in developing Indian products as per international standards”. The journey of contributions to the nation included few milestones, namely development of indelible ink, preservation of original copy of the Constitution of India, solar photovoltaic technology, methane emission, contribution to Indian Antarctica missions etc. The article also includes the pioneering achievements on National Atomic Timescale, Bhartiya Nirdeshak Dravya (BND®)—CRM, foundation of National Environmental Standard Laboratory dedicated to the nation, by the Honourable Prime Minister of India for nation building. A list of galaxy of scientific and political leaders, visionaries who made their visit to this esteemed institution ever since its inception and witnessed its journey as grand national laboratory of India, taking its role beyond the national frontiers, is also summarized at the end. The feature article therefore, would certainly serve as a useful reference document with relevant information, for researchers, scientists, academicians, policy makers, regulators, administrators, industries, stakeholders and science historians, collected at one place.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Authors would like to convey their whole-hearted gratitude and appreciation to all the contributors, organizations, members, scientists and students of CSIR-NPL, past and present, whose research works and activities are included in this feature article.
