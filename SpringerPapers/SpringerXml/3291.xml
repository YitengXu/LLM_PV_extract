Apart from other factors, potting media (PM) play a crucial role in determining the success of nursery cultivation. Worldwide, peat is the most commonly used substrate in PM because of its favorable physicochemical properties. However, due to ascending environmental and ecological concerns regarding the use of peat, a variety of new substrates have been used/tested by researchers/practitioners/growers as PM. Bark, coir pith, wood fiber, compost derived from various agro-residues, and vermicompost either alone or in combination are some of the commonly explored substrates and found to have the potential to replace peat to a greater extent. In lieu of availability, abundance, low cost, and no/low processing requirement, the use of agro-industrial residue (AIR) in the PM is the current trend. However, challenges associated with their adoption cannot be ignored. The present review is focused on providing collective information, scientific knowledge and detailed analysis of various AIR used in PM. The critical evidence-based review would help in developing a consistent approach for the identification, selection and characterization of a new renewable substrate. In addition, it would help in developing a rationale understanding of the practical and economic realities involved in the adoption of the same in PM.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"

</title><p id="Par3">Transplant production, especially for vegetable and floriculture, has become popular in the last two decades to enhance resource efficiency as well as to reduce the environmental impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Early and uniform crop maturity, efficient management of land, energy, time and seed materials, production of pest-free transplants, reduction in pesticide and herbicides usage, and most importantly healthy and homogenous seedlings are some of the advantages of transplant production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The profitable opportunities offered by this production system are the reason for the enhanced demand for seedlings, especially for the production of vegetables and flowers. Looking into the advantages of the transplant system, researchers extended their applications into a wide range of plants, including sugarcane and forestry species (pine, beech, spruce, etc.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Ornamental plants production is another emerging horticulture sector in terms of volume, value, specialization, as well as commercialization. Quality, homogeneity, and standardized products is one prerequisite to achieve success in producing ornamentals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Potting media (PM), fertilizers, permitted pesticides, seeds, labor, and the infrastructure itself is the main inputs in greenhouse nurseries and ornamental plant cultivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. After labor, PM is the second prominent contributor to total greenhouse production cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">Two fundamental challenges before soilless cultivation are, (i) unlike a normal soil profile, a pot provides a very shallow layer of a PM that saturates quickly during irrigation; (ii) small pot volume provides limited capacity for water storage between irrigation events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Indeed, an effective PM must have a physical structure that can sustain a favorable balance between air and water content both during and between irrigation events in order to prevent root asphyxia and drought stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The inability of the soil to provide this balance at such small volumes is a key factor in the development of soilless PM. Indeed, these PMs have been a pivotal innovation, allowing growers to ensure rationale supply of water, air, and nutrient to the plant while excluding soil-borne pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Peat is the most widely used substrate in PM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, due to ecological and environmental concerns, the use of peat in PM is under high scrutiny. This had given a thrust to examine a wide range of alternative materials in PM. In spite of exploring a diverse range of new materials, only a few of them have been adopted widely. This review critically examines all the issues and provides an overall and comprehensive knowledge of:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par5">all the widely used substrates in PM</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par6">some new renewable substrates which were not investigated in detail</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par7">selection and evaluation criteria of an unconventional substrate in PM</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Background</title><p id="Par8">Historically, horticulturalists were using a mixture of composted organic waste and mineral soil for growing plants. Usually, the soil was not sterilized or pasteurized. Consequently, the chances of soil-borne pathogens and insect infestation were very high. Also, these mixtures were usually unbalanced in nutrition with varied physical properties reducing the consistency of PM performance. In the United Kingdom (UK), in 1930s, Lawrence and Newell standardized growing media called “John Innes” (blend of loam, sand, and peat in 7:3:2 ratio, respectively) for commercial purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Here, the loam was sterilized to eliminate pathogens and pests. Additionally, necessary nutrients status and desirable physical properties were taken into consideration while developing the media to achieve optimum plant growth. Since loam was the main “body” of this media, its usage was limited by difficulties in transportation and handling because of its heavy weight. During 1950s in the United States (US), due to the widening of greenhouse crop production and containerized nursery, researchers and practitioners identified bark and peat as the most efficient soilless components for PM production. Later, in the 1970s, peat was explored successfully as an alternative to loam to make transportation cost effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Considering the ease of handling and beneficial properties, with time peat became the major component of PM and still dominates the sector. About 40 million cubic m<sup>3</sup> of peat is used annually worldwide in horticultural production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], among which Germany (8.5 million m<sup>3</sup>) and UK (2. 5 million m<sup>3</sup>) are the major consumers of peat in horticulture media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Peatlands are highly fragile ecosystems, which are natural habitats of huge biodiversity. Peatlands contain 15–35% of regional species, among which 5–25% are endemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Peatlands serve as a primary sink for CO<sub>2</sub>, estimated to store 75% of all atmospheric carbon. The destruction of these habitats leads to a wide range of biodiversity loss and release of active C into the atmosphere, thereby disturbing the global carbon cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Adding to this, every 4 to 5 tons peat collection process from its natural habitats costs 1 ton of CO<sub>2</sub> emission into the atmosphere making the process more hazardous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In addition, the existence of this ecosystem is of crucial importance for maintaining the quality of groundwater, flood and drought mitigation, and local climate regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A life-cycle assessment study has shown that peat-based media have the highest detrimental impact on climate change and resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Therefore, in recent years, intensive use of peat for horticulture has been discouraged due to ascending environmental concerns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Since peat is identified by environmentalists as an unsustainable constituent in terms of habitat destruction pillars of sustainability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], many peatlands are declared as special areas of conservation. The number of licenses for peat extraction has decreased in order to protect peatlands. The pressure of environmental groups has increased to reduce the use of peat in horticulture. In 2011, the UK government set specific targets for ending the use of peat in horticulture in England and Wales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and phasing out peat in the horticulture market by 2020. In relation to peat extraction, the International Union for Conservation of Nature Commission on Ecosystem Management (IUCN-CEM) has produced a Global Action Plan for Peatlands (GAPP). The vision statement of the GAPP recognizes the importance of peatlands and recommends wise use, conservation, and management of natural resources for the benefit of people and the natural environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In response to this, scientists and practitioners all over the world are exploring alternative substrates for replacing peat in PM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Characteristics of potting media</title><p id="Par12">Potting media play a pivotal role in the success of the nursery industry. It provides anchorage to the root system, supplies enough water and nutrients for the plant, and guarantee adequate aeration in the rhizospheric region of the seedlings and also ensures maximum transplantation success (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. For the success of any PM, stability and consistency are essential. Further, the absence of phytotoxic chemicals, pests, and pathogens is crucial; otherwise, plant growth and health are negatively affected. Availability of raw material, cost, environmental impact, and ultimately, consumer acceptance are some of the other vital factors which cannot be ignored while choosing/developing a PM.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Characters of an ideal potting media</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13399_2021_1998_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Physio-chemical properties of potting media</title><p id="Par13">Since the volume of PM in the pot is relatively small, standardization of physical, chemical, and biological properties is of utmost importance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Some of the essential physical and chemical properties are discussed below. However, the requirement may change according to plant type, environment, and management practices. Prior knowledge of these properties among growers helps in tailoring the PM according to the requirements of different plants and to obtain higher benefits from the transplants.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Particle size</title><p id="Par14">It indicates the size and distribution of particles in the PM, and it is related to water retention and air porosity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In general, the particle size and air porosity are directly proportional. Whereas the particle size is inversely proportional to the water-holding capacity (WHC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. According to Benito et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], the best substrate should contain medium to coarse texture and particle size distribution ranging between 0.25 and 2.5 mm, which allows the retention of enough readily available water along with an adequate air content. By mixing eight different particle sizes (&lt; 0.25, 0.25–0.5, 0.5–1, 1–2, 2–4, 4–8, and &gt; 8 mm) of pruning waste compost, a number of PM were prepared to observe the effect of particle size on physical properties. On increasing the proportion of 0.25–0.5 mm particles in the PM, all the physical properties (air porosity, total porosity, easily available water) tend to come in the recommended range for an ideal substrate, while increasing the proportion of particles of larger size (0.5–8 mm) leads to the deviation in the physical properties from the recommended values.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The interrelationship between particle size, air porosity, water-holding capacity, and their effect on plant growth and health</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13399_2021_1998_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p id="Par15">A PM developed by using almond shell waste had shown reduced WHC (188 mL/L) and high air porosity (36%, v) than the acceptable range (600–1000 mL/L and 20–30%, respectively). This effect was attributed to a high proportion (85%) of coarse (&gt; 1 mm) particles and a low proportion (≈ 3%) of intermediate particles (0.25 to 0.5 mm) in the PM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Similarly, Samadi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] reported that cucumber (<italic>Cucumis sativus</italic>) plants grown in fine-grade perlite had higher fruit weight (50%), plant height (25%), and leaf area (70%) compared with very-coarse grade. The inferior performance of course grades of perlite could be ascribed to their low WHC rendering the plants susceptible to water stress.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Bulk density</title><p id="Par16">Bulk density refers to the mass of the PM divided by the volume occupied by it. The bulk density of a PM is directly proportional to WHC and inversely proportional to air porosity. Bulk density is an important parameter while considering transportation. Raw materials or final PM or transplants with very high bulk density may not be desirable during transportation. Because of its high bulk density (1.0 g/cm<sup>3</sup>), soil-based PM called “John Innes” developed in the UK was replaced by peat-based media to make transportation cost effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, too low density is not good while considering the stability of PM in windy conditions, mainly when lightweight plastic pots or polythene bags are used as containers for growing nursery seedlings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Many workers have suggested an optimum range for the bulk density of PM. According to Bunt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], a bulk density of 0.4 to 0.5 g/cm<sup>3</sup> is optimum. While Abad et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and Noguera et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] had given a range of 0.2 to 0.4 g/cm<sup>3</sup> to be good for PM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Total porosity</title><p id="Par17">It determines the total available free space acquired by water, air, and roots in a PM. In general, large pores are responsible for aeration, whereas small to fine pores hold water. The degree of porosity is responsible for good gas exchange capacity for the root system and providing enough available water to the plant. For an ideal PM, a total porosity of 70–90% is recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], while Beardsell et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and Jaenicke et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] suggested that a total porosity in the range of 50–80% can be ideal for a good PM. The presence of sufficient oxygen in the rhizosphere is crucial for plant roots. It is accepted that with less than 12% oxygen in the root system, plants would not be able to produce new roots and between 5 and 10%, roots would not grow and below 3%, plants would die. To maintain oxygen above 12%, the porosity of 50–80% by volume is ideal for PM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Air porosity and water-holding capacity</title><p id="Par18">The percentage volume of the PM occupied by air after gravitational drainage is known as air porosity %, while WHC refers to the maximum volume of water retained by the substrate after it is allowed to drain. A correct balance of water and air in the PM is crucial for plant health and growth. It is also important for regulating the frequency and volume of irrigation. If the WHC of media is low while air porosity is high, media will drain fast, imposing drought stress to the plant, demanding frequent irrigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. While in the case of low air porosity, aeration in media would be hindered, and roots would face the hypoxia condition.</p><p id="Par19">The particle size of the PM determines the air and water pore space. Larger or coarser particles have a greater percentage of macropores, also known as air pore space, while smaller or finer particles have a greater percentage of micropores, also known as water pore space. Graceson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] reported that WHC increases with an increase in the proportion of fine particles in PM, creating more water-holding pore spaces. In addition to the substrate, WHC and air porosity depend on the container height also. Owen and Altland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] reported that WHC decreases (14%) while air porosity increases (9%) linearly with an increase in container height from 3.8 to 15.2 cm. Changes in the moisture content of the PM as a result of the combined effect of matrix and gravitation results in a vertical gradient of moisture which is higher at the bottom and lower at the top of the container. This vertical gradient in the moisture content of the PM results in an inverse relationship between air porosity and WHC. For an ideal substrate, air porosity of 20–30% and WHC in the range of 50–60% are recommended to be good [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>pH</title><p id="Par20">It refers to the concentration of hydrogen ions (protons; H +) in an aqueous solution. The pH of the substrate is a crucial parameter affecting the mobility and availability of nutrients. Further, young seedlings are more vulnerable to pH extremes in comparison to mature plants [46, 47 and others]. If the pH is not within the desired range, nutrients can become either unavailable or toxic. At high pH (&gt; 7.5), the solubility of phosphate, carbonates are reduced so plants cannot utilize them, while at low pH (&lt; 5), the high solubility of aluminum and manganese can cause phytotoxicity. Further, low pH levels (&lt; 5.5) reduces the availability of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, and molybdenum [48, 49 and others]. Different plants vary in their pH requirement for example for tomato cultivation, a pH of 5.8–6.7 is desirable and for cucumber, the recommended pH is 5.3–6.4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

A high electric conductivity (EC) has an adverse impact on germination, photosynthesis, plant vigor, and yield, thus the productivity of many crops, as well as their nutritional and economic value [58, 59 and others]. On the other hand, a very low EC value indicates a lack of available salts. During the anion exchange process, excess sodium ions can replace calcium and magnesium, leading to altered medium structure and fertility. This results in the depletion of available nutrients. A high concentration of salts in the PM negatively affects transplant health. Salinity impairs plant growth and development via water stress, cytotoxicity due to excessive uptake of ions such as sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) and chloride (Cl<sup>−</sup>), and nutritional imbalance. Additionally, salinity is typically accompanied by oxidative stress due to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Different plants differ in their salt sensitivity/tolerance range. Cucumber, a salt-sensitive species, EC &lt; 2.7 dS/m should be maintained in the PM, otherwise significant yield losses are inevitable. While zucchini (moderately salt-sensitive) prefers to grow in PM with EC of 2.6 to 2.8 dS/m.

Defibration affects not only the basic features (amount of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, pH, Ec, water-extractable C), but it also affects microbial activity, thus it is linked to the risk of N immobilization. The effect of defibration on plant fiber is not straightforward. It depends on the characteristics of plant fiber and the method of defibration. Extrusion, retrusion, and disc refining significantly reduced the risk for N immobilization for miscanthus straw. Acidification of miscanthus straw, flax shives, and reed straw with acetic acid and citric acid reduced the pH of the fibers, resulting in a reduction in the risk of N immobilization.

Management of the PS is a major problem in comparison to other residues such as wheat straw because of time constraints between rice harvest and wheat sowing. Since PS is rich in silica, it is not preferred as animal feed. Further, in the era of mechanized agriculture, dependency on animals is reduced, so the number of animals used in agriculture is also reduced. Among all residue management options (burning, bailing, in situ incorporation in the soil, removal), burning is considered the most feasible method by farmers.

The use of various AIR would also help in the channelization and management of waste so these industries turn towards green. However, the development of standard protocols to bring uniformity in the production process and quality improvement in PM is to be taken care. The PM of the future will most likely rely upon blends of several ingredients, taking advantage of their beneficial properties while minimizing their limitations.
