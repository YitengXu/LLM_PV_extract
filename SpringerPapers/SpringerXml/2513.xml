Herein, we report a single-atomic-site Co catalyst supported by carbon doped boron nitride (BCN) with locally polarized B–N bonds (Co SAs/BCN) to simulate the reductive dehalogenases. Density functional theory analysis suggests that the BCN supports, featured with ionic characteristics, provide additional electric field effect compared with graphitic carbon or N-doped carbon (CN), which could facilitate the adsorption of polarized organochlorides. Consistent with the theoretical results, the Co SAs/BCN catalyst delivers a high activity with nearly complete dechlorination (~98%) at a potential of −0.9 V versus Ag/AgCl for chloramphenicol (CAP), showing that the rate constant (<italic>k</italic>) contributed by unit mass of metal (<italic>k</italic>/ratio) is 4 and 19 times more active than those of the Co SAs/CN and state-of-the-art Pd/C catalyst, respectively. We show that Co single atoms coupled with BCN host exhibit high stability and selectivity in CAP dechlorination and suppress the competing hydrogen evolution reaction, endowing the Co SAs/BCN as a candidate for sustainable conversion of organic chloride.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Bridging the biocatalytic repertoire and the effective environmental remediation remains a great challenge.

However, most of the halogenated compounds entering the environment are persistent with bioaccumulation potential in organisms and adverse effects on human health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Among them, halogen-containing antibiotics, specially, chloramphenicol (CAP), a suspected carcinogen, was the first synthetic antibiotic to be applied at large scale since 1949<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The excessive use of antibiotics for a long time yields emerging antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antibiotic-resistant genes, becoming a growing public health problem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Dehalogenation generally enables to reduce the biological toxicity of halogenated compounds and also remove the antibiotic properties. However, traditional physicochemical techniques are often inadequate or expensive for breaking the strong carbon–chloride (C–Cl) bond in organic chloride, compared to bromide and iodide analogs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The existing chemical reductive and oxidative dechlorination scenarios require long reaction times, high energy consumption, and/or costly or unstable reagents under particularly harsh reaction conditions and often lead to non-selective transformations, causing a secondary pollution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Thus the development of strictly sustainable dehalogenation solutions to avoid jeopardizing the current natural resources has become an urgent challenge.</p><p id="Par5">Biocatalytic dehalogenation on the basis of microorganisms typically operates under mild temperatures and pressures with fewer hazardous solvents in comparison of physicochemical transformations and plays a crucial role in achieving the sustainable development goals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. However, biocatalytic systems are time-consuming and incapable of degrading refractory and toxic pollutants completely<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. To bridge nature’s catalytic repertoire and the demands of sustainable and effective environmental remediation, chemists have started to import function of microbial enzymes into chemical materials. In particular, the atomically dispersed single-metal-site materials might be an ideal platform to satisfy these demands due to the uniformity of isolated active site and the tunable coordination environment through the host structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">For dehalogenation, organohalide respiring bacteria with reductive dehalogenases (Rdh) composed of cobalt ionic center coordinated to tetrapyrrole-derived macrocycle could remove halogen through heterolytic cleavage from organic halides via the formation of halogen–cobalt intermediates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The cobalt center and the binding pocket with optimal noncovalent interactions, generally including hydrogen bonding, electrostatic effects, <italic>π</italic>–<italic>π</italic> interaction, hydrophobic, and Van der Waals forces, are responsible for biological dehalogenation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In addition, the electric field generated from the charged residues of the binding pocket also plays important roles in enzymatic dehalogenation. The local electric field around the active site could assist in activating the carbon–halogen bonds by changing the orientation and bond length of the organic halides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Inspired by the intrinsic activity of Rdh, rationally tailoring the element compositions and molecular structure of the hosts for metal centers in single-metal-site materials is the key for the design of high-performance dechlorination catalysts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Among the elements usually applied in the hosts, the electron-deficient B (2<italic>s</italic><sup>2</sup>2<italic>p</italic><sup>1</sup>) has fewer valence electrons than valence orbitals, readily sharing electrons donated from an electron-rich N (2<italic>s</italic><sup>2</sup><italic>p</italic><sup>3</sup>). The resulting B–N bonds are partial ionic due to the large difference in electronegativity between B atom and N atom, presenting the local electric field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Each functional B–N region with electric field could build up an overall electrostatic surface to interact with the C–Cl dipole, thus to capture the reactant correctly, like the function of the binding pocket in Rdh.</p><p id="Par7">Inspired by the above analysis, based on electron localization function and partial density of states (PDOS) analysis, we report a design strategy to integrate enzyme-like single-atom sites with highly polarized support. Since electrocatalysis lies at the heart of green transformation of contaminants in the future technologies, single atomic Co confined in carbon-doped boron nitride (BCN) supports (Co SAs/BCN) as a robust and competent electrocatalyst for dechlorination was synthesized for proof-of-concept demonstration. Single Co sites behave as an enzyme-like active center. The electric fields endowed by the ionic B and N sites of Co SAs/BCN reinforce the interaction between Co SAs/BCN and organochlorides, thereby boosting dehalogenation kinetics. Computational studies reveal that Co SAs/BCN exhibit preferential and accelerated adsorption of chlorine than that of hydrogen. The single-atom Co catalyst delivers high electrocatalytic dechlorination performance for CAP, surpassing most of the reported heterogeneous catalysts in previously published studies (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Electronic structure of Co SAs/BCN</title><p id="Par8">We first carried out density functional theory (DFT) calculations (detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Methods</xref>) to analyze the feasibility of single-atom catalysts (SACs) to learn from the catalytic active sites and micro-environment of Rdh (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Electron localization function analysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1a</xref>) and Mulliken charge analysis (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1b</xref>) show that the electron density is concentrated around N sites and lacks at B sites. This is in consistent with the results that BN is featured with ionic surface derived from its locally polarized B–N bonds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The charge separation of BN could be similar to the micro-environment of the charged pocket in native enzymes, favoring the binding of organochlorides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. To evaluate the electrical conductivity, band structure of the pristine BN was calculated. The results show that BN exhibits as a semiconductor with a wide gap of 4.633 eV, impeding its electrochemical application. To improve the electrical conductance, the carbon atoms were doped into the BN substrate to form BCN. The band gap of BCN is significantly reduced to 0.084 eV by introducing new electronic states contributed by the carbon atoms (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. To evaluate the redox activity, charge analysis and orbital calculations were conducted. The atomic charge is a useful one to reflect the electron density map in solids for describing the distribution of electrons in chemical bonds. The Mulliken charge analysis is adopted to calculate the atomic charge through a linear combination of atomic orbital approach. The atomically dispersed Co sites anchored on BCN supports with net charge of 1.110 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1f</xref>), comparable with that of Co atom (1.03) in a simplified model of the active site in the reduced Rdh (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. The highest occupied molecular orbital (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>) of the isolated Co is near the Fermi level due to a positive shift of the energy levels (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2b</xref>), which is beneficial for electron donating, suggesting a promising reducing ability of Co SAs/BCN.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>DFT calculations of Co SAs/BCN.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Electrostatic surface representation of the Rdh; the potential contour was scaled to +5.0 (blue) and −5.0 (red) <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub><italic>Te</italic><sup>−1</sup> (where <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub> is the Boltzmann constant, <italic>T</italic> is temperature, and <italic>e</italic> is the charge of an electron). <bold>b</bold> Electron density plots of BCN with the electric field around B–N bond; the isosurface contours reveal discontinuity in electron density between the N (negative charged) and B (positive charged) atoms. <bold>c</bold> Orbital density images of C atoms in BCN. <bold>d</bold> HOMO and <bold>e</bold> LUMO of isolated Co atom supported on BCN. <bold>f</bold> PDOS plot of BN-2<italic>p</italic> and C-2<italic>p</italic> orbitals. <bold>g</bold> PDOS plot of Co-3<italic>d</italic> orbitals; the peaks were imaged in <bold>d</bold>, <bold>e</bold>.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2020_20619_Fig1_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par9">Moreover, the binding of CAP on BCN is strictly stronger than that on nitrogen-doped carbon (CN) supports due to the additional electric field contributions (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>).

When the CAP was adsorbed on Co SAs/BCN, a strong interaction was observed along with a newly occupied band (P<sub>1′</sub>), resulting from the electrons transferred from the Co-3<italic>d</italic> orbital to the Cl-2<italic>p</italic> orbital (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4a</xref>). To relate the electron redistribution with the bond formation, electron density difference analysis was conducted. For the CAP and Co SAs/BCN complex, enriched electron density was found in the region between Cl and Co, giving rise to the Cl–Co bond (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4c</xref>).

In addition, less chloride ions were detected after 3 h electrolysis on state-of-the-art Pd/C catalyst (50%). To rationally compare the catalytic activity of dechlorination catalysts, their faradaic efficiency (FE) of chloride ions were calculated.

The effect of initial pH on CAP dechlorination was also examined. Co SAs/BCN in neutral solutions outperformed those under the acidic and basic conditions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>), which is beneficial for practical treatment of real wastewater. Subsequently, the influence of Co content in the catalyst was investigated in the subsequent tests (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">18a–b</xref>).

Co SAs/BCN-H showed the similar performance with Co SAs/BCN and achieved almost 100% chlorine removal by half hour early.

As the Co site is believed to be the catalytic active center, Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref> and Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">34</xref> show the calculated free energy diagrams and geometric structures in the dechlorination pathway on the Co site with the reasonable position (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">32</xref>). Generally, the reductive dechlorination of CAP involves concerted proton–electron transfer steps through heterolytic cleavage on surface metal sites, generating different intermediate adsorbates (the asterisk (*) denotes the surface site). At the same time, the HER was also considered since it might be the major competitive reaction (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">22</xref>). The initial step of HER is H adsorption (* + H<sup>+</sup> + e<sup>−</sup> → H*), which would block the catalyst surface and hinders CAP adsorption. However, in the same potential range, there was no significant current of HER and no signal of H* desorption on the CV with the Co SAs/BCN electrode (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">23b</xref>). This result indicates that the Co SAs/BCN was not beneficial to generate H*. Nevertheless, the Co SAs/BCN electrode showed a higher dechlorination capability and CAP conversion efficiency than the Pd/C electrode (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">25</xref>). Thus the dechlorination on the Co SAs/BCN electrode was independent on H*, which is different from the traditional hydrodechlorination mechanism on the Pd/C electrode. Moreover, the suppressed H* generation markedly inhibited the dechlorination performance on the Pd/C electrode (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>) but had no effect on the dechlorination capability of the Co SAs/BCN (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h</xref>, detailed description is given in Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). At potential <italic>U</italic> = 0 V, Co SAs/BCN showed a selective adsorption of CAP* (−2.66 eV) over H* (−0.46 eV). For the subsequent conversion, the potential limiting step was suggested to be the removal of the adsorbed chloride ion after breaking C–Cl bond of CAP. Therefore, to drive the limiting step into thermodynamically feasible process, external potential was applied. At potential <italic>U</italic> = −1.63 V, each step of CAP dechlorination became spontaneous on Co SAs/BCN. The adsorption of CAP* was still preferred to H* (−2.09 eV), resulting in a dominant dechlorination reaction. On the other hand, the energy difference between CAP adsorption and H adsorption (i.e., <italic>E</italic><sub>CAP*</sub> − <italic>E</italic><sub>H*</sub>) demonstrates as a reasonable descriptor of CAP reduction selectivity. More negative <italic>E</italic><sub>CAP*</sub> − <italic>E</italic><sub>H*</sub> corresponds to a higher selectivity toward CAP reduction. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>, Co SAs/BCN exhibits more negative <italic>E</italic><sub>CAP*</sub> − <italic>E</italic><sub>H*</sub> in comparison with Co SAs/CN and BCN, consistent with the experimentally improved selectivity.

During the nitro group reduction (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">29a</xref>), the CAP adsorption makes the orientation of NO<sub>2</sub> group toward Co active site with a binding energy of −1.826 eV, followed by the first hydrogenation step of NO<sub>2</sub> group coupled with electron transfer (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">24b–e</xref>). The subsequent dissociation of OH forms the intermediate with NO group. The Co SAs/BCN presents a higher activation capability of the first N–O bond, which is the critical step in further reductive hydrogenation of nitro group. After the nitro group reduction, the dechlorination process is carried out via formatting a Co–Cl bond according to the heterolytic cleavage coupled with electron transfer (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">29b</xref>). The results show that the free energy profiles of the first cleavage of C–Cl bond on the Co SAs/BCN become downhill with the most released energy (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">24f–j</xref>), which could be used to drive the subsequent elementary reactions, indicating that dechlorination is more favorable on the Co SAs/BCN.

The hard X-ray was monochromatized with Si (111) double crystals. The acquired EXAFS data were extracted and processed according to the standard procedures using the ATHENA module implemented in the IFEFFIT software packages. The k3-weighted EXAFS spectra were obtained by subtracting the post-edge background from the overall absorption and then normalizing with respect to the edge-jump step. Subsequently, k3-weighted <italic>χ</italic>(<italic>k</italic>) data in the <italic>k</italic>-space ranging from 2.5 to 11.2 Å<sup>−1</sup> were Fourier transformed to real (<italic>R</italic>) space using a Hanning window (dK = 1.0 Å<sup>−1</sup>) to separate the EXAFS contributions from different coordination shells.

An H-type electrochemical cell was employed with cathode cell (100 ml) and anode cell (100 ml) separated by the proton exchange membrane (Nafion-117, Du Pont). A platinum wire of 0.5 mm diameter was used as the counter electrode. All potentials were measured against a saturated Ag/AgCl reference electrode. A glassy carbon electrode (GCE) of 3 mm diameter was used as the working electrode for CV measurements. Before catalyst modification, the GCE was well polished with 0.05 μm alumina slurry. The carbon fiber paper (CFP, thickness 0.28 mm, TGP-H-090, Toray) was used as the working electrode for constant-potential electrolysis. Catalyst ink was prepared by dispersing 2 mg of catalyst material in a mixture of 50 μl of 5 wt.% Nafion solution, 200 μl of DI water, and 300 μl of ethanol with the assistance of sonication. An aliquot of 6 μl of the catalyst ink was applied onto the GCE and allowed to dry in air, giving a catalyst loading of 0.34 mg cm<sup>−2</sup>. By drop-drying of 200 μl of the catalyst ink on CFP (1.0 cm × 2.5 cm), the loading was 0.32 mg cm<sup>−2</sup>.
