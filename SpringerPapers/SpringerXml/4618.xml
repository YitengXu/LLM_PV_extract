Although metal oxide semiconductors have been investigated for their promise to resist oxidative attack, materials in this class can suffer from chemical and photochemical instability. Here we present a methodology for evaluating corrosion mechanisms and apply it to bismuth vanadate, a state-of-the-art photoanode. Analysis of changing morphology and composition under solar water splitting conditions reveals chemical instabilities that are not predicted from thermodynamic considerations of stable solid oxide phases, as represented by the Pourbaix diagram for the system. Computational modelling indicates that photoexcited charge carriers accumulated at the surface destabilize the lattice, and that self-passivation by formation of a chemically stable surface phase is kinetically hindered. Although chemical stability of metal oxides cannot be assumed, insight into corrosion mechanisms aids development of protection strategies and discovery of semiconductors with improved stability.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Metal oxide semiconductors are promising materials for solar energy capture but can suffer from stability problems.

However, harnessing light to split water involves thermodynamic and kinetic challenges, with major efficiency losses associated with oxygen production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Furthermore, material stability is often poor under the harsh conditions in which this reaction is performed. Therefore, much attention has been devoted to the development of <italic>n</italic>-type thin film semiconductors that are chemically stable, can efficiently harvest sunlight and can oxidize water when coupled to appropriate catalysts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Among available candidates for photoanodes, metal oxides are a promising class of potentially durable materials, as they are usually less readily oxidized than water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, many of the most stable metal oxide semiconductors possess wide bandgaps that render them impractical for solar energy conversion. Thus, a central challenge is the discovery and development of new semiconductors that are stable and have bandgaps suitable for efficiently capturing solar energy. In recent times, the quest for such materials has been accelerated by advances in high-throughput computation for prediction of electronic structure and thermodynamic stability of semiconductors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Understanding the present limits of such computational approaches and improving their ability to predict the complex behaviours of real materials requires direct comparison with experiments using known semiconductors.</p><p id="Par4">Although thermodynamic considerations provide a starting point for evaluating (photo)electrochemical stability of materials under the conditions present in solar fuel generators, kinetic factors can also play a dominant role on achievable operational durability. Indeed, some materials exhibit chemical instabilities that cannot be explained by thermodynamic considerations alone. One such material is BiVO<sub>4</sub>, which has been actively investigated as one of the highest performance oxide photoanodes for water splitting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. This material has garnered significant interest, because it absorbs in the visible range, with a bandgap of 2.5 eV (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>), and has conduction and valence band positions—∼4.77 and 7.27 eV below the vacuum level, respectively—that are well-suited for generating large photovoltages and driving the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The calculated oxidation potential of BiVO<sub>4</sub> has been predicted to be slightly more positive (1.24 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) than the water oxidation potential (O<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O, 1.23 V versus RHE), suggesting that this material could be resistant to photoinduced corrosion under water splitting conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In contrast to this prediction, this material suffers from photoelectrochemical instability in both near-neutral and alkaline pH ranges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Although photocorrosion of BiVO<sub>4</sub> has been correlated with vanadium leaching from the surface into the electrolyte solution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, the mechanisms of photodegradation and the associated chemical transformations have not yet been identified. This poor stability undermines its practical use in large-scale integrated devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">In this work, we establish a methodology for systematically assessing the chemical and photochemical stabilities of semiconductors and apply it to a visible-light-absorbing semiconductor, BiVO<sub>4</sub>. We investigate chemical and photochemical corrosion pathways using BiVO<sub>4</sub> thin films at near-neutral and at high pH, thereby simulating possible operating conditions in solar fuel devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. These measurements demonstrate that BiVO<sub>4</sub> is susceptible to chemical corrosion that is accelerated by illumination (photodegradation). Electron microscopy indicates that photodegradation initiates at and propagates from surfaces and grain boundaries, resulting in extensive dissolution of the films. Given the existence of thermodynamically stable bismuth oxides predicted by Pourbaix diagrams under these conditions, formation of a chemically stable surface layer was expected but not observed. Therefore, bulk dissolution of the film cannot be described by thermodynamic arguments. This finding is confirmed by <italic>in situ</italic> electrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC-AFM), which reveals that degradation under operating conditions occurs via dissolution of the film, starting at exposed facets of grains in polycrystalline thin films. To understand this chemical behaviour, we use computational methods to examine both the illuminated and dark stability. This analysis indicates that accumulation of photogenerated holes at the surface leads to structural destabilization and chemical attack via vanadium loss into solution. Although self-passivation of the material with bismuth oxide would be expected, thermodynamically stable phases of this oxide require significant structural transformations from the low-density V-leached state and are not accessible at room temperature. Therefore, photocorrosion results in bulk dissolution of the material. Our measurements reveal that non-equilibrium and kinetic factors dominate chemical and photochemical degradation processes for this commonly studied semiconductor material, and these factors must be considered for prediction of new materials that possess desired combinations of stability and efficiency. Furthermore, the kinetic accessibility of self-passivating surface layers, which broaden the range of available corrosion protection strategies, must be considered for engineering the interfaces of materials possessing lower intrinsic stability.

Notably, etching progresses approximately uniformly from all three solid/liquid interfaces. In addition, the height histogram from Region 1 reveals that simultaneous etching occurs from the exposed top surface. In contrast, Region 2 has just one solid/liquid interface, which runs diagonally across the upper left portion of the region, exposed directly to electrolyte. Importantly, solid/solid boundaries that are present within this region do not appear to be specific sites for chemical attack. Analysis of the corresponding height histogram supports this interpretation, in which an approximately bimodal distribution is observed, with low and high values corresponding to the substrate and the BiVO<sub>4</sub> grain, respectively. Region 3 exhibits no solid/liquid interfaces and is instead characterized by the presence of solid/solid grain boundaries, along with the exposed top surface of the central grain. Thus, this region is more protected from chemical attack and corrosion occurs almost exclusively from the top surface. As corrosion propagates from the top surface, the distribution of heights shifts monotonically towards smaller values.</p><p id="Par26">Based on these <italic>in</italic>-<italic>situ</italic> EC-AFM measurements, we can conclude that corrosion of the material initiates predominantly from solid/liquid interfaces. We find no indication for selective etching of localized regions, such as at secondary phases at grain boundaries, or undercutting of the film at its interface to the FTO substrate. However, as these polycrystalline films are not completely compact, the evolution of morphology depends strongly on local geometry. Voids in intergrain regions act as sites for more rapid chemical attack, whereas adjacent grains in intimate physical contact with one another are partially protected. For those regions that are characterized by multiple solid/liquid interfaces, increases of the microscopic surface to volume ratio as etching progresses could lead to accelerated corrosion (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>).

As shown in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>, BiVO<sub>4</sub> is stable in a large region with pH values from 1 to 11 and at the electrochemical potentials within the water stability region. Unfortunately, at potentials close to the oxygen evolution potential, BiVO<sub>4</sub> is no longer thermodynamically stable.

However, although our XPS experiments indicate some Bi enrichment at the surface following extended dark stability testing, we also detect the presence of Bi ions in the supporting electrolyte and conclusively observe that bulk dissolution of the BiVO<sub>4</sub> occurs and self-passivation does not impede corrosion. This experimental result indicates that the thermodynamic equilibrium between the solid and liquid is not established. Indeed, a self-passivated surface of BiVO<sub>4</sub> would require formation of a more stable Bi–O surface phase (for example, Bi<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub> as seen at higher potentials and pH). However, the vanadium to bismuth content in BiVO<sub>4</sub> is 1:1, which means that 50% of the cations will dissolve, rendering the resulting Bi–O framework highly defective and unstable. Formation of a stable bismuth oxide or hydroxide would require significant structural rearrangement, which may be kinetically hindered under room-temperature aqueous conditions. Given these considerations, we can visualize the scenario in which structural rearrangement to form a passivating oxide on the solid surface is kinetically unfavourable by artificially removing all solid Bi-oxide phases above the OER potential (in this case, Bi<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub> and Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) from the set of phases included in the construction of the Pourbaix diagram. The result is shown in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>, where we observe that only ions exist in the aqueous solution in the entire pH range above the OER potential. This result reveals that thermodynamic considerations cannot describe the observed dark stability of BiVO<sub>4</sub> thin films. Rather, kinetic limitations associated with room-temperature structural rearrangements of corrosion products must be considered. Such a mechanism for kinetically inaccessible self-passivation is expected to be increasingly important for complex, multi-component oxides. Computational evaluation of possible kinetically hindered surface transformations may be essential for predicting the real world stabilities of novel compounds and for designing strategies for overcoming chemical instabilities.</p><p id="Par29">In addition to the dark chemical instability of BiVO<sub>4</sub> thin films, our experimental results indicate that dissolution of the material in water is accelerated by illumination, as well as anodic biasing to 1.23 V versus RHE. These findings suggest that accumulation of photogenerated holes at the surface of BiVO<sub>4</sub> promotes photocorrosion. Furthermore, we note that previous studies have found that integration of a catalyst on the surface can suppress photocorrosion and enhance long-term stability of BiVO<sub>4</sub> (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>), even for the case of porous and ion-permeable catalysts, such as CoPi and FeO(OH), which do not physically isolate the semiconductor from the electrolyte environment. This suggests that efficient extraction of photogenerated holes from the near-surface region reduces chemical attack of the material.</p><p id="Par30">Given these observations of photoinduced chemical instability, we consider the role of surface-accumulated holes under photoexcitation, as well as the strongly oxidative conditions present with the production of reactive oxygen species (for example, OH<sup>·</sup> and O<sup>−</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, on the stability of BiVO<sub>4</sub>. The valence band maximum, where photogenerated holes accumulate, consists of considerable Bi 6<italic>s</italic> orbital character, hybridized with O 2<italic>p</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>). In prior theoretical work, Kweon and Hwang<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> showed that large polaron holes are the stable positive charge carriers within the monoclinic phase of this material, and that, at the surface, holes localize to BiO<sub>6</sub> polyhedra, with 22% of hole charge density on Bi cations and an average of 8% of hole charge density on each of the six O anions in the polyhedron, with balance of charge located outside of the polyhedron. Therefore, we first consider the impact of the modified charge density around Bi ions due to hole localization on stability. To this end, we hypothesize the scenario that brings Bi<sup>3+</sup> to Bi<sup>5+</sup>+2e<sup>−</sup> in BiVO<sub>4</sub>, as Bi<sup>5+</sup> is a potentially stable oxidation state for Bi, whereas Bi<sup>4+</sup> is uncommon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. To obtain a plausible structure representing a Bi<sup>5+</sup>/V<sup>5+</sup> compound or film, we use the Materials Project structure predictor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> to predict a new oxide compound containing only Bi<sup>5+</sup> and V<sup>5+</sup> valence states. By calculating the stability of an optimized bulk Bi<sup>5+</sup> and V<sup>5+</sup> oxide, we can obtain a qualitative picture of the stability of such a configuration in an oxide framework. The structure predictor algorithm searches for the most suitable structure among all known structures found in the ICSD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> for the target ions and valence states (in this case, Bi<sup>5+</sup> and V<sup>5+</sup>) through a data-mining approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. The resulting structure is shown in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>. From our calculations, the projected density of states show that the Bi 6<italic>s</italic> orbitals are very strongly hybridized with the O 2<italic>p</italic> orbitals, both in the valence band and conduction band (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>). Considering that the magnetic moment is zero in the system, it is confirmed that Bi and V in BiVO<sub>5</sub> are both in 5+ oxidation states. A new phase diagram for the Bi–V–O system is generated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM41">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>) and it is found that BiVO<sub>5</sub> is unstable by 0.215 eV per atom towards oxygen release. This large above-hull energy, defined as the energy of unstable phases, strongly indicates that the thermodynamic driving force for BiVO<sub>5</sub> to decompose into BiVO<sub>4</sub> and ½ O<sub>2</sub> is significant. One of the reasons for the instability of BiVO<sub>5</sub> is that the small ionic radius of Bi<sup>5+</sup> is not compatible with the BiO<sub>8</sub> structure motif in the crystal. These results suggest that any photo-induced oxidation event on Bi is likely to further destabilize the compound and increase the rate of corrosion under operating conditions, due to an effective Bi–O bond strain in the presence of Bi<sup>5+</sup>.</p><p id="Par31">In addition to hole localization on Bi ions, we also consider the impact of oxidation of O<sup>2−</sup> to O<sup>−</sup> at the surface of BiVO<sub>4</sub>. Such a process has been implicated in the photocorroison mechanism of, for example, ZnO, where it has been proposed that degradation proceeds through hole trapping at oxygen surface sites to yield formation of O<sup>−</sup> intermediate that results in irreversible loss of oxygen from the lattice as O<sub>2</sub> and consequent release of Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions in the solution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Although the charge density of surface-accumulated holes has been predicted to be higher at Bi cations than O anions, such a mechanism is not precluded. Furthermore, the energetic position of the valence band maximum of BiVO<sub>4</sub>, at ∼7.27 eV below the vacuum level, renders formation of radical OH<sup>·</sup> species, as found by Bard and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Participation of such radicals in the oxygen loss processes described above may serve to further accelerate photocorrosion, in particular at high pH.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par32">We demonstrate that polycrystalline BiVO<sub>4</sub> thin films are susceptible to chemical and photochemical corrosion. Indeed, chemical attack of the semiconductor is observed under all aqueous testing conditions and is accelerated by illumination, increasing pH and applied anodic bias. Although RBS reveals near-stoichiometric composition in the bulk of as-deposited thin films, XPS indicates a non-stoichiometric composition at the surface that is affected by exposure to electrolyte. Observation of film dissolution in real time by EC-AFM indicates that chemical attack propagates approximately uniformly from exposed solid/liquid interfaces. Therefore, there is no indication of preferential chemical attack at specific regions or at crystal facets of grains, but consumption rate is dependent on local solid/liquid interface morphology. In contrast to thermodynamic predictions, self-passivation of BiVO<sub>4</sub> by the formation of a chemically stable Bi oxide surface phase is not observed and bulk dissolution of films occurs on extended exposure to aqueous electrolytes. We attribute the bulk chemical instability to kinetic factors that limit room-temperature structural transformation of the V-deficient degradation product into a stable Bi oxide phase. In addition, photoexcitation results in accumulation of holes at the surface of BiVO<sub>4</sub> that destabilize the lattice and increase the dissolution rate.</p><p id="Par33">Mechanistic insights into the chemical and photochemical instability of BiVO<sub>4</sub> can be used to guide approaches to stabilization and aid the search for active catalysts and functional interfaces that can improve durability for sustained operation. For example, efficient transfer of holes to catalyst on the surface will dramatically reduce the corrosion rate. However, unless this catalyst layer is dense and impermeable, long-term durability may be limited by the native dark chemical stability of the material and self-passivation cannot be assumed. We note that introduction of surface layers that reduce the corrosion rate and enable time for structural reorganization of the surface before dissolution might promote self-passivation and kinetically stabilize the material. Beyond BiVO<sub>4</sub>, the methodology presented here can be applied for rigorous investigation of the stabilities of new and emerging functional materials under operating conditions. Identification of kinetic limitations to self-passivation points to a new set of factors that should be considered in the experimental and computational search for stable, visible-light-absorbing semiconductors for photoelectrochemical energy conversion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Fabrication of BiVO<sub>4</sub> thin film photoelectrodes</title><p id="Par34">Spin-coated bismuth vanadate thin films were prepared using a procedure adapted from the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.
