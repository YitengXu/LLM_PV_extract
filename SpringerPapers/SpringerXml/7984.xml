Therefore, we derived four recombinant inbred line (RIL) tomato populations from parents with contrasting growth responses to different light spectra. These RIL populations were grown for four weeks under supplemental HPS or 95% red and 5% blue LED light in the greenhouse. For one population we also studied fruit production. Plant height and size of the side shoots of the young plants were strongly reduced under LED supplemental lighting compared to HPS in all populations. The adult plants showed shorter internode lengths, less trusses, less fruits, and lower yield of ripe fruits per plant under LED. However, when the unripe fruits at the last harvest day were included, the difference in yield between HPS and LED disappeared, indicating that the plants under LED light were compacter and slower in development, but in the end produced similar yield. We found numerous QTL, but hardly any of these QTL appeared to be significantly LED-specific. Also, we found very significant genetic effects of maternally inherited plastids and mitochondria, showing the importance of using a parental genotype as mother or as father. However, these effects were very similar between the two light conditions. We conclude that our study does not justify tomato breeding programs that are specifically targeted at 95% red and 5% blue LED supplemental lighting.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>LED</kwd><kwd>HPS</kwd><kwd>QTL</kwd><kwd>Maternally inherited plastids</kwd><kwd>Tomato</kwd><kwd>Side shoots</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Stichting voor de Technische Wetenschappen</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003958</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">14211</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marcelis</surname><given-names>Leo F.

climates with long winter periods of low light and low temperature requires greenhouses with supplemental lighting. Those are not only costly for the grower but also leave a large ecologic footprint due to the energy usage. The supplemental light is often provided by High Pressure Sodium (HPS) lamps that emit a warm, relatively broad light spectrum that proved favourable for many plant species. However, HPS lamps consume considerable amounts of energy. Narrow band Light-Emitting Diodes (LED) -lamps could be an alternative as these consume far less energy for the same light output (Gómez and Mitchell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2015</xref>; Kaiser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2019</xref>). By providing the plants with a narrow spectrum of supplemental lighting, the lighting energy can be focussed on a more efficiently used light spectrum (Paradiso et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2011</xref>). Tomato plants grown in climate rooms under red and blue (RB) LED lighting had a higher CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate than under white light from fluorescent tubes (Arena et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2016</xref>). However, the plants in the study of Arena et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2016</xref>) had, despite the higher CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate, in RB-light a lower biomass compared to the white light control.</p><p id="Par3">Light composition not only influences photosynthesis and biomass accumulation, but influences plant performance in many other ways: The concentration of soluble sugars is influenced by the quality of the light regime (Lanoue et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2017</xref>) which in turn is involved in oxidative stress signalling (Couée et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2006</xref>) and metabolic regulation (Smeekens et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2010</xref>). Photoreceptors, like phytochromes, influence flowering time (Strasser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2010</xref>; Cao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2015</xref>), and root and leaf growth (Rao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2011</xref>; Costigan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2011</xref>). The light regime under which plants grow also affects secondary metabolites (Carvalho and Folta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2014</xref>) and thereby could indirectly influence quality traits and disease resistance.</p><p id="Par4">The genotype by environment interaction is important in the selection of the optimal spectral composition for a crop. Next to species specific responses (Bantis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2018</xref>), natural variation for light responses was also identified between different tomato accessions (Ouzounis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2016</xref>). In tomato, quantitative trait loci (QTL) for plant architecture that could influence light absorption in the canopy were identified (Nakano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2016</xref>; Fulop et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2016</xref>) and also QTL for photosynthetic traits (Oyanedel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2000</xref>; de Oliveira Silva et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2018</xref>) but light spectrum differences were not taken into account. Velez-Ramirez et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2014</xref>) identified a QTL for continuous light tolerance in tomato and developed from this a genotype that showed up to 20% higher yield when grown under continuous light. This study from Velez-Ramirez et al. is thus an example for the possibilities of genetic adjustments for light use efficiency in tomato. Nonetheless, there are, as far as we know, no QTL studies in tomato looking at light spectrum effects. Therefore, we aimed at identification of QTL that are LED or HPS specific.</p><p id="Par5">Chloroplasts are critical in light perception and photosynthesis, and mitochondria are important for energy use. Chlorplasts and mitochondria are inherited from the mother, and contain their own genomes, and can thereby contribute to the genetic variation (Gray <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1993</xref>). Therefore, we did not focus on genetic effects located in nuclei only (the QTL), but in addition we studied the effects of maternally inherited plastids and mitochondria. For this purpose, we made reciprocal crosses when developing F1 hybrids. Per combination of parents, half of the RILs were derived from F1 plants from Parent A x Parent B, whereas the other half of the RILs was derived from an F1 from the reciprocal cross Parent B × Parent A. As a result, the first half of the RILs from this population harboured the plastids and mitochondria from Parent A, and the other half of the RILs contained the plastids from Parent B. We did this for all four RIL populations, leading to eight sub-populations.</p><p id="Par6">We wondered if it makes sense to specifically optimize modern cultivars for LED supplemental lighting, by identification of LED specific QTL that could be used during breeding. We used tomato as a representative species for this study as tomato is often grown in protected conditions. We started the study by investigating the natural variation among light responses of 40 genotypes in climate rooms, focussing on the effects of red, blue and white LED light on biomass and physiological traits of these genotypes. Genotypes were selected with contrasting light reactions, crosses were made between these contrasting genotypes, and subsequently four different RIL populations were developed. We included reciprocal crosses, as these allowed the study of effects from maternally inherited plastids and mitochondria for each RIL population. We grew those populations in greenhouse conditions with supplemental HPS and LED light to identify physiological and morphological trait differences in the two light environments and investigated the underlying genetics by means of QTL mapping. We analysed four RIL populations in three replications in young plant stages and one RIL population of full-grown fruit yielding plants under HPS versus LED supplemental lightning, and genetically mapped plant growth and yield.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>The initial 40 tomato accessions</title><p id="Par7">In an initial experiment 40 tomato genotypes, including cultivars and wild accessions (Supplementary Table S1), were tested for their biomass under different lighting conditions (Ouzounis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2016</xref>; Ji et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2020</xref>). These 40 accessions were grown in climate rooms (Ji et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2020</xref>) with artificial lighting. The plants were pre-grown in potting soil under fluorescent light for seven to nine days after sowing and then transferred to sterile river sand and grown in one of the following LED conditions: white light with additional UVB (ca. 0.16 W m<sup>−2</sup>) and FR (ca 26 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) or R/B LEDs at a 16 h photoperiod (light intensities ca. 130 µmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>). The white light was created with white/red LEDs (GreenPower LED-TL-DR/W-MB-VISN, Philips, The Netherlands), and the additional UVB and FR was provided by Philips GreenPower LED production modules far-red (GreenPower LED -PM-FR-150), cool fluorescent tubes (38 W, Philips) and Philips Broadband TL 20 W/12 RS Ultraviolet-B lamps. The R/B LEDs had 88% red light and 12% blue light (GreenPower LED-PM-DR/B-MB-150, Philips). The temperature and humidity of the climate room were approximately 22 °C and 70%, respectively. Destructive measures for total dry biomass (roots, shoots and leaves) were done three weeks after transplanting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Development of four RIL populations</title><p id="Par8">From the 40 accessions, genotypes were selected that showed contrasting responses to the different light environments. The following four combinations of contrasting genotypes were selected for development of RIL populations: Ailsa Craig (LA2838A) and Kentucky Beefsteak (TR00021) hereafter abbreviated with “A ~ K”; LA1578 (EA00674; <italic>S. pimpinellifolium</italic>) and Rutgers (EA00465; <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic>) “L ~ R”; Moneymaker (CGN14330; <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic>) and Momotaro (Tough Boy; TR0003; <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic>) “Mm ~ Mo”; and Kentucky Beefsteak (TR00021; <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic>) and NunhemsFM001 (<italic>S. lycopersicum</italic>) “K ~ N”. For each of these cross-combinations a reciprocal cross was performed, swapping the two parents, and therefore each RIL population consisted of two subgroups differing in maternally inherited plastids and mitochondria. All individuals of the populations were grown via single seed decent at least to the F5 generation (the Mm ~ Mo RIL population was an F6). The F1 hybrids were made at Wageningen University and Research (WUR), whereas the RIL populations were developed in greenhouses in the Netherlands by Nunhems Netherlands B.V. (BASF Vegetable Seeds), Rijk Zwaan Nederland B.V., and Bejo Zaden B.V. For each subpopulation ca. 75 individual RILs were grown, leading to ca. 150 RILs per QTL analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Growth conditions for the four RIL populations analysed in young stage</title><p id="Par9">For the screening of the RIL populations, the plants were grown in glasshouses at Unifarm, Wageningen University and Research. In each experiment the same set of RILs was grown in parallel in two different compartments, one with HPS supplemental lighting and one with LED supplemental lighting.</p><p id="Par10">Plants for both supplemental light treatments were germinated under HPS-supplemental lighting. Of each genotype ca. 12 seeds were sown. The seeds were placed on stone-wool plugs (Gro Plug, Grodan Rockwool B.V., Roermond, The Netherlands), covered with Agra-Vermiculite (PULL Rhenen, Rhenen, The Netherlands) and a transparent foil for additional humidity for approximately the first five days. The plugs were soaked with nutrient solution: NH<sub>4</sub> 1.2 mM, K 7.2 mM, Ca 4 mM, Mg 1.82 mM, NO<sub>3</sub> 12.4 mM, SO<sub>4</sub> 3.32 mM, P 1 mM, Fe 35 μM (as mixture of Fe‐DTPA/Fe‐EDDHSA), Mn 8 μM, Zn 5 μM, B 20 μM, Cu 0.5 μM and Mo 0.5 μM. The macronutrients were provided as a mixture of fertilizers from Yara Benelux BV (Rotterdam–Vlaardingen, The Netherlands) and the micronutrients were from the Agrispoor product line of Horticoop BV (Bleiswijk, The Netherlands). The pH was between 5.5 and 5.8 (adjusted with KOH) and the EC was approximately 2.0 dS m<sup>−1</sup>.</p><p id="Par11">Seedlings with fully expanded cotyledons were selected for transfer after one week. The plants were transferred to 10 cm × 10 cm × 6 cm stone-wool blocks (Grodan Delta, Grodan Rockwool B.V., Roermond, The Netherlands). Upon transfer the plants were divided among the two compartments, one with supplemental HPS-lighting (Master green power, cgt 400 W, Philips) and one with supplemental DR/LB LED-lighting (Green Power LED top lighting module DR/B LB, 190 W, Philips).</p><p id="Par12">The light spectra of the lamps were measured (Supplementary Fig. S1) with a Field Spectroradiometer (SS-110, Apogee Instruments, Logan, UT, USA) and PSS values calculated according to the method of Sager et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1988</xref>). For the analysis, blue light over the wavelength range 400–500 nm, green over 500–600 nm, red over 600–700 nm and FR over 700–800 nm were considered (individual intensity measures per wavelength were used for the average if above 0.05 µmol s<sup>−1</sup> m<sup>−2</sup>). Percentages of those wavelengths in the spectrum were compared to the overall intensity in the PAR range from 400 to 800 nm and rounded to 5% intervals. To shield the experiment from light of adjacent compartments, the walls of the compartments were covered with white horticultural foil. The supplemental light intensity was about 200 µmol s<sup>−1</sup> m<sup>−2</sup> (in a wavelength range from 400 to 700 nm) during 16 h, starting 16 h before sunset each day. The compartments were heated and set to an air temperature of 22 °C during the supplemental lighting period and of 19 °C outside the supplemental lighting time. Climate data inside the greenhouse were measured by a climate box (PT500 Temp./RH sensor, Hoogendoorn Automatisering) every 20 s and averaged over 5 min intervals. The incoming solar light and other environmental factors were recorded and averaged over time (Supplementary Table S2). The solar light was measured on top of the greenhouse. Eight light measurements (light meter LI-250A from LI-COR) inside the empty greenhouse were taken at the approximate plant height on one day. With this data a coefficient between incoming light and the light measured on top of the glasshouse was calculated to estimate the incoming solar light for all experiments. In case the solar radiation (in the third and fourth experiment) outside the greenhouse was above 200 W m<sup>−2</sup>, an energy screen (Harmony 4215 O FR) was closed above the lamps in the greenhouse (leading to 42% less light at 100% screen-closure, the light-coefficient was adapted accordingly). For the mature plants the intensity of the solar light received by the plants was estimated using the measured solar radiation outside the greenhouse and a transmissivity factor of 0.62 (based on previous measurements). In addition, the measured solar radiation was reduced to 47%, as this is the approximate amount of photosynthetically active photon flux density in the solar radiation; and then assuming that 1 W m<sup>−2</sup> solar light equals 4.57 µmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> the conversion into µmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> was done (McCree <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1972</xref>; Britton and Dodd <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1976</xref>).</p><p id="Par13">The RILs of the populations L ~ R, A ~ K and Mm ~ Mo were grown together in three, repeated experiments between October 2018 and March 2019 with one replicate per RIL and experiment, giving three replicates in time. The population A ~ N was grown in one experiment in March/April 2019 with three replicates per RIL simultaneously. The seven parents of those RIL populations were grown in each experiment with four replicates. The first experiment was harvested 5 weeks after sowing and the consecutive three experiments were harvested in week 4 after sowing. The individual plants of each experiment were divided into four batches and sown on four consecutive days each on one ebb-and-flood table. Destructive measurements were performed during four consecutive days as well, so that the growth-period was the same for all plants. All plants were distributed in a randomized design over the four tables. For the first three experiments the tables were divided into four areas (front, back and two middle parts of the rectangular tables) for the randomization pattern with similar numbers of plants from each RIL-population and reciprocal cross per area. From the parents one replicate was grown per table. The parents used for one population were situated close to each other on each table.</p><p id="Par14">Plants were watered by flushing the stone-wool blocks for 5 min with nutrient solution (see above) on the ebb- and flood-tables.

The measurement was done four or five weeks after sowing on the second or third leaflet of a fully expanded leaf that was as much as possible perpendicular to the light. Measurements were done between 09.00 and 14.00 o’clock, alternating between the HPS supplemental light and LED supplemental light greenhouses approximately every 30 min (measuring batches of the same 22 genotypes in both HPS and LED supplemental lighting).

In the axil of the true leaves (TL), side shoots developed in most genotypes. The numbers of true leaves and side shoots were counted separately from the second experiment onwards. The leaf/shoot-structures were counted in case they were longer than ca. 5 mm and the total respective fresh weights per plant determined. Final leaf area (of true leaves and side-shoots) was determined with an area meter (Li-cor, LI-3100C Area Meter, Li-cor Inc., Lincoln, Nebraska, USA). True leaves, side shoots and stems were put into separate paper bags and placed into a ventilated oven at 70 °C for 24 h followed by 105 °C for 24 h, after which the dry weight was measured (in the first experiment the side shoot and true leaf dry weight was determined together, in all the following experiments separately). The specific leaf area (SLA) was determined as the ratio between leaf area and leaf dry weight.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Growth conditions of the fruiting RIL population</title><p id="Par17">For the phenotyping of fruits of the RIL population “K ~ N” (‘Kentucky Beefsteak’ ~ NunhemsFM001) the plants were grown in glasshouses of Unifarm (Wageningen University and Research). The plants were sown in September 2020. The RIL population was chosen for the similar sizes and weights of their fruits of its parental lines, as well as the resistance to tomato mosaic virus (TMV) of the NunhemsFM001 parent. The plants were pre-grown for four and a half weeks on ebb and flood tables in a greenhouse. If within a 16 h light period the outside global radiation was below 250 W m<sup>−2</sup>, the natural light was supplemented with approximately 100 µmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> HPS light. Subsequently, the plants were divided among two compartments of 12 m by 12 m each at a plant density of approximately 2.2 plants per m<sup>2</sup>. For avoidance of border effects, at each side of the greenhouse a border row of plants was grown. In both compartments about 220 µmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> supplemental lighting was applied of either HPS in one compartment (Master green power, cgt 400 W, Philips) or 95% red and 5% blue LEDs (Green Power LED top lighting module DR/B LB, 190 W, Philips) in the other compartment. The light was measured ca 2.5 m over ground which was the height of the canopy top. The plants were kept at a height of approximately 2.5 m in order to keep 1 m of distance to the lamps above, and obtain equal light distribution. The duration of supplemental light was gradually increased, starting at five hours one month after sowing and reaching a maximum of 15 h of supplemental HPS/LED light per day from four months after sowing onwards.</p><p id="Par18">Stone-wool (Rockwool Grodan B.V., Roermond, The Netherlands) was used as planting medium, and the plants were drip-irrigated using the same nutrient solution as for the young plants. The EC of the nutrient solution in the stone wool slab was on average 3.8 ds m<sup>−1</sup> under HPS versus 3.2 ds m<sup>−1</sup> under LED. The compartments were heated if the temperature dropped below ca. 22 °C (in a later stage of the experiment 24 °C) during the supplemental lighting period or 19 °C outside the supplemental lighting time. In compartment with LED supplemental lighting, heating pipes below the plants and above the lamps were used, to compensate for the heat irradiance from the HPS lamps. The HPS compartment was only heated by pipes below the plants. For pollination we used bumblebees (Koppert, biological systems). Harvesting and measurements started in week 17 after sowing and continued up until week 28. In each compartment the same set of 136 RILs was grown with one replicate each, as well as 11 replicates of each parent of the RIL population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Growth abnormalities in the young RIL populations</title><p id="Par19">The RIL populations were grown under two different supplemental lighting conditions in the greenhouse, under standard HPS lighting and R/B supplemental LED lighting. In some plants the formation of callus like structures starting at the veins on the abaxial side of leaves, called intumescence, was observed in both supplemental lighting conditions (Supplementary Fig. S2). Although all populations had individual plants with light intumescence symptoms (Williams et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2016</xref>), in some populations the occurrence was more severe. Intumescence was scored from 0 (no intumescence) to 3 (most of the leaves affected) and because this invasive physiological trait could affect other measured traits, genotypes that had a score of 2 and above were excluded from further analysis (0.1–19.2% of all individual plants, depending on the population).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Measuring fruit traits</title><p id="Par20">The number of fruit trusses was counted on week 17 and week 25 after sowing. The fruit trusses were labelled in order of development, starting at truss number 1. The number of fruits were counted on week 17 and week 25 after sowing as well. Internode length was measured once during the trial on week 17 after sowing. This length was measured in centimetres from the third truss to the fifth truss. Fruit fresh weight was measured throughout the trial with intervals of three to four days between measurements, with the measurements starting in week 17 and ending in week 28 after sowing. The fresh fruits were measured from the breaker stage and onwards. This breaker stage is defined as the phase at which the fruit starts developing orange/red colour on its surface skin. During the last harvest during week 28 after sowing, all fruits were collected, including the non-ripe ones. By adding the weight of all unripe fruits per plant to the yield of ripe fruits of that plant, a total fruit yield (both ripe and unripe) was calculated per plant. By taking the number of fruits per plant into account, the average fruit weight per plant was obtained. Dry weight was measured for fruits from the 3rd and the 5th truss. This was done by cutting the fruits and subsequent drying the cut pieces in a ventilated oven for the first 12 h at 70 °C and followed for at least 84 h at 105 °C. Subsequently the weight of the dried fruit was determined.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Genotyping of the RIL populations</title><p id="Par21">The four RIL populations were genotyped by Bejo Zaden B.V., Rijk Zwaan B.V, and Nunhems Nederlands B.V.

The average inter-marker spacing across all chromosomes was 4.8 cM, 5.7 cM, 7.2 cM and 4.7 cM respectively for the four populations (calculated with the summary.map function of RQTL). The number of markers is similar or higher compared to other recent publications that determined QTL in tomato (Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2016</xref>; Wen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par22">A Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to determine the significance of the light condition or reciprocal cross effect on the individual populations, using R (version 3.5.0; <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org" ext-link-type="uri">www.r-project.org</ext-link>). Descriptive statistics were done with the R package psych (version 1.8.4; Revelle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2018</xref>). All graphics were made with the R package ggplot2 (version 3.0.0; Wickham <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2016</xref>). For the relative trait value in HPS and LED light, the trimmed mean under LED light, excluding the phenotypically upper 10% and lower 10% of individuals of each population (for A ~ K, L ~ R and Mm ~ Mo over three experiments), was expressed as percentage of the trimmed mean in HPS light (Mean<sub>LED </sub>* 100/Mean<sub>HPS</sub>). For the relative trait range per population, the trimmed average (again with a fraction of 0.1 of extremes trimmed at each end) trait value of the top 10% and bottom 10% plants within each population was calculated, and the difference between those values in percent as (((top–bottom)/top) * 100) was calculated. Equally the relative difference between the sub groups of the RIL population that were derived from the reciprocal crosses were calculated, by comparing the trimmed means per subgroup as ((High<sub>GroupMean </sub>− Low<sub>GroupMean</sub>)/ High<sub>GroupMean</sub>) * 100. A Shapiro–Wilk normality test per condition, population and experiment showed that nearly 2/3 of the trait values were not normally distributed. Broad sense heritability was estimated by using the mean sum of squares values (Mean Sq) from a two-factor ANOVA (type III SS) on the rank-transformed data, that uses the RIL-genotypes and the experiment as main factors or in case of the population “K ~ N” from a single ANOVA with genotype as factor. The ANOVA was done with the R package car (version 3.0–0; Fox and Weisberg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2019</xref>). For the estimation of the heritability, we used the equation H<sup>2</sup> = σ<sup>2</sup><sub>g</sub>/(σ<sup>2</sup><sub>g</sub> + σ<sup>2</sup><sub>e</sub>). The Mean Sq of the residuals was used as environmental variance (σ<sub>e</sub><sup>2</sup>) and ((Mean Sq<sub>RIL-genotype </sub>− Mean Sq<sub>residuals</sub>)/replicate number) gave the genotypic variation (σ<sub>g</sub><sup>2</sup>).

The genetic map was based on the position information from the companies and re-calculated for each RIL population. A single QTL analysis was performed with the non-parametric mapping function for both the young and mature RIL populations, using individual values per experiment as input. However, in case of the young population N ~ K for which all replicates were grown within the same experiment an average value per genotype was used for the QTL analysis.

All permutation tests for LOD-thresholds/penalties were done with 1000 permutations. In the single QTL analysis, the LOD threshold was determined specifically per population, trait and condition. For the multiple QTL analysis, the automated stepwise procedure was used (assuming a maximum of 7 possible QTL) with a penalized LOD score criterion balancing heavy and light interaction penalties. For computational reasons the penalties were calculated based on one trait with a median level heritability under HPS light conditions in the population N ~ K. LED-specific QTL were selected based on the multiple QTL analysis for the young population. For the mature population, these were selected based on the single QTL analysis. For the young population, QTL on the same chromosome were considered different if their approximate 99% Bayes credible intervals did not overlap. The significance of the QTL that were only identified under LED light was verified with an ANOVA for the effect of the allele distribution at the peak-marker on the phenotype under LED light. Also, the allele by light-condition interaction of those LED-specific QTL was assessed with an ANOVA (using the peak marker and the light condition as interacting factors explaining the trait). For both ANOVAs the rank transformed data from the individual plants was used and for the young populations A ~ K, L ~ R and Mm ~ Mo, the experiment number was used as a block factor. The phenotypic mean difference of the two QTL with significant allele by light interaction was tested with a Tukey HSD-test with the package Agricolae (De Mendiburu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Selection of contrasting parental genotypes for the four RIL populations</title><p id="Par25">In an initial study 40 cultivars and wild accessions (Supplementary Table S1) were compared on the basis of their total dry biomass in different light conditions. Contrasts between genotypes in different light conditions were used to select parents for crosses to construct RIL populations. In the two light conditions, i.e. R/B LED light and white LED light with UVB and FR, Moneymaker, Momotaro, Ailsa Craig and Kentucky Beefsteak were among the genotypes with the largest difference in biomass comparing plants growing in white light with plants growing in R/B light. Moneymaker and Kentucky Beefsteak had a higher biomass in R/B while Momotaro and Ailsa Craig had a higher biomass under the white light (Supplementary Fig. S3). In R/B light, Rutgers was among the genotypes with the highest biomass and LA1578 was among the genotypes with the lowest biomass. The genotype NunhemsFM001 had an approximately median biomass under both conditions and one of the smallest differences in biomass between the light treatments. It was in contrast to Kentucky Beefsteak which had one of the largest biomass in R/B light and the largest difference in biomass when compared between the two light environments. Those contrasting genotypes were used to create four RIL populations: Ailsa Craig (LA2838A) and Kentucky Beefsteak (TR00021)), abbreviated as “A ~ K”; LA1578 (<italic>S. pimpinellifolium</italic>) and Rutgers “L ~ R”; Moneymaker and Momotaro “Mm ~ Mo”; and Kentucky Beefsteak and NunhemsFM001 “K ~ N”.

Despite few traits that were most likely more affected by the seasonal changes than by the population, the overall trend between the populations’ average light responses was similar. In all four populations, the plants grown under LED supplemental lighting had on average less biomass, were more compact, darker pigmented and had smaller side shoots with less biomass compared to plants grown under the standard HPS supplemental lighting. Among the different traits, the side shoot size and the height of the plants were lowest in LED light compared to HPS light. The leaf area of the side shoots under LED supplemental lighting was between 65 and 79% of that of plants under HPS lighting, depending on the RIL population. Likewise, the dry weight (DW) of the side shoots under LEDs was considerably lower, being 63% to 85% compared to those under HPS lighting. Moreover, the area and DW of the true leaves was lower under LED (between 84 to 90% of HPS). However, the reduction of the side shoots size and biomass was on average greater than that of the true leaves (TL), as the ratio of side shoots to true leaves was significantly smaller for plants grown under LED light compared to those under HPS (ratio side shoots/TL area, Ratio side shoots/TL DW; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Also the total number of leaves and side shoots was slightly but significantly lower for LED than HPS grown plants. The anthocyanin and flavonol content indices were in all populations between 12 and 50% higher in LED compared to HPS grown plants. Chlorophyll content was in most populations also slightly increased in LED grown plants but overall similar between the conditions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

The rationale behind this was that photosynthesis and energy related processes occur for a large part in chloroplasts and mitochondria. These plant cell organelles are maternally inherited. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows that there was a clear impact of the reciprocal cross group on the evaluated traits, especially on plant size and architecture.

Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows in total 44 putative LED-specific QTL, with LOD scores between 1.4 and 11.3 and an explained variance between 1.8 and 17.2% (Supplementary Fig. S6). We used an ANOVA to evaluate if the allelic effect at the QTL was significantly different for the two light conditions (interaction term in the ANOVA) beyond the overall difference in phenotype caused by the different lights. If the interaction would be significant, the allelic variation at the QTL can be useful for breeding for LED specific conditions. For only two out of those 44 QTL a significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) allele by light interaction was determined i.e., for leaf distance (= internode length) in the population Mm ~ Mo, and for anthocyanin content index in the population A ~ K, although the differential impact was not very strong for these two QTL (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>QTL that were only identified under LED light.

This means that only two small effect QTL were really LED-specific for the young plants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>LED reduced internode length, plant development, and number of fruits per plant, but eventually no yield reduction</title><p id="Par36">For one out of the four RIL populations we also analysed fruit traits, namely for the K ~ N population (Kentucky Beefsteak ~ NunhemsFM001). The reason for selecting this population was that one parent (NunhemsFM001) is a recent variety and its performance represents better modern varieties than old varieties like Moneymaker do. In addition, the parents had similar fruit sizes, i.e. NunhemsFM001 245.48 ± 7.25 g/ fruit and Kentucky Beefsteak 281.95 ± 15.18 g/ fruit under HPS light, which should prevent a very pronounced segregation of fruit size in the RIL population. This is relevant for analysing fruit yield.</p><p id="Par37">We evaluated this fruiting RIL population under LED and HPS supplemental lighting. The population showed significantly (<italic>p</italic> = 0.02) shorter internode lengths under LED compared to HPS supplemental lighting in mature plants, 8% and 18% less trusses respectively in week 17 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.002) and week 25 (<italic>p</italic> = 1.0e−10), 8% and 17% less fruits during these weeks (<italic>p</italic> = 0.018 and 1.2e−05, respectively), and 15% lower yield of ripe fruits per plant (<italic>p</italic> = 5.2e− 07, Figur.8, Supplementary File 3). However, when the unripe fruits at the last harvest day were included, the difference in yield between HPS and LED disappeared, indicating that the plants under LED light were a bit compacter, slower in development, but in the end produced similar yield.</p><p id="Par38">Interestingly, the fraction of dry matter partitioned to the fruits was similar for HPS and LED. Furthermore, the average weight per fruit was 8% higher for LED, which was a significant difference (<italic>p</italic> = 0.035). Apparently, the lower number of fruits per plant under LED was compensated by a somewhat larger fruit size, giving a similar yield eventually.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>High correlations between fruit traits</title><p id="Par39">As expected, the number of trusses per plant in week 17 was highly correlated with the number of trusses in week 25, and highly correlated with the number of fruits per plant during these weeks (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The weight per fruit was very clearly negatively correlated with number of fruits per plant (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). There was a weaker positive correlation between the number of fruits and number of trusses at the one hand, and the total fruit yield (in kg per plant) at the other hand. The table also shows that the number of fruits per plant showed a higher correlation with yield than weight per fruit did. Both, number of trusses and weight per fruit, contribute to yield, but apparently, the number of trusses was a more important driver for yield.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Correlations of traits of adult plants of the N ~ K RIL population</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10681_2022_2981_Fig6_HTML.png" id="MO6"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Several major QTL for fruit traits under LED and HPS, but no convincing LED specific ones</title><p id="Par40">To identify possible LED-specific QTL for the measured traits, a QTL analysis was performed on data from both lighting systems individually.

These five traits are physiologically closely related, showed therefore a high correlation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), and apparently are under control of the same QTL on ch01 and ch11.

The presence of QTL under LED light, and absence of these QTL under HPS light, may indicate LED-specific QTL. To study this in more detail, we mapped the relative differences for these traits between the two lighting conditions, using the expression (<italic>x</italic><sub>LED</sub> − <italic>x</italic><sub>HPS</sub>)/<italic>x</italic><sub>HPS</sub>. However, no light specific QTL were found, neither on ch01, nor on ch11 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>C).

Especially the architectural traits height and side shoot size showed high levels of heritability. Also other studies in tomato found a high heritability for architectural traits, especially height but also to varying degree for number of primary branches (Mohamed et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2012</xref>; Shankar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2013</xref>; Taiana et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2015</xref>). For height, side shoot area, and weight of the young plants, QTL were identified in each population though there is a discrepancy between the explained variance by the QTL and the heritability estimate. This so called missing heritability can be explained by e.g. smaller effect QTL or interactions that are not detected by the analysis (Eichler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010</xref>; Yi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2010</xref>).</p><p id="Par45">Between the young populations the identified QTL were mainly different, reflecting the diverse genetic backgrounds used in this experiment. The parents of the RIL populations were selected according to their diverse light responses and the QTL identified were therefore largely specific to the respective genotypes. Only the populations with one common parent, Kentucky Beefsteak, showed co-locating QTL (for side shoot area and DW). Overall, this suggests a complex regulation of light responses and a large diversity among the evaluated accessions. We believe the series of QTL described in this study is reliable as for three of the four populations, the effect of three experimental replications was taken into account for the analysis and thereby minimizing the random environmental effects that could influence a QTL analysis in only one experiment. In addition, the similarity in QTL pattern (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) between the two light conditions for young plants shows not only the similar genetic control in both light setups but further also the reproducibility of the data, obtained from parallel experiments.</p><p id="Par46">The overall trait ranges and heritabilities were considerably consistent across populations and light conditions. There were a few differences, especially between the populations tested in the first three experiments compared to the population K ~ N that was tested in the fourth experiment. These differences may have resulted from the increased solar light period and higher light intensity during the fourth experiment. Though there was a strong impact of the light spectrum on the overall plant performance, the QTL patterns for most traits were similar between the conditions within one population. Only two QTL out of the 44 LED-specific QTL were found to have a significant interaction with the light environment, which points to a general shift in phenotype in the different light conditions, but all tested genotypes responded in a similar way. Also Wolyn et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2004</xref>) studied an <italic>A. thaliana</italic> RIL population in five different light qualities for hypocotyl length and out of eight QTL only one QTL, specific for red light, was found to have a significant genotype by environment interaction. So, although the parental accessions of our RIL population were selected based on differences to light responses, the data on the RIL populations gave no strong indication for a differential interaction between the tested tomato genotypes and the two light conditions. The difference in environmental response between these greenhouse experiments and the first ones in the growth chamber may be explained by the more fluctuating environmental conditions and additional solar light in the greenhouse.</p><p id="Par47">For one RIL population we also studied fruit traits. The number of fruit trusses per plant, number of fruits per plant, and average weight per fruit per plant showed a strong genetic impact with clear QTL on ch01 and ch11. These traits could be linked to the <italic>fruit weight 11.3</italic> (<italic>fw11.3</italic>) or <italic>fasciated</italic> (<italic>fas</italic>) loci, which have been shown to be located at the bottom of ch11 in different tomato cultivars (Huang and van der Knaap <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2011</xref>). The presence of the loci increase fresh fruit weightby increasing mesocarp size (<italic>fw11.3</italic>) or the locule number of the fruit (<italic>fas</italic>; Lippman and Tanksley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2001</xref>; Cong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2008</xref>; Mu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2017</xref>), one of those factors could explain the QTL on ch11. The QTL on ch01 might be linked to a locus similar to <italic>fw11.3</italic> or <italic>fas</italic>, possibly the <italic>fruit weight 1.1</italic> (<italic>fw1.1</italic>) locus (Lippman and Tanksley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2001</xref>; Hernández-Bautista et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2015</xref>), as the QTL on ch01 has a similar pattern as the QTL on ch11 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).</p><p id="Par48">Next to the nuclear genome, the organelle genomes in the mitochondria and plastids carry genetic information (Gray <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1993</xref>) which is passed on via the maternal line to the offspring. The organelle genomes contribute to plant performance and environmental responses, e.g. plastome gene expression can be light regulated (Yen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">1997</xref>; Lupaşcu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2015</xref>; Facella et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2016</xref>). Although a number of spontaneous chloroplast mutations were described (Massouh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2016</xref>), there may be little variation in plastomes of modern tomato cultivars (Kahlau et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2006</xref>; Raime and Remm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2018</xref>). Similar intraspecific studies for the mitochondrial genome of tomato are missing but the mitogenome is less conserved than the plastome and intraspecific variation for different species was shown (Sloan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2012</xref>; Kim and Lee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2018</xref>). The effects from the reciprocal crosses varied between the populations, and the sizes of these effects were lower compared to the overall genetic trait range. Plastid and mitochondrial specific metabolic processes were found to influence axillary bud break by providing energy as well as metabolites that act in the light induced phytohormonal signalling (Mason et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2014</xref>; Signorelli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2018</xref>). This important role of the organelles in bud outgrowth could explain the differences we observed in side shoot formation between the two sub-groups from reciprocal crosses. Chloroplasts are critical in light perception and photosynthesis, and therefore genetic differences in chloroplasts might lead to differences in responses to HPS and LED supplemental light. However, we did not observe this in our experiments, as clear interactions between supplemental lighting and reciprocal crosses were not found.</p><p id="Par49">Across all RIL populations, the plants were more compact and had less biomass under LED compared to the standard HPS supplemental lighting in the greenhouse. Specifically, they had shorter internodes, the biomass and leaf area were reduced, while the specific stem height was identical to growth under HPS. Also, the fruiting population showed significant shorter internodes under LED compared to HPS supplemental lighting. HPS lamps emit more far red (FR) light than the LEDs, with a phytochrome stationary state values of 0.852 for HPS vs 0.883 for LED. Low ratios of R/FR light and corresponding lower phytochrome stationary state (PSS) values can lead to plant elongation. Previous studies showed that R/B LED supplemental lighting led to compacter growth compared to HPS and R/B lighting with FR (Hogewoning et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2012</xref>). Decreasing PSS values from 0.88 to 0.80 increased stem height, leaf area, and total dry weight (Kalaitzoglou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2019</xref>). Our data confirm that this is a common trend amongst a wider range of tomato genotypes. The lower PSS values may explain the taller stems and thinner leaves with a larger leaf area under HPS-supplemental lighting in our study.</p><p id="Par50">Higher levels of green light or lower blue to green ratios were implicated in e.g. shade avoidance (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2011</xref>; Fraser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2016</xref>) that also lead to hypocotyl and maybe (early) stem elongation (Folta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2004</xref>; Sellaro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2010</xref>). Therefore, the green light in the HPS lamps (ca. 50%) may also play a role in the morphological differences compared to LED light. Another factor that could affect the plant growth was that the HPS emit radiative heat, the broad range HPS radiation has more infrared light and may lead to a higher meristem temperature at the top of the plants. This could favour leaf initiation and outgrowth. We have seen a slightly higher leaf number under HPS light, which could be a meristem temperature effect (Savvides et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par51">Most striking for the young plants were the sizes of the side shoots compared to the true leaves, both regarding high heritability and difference between the light conditions. When looking at side shoot formation we should subdivide into axillary bud outgrowth that breaks its quiescence, and consecutive side shoot development. The first could be indicated in our study by the number of side shoots and the second by the overall size and dry weight of these side shoots. The number of axillary buds was less affected than the size of the side shoots by the different supplemental lighting conditions. Tucker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">1976</xref>) proposed that far red triggers abscisic acid formation near the auxiliary bud and thereby inhibits it outgrowth. He showed that a pulse of far red light stunts side shoot formation in young tomato plants. Generally, a low R/ FR ratio can favour apical growth instead of side shoot growth (Girault et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2008</xref>; Evers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2011</xref>; Dierck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2017</xref>). The R/FR ratio is higher in the LED-compartment, so we would expect more side shoots there than under HPS supplemental lighting. These assumptions conflict with our experimental outcome of less and smaller side shoots in LED light. Blue light was also found to impact axillary bud outgrowth but the effect seems to vary between species and genotypes (Leduc et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2014</xref>; Huché-Thélier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2016</xref>). However, the percentage of supplemental blue light is similar between our two conditions (ca. 5% in both). Therefore, also other light quality differences seem to impact side shoot outgrowth. In our experiments, this could be a lower blue/red ratio (0.03 in compared to 0.12) or the lack of green light in LED supplemental lighting.</p><p id="Par52">The significantly elevated levels of anthocyanin content in the plants grown under LED light compared to HPS light could indicate stress (Chalker-Scott <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1999</xref>; Kovinich et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2015</xref>). It is not easy to determine if a plant is in an optimal growing condition or stressed state. The reduction of ɸ<sub>PSII</sub> is a possible stress indicator. In three of the four populations ɸ<sub>PSII</sub> was indeed lower in LED than HPS grown plants, however the difference was minor and the ɸ<sub>PSII</sub> was with an average of 0.7 (over all populations and experiments) still at a healthy level. In addition, the plants grew otherwise visually normally. Studies in Arabidopsis showed phytochrome induced upregulation of anthocyanin inducing genes with increasing red light (Shin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2007</xref>; Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2015</xref>). Red light was overrepresented in LED compared to HPS supplemental lighting, activating more phytochrome which in turn could activate transcription factors, like PIF3 and HY5 (Shin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2007</xref>), that upregulate anthocyanin biosynthesis genes.</p><p id="Par53">The adult plants showed on average less fruit trusses, less fruits, and lower yield of ripe fruits per plant under LED compared to HPS (Suppl. File 3). However, when the unripe fruits at the last harvest day were included, there was no significant yield difference between HPS and LED. The average weight per fruit was a bit higher under LED, probably compensating the lower number of fruits per plant. We conclude that the plants under LED light were compacter, slower in development, but in the end produced similar yield compared to plants under HPS supplemental lighting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par54">The primary aim of this study was discovery of LED-specific QTL for growth related traits and fruit yield. That could help plant breeders when developing modern cultivars that are optimal for greenhouses with supplemental LED-lighting, and developing other cultivars that are optimal for HPS supplemental light. Therefore, we developed four RIL populations, that were derived from parents that showed contrasting phenotypes under different light environments. We observed numerous QTL, both at HPS and LED supplemental lighting, at the seedling stage and at the fruiting stage. However, we detected hardly any light environment-specific QTL. Therefore, our study indicates that breeding for optimal tomato cultivars for greenhouses with supplemental HPS simultaneously leads to optimal cultivars for supplemental LED lighting. And the other way around, cultivars that perform well under LED, very likely also perform well under HPS.</p><p id="Par55">Moreover, we made reciprocal crosses for the four RIL populations, in view of possible effects of the maternally inherited plastids, such as chloroplasts, and the mitochondria, which are critical for photosynthesis and energy regulation. Again, we found very clear and significant effects from the maternally inherited plastids and mitochondria, showing the importance of using a parent either as mother or as a father. However, these differences did not interact significantly with the light environment. So, similarly as for the genetic factors from the nuclei (the QTL), the genetic factors from the maternally inherited plastids and mitochondria, are of paramount importance for plant architecture and fruit traits, but these genetic factors did not show a specific interaction with either supplemental HPS or supplemental LED light.</p><p id="Par56">Therefore, our data do not support tomato breeding for specific light environments in greenhouses, as far as supplemental 95% red and 5% blue LED light is concerned.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Nunhems Netherlands B.V.
