We define an activity as an action or process that uses one or more resources and that responds either wholly or partially to a demand. A definition for sustainability is developed and is contingent on whether or not an activity can be sustained according to the available resources, the duration of an activity, the cost of its execution, or whether substitution is possible. A sustainability condition is met when the duration, cost and the chain of dependent activities satisfies the demand. Two conditions for sustainability are developed: a strong condition when the demand is met with no substitution and a weak condition when the demand is met via substitution. In the latter case, we show that the set of all sustainable activities is a subset of a N-level union of sustainable activities and forms a topological cover.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>4026</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2014</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep05215.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>22</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep05215" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep05215</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the 21st Century, humans are faced with the extraordinary challenge of developing methodologies to manage Earth's limited resources in a sustainable way<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. A widely accepted definition of sustainability has its origins in the Brundtland Commission statement of 1987, <italic>Our Common Future</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>: “Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” This normative description summarizes the document and proposes a set of fundamental qualities for sustainability, including the notion of being global (encompassing everyone) and providing for intra- and intergenerational equity and justice. This document proposes the reduction of inequities for all as well as providing a way to protect the common good for the poorest and wealthiest nations, not only for the present, but also for future generations. Indeed the very notion of sustainability, ‘needs to be sustained’ in light of the self-evident prospect that we have a limited supply of available resources.</p><p>As a consequence, scientists continue to seek a better understanding of the fundamental character of the interactions between nature and society and to explore whether these interactions are along sustainable trajectories. Policy makers have also tried to implement these concepts. Kofi Annan's report to the United Nations, <italic>We the peoples, The role of the United Nations in the 21st Century</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, echoes this notion. Activated by an international effort, Annan claimed, “globalization must be built on the great enabling force of the market … and requiring a broader effort to create a shared future, based upon our common humanity in all its diversity.” In the years following the Brundtland Report, a set of three pillars (we use interchangeably with the term dimensions) were conceived, namely, the environmental, economic and social pillars. Then in 1992, the United Nations held the “The Earth Summit” conference in Rio de Janeiro. It was here that the agenda for the 21st century was established (Agenda 21) and the ‘triplet’ was solidified into the well known Venn diagram that has since become an icon for visualizing sustainability.</p><p>In the attempts to connect the potentially conflicting issues from each dimension, many subsequent interpretations and a host of definitions based on different academic disciplinary perspectives, ideological preferences, [and] even political expediency were developed. Some well known and constructive definitions include those for sustainable production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, sustainable biophysical systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, eco-systems goods and services<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and others. Using some of these definitions, holistic approaches have been sought in response to the diverse challenges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and have had some success in building frameworks to address sustainability problems.</p><p>There is a clear imbalance in terms of analytical work on the three dimensions. Environmental and the closely-related ecological sciences, most naturally accessible to modelling, have developed the first among the three<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, followed by quantitative economic approaches towards sustainability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and then much later by work on social sustainability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Social sustainability is also commonly understood as a ‘weak pillar’, in part because of the difficulty in formulating issues into an analytic framework. Some progress has none-the-less been made<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Despite the differences of the three, there is a general agreement that holistic approaches to sustainable development must encompass 1) the interactions across all three dimensions, 2) multiscale approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and 3) complexity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Apart from these concerns, the modeller must balance detail and relevance since a model will only be as good as the available input information and the associated uncertainties. Forecasting sustainability trajectories is an even more difficult task when so many unknowns, both present and future, must be taken into account. A seemingly good solution for the present might turn out to be disastrous later on<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Currently, no clear methodology links the three dimensions and no forecast method provides a vivid picture as to how we should use our limited resources.</p><p>In this paper, we develop a methodology linking the three dimensions and providing a means to distinguish between sustainable and non-sustainable activities. We provide a simple parametrization that connects renewable and non-renewable resources associated with the activities. In the next section, we recount the major historical steps in bridging sustainability dimensions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>On the road to modelling sustainability</title><p>Early interdisciplinary work came in the 1940s, when Karl William Kapp, considered one of the founders of ecological economics (EE), proposed the connections between societal and economic activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, “Social cost[s]… are all direct and indirect losses sustained by third persons or the general public as a result of unrestrained economic activities.” In these early years, the societal dimension was treated as a subsystem of the ecosystem. In the same time period, Karl Polanyi produced his work on <italic>The Great Transformation</italic> (1944)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and developed the concept of societal and cultural economics. In the 1960s, a number of essays describing the interactions between the economic and ecosystems appeared, including Kenneth E. Boulding's work “The economics of the coming spaceship Earth”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and Herman E. Daly's contribution entitled “On Economics as a life cycle”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In the 1980s, a next major step came when regular scientific activities commenced in the field of EE. In 1984, the symposium entitled “Integrating Ecology and Economics” was hosted in Sweden by Ann-Mari Jansson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and brought together, for the first time, a large number of ecosystem ecologists and mainstream environmental economists. In 1988, the International Society for Ecological Economics (ISEE) was founded, and, in February 1989, the first volume of Ecological Economics, the “Transdisciplinary Journal of the ISEE”, was published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Today, EE is considered a well established scientific community. A good review of EE by Kastenhofer et al. (2011)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> provides an overview of this period and includes some of the more recent works<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p>Also, during this period, the interdisciplinary fields of sustainability science (SS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> emerged as a set of disciplines addressing the central issues of sustainability. A comprehensive definition is proposed by Kieffer et al. (2003)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>: “[Sustainable science is] the cultivation, integration and application of knowledge about Earth systems gained especially from the holistic and historical sciences ... coordinated with knowledge about human interrelationships gained from the social sciences and humanities, in order to evaluate, mitigate and minimize the consequences”.</p><p>Despite the definitions available, no consensus on a theoretical framework has yet been defined in either interdisciplinary movements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. A current priority theme is the development of strategies dealing with the dynamical interfaces between dimensions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> and the uncertainties of measurable parameters.</p><p>A modern technique in dealing with the problem of interfaces has been the use of systems approaches (SA) where tools have traditionally been used to treat two or more domains of research. In SA, different metrics for each discipline are treated separately<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The method uses dynamic processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> (time dependent), is cross dimensional (economic, social and environmental) and is able to handle complex problems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> (interconnected, interwoven, with feedback) as well as problems with multi-variables. As with most approaches dealing with complex issues, SA employs numerical methods that can handle problems of this nature, but these approaches are not always easily interpretable.</p><p>Another quantitative method includes the use of sustainability assessment maps (SAMs). These maps use indicators such as costs, profits, numbers of jobs, environmental impact and types and quantities of natural capital. A score is set up to weigh each decision in terms of its sustainability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The approach is appealing for policy makers because it is easy to communicate and understand, although it should not be considered a panacea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Some problems include the aforementioned ‘imbalance between ecological modelling and the other two branches’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, the weak integration of data into a single, dynamical framework since SAMs are static<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, the unresolved issue of what to do when conflicting goals and interactions between indicators have not been sufficiently considered and finally, the mismatch of scales (local to global). The last issues is especially important in the social dimension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p>Several other approaches have been pursued to overcome these challenges, including the multivariate analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> and comprehensive indicator approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, both having a certain degree of success in specific applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. The issues of complexity, non-locality and multi-scales, still proved difficult to address with these methods, both in terms of calculation and interpretation. It is not surprising that no single approach for modelling sustainability has yet emerged. Furthermore, no consensus exists for a comprehensive list of sustainability topics. A good compilation of theoretical approaches has nonetheless been developed (adapted from van den Bergh, 1996)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> and is given in <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Adapted from van den Bergh<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> ‘Theoretical Perspectives on Sustainable Development’</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="justify"><p>Theory</p></th><th align="justify"><p>Characterization</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="justify"><p>1.

An underlying concept connecting the dimensions is <italic>cost</italic>. This is not necessarily a monetary value, except in the obvious case of commodities in the economic dimension, but a parameter used to weight and compare decisions. Monetary values are more difficult to assign to environmental costs, although methodology has been developed to do so<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Impact has also been evaluated in other contexts, for example, direct human activity in the environment via population growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Also, not surprisingly, it is difficult to assign a monetary cost for societal concerns, but a relative weighting can still be done, especially for issues at a local level where a consensus on the social cost is easier to obtain.</p><p>For example, when dealing only with energy resources and long-term planning, the model should provide solutions that approach those of classic technoeconomic models (e.g., MARKAL, the MARket ALlocation model)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. When details are available (e.g., costs of fuel, maintenance and investments), the model should be readily adaptable to search for and test different hypotheses. Indeed, the model should provide a means to make decisions or at least be flexible enough so that a decision process can be developed around the core model.</p><p>The model should also be adaptable to handle dynamic systems such as the dynamic resource stocks of limited resources (e.g., fossil fuels) or linked (indirect) resources typically modelled in ecological - economic literature (e.g., tuna: the harvesting of this top predator fish and its dependency on herrings).</p><p>Environmental costs, though less tangible, can also be determined via an impact or damage. A number of air pollutants, including CO<sub>2</sub>, nitrous oxides, hydrocarbons and particulate matter are emitted from the vehicle and damage or impact the health of the surrounding human and plant environment. Although difficult to calculate on an individual basis, the damage to humans can be assessed in terms of the health costs or decreased longevity as a result of the diminished environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.</p><p>The social costs depend on the social milieu. For example, the social acceptability of taking the bike instead of the car, may or may not be important. In some localities, residents consider it to be more socially responsible to use a bike for a short trip, especially if the other choice was an oversized car; yet in other societies, for cultural reasons, the consideration is just the opposite. This reality suggests that social costs may still be evaluated, but more as a means of weighing two or more decisions based on their local acceptance.</p><p>In this paper, we break down the concept of sustainable development into its building block activities; these can then be tested for the sustainability condition as we will show in the next few sections. Furthermore, we propose that sustainable development occurs only when the ensemble of activities that make up the development are all sustainable.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Time scale considerations</title><p>Some activities will have immediate and direct consequences on their surroundings; others will have delayed impact. It is therefore important to model the activity with its associated impact and cost and capture both the immediate and the future consequences. The temporal behavior of activities and their costs must therefore be taken into account and modeled in a way that also reflects the limited knowledge that is available.

An activity may require several resources. For example, a multiple list of objects, representing the four basic food groups, <disp-formula id="Equ8"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep05215_Equ2_HTML.jpg"/></disp-formula>might be desirable to fulfill the needed demand.

A time dependent and renewable stock (e.g., a fish population), can be treated in this same framework, but with additional considerations on <inline-formula id="IEq12"><inline-graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep05215_IEq12_HTML.jpg"/></inline-formula>, see Appendix (A dynamic reservoir). Second, we have assumed that only one activity is associated with a resource. In reality, several activities can be linked to a single resource and, in this case, we need to partition the resource for each activity. A multiple and simultaneous set of demands can be subsequently met by individual resources <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>. Petroleum meeting the demand for transportation <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>petrol</italic></sub><sub>→<italic>trans</italic></sub> and petroleum used as raw material for the plastic industry, <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>petrol</italic></sub><sub>→<italic>plastic</italic></sub>, is an example. The resource <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>petrol</italic></sub><sub>→<italic>trans</italic></sub> is implicitly used only for transportation while <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>petrol</italic></sub><sub>→<italic>plastic</italic></sub> is implicitly only used for plastics, <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>totpetrol</italic></sub> = <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>petrol</italic></sub><sub>→<italic>trans</italic></sub> + <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>petrol</italic></sub><sub>→<italic>plastic</italic></sub>. The uncertainty in the demand for transportation and plastics implies that some of the petroleum reservoir initially allocated for transportation could be used for the plastic industry and visa-versa. The time dependency on the activity, the cost, the demand and any other parameters is implicit and generally not known. For these reasons, only a limited amount of modeling can be done for long-term environmental impact and cost.</p><p>The cost <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> for activity <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> for a one-level dependent activity (temporarily dropping the activity subscript) is composed of three parts: economic <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>F</italic></sub>, social <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub> and environmental <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub>. For extended planning, the technoeconomic costs include the standard investment, operational (maintenance), energy and replacement (salvage) values. The environmental cost <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> is proportional to the impact <italic>I</italic>, the pollutant <italic>p</italic> and ultimately the required capacity <italic>c</italic>, using a set of conversion constants, α, β and γ, <disp-formula id="Equ10"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep05215_Equ4_HTML.jpg"/></disp-formula><disp-formula id="Equ11"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep05215_Equ5_HTML.jpg"/></disp-formula><disp-formula id="Equ12"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep05215_Equ6_HTML.jpg"/></disp-formula>In this simple example where neither feedback nor other non-linear behavior occur, the environmental cost is directly proportional to the pollutant. Even in this example, the pollutant may accumulate over time and the net pollution <italic>p</italic>, resulting from the activity, can be diminished by dispersive action and/or by sequestration. Given a constant activity over a period of time <italic>t</italic>, the accumulated pollution <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>ACC</italic></sub> and cost are, <disp-formula id="Equ13"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep05215_Equ7_HTML.jpg"/></disp-formula><disp-formula id="Equ14"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep05215_Equ8_HTML.jpg"/></disp-formula>where η = α × β × γ.

We start with the simple example, the need (demand) to take a short trip and propose that only two modes of transportation are available: a bike and a car. First, we consider the resources required by each activity. Does the biker have enough stored bio-chemical energy available or is there enough gas in the car tank? If not, what are the costs of a snack for the biker to ‘energize up’ or the costs to refuel the car? If a longer trip was planned, we would have to include the purchase (replacement) and operational costs (maintenance) for both car and bike and include the amount recovered (salvage value) for each. For longer planning scenarios, covering decades of time, we must also consider the projected change of technology (e.g., a petroleum or diesel car replaced by a fuel cell car).</p><p>If the bike is chosen and the rider has enough energy to make the trip, then the trip is sustainable since τ &lt; τ<sup><italic>max</italic></sup> and we assume <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>bike</italic></sub> &lt; <italic>C</italic><sup><italic>max</italic></sup>. According to this scheme, the journey completed by a car is also sustainable if the car completes the journey before the tank is empty (τ &lt; τ<sup><italic>max</italic></sup>) and <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>car</italic></sub> &lt; <italic>C</italic><sup><italic>max</italic></sup>.</p><p>Other indirect consequences come out of this example. Theoretically, the ‘clean’ bike trip can negatively impact the environment. Prior to the trip, the bicyclist might be inclined to eat an apple for energy and therefore indirectly supports an apple farmer. A truck driver who is transporting the apple to the market is also supported by this activity, albeit marginally. The truck consequently contributes to the emission load. Therefore, secondary environmental costs that are not usually foreseen when riding a bike might be taken into account. To be thorough, we should not stop here; we should include the manufacturing costs needed to build the truck, bike, or car. We should also include the impact from the exhaust of all the commuters who journeyed to and from the factory to build the bike, car, or truck. The list would go on and on and the problem quickly becomes an intractable one to assess. Although arguably small, the ramifications of activities should be considered. To a degree, these are reminiscent of the Life Cycle Assessment considerations of the ‘cradle-to-grave’ analysis and Boundary Critique issues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> associated with typical rigid boundaries of problems. The model should be expandable to account for these issues by adding ‘higher-order terms’. The question of how these terms are weighted is probably less important than being consistent. (See Appendix item Generalizing the activity to include higher-order dependencies.)</p><p>One method to determine the higher-order terms in this case would be using the fraction of the weight of the one apple eaten compared to the weight of the entire lot on the truck. This information might be very difficult to ascertain and statistical models would be needed. The number of linked activities or levels <italic>N</italic> or the number of higher-order considerations will each have to be determined in light of the knowledge and uncertainty of the problem. When the higher-order term is sufficiently uncertain, the calculation should then stop.</p><p>Now consider two sets of capacities, renewables Ω<sub><italic>r</italic></sub> and non-renewables Ω<sub><italic>nr</italic></sub>, as given in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, <disp-formula id="Equ34"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep05215_Equ34_HTML.jpg"/></disp-formula><disp-formula id="Equ35"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep05215_Equ35_HTML.jpg"/></disp-formula><inline-formula id="IEq42"><inline-graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep05215_IEq42_HTML.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula id="IEq43"><inline-graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep05215_IEq43_HTML.jpg"/></inline-formula> and as an example, an ‘actual’ situation, <inline-formula id="IEq44"><inline-graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep05215_IEq44_HTML.jpg"/></inline-formula>.

Though the demand in this example is constant, it could be time dependent and therefore represents a national transportation activity. Scenarios developing replacement technologies (fuel cells) using renewable energies (solar, wind, etc.), for the most part, have not yet been developed on large scales and therefore, the uncertainty of replaceable technologies limits the knowledge for substitution.

An unsustainable situation will arise if any of the links, all critical to the higher link, becomes unsustainable or if substitution was not possible at any of the endangered links. Unmanaged activity could lead to unfavourable consequences (e.g., overshoot and collapse of the tuna, mackerel, or sardine population).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although the three-dimensional (pillar) view of sustainability is widely accepted, there remains a number of fundamental criticisms in terms of its modelling, especially in terms of the social pillar and its interfaces. Literature demonstrates a degree of criticism in terms of the interfaces, especially between the environmental and social dimensions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Theys<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> provides a way to proceed, noting that:</p><p>Local territories are the level at which the questions of socially sustainable development become concrete and where the interactions between the different dimensions are most explicit and where participation and dialogue are the most feasible.</p><p>No single approach has yet emerged to bridge the gap between the local social issues, involving geographers, planners and landowners who deal with issues that immediately impact the local community and global issues, involving economists, large enterprises, consumer organisations, international NGOs and diplomats who deal more with topics revolving around the global commons such as eco-taxes and emissions trading<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In the absence of well-defined analytic constructs such as the higher-order terms and social costs, social scientists will have difficulty connecting the local and global in an analytic way. We also note similar activities may have similar costs and in this case a simplification could be made, e.g. <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> = <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub><sub>,<italic>i</italic></sub> for <italic>i</italic> representing two or more activities. Theys recommends a multi-tier system to address these separate social issues, similar to the indirect (higher-order) terms considered here.</p><p>Beyond this concern, connecting the social to the other dimensions is still problematic. An important study in the late 1990s was conducted by the Dutch Ministry of the Environment with the aim of gaining knowledge on the environmental and social interactions. A set of indicators was used to build an operational linkage between the social and environmental dimensions. As suspected, the study found that in some cases, social policies (e.g., reinforcement of consumption) were determined to adversely affect the environment (e.g., loss in eco-efficiency)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. The study concluded that in the absence of economic indicators, the model was too rudimentary to represent the complex interactions and causal relations between social and environmental indicators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. It was concluded that a holistic framework<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> encompassing the three dimensions was still needed but that treatment of the social-environmental interaction was most easily handled, as previously mentioned, at the local level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Translated to the approach presented here, the local or base activity ℓ = 1 is where social issues become more concrete. Perhaps consensus at the local level is one way to proceed. On the other hand, consensus of social costs on the global level, although more difficult, presents more noble ambitions in terms of tackling the issues of sustainability.</p><p>As noted earlier, a good model should be ‘falsifiable’ to the criteria it was meant to test; clearly some examples in the economic and environmental dimension are more readily testable than in the social dimension. Indeed, a proper balance must be achieved when providing numbers for costs, durations and substitutable activities, when knowledge permits. Only when these figures with their respective levels of uncertainty are tabulated can a full validation be determined.</p><p>Although numbers are not given here, <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> does provide a starting point in response to the not-so-quantifiable theoretical issues of sustainability.

Costs are used to connect the three dimensions and their theoretical maximum values, namely economic, social and environmental. These maximums are used to test if the activity is sustainable. We also show that when cost and duration constraints are satisfied, an activity is classified as sustainable according to a strong condition (no substitution required) or weak condition (substitution required). We have shown that in the weak case, the set of all sustainable activities is a subset of an <italic>N</italic>-level union of sustainable activities, the set of which is a topological cover of sustainable activities. The number of levels is limited by the knowledge and uncertainty of the substitutable activities. A simple classification of activities is given, though quantification will be required to advance the work. What is surprising is that the basic framework is simple, closely following the three dimensions (pillars) of sustainability. While these three have been discussed for some time, the literature to connect them has been sparse. Perhaps this methodology will assist in their connection and allow for more quantitative studies in the field of sustainability science.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The author wishes to acknowledge support from the <italic>Ministière de la Culture, de l'Enseignement Superieur et de la Recherche (MCESR).</italic> The author is also very grateful to William Zachary for his helpful reviewing of the manuscript.</p></ack><sec sec-type="ethics-statement"><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author declares no competing financial interests.</p></sec></sec><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Solow</surname><given-names>RM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">[Resources for the Future] An Almost Practical Step Toward Sustainability</article-title><source>Res.
