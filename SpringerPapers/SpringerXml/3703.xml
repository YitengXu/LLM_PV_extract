integral part of our society. They appear in great diversity in a multiplicity of applications for economic, commercial, leisure, military and academic purposes. The drone industry has seen a sharp uptake in the last decade as a model to manufacture and deliver convergence, offering synergy by incorporating multiple technologies. It is due to technological trends and rapid advancements in control, miniaturization, and computerization, which culminate in secure, lightweight, robust, more-accessible and cost-efficient UAVs. UAVs support implicit particularities including access to disaster-stricken zones, swift mobility, airborne missions and payload features. Despite these appealing benefits, UAVs face limitations in operability due to several critical concerns in terms of flight autonomy, path planning, battery endurance, flight time and limited payload carrying capability, as intuitively it is not recommended to load heavy objects such as batteries. As a result, the primary goal of this research is to provide insights into the potentials of UAVs, as well as their characteristics and functionality issues. This study provides a comprehensive review of UAVs, types, swarms, classifications, charging methods and regulations. Moreover, application scenarios, potential challenges and security issues are also examined. Finally, future research directions are identified to further hone the research work. We believe these insights will serve as guidelines and motivations for relevant researchers.

gained significant attention in the last decade. Most of the studies report multirotors due to their simplicity in control mechanisms and high-precision in positioning. Other types of UAVs are also reported, but their numbers are comparably low. There are several limitations to the practical implementation of UAVs in different application scenarios. The main critical limitation among UAVs is flight endurance, which is limited due to the limited power supply provided by batteries. This issue can be mitigated through the design of different types of batteries using hybrid systems or internal combustion engines. Another promising solution is a docking station, which can recharge or swap batteries, store and even perform communication tasks with UAVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Docking stations can solve the battery endurance issue and put UAVs one step ahead in autonomous systems.</p><p id="Par3">At present, UAVs are being used in multiple military, industrial and commercial applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. In the military, UAVs offer navigation, secure communication and reconnaissance. Furthermore, they are being used in mobile edge computing, cellular communication, package delivery, smart healthcare, intelligent transportation systems, video surveillance missions, precision agriculture, power-line inspection, remote sensing, search and rescue, and performing relief operations in disaster environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. UAVs have the capability to access remote or dangerous areas, facilitate environmental monitoring and capture high-resolution imagery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These flying objects are helpful in monitoring as they bridge the constraints in limited-access, dynamic, harsh and complex environments. Furthermore, they reduce the labor and time required to survey, inspect and sample on ground, provide collision avoidance and quick convergence to reach targets, and offer more time for intended managerial operations. However, there are multiple critical limits on the design, deployment and performance of UAVs. Some of them have limited flight time, limited autonomy, less mobility and limited battery endurance. Harsh weather conditions and environments also impose limitations of UAV performance. Limited mission time is due to low battery endurance, harsh atmospheric conditions and sensor accuracy challenges. Several promising solutions are presented in the literature to mitigate these challenges, including high-quality devices such as manufacturing materials and motors, UAV geometry, wings and batteries. Some studies also address optimization strategies to look for shortest trajectory for UAV flight to reach the target destination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].

We also provide realistic recommendations and solutions to overcome these challenges. We carry out our extensive analysis to empower the use of UAVs in several application scenarios.

They can be remotely operated through different electronic gadgets such as microprocessors and sensors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. UAVs can perform operations autonomously in such areas where human intervention is dangerous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> presents a general architecture of UAVs where they utilize communication links to establish connectivity with satellite or ground control system (GCS) such as a laptop or smart phone. A human operator is needed to operate and control the UAV remotely. In literature, several works have been presented to address different features of UAVs. For instance, Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] have focused on mobile charging features for drones to enhance their battery life. Aldhaher et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] the use of a wirelessly powered receiver in order to decrease the weight of UAVs. Several wireless charging techniques have been suggested in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] to increase the UAV’s flight time. Raciti et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] reported a charging system empowered by a wireless power transfer (WPT) system. This study also highlights misalignment losses and associated mitigation solutions. Rohan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], proposed an intelligent drone charging system empowered by WPT. Shin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] addressed charge scheduling for multi-drones networks based on deep learning algorithms. In Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, we have summarized different surveys and reviews reporting on multiple aspects of UAVs.

Different types of UAVs can be found in the literature: fixed-wing, single rotor, fixed-wing hybrid, and multirotor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Fixed-wing UAVs contain a main body, wings, propeller and motor. These UAVs need special training to control and they remain useless for aerial surveillance. A fixed-wing UAV is depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. These unmanned aerial vehicles are often used for aerial mapping and power line inspection. Such UAVs are not capable of hovering or forward flight. Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b depicts a hybrid fixed-wing UAV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Figure 4c depicts a single-rotor UAV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. However, single-rotor UAVs are costly to produce and need skill training. These unmanned aerial vehicles are mechanically difficult and susceptible to obstacles such as vibrations. Furthermore, multirotor UAVs are the most affordable and simple to build. These unmanned aerial vehicles are often employed for image and video surveillance. Quadcopters are the most often utilized UAVs, as seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d. Quadcopters have gained popularity for their vertical landing, or quick maneuverability, low cost, and compact size. We have illustrated basic UAV types in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>.

This categorization is also divided into single and multi-layered swarms. Each drone in the swarm provides real-time data recording and processing capabilities. While core processing takes place in the base station (BS) or in the clouds. UAV swarms with sophisticated monitoring mechanisms can cover a zone reliably and quickly by deploying several parallel-operating drones. Numerous studies have been reported on the usefulness of UAV swarms. Such as [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] analyzes swarms of drones to solve the charging process of many drones at the same time. It employs UAV swarms for smart power management. When considering the mission accomplishment of swarms of UAVs such as quadcopters, UAV flight coordination and hovering endurance become critical.

On the other hand, large-sized UAVs can travel at higher speeds up to 100 m/s. Whenever any UAV is following any intended path to improve its energy or spectral efficiency, its speed should be taken into account at multiple turning points and locations along this path. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], authors have addressed this trade-off between UAV speed and turning agility.</p><p id="Par18">Similarly, flight time indicates to the maximum time for which the UAV can fly until the batteries are drained out. It is of paramount significance along with cost. UAV weight, size and atmospheric conditions such as rain or wind have strong impact on battery endurance of UAVs which is closely associated to flight time. GPS and autopilot systems also play a crucial role in flight time. Small size UAVs can fly up to 20–30 min, while large size UAVs can fly up to several hours.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Payload</title><p id="Par19">The lifting capability of a UAV to carry any weight is referred to as payload. Lifting capacity ranges from a few grams to several hundred kilos. Greater payloads allow for more accessories to be carried at the expense of shorter flying times, greater power capacity, and wider dimensions. Sensors and video cameras are common payloads for reconnaissance, surveillance, and commercial purposes. Cellular user equipment (UEs), such as tablets, mobile phones, and tablets weighing less than one kilogram, may also be carried by UAVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. UAVs with high payloads are thought to have shorter flight duration. However, if a UAV has a larger surface area along with occupying more motors; it has the ability to store more power, which increases flying time. As a result, the payload's quality might let it move faster while maintaining the same precision and resolution.

They are defined as a series of actions that can affect UAVs and the physical world. The controllers vary according to the UAV type such as flapping wing, single rotor, multirotor and fixed-wing. These UAVs are designed for certain operations and face different aerodynamics. UAV control encompasses an extensive range of technologies and treatments. For some certain operations, the control may contain the macro- executions (such as formation control and path planning) and the micro flight control decisions of the actuators according to the provided commands. Due to the dynamic behavior of UAV configurations, the design and development of UAV control must follow an appropriate mechanism. As a result of the external disturbances, the operability of the flight control system is critical to following the stable response. The key objective of the controller is to reduce the error between the estimated and desired states, which can be altitude, velocity, or position of the UAV operating under varying atmospheric conditions. Next, we discussed the flight controller for UAVs in detail.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Flight controllers</title><p id="Par31">Flight controllers are commonly known as autopilot systems, are the main elements of UAVs. They are generally designed to ensure autonomous flight control, such as mission planning, flight waypoint generation and attitude stabilization. To efficiently realize these operations, flight controllers require software or hardware assistance concurrently. The latter mostly consists of power control modules, communication entities, GPS modules, onboard sensors, inertial measurement units and onboard computers, and the former mainly contains signal processing algorithms, attitude control, path planning and task allocation.</p><p id="Par32">The flight controller is based on three major components. The first one is named "kernel control law," which is responsible for the asymptotic stability of the UAV’s mobility within the air. The second component is called the command generator, which is used to generate references for the kernel control. The last part is the flight schedule, which is responsible for generating a group of flight arrangements to realize the desired mission. Flight control of a UAV can be achieved by controlling the altitude in order to maintain the UAV at the desired height and controlling the orientation and velocity to follow specific trajectories. Different linear and non-linear controllers are used for UAVs. The linear controllers include H¥, LRQ, PD, and PID, and non-linear controllers include NDI, gain-scheduling, fuzzy logic control, nested saturation, sliding mode, and backstepping. The linear controllers are as follows:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par33">The H¥ Loop-Forming technique, which integrates conventional loop forming control with robust control, provides high robustness than other techniques.

Power, telecommunications infrastructure, water utilities, and transportation are all vulnerable to these calamities. UAVs can assist in the collection of data, the need for quick answers, and the navigation of debris. UAVs equipped with sensors, radars, and high-resolution cameras can aid rescue teams in identifying damage, launching urgent recovery efforts, and dispatching supplies including first-aid manned helicopters and medical kits. UAVs can aid with catastrophe assessment, disaster alarms, and discovering preventative measures in real-time. A swarm of drones equipped with firefighting equipment can watch, analyze, and track any region in the event of a wildfire without jeopardizing human life. As a result, UAVs may help with real-time surveillance of a vast region without jeopardizing the safety and security of anyone involved. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can help to find people and animals in danger so they can be saved.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Remote sensing</title><p id="Par66">Drone technology is increasingly being applied by amateurs to collect high-resolution imaging data of isolated places, such as mountaintops, coastlines, and islands. The usage of UAVs serves as a link between aerial, ground-based and space-borne remotely sensed data. UAVs' cost-effectiveness and ultralight features enable spatial and temporal resolution observation. Disease diagnosis, water quality inspection, famine monitoring, gas and oil yield estimations, conservation of natural resources, geological calamity survey, topographical survey, woodland mapping, hydrological modeling, and crop management are all possible applications of UAV remotely sensed. Poor water quality because of wastewater discharge and nutrient pollution is a critical concern in some marine and coastal environments. Particularly, nutrient flow from agricultural, urban, and industrial activities can cause harmful algal blooms (HABs), ultimately producing the harmful toxins. Some research labs in Virginia and Florida, USA are focusing on the use of UAVs to early trace and detect HABs through hyperspectral sensors. However, there are several challenges which must be tackled to make this technology practical for coastal monitoring activities. Moreover, this technique is also being utilized in archaeological and cartography for crowd-sourced mapping and the generation of 3D atmospheric maps.

UAVs may save a lot of time and resources by providing real-time imaging data of desired sites. Resulting that, the SAR group is able to detect and pinpoint precisely where aid is necessary. Drones, for example, can be used to follow lost mountaineers on any trip or to defend humans in any isolated forest or desert. Drones may therefore aid in the tracking of unlucky victims as well as any difficult terrain or harsh weather conditions. Drones can deliver critical medical equipment before an emergency or physician arrives. Drones containing food supplies and medical supplies such as vaccines, medical kits and life-saving jackets can be sent to disaster-stricken communities and isolated locations. Drones, for example, can deliver clothing, water, and other essentials to stranded people in difficult regions before rescue workers arrive.

Authors of a recent research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>] examined the use of UAVs to detect and monitor defects in overhead transmission lines. To find defects, both climbing robots and flying UAVs can be utilized. These inspection tasks may be carried out by UAVs at a cheaper cost than helicopters and with a lower risk than traditional foot patrol. Fixed-wing UAVs, which can fly at high altitude and speed than other types of UAVs, are most commonly used for rough inspection. Multirotor UAVs, on the other hand, obtain photographs in the air at a closer distance from the objects by hovering. Because of their excellent 3D mobility, multirotor UAVs are ideal.

In natural disaster conditions e.g., typhoons, hurricanes or Tsunamis, atmospheric condition tends to be a cardinal challenge for UAV missions. In these detrimental conditions, UAVs cannot hover and cannot take accurate readings or data and cannot operate in extreme conditions. Therefore, researchers should address the specifications and UAV capabilities to withstand these adverse weather conditions and can complete weather-sensitive missions efficiently and safely. Specifically, wind speed should be taken into account for smooth UAV operations and it should be involved in UAV’s strategic mission plan and deployment phase.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par106">There should be proper insurance liability due to damages caused by UAVs. Several media reports describe soft tissue injuries, eye loss and severe lacerations due to UAV accidents. In addition to property damages and injuries due to UAV crash, UAV also cause accident with aircrafts, liability doe damaged goods and dropped cargo. Liability for UAV use also contains an enormous threat to individual privacy.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par107">Another major concern of privacy arises with the use of UAVs. UAVs are incorporated with cameras or other equipment which can capture photos or record videos; which may result in violation of individual’s privacy. To tackle this problem in USA, Center of Democracy and Technology (CDT) informed Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to develop specific regulations to preserve privacy. For this purpose, Privacy by Design (PbD) was introduced which supports compensations for privacy violations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>]. PbD regulations notably restrict the privacy intrusion. Moreover, consistent UAVs flights can damage the market value of some companies by revealing their trade strategic plans and secrets.</p></list-item></list><fig id="Fig15"><label>Fig. 15</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Limitations of current stage of UAV usage</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11370_2022_452_Fig15_HTML.png" id="MO15"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>Security issues</title><p id="Par108">In this section, we have discussed different cyber security issues on UAVs such as:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par109">UAVs mostly suffer from Hijacking, denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed DoS attacks because of the unavailability of appropriate DoS/DDoS resistant strategies. Signal spoofing trough hijacking can harm the behavior of some UAVs. GPS Signal spoofing attacks occur due to inlaying or injecting wrong information from the GPS channels by the miscreant as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">16</xref>. In hijacking, full control of UAV can be stolen by the through inserting extra commands. Similarly, session hijacking can severely damage communication links of UAVs. Moreover, DoS attacks impose severe availability challenges as attacker can cause network congestion by sending multiple requests. DoS attacks occur due to overflow data in communication links to cause interruptions, putting extra load on processing units and by depleting the batteries. In DDos, the attacker overwhelms the UAV by sending traffic from several sources to introduce unreachability issues. These attacks can be mitigated by sensing, tracing signal distortion and high authentication.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par110">Current countermeasure algorithms are available for single UAV networks. Thus, there is a need to develop or modify existing algorithms for multi-UAVs.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par111">According to Shakhatreh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>], existing simulation test beds are not complete mature. Similarly, available emulators for security analysis are only suitable for specific software and hardware designs. Thus, there is a need to develop customized simulators and tools.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par112">Existing security analyses neglect the software and hardware differences for different types of UAVs. In contrast, some attacks only occur in particular software or hardware design. In contrast, security measures are suitable for any specific UAV and cannot be implemented to different UAV systems. Thus, there is a need to design unified security measure which can be implemented to all UAVs.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par113">Among various security threats, GCS threats are very harmful as sensitive data can be leaked through software tools and malicious operating commands. A compromised GCS receives erroneous commands from attacker. These attacks usually occur due to viruses, key loggers and malwares. Mitigative solutions such as GCS authentications are needed to secure UAV data to be leaked to unauthorized processes, entities and users. Figure <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">17</xref> illustrates some GCS attacks.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par114">In some scenarios, attacker can misguide UAVs by sending some erroneous warning texts. It can cause network traffic jams. The attacker can masquerade as a legitimate user to give false information, wrong commands or corrupt data to substantially degrade UAV performance. These attacks occur due to the unavailability of authentication strategies as any adversary can pretend like a legitimate user to cause interference in the network.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par115">In some cases, the attackers can steal the UAV path planning information or monitor UAV trajectories for any illegal activity by using this data. These threats can leverage the attacker UAV around the legitimate UAV.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par116">Eavesdropping is another major concern which occurs due to the absence of preventive strategies like data encryption. In such scenario, the adversary can access the legitimate UAV’s data. Non-repudiation can be used to strengthen the security measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>]. In such case, specific information is needed for any confirmation to prevent from security breaches.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par117">Another important factor is the integrity of UAV mission which relates with data accuracy and transfer without any interference. If integrity protection strategies are absent, the data becomes invalid as attacker can damage the original data.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par118">In some scenarios, UAV hardware components do not respond accurately and change their target behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>]. Such kinds of attacks are performed to cause UAV mission failure or steal confidential data.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par119">Another critical attack is flight control computer attack which can change mission instructions or parameters to interrupt UAV flight control. On-board software or hardware tools can be used to protect from such attacks. It may contain warning generation, controller estimation or real-time monitoring in order to respond immediately against any possible risk.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par120">In some cases, the attacker misguides UAV to stop following any intended trajectory through intended tampering on onboard navigational devices. Due to these attacks, the UAVs cannot provide accurate position and location to the control system.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par121">It is highly critical to develop advanced mechanisms to combat ever evolving security risks against UAV communication, infrastructure and reliability. Major security concern related to delivery-based UAVs is hijacking, where attacker can steal or damage its load. In case of multimedia-, entertainment- or commercial-based UAVs, disruption its transmission can severely impact the whole network performance. In such scenario, UAV authentication is required, which can cause excessive delays. To cope with different security challenges, ML algorithms are proposed. ML-enabled physical layer security adopted to reduce the impact of malicious UAVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>]. Furthermore, anti-jamming strategies can be implemented to enhance physical layer security (PLS) performance against potential jammers.

It is due to limited power constraints and processing utilities. Hence, researchers should find deep-learning-based novel strategies for UAVs, particularly for SAR mission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">144</xref>]. These schemes can support contextual decisions and learning on the basis of trajectory information. The gathered information can be utilized to ensure efficient autonomous piloting of UAVs. As UAVs suffer from both storage and energy limitations, thus, lightweight and portable ML, DL, and RL approaches can be adopted to tackle these limitations. AI/ML-based solution can be implemented in a wide variety of scenarios for UAV communication as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig18" ref-type="fig">18</xref>.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par124">Novel strategies for UAV energy harvesting and novel material for UAV batteries must be investigated to achieve extended missions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">145</xref>].

In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">146</xref>], authors proposed a convolutional neural network method to assist avalanches search and rescue operation through UAV captured images. Similarly, algorithms for UAVs swarms, swarms optimization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">147</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">148</xref>], coordination, collision avoidance and UAVs trajectory plans are also needed.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par126">It is envisaged that with the further development of UAVs with efficient standardizations, privacy rules, image processing algorithms, low-cost sensors, enhanced flight time and larger payload, there is a need to integrate UAVs in diverse applications such as field crop phenotyping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">149</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par127">Imaging processing techniques for UAVs face several critical issues such as varying image orientation, higher overlaps, variable scales and varying altitudes.

There is a need to find robust coordination mechanisms to support such applications.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par133">More research works should be carried out to assess adverse weather effects on UAV robustness to ensure successful mission implementation.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par134">Data filtering techniques should be embedded in UAVs to prevent from redundant data, limit duplicate, illegal access and false locations. UAV can be integrated with emerging intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) to enhance PLS of IRS-assisted UAV system in different scenarios while maintaining computational intricacy and system performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">161</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par135">In future, UAVs may be recharged through different types of energy resources such as fuel cell, solar cell and batteries to prolong flight time and endurance in persistent missions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">162</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">164</xref>]. Considering hybrid power supply feature, it will important to effectively control UAV’s charging characteristics. In addition, UAVs can offload traffic and computation tasks to nearby ground vehicles in order to save power consumption.

Due to geographic limitations and highly dynamic network topology, smartly monitoring UAV’s flight in a collision-free and real-time manner has become a crucial issue. To overcome such issues for distributed and intelligent routing scheduling, deep reinforcement algorithms can be used through efficient transfer learning and accelerating the learning speed.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par139">Present studies on UAVs mainly rely on trusted hardware or a third party integration, whose malfunction can severely damage the system. Therefore, there is a need to propose trust-free mechanisms to avoid illegal activity and develop trust for UAVs in an untrusted environment. In this regard, blockchain technology is a viable approach to ensure security. However, a major hurdle is to develop robust and lightweight blockchain system to withstand network fragmentation due to UAV’s constrained resources and high mobility. Moreover, it can cause complex incorporation problem and requires rigorous testing. Thus, a highly devoted architecture integrating features of both UAVs and blockchain technology is needed.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par140">Existing blockchain-assisted UAV applications need a permissioned or private blockchain networks. These networks are critically vulnerable to threats in case of multi-UAVs networks. Moreover, due to increasing number of potential attacks such as game-theory-based attacks, machine learning (ML), and quantum-based attacks, it is essential to secure blockchain. Thus, research efforts are needed to make private blockchain networks safer, secure and immutable.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par141">New set of regulations and policies for UAVs must be introduced and implemented to ensure efficient, reliable, secure and safe operations of the vehicles. Developing new standardizations is one of the major concerns as UAVs must be interoperable with the current technologies. In order to manage EM spectrum and its bandwidth, it is critically essential for UAVs not to be operating in the congested bandwidth and frequency spectrum. It is also crucial to keep the knowledge of published regulatory agreements by NATO for UAVs. This regulation defines the standard data protocols and message formats. It also enables a standard interface between ground coalitions and UAVs. Additionally, it indicates the coalition-shared database which permits data sharing between smart sources. In the US, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) provides certification for remote piloting, even for commercial operators. Commercial UAVs should follow the rules set by the FAA for reliable operations. For example, commercial UAVs must have a weight of 55 pounds and their operational range must be below 400 feet above the ground in case of uncontrolled airspace as indicated by Class G. On the other hand, certain authorizations and permissions must be attained to fly in controlled airspace as indicated by Class C, D and E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">165</xref>]. UAVs which will be utilized for public operations must have a certificate issued from the FAA, operating body must comply with all regulations, rules, laws and federal of each specific area, city, province, state and country.</p></list-item></list><fig id="Fig18"><label>Fig. 18</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>AI/ML-based solutions for UAV communication</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11370_2022_452_Fig18_HTML.png" id="MO18"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec43" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par142">As UAVs have gained significant research attention, more and more patents and scientific articles are being published. The rapidly expanding research and development of UAVs is a consequence of these innovations. Furthermore, the demand for high mobility, more autonomy and bigger range of UAVs resulted in the design of novel systems for battery swapping, docking stations and precision landing. The application of these is already being used for fire detection and prevention, disaster monitoring, precision agriculture, wireless communication, remote sensing, power-line monitoring, and highway traffic control etc. In this regard, we comprehensively review ongoing developments of UAVs, accomplished by both academia and industrial sectors. We review academic contributions pertinent to UAV types, classifications, standardizations, swarms and charging methods. Furthermore, this study outlines the rapidly expanding interest of researchers, state authorities and business bodies to further harness and utilize the complete features of this promising technology. We briefly discuss UAV characteristics such as payload, altitude, range, speed, and flight time. Moreover, application scenarios, potential challenges and security issues are also examined.
