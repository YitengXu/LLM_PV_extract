Here, we report the controllable fabrication of TCFs for moisture-sensing applications based on heating-rate-triggered, 3-dimensional porous conducting networks through drop casting lithography of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) ink. How ink formula and baking conditions influence the self-assembled microstructure of the TCFs is discussed. The sensor presents high-performance properties, including a reasonable sheet resistance (2.1 kohm/sq), a high visible-range transmittance (&gt;69%, PET = 90%) and good stability when subjected to cyclic loading (&gt;1000 cycles, better than indium tin oxide film) during processing, when formulation parameters are well optimized (weight ratio of SWCNT to PEDOT:PSS: 1:0.5, SWCNT concentration: 0.3 mg/ml and heating rate: 36 °C/minute). Moreover, the benefits of these kinds of TCFs were verified through a fully transparent, highly sensitive, rapid response, noncontact moisture-sensing device (5 × 5 sensing pixels).</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>21028</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>28</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep19632.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>22</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep19632" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep19632</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Flexible and transparent electronics (FTEs) will be integral to the next generation of electronics, for which classical silicon electronics are not suitable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.

However, on flexible substrates, indium tin oxide (ITO) film performance is limited for flexible electronics because as the film mechanically degrades, their conductivity quickly decreases.

To date, these 3D-PCNs have predominantly been fabricated by the following dominant processes: etching with a high concentration of waste lye<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, blocking copolymers using the template method with plenty of polymer residue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, or using the self-assembly method using a toxic nonpolar solvent like benzene or chloroform<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Drawbacks for each of these processes have inspired the development of a more facile and effective method of fabrication.</p><p>Here, we develop single-walled carbon-nanotube-based porous transparent conductive films (SWCNT-PTCFs) with self-assembled 3-dimensional conducting networks using a facile and novel approach.</p><p>First, SWCNTs with high aspect ratio (2500–20000) were chosen as material for the conductive backbone. To inhibit the agglomeration of SWCNTs, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) was used as a dispersant because of the π–π intermolecular interaction between SWCNTs and conjugated thiophene chains in PEDOT:PSS, confirmed by our previous research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. We prepared stable and monodisperse SWCNT/PEDOT:PSS inks, which we display along with their TEM images in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S1</xref>. The advantages of using PEDOT:PSS as a dispersing agent is that it creates a highly conductive interface at CNT/CNT junctions. We used this strategy in our previous work to design highly conductive thermoplastic composites enriched with PEDOT:PSS-coated CNTs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Digital image of SWCNT/PEDOT:PSS inks with different concentrations ((i) 12.5 mg/ml, (ii) 0.3 mg/ml, (iii) 0.2 mg/ml, (iv); 0.1 mg/ml) and its TEM image (the scale bar is 50 nm); (<bold>b</bold>) Schematic illustration of the preparation of SWCNT-PTCFs; (<bold>c</bold>) Schematic illustration of the transition from a 2D to a 3D microstructure with varying heating rates.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep19632_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>Second, SWCNT-PTCFs were fabricated by the drop casting method (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Ink properties and baking processes, such as the ratio between SWCNT and PEDOT:PSS, the concentration of SWCNT and heating rate, were investigated systematically. Our objective was to promote a transition from a 2-dimensional (2D) to a 3D microstructure of the conducting networks by increasing the heating rate throughout the baking process, allowing the fabrication of SWCNT-PTCFs to be controlled (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Note that the fabrication process will be largely dependent on both electrical and mechanical behaviors of PEDOT:PSS with humidity and chaotic accumulation of the high aspect ratio and flexibility of SWCNT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Porous graphene films were prepared alongside for comparison.</p><p>Third, the efficiency of fabricated SWCNT-PTCFs on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was measured by assessing the physical properties of the resulting sensor. Properties were investigated using Raman spectra, sheet resistance, dynamic fatigue properties and total optical/diffuse transmittance (T<sub>T</sub> and T<sub>D</sub>) with a haze value (=T<sub>D</sub>/T<sub>T</sub>). Taken together, these results provided detailed information on the physical properties of SWCNT-PTCFs, which are useful for determining where they can be suitably applied.</p><p>Finally, we demonstrate the practical benefits of SWCNT-PTCFs by applying them to a fully transparent, highly sensitive, rapid response, noncontact moisture sensing film with 5 × 5 sensing pixels. Here, SWCNT-PTCFs are used to detect the proximity of a human index finger without direct contact based only on detecting humidity. The high performance of SWCNT-PTCFs was proven by their high sensitivity, good stability and rapid response/recovery ability. In the future, this technology could have potential for a different sort of human–machine interaction, compared to existing touch panels that operate through direct contact. And lastly, we demonstrated the sensitivity of the film by tracking the real-time movement of an insect in 3D space (e.g., an ant).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Characterization of SWCNT/PEDOT:PSS ink</title><p>The quality of SWCNTs and the homogeneity and stability of its ink are integral to the final SWCNT-based porous transparent conductive film product. Hence, SWCNTs with an outer diameter of 1–2 nm and a length of 5–30 μm were chosen for the transparent conductive material, as shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>. The high aspect ratio of these CNTs (up to 2500–30000) makes them excellent candidates to effectively create a continuous and steady conductive network at a low percolation threshold value.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>SEM images of SWCNT-PTCFs with self-assembled 3D porous microstructures at different magnifications.</p><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Pure SWCNTs; (<bold>b</bold>) Different ratios of SWCNT to PEDOT:PSS (A1: 1:1, A2: 1:0.75 and A3: 1.0.5, respectively); (<bold>c</bold>) Different heating rates (B1: 0 °C/minutes, B2: 36 °C/minutes and B3: 72 °C/minutes, respectively); <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> is a zoom on the blue-marked domain in B2 (<bold>d</bold>) Different concentrations of SWCNT (C1: 0.1 mg/ml, C2: 0.2 mg/ml and C3: 0.3 mg/ml, respectively); Fig. 2 is a zoom on the blue-marked domain in C2.

Each SWCNT can be identified with clear boundaries. Moreover, a very thin and unsmooth PEDOT/PSS layer (approximately 1–4-nm thick or thicker due to a hydrophilic amorphous phase from PSS) on the outer wall of SWCNTs can be observed, indicating that the agglomeration of SWCNTs was successfully prevented. This can be attributed to the conjugated aromatic chains from PEDOT:PSS that can strongly anchor to the surface of SWCNT via π–π interactions without disrupting the electronic structure of the SWCNT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Preparation of SWCNT-PTCFs</title><p>SWCNT-PTCF microstructures can be effectively controlled using different ink formulas and baking conditions, as shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b–d</xref>.</p><p>The influence of the ratio between SWCNT and PEDOT:PSS in the ink formula is discussed in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>. We found that when the ratio is 1:1, SWCNTs and PEDOT:PSS chains were completely intertwined, making it difficult to distinguish the existence of SWCNTs. When this ratio increases to 1:0.75, the crossed networks of SWCNTs become detectable and porosities emerge with diameters in the 30–100-nm range. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that PEDOT:PSS films between the crossed SWCNTs begin to shrink during the baking process. When this ratio is increased to 1:0.5, the amount of PEDOT:PSS becomes insufficient to prevent the PEDOT:PSS films between the crossed SWCNTs from completely breaking apart during the baking process. As a result, a highly porous network of SWCNTs is formed, which is only slightly attached to the substrate and with much greater porosities in the 100-nm to 1000-nm range.</p><p>The influence of heating rate on the microstructure of SWCNT-PTCFs is summarized in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref> (B1, B2, B3 and <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). The results show that as heating rate increases, the whole SWCNT-PEDOT/PSS assembly begins to form a 3D structure. More specifically, the porosities between the crossed SWCNTs emerge in the vertical and horizontal planes, gradually forming a 3D porous microstructure of TCFs with increased heating rate.</p><p>The formation of the porous structure in the horizontal plane comes from the break of PEDOT:PSS films among crossed SWCNTs and has little connection to heating rate; however, in the vertical plane, the porous structure is created by the volatilization of a solvent. At slower heating rates, SWCNTs coated with PEDOT:PSS have already deposited by gravity and adhered to firmly to the PET substrate before all of the solvent has volatilized: the result is a 2D TCF. Another distinct difference between 2D and 3D structures is that the SWCNT track in a 2D structure is wider than that in a 3D structure, due to the stack of SWCNTs coated with PEDOT:PSS in the vertical plane. As heating rate increases, the speed of volatilization of the solvent increases, leading to the drying of the PEDOT:PSS coat on SWCNTs before it has been completely deposited onto the PET substrate, which causes PEDOT:PSS film among the crossed SWCNTs to break, forming a porous structure in the vertical plane.</p><p>Most importantly, as we described earlier, SWCNTs with a high aspect ratio (up to 2500–30000) have excellent flexibility and strong spatial extension similar to carbon fibers, which helps maintain the stability of the 3D microstructure during the baking process. In addition, an earlier report noted that the physical properties of PEDOT:PSS have a high dependency on water content, which was attributed to water uptake during the hygroscopic (PSS-HSO<sub>3</sub>) phase that weakens the cohesion between PEDOT/PSS grains via hydrogen bonds. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">[30]</xref> Thus, during the baking process, the physical properties of PEDOT/PSS become more favorable as water content decreases, ultimately becoming glue-like bonds with SWCNT at junctions. For these reasons, a continuous and steadily conductive network with a 3D porous microstructure can be successfully fabricated.</p><p>Increasing the concentration of SWCNTs also caused the 3D film to form smaller holes (smaller than 30 nm in diameter) on the microstructure of the SWCNT-PTCFs, as shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref> (C1, C2, C3) due to the stack of SWCNTs, not only the thickness variation.</p><p>For comparison we also analyzed graphene/PEDOT:PSS film though graphene/PEDOT:PSS ink and found a strong relationship between the graphene microstructure and baking conditions with brightness variation of the film, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S5</xref>. More specifically, brightness variation mainly results from the state-space transmission of graphene sheets, with a gradually increasing angle between the substrate with increased heating rate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Characterization of SWCNT-PTCFs</title><p>To further explain the influence of different ratios of SWCNT to PEDOT:PSS, Raman spectrum were used to investigate the molecular changes in SWCNT-TCFs, as shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>.

With increasing SWCNT concentration from 0.1 mg/ml to 0.3 mg/ml, the sheet resistance of SWCNT-PTCFs decreases from 139 kohm/sq to 2.1 kohm/sq due to the increased thickness of SWCNT-PEDOT:PSS film and the decreased porous diameter from 800–1000 nm to 150–300 nm (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). Meanwhile, when the porous microstructure changed from 2D to 3D with increased heating rate, sheet resistance increased slightly from 51 kohm/sq to 89 kohm/sq. This is mainly because the porosity in the vertical plane decreased the stacking density of SWCNT along with decreased porous diameter from 900–1100 nm to 700–800 nm (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p><p>Mechanical flexibility and durability of the prepared SWCNT-PTCFs were also investigated in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>. Variations in the mechanical-resistance of the films on the PET substrate were recorded as a function of cycle number under a fixed external compression stress. Meanwhile, the ITO film (130-nm thick) on the PET substrate was also constructed for comparison. Results show that sheet resistance increased gradually with a continuous compression cycle, especially for films with a 3D porous microstructure (incl. B1 to B3, C1 to C3) because they are less adhesive to the substrate. Adhesive ability increased with the increasing film thickness because, to a certain extent, thicker films inhibit the development of microscopic cracks that can form perpendicular to the compressing stress, as seen in the curves of C1 to C3. These results are favorable over those of ITO films with a drastic variation in resistance.</p><p>More details can be seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S6</xref>. In general, our SWCNT-PTCFs exhibited excellent mechanical flexibility and durability under compression stress.</p><p><xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e,f</xref> present the optical properties of the prepared SWCNT-PTCFs with PET film as a refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></p><p>All films exhibit stable and uniform total optical transmittance (T<sub>T</sub>) and diffuse transmittance (T<sub>D</sub>) in the visible range and T<sub>T</sub> is inversely proportional to the concentration of SWCNT and heating rate. T<sub>T</sub> was expected to decrease with thicker films. The relationship with heating rate can be explained by the higher reflectivity of films with 3D networks compared with 2D networks. Finally, T<sub>D</sub> increased with both the film thickness and heating rate. As a consequence, films obtained by high heating rate feature a higher haze that is a direct consequence of the 3D microstructure of the obtained network that is promoting light dispersion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Fully Transparent, flexible, noncontact sensing device</title><p>To demonstrate the benefit of the SWCNT-PTCFs, they were integrated into a fully transparent, flexible sensing panel with 5 × 5 sensing pixels.

The RH decreased from 72.8 RH % to 43.2 RH % with an increasing distance from the meter of 1 mm to 1 cm, compared with the humidity of the room of 42.1 RH %. Results in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref> also show that the resistance response of the SWCNT-PTCFs was highly distance dependent due to the change in humidity. Specifically, sensitivity to humidity (defined as Delta R/R<sub>0</sub>) of PTCFs with a 3D microstructure is approximately 1.5-fold higher than that of PTCFs with a 2D microstructure; no change in the resistance response of PEDOT:PSS films was observed.</p><p>The real-time dynamic response curves of SWCNT-PTCFs with repeated distance (4 mm, to sensing films) of a human index finger were compared in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>. Results indicate that these films can detect RH with high sensitivity, good stability and fast response/recovery ability, reproducing with a stable signal output. The response and recovery time was defined as the time required to attaining 90% of the steady state value, which were typically only 0.5 s and 0.6 s, respectively, with the ratio of response time/recover time approaching 1 for PTCFs with 3D microstructure. These values were much better than those for PTCFs with a 2D microstructure, for PEDOT:PSS-TCFs and than those previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. These performances can be attributed to the 3D microstructure of PTCFs, which bare a greater surface area for exposure to ambient humidity.</p><p>For the working mechanism, according to previous description, there is a PEDOT:PSS layer coated on the outer wall of SWCNTs with the thickness of 1–4 nm through π–π interactions. This layer has strong humidity sensitivity because the hydrophilic amorphous phase from PSS can absorb water molecules, further generating hydronium ions (H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>) or free hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>), which form an electrical double layer (C<sub>EDL</sub>) between PEDOT:PSS chains, as shown in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref> and equation (1)<sup>40</sup>. This layer acts to reduce the conduction of original materials according to quantum conductance calculations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. More importantly, this phenomenon also take place at the junctions of SWCNTs, resulting in non-ohmic contacts, which is important in light of the 3D microstructure of PTCFs. These variations cause an increase in the total resistance.<disp-formula id="Equ1"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep19632_Equ1_HTML.gif"/></disp-formula></p><p>In addition, the dependence of the capacitance or impedance of 3D SWCNT-PTCFs to humidity and frequency was also investigated to verify the above explanation, as shown in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>. The value of C<sub>EDL</sub> is proportional to environment humidity: 189 nF (RH = 85%), 155 nF (RH = 68%) and 121 nF (RH = 41.3%) at 10 kHz Compared to 42 pF, 34 pF and 29 pF at 2 MHz. The impedance value of the 3D SWCNT-PTCFs experiences a similar phenomenon. All of these results show that the existence of C<sub>EDL</sub> changes with environmental humidity.</p><p>The high performance of our carbon-based humidity sensor reported here provides a basis for its future development towards a new age of noncontact human–machine interactions. We illustrated the benefits of our 3D SWCNT-PTCFs by continuously and accurately mapping the movement of an ant within a 3D space, as shown in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e,f</xref>. Only point D (13.9 mm) was not accurately represented, but his was expected as this point fell outside of the defined space (7.6 mm, green plane in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>). The location of the ant in X-Y direction was predicted by changes in the resistance of the sensing pixel, whereas the location of the ant in the Z direction can be estimated from the resistance variation of the sensing pixel according to the relationship between resistance variation and height. In this case no variation indicates that the ant is out of the defined space.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In conclusion, we have reported on the controllable fabrication of TCFs with a self-assembled 3D porous microstructure produced by drop casting SWCNT/PEDOT:PSS ink triggered by heating rate. We reviewed the roles of the ink formula and baking conditions on the microstructure of the SWCNT-PTCFs. Our SWCNT-PTCFs exhibited an acceptable level of electrical conductivity, a high visible-range transmittance and an excellent dynamic mechanical property. The fully transparent, flexible, noncontact sensing device (5 × 5 sensing pixels) integrated with these SWCNT-PTCFs had high sensitivity, good stability and rapid response/recovery ability; it could even continuously and accurately map the trail of a moving ant within a 3D space. Therefore, these types of films are promising for future application to noncontact human–machine interactions, for energy storage and conversion, gas adsorption and filtration and as a catalyst because of its 3D porous microstructure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Materials</title><p>The PEDOT/PSS aqueous dispersion (1.3 wt. %, Clevios™ PH1000) was purchased from HC Starck, Inc.
