StO2 was continuously measured on the thenar eminence with InSpectra® (Model 650, Hutchinson Technology, Minn. USA). From the StO2 values and the tissue hemoglobin index (THI) HbO2 was calculated. Blood pressure, StO2 and HbO2 values at the beginning and immediately after blood donation(BD) were calculated. The ischemic stress test was performed by occluding the brachial artery by a sphygmomanometer cuff inflated 50mmHg over systolic blood pressure for 3 minutes. Pre- defined variables were calculated out of the recorded StO2 and HbO2 values. To detect a difference in variable before and after blood donation, the non-parametric Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test was used.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Median age was 30.5 yrs (range 19–62), median body weight 58 kg (range 50–65).

In a logistic regression model with ICU mortality as end point, adjusted to age, gender, SAPS II, category of admission and ICU admission time, for patients admitted during daytime we found an OR =0.886 (95% CI =0.620–1.265).</p></sec><sec id="Sec41" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Admission in ICU is more common during “off hours”. The results of the few studies that examined the effect of the time of admission on outcome were contradictory probably reflecting the different organizations in the care of critical ill patients and type of ICU. In our unit, there is a consultant on site 24h/day, every day and the nurse-to-patient ratio is at least 1:2. As long as adequate staffing is maintained, and necessary diagnostic and therapeutic modalities are available, weekend and night admission should not be associated with differences in patients outcome.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec42"><title>0358</title><sec id="Sec43"><title>Off Hour Admission to the Intensive Care is not Associated with Increased Mortality</title><p>I.

Phosphoinositide 3-kinase |gamma (PI3K|gamma) is a critical mediator of directional cell movement and has been implicated as an attractive target in experimental ALI. Here, we sought to characterize the role of PI3K|gamma in mediating the different steps of PMN trafficking in the lung.

PMN accumulation in the different compartments of the lung (intravascular space, interstitium, alveolar space) was determined by flow cytometry. Chimeric mice were created by transfer of bone marrow between wildtype and PI3K|gamma-/- mice. We evaluated the small molecule PI3K|gamma inhibitor AS-605240 for its efficiency to block PMN transmigration in vivo and in vitro.

However, transepithelial migration into the alveolar space was reduced in these mice significantly. When irradiated PI3K|gamma-/- mice were reconstituted with bone marrow from wildtype mice, migratory activity into the alveolar space was restored only partially, suggesting a proinflammatory role for endothelial PI3K|gamma. A small molecule PI3K|gamma inhibitor reduced chemokine-induced PMN migration in vitro when PMNs but not when endothelial cells were treated. The inhibitor also reduced LPS-induced PMN migration in vivo but did not affect pulmonary microvascular permeability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec92" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that PI3K|gamma is required for transepithelial but not for transendothelial migration in LPS-induced lung injury.

The triggering mechanisms for ARDS/ALI are not completely understood, and current treatments provide supportive care rather than target specific mechanisms that have a definitive effect upon outcome. A recent study revealed a protective effect of dexmedetomidine in a rat model of sepsis, demonstrating a decrease in mortality and inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1</xref>). With this in mind, we investigated the effect of dexmedetomidine on lung edema formation and albumin permeability in an airway endotoxin model of ALI.</p></sec><sec id="Sec104"><title>Methods</title><p>Mice were divided into four groups: no lung injury/no treatment (control), lung injury/no treatment (LPS/saline), no lung injury/ dexmedetomidine treatment (saline/Dex), and lung injury/dexmedetomidine treatment (LPS/Dex). Under general anesthesia, the subclavian vein was cannulated after which the mouse was allowed to recover for approximately 60 minutes. The mice were subsequently placed in a closed chamber and exposed to nebulized normal saline (no injury) or 10 mg of LPS in saline solution for 60 minutes to induce an inflammatory response. After an additional 60 minutes, mice were given an IV bolus injection of saline or Dex (10 ug/kg) followed by a constant infsuion (10 ug/kg/hr) for 2 hrs. Mice were also injected with 125I-labeled albumin 60 min prior to euthanasia under general anesthesia at which time blood and lung tissue were collected for determination of extravascular lung water (ELW) content, lung edema formation (wet/dry weight ratio), and albumin permeability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec105" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Exposure of mice to nebulized LPS increased ELW from 15.5 ± 4.0 ul to 40.5 ± 5.5 ul (P&lt;0.05) following LPS exposure, whereas ELW in mice treated with Dex was significantly reduced (26.9 ± 4.5 ul) and not different from control or Dex treatment alone (17.8 ± 3.1 ul). In addition, LPS-induced increase in the lung W/D ratio (16% increase over control; P&lt;0.05) was prevented by Dex treatment. Lastly, exposure of mice to nebulized LPS increased vascular albumin permeability from 5.2 ± 0.6 to 6.6 ± 0.8%, whereas treatment with Dex 2 hrs after the onset of LPS exposure tended to block the permeability increase (5.5 ± 0.8% in lungs exposed to Dex alone vs. 5.7 ± 0.7% in LPS/Dex group) though this effect did not reach statistical significance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec106" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, treatment with dexmedetomidine after induction of lung injury by LPS significantly decreased extravascular water accumulation in the lung, thereby attenuating edema formation. 125I-albumin permeability may also be reduced.

For patients with critical care hyperglycaemia, relative risk for development of IGT or IFG was 2.26 (95% CI 1.21–4.22) and for development of type 2 diabetes 5.35 (95% CI 1.71-16-72).</p></sec><sec id="Sec139" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results show that patients with critical care hyperglycaemia are at increased risk of developing impaired glucose control or type 2 diabetes mellitus in the 5 years follow-up period.

Arg metabolism was studied using primed-continuous infusion of stable isotopes of arginine, citrulline and urea, and subsequent measurement of arterial amino acid concentrations and tracer-tracee ratios. De novo Arg production is the Cit to Arg conversion and whole body arginase activity was measured as Arg to Urea conversion. None of the patients received blood transfusions.

According to animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1</xref>], anterior pituitary dysfunction, particularly flat growth hormone (GH) secretion pattern may contribute to muscle wasting syndrome during protracted critical illness.

Design: Arterial blood was sampled every 30 min from 22:00 to 06:30 on day 4 and 17 of their ICU stay and GH was sampled using RIA. As a measure of GH secretion we use basal level, number and amplitude of pulses (derived manually from individual GH vs. time plots), and area under the GH curve. For these experiments, we used control groups from a previously publihed study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2</xref>]. Mann-Whitney or Wilcoxon tests are used for comparisons, as appropriate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec150" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>During acute illness (day 4) patients without TBI tend to secrete more GH than those with TBI (median AUC 74 vs. 130 mIU/l, p=.46), because GH pulses tend to have higher amplitude (p=.13), but there is no difference in No of pulses (p=.52). During acute-to-protracted transition (i.e. from day 4 to 17), we did not observe any significant change in GH secretion pattern (see Table), but the overall amount of GH secreted tend to decrease in patients without TBI (p=.098).

In incompetent patients 96% responders considered physicians as a key person for decision making. Only 57 (28,9%) resp. 87 (43%) physicians include family resp. nursing staff in decision-making process. Physicians from small hospitals and with shorter clinical practice include relatives and nurses to EOLD significantly fewer. The majority of responders agree with maintenance of analgosedation and infusion therapy, 76% keep ventilatory support, 43% nutrition, 49% oxygen and 14% antibiotics. Euthanasia is acceptable in 39 (19,1%) physicians, from those most of them were unbelievers. Lack of privacy and absence of family being present was considered as a key barriers for providing death dignity.

In this country there is few studies about the dying process and there is not clear legal definitions about withhold or withdraw support (WWS). It is important to know about the reality of the dying process to provide the best treatment for dying patients. The objectives of this study are: To analyze the deaths occurred in the HU/UFSC; To compare the profile of the patients who died in the ICU to those who died in the wards; To identify if the decisions of WWS, comfort care plans, patients’ identification as dying and/or do-not-resuscitate orders prior to the death were recorded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec207"><title>Methods</title><p>Retrospective cohort study, approved by Ethical Committee. Deaths occurred in patients, admitted to the HU/UFSC from July 2004 to June 2007, were analyzed. Demographic characteristics, clinical features and the treatment performed for the patients who died were evaluated. It was considered if WWS preceded the death. Data was allocated in two groups: G1 to the patients who died in the ICU and G2 to the patients who died in the Wards. Data were analyzed using t Student and χ2 tests (p&lt;value &lt;0,05).</p></sec><sec id="Sec208" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The analyzed hospital has 165 beds (158 in wards and 7 in ICU). During the study period 14330 patients were admitted at hospital. The hospital mortality rates was 4,95%. This index in ICU was 23,77% and in Wards was 3,39%. The data of 710 patients had been analyzed. Two hundred and sixty one died in ICU (G1) and 449 in the wards (G2). The most of patients were men in both groups (56,9% in G1, 53% in G2) and the patients mean age was 57,4±18,1 years (G1) and 69,7±15,8 years (G2) (p&lt;0.001). WWS preceded 37,5% of the deaths in G1 and 9,6% in G2 (p&lt;0,001). Vasopressor drugs were the most frequently WWS in G1, while intensive care admission was the most WWS in G2. Do-not-resuscitate orders was documented in 0,76% of patient's records (G1) and in 2,44% (G2). Comfort care plans were present in 0,38% in cases (G1) and in 11,13% (G2). Patients were identificate as dying in 2,68% (G1) and 29,84% (G2).

Legal issues regarding power of attorney, compensation claims, dealing with the police etc are not taught at medical school yet are often immediate concerns for both patients and their families.</p></sec><sec id="Sec214"><title>Methods</title><p>A legal firm specialising in medicolegal issues, particularly brain and spinal injuries, was approached about providing pro-bono advice to patients on NICU. After approval by the Hospital Trust a 12 month pilot project was established with lawyers spending one day per week on the NICU. Formal consent/assent was sought from the patient or their relatives by the ICU consultant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec215" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>31 cases were reviewed. Demographics were similar to the overall patient mix on NICU. 10 cases were road traffic accidents (passenger or pedestrian), 6 RTA (driver), 7 medical cases (SAH or ICH), 2 industrial accidents, 1 sport related injury, 3 alleged assaults and 2 falls. Breach of care and the possibility of compensation was identified in 22 cases. Non-compensation issues were identified for all cases and a total of 123 hours spent on noncompensation issues. The legal firm involved were instructed to pursue compensation claims in 7/22 cases. Feedback from families has been universally positive.

Indeed, the RRS calls are usually made for all instable patients in the wards, independently of their resuscitation status. So, some calls are made for patients with do-not-attemp-reanimation (DNAR) orders, and others, have a DNAR order registred after the evaluation of the instability. We quantify here the utilization of resourses of RRS to attend DNAR patients in 6 months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec220"><title>Methods</title><p>We describe the proportion of calls made for DNAR patients, the call criteria and the management of this group of patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec221" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In 6 months, the RRS received 536 calls, 33 was for patients with a previous DNAR order and 31 for patients that received a DNAR order during the RRS attending. This sums a total of 12% of calls for DNAR patients. The median age was 80 ± 11 years. The more frequent calling criteria for DNAR patients was respiratory distress (30%, 19 calls), low oxigen saturation (28%, 18 calls), death constatation (27%, 17 calls) and hypotension (13%, 8 calls). The RRS prescribed medications for 34 (53%) DNAR patients and solicited adictional exams for 12 (19%). Eleven (17%) DNAR patients were submited to Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) and one (2%) was intubated. From the 64 DNAR patients, 1 (2%) was transferred to ICU and 3 (5%) to High Dependency Unit (HDU).</p></sec><sec id="Sec222" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>These data show that in our experience, a significative proportion of RRS work is dedicated to assist DNAR patients. This group of DNAR patients is old, demand medical attention for respiratory disfunction and has a low rate of investigatory exams performed, low ICU transferences, but high rates of HDU transferences and NIV utilization rates. We suggest that better evaluating the characteristics and needs of this group of patients may provide tools to better organization of care.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec223"><title>Oral Presentations Abstract awards winners — The best preselected abstracts submitted to the congress: 0387–0390</title><sec id="Sec224"><title>0387</title><sec id="Sec225"><title>Impact of Subglottic Secretions Drainage on Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia: A Randomized Multicentre Trial</title><p>J.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, endotoxin) can be used to induce endotoxemia as a model of inflammation in humans, but the effects on microcirculatory perfusion have not been tested before. We were particularly interested in microcirculatory changes during repeated administrations of LPS when endotoxin tolerance developed. The aim of our study was to compare 3 methods to investigate microcirculation and vascular reactivity during endotoxemia and endotoxin tolerance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec255"><title>Methods</title><p>Endotoxin tolerance was induced in 9 volunteers by intravenous injection of 2ng/kg/day lipopolysaccharide on 5 consecutive days. Microcirculation and vascular reactivity was monitored before (t=0) and after (t=2 and 4 hrs) LPS administrations on day 1 and 5. Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) measured thenar muscle tissue saturation before, during and after arterial occlusion (ischemia) was induced by inflating a cuff above the elbow to 50mmHg above systolic blood pressure for 90 seconds. Orthogonal Polarization Spectral imaging (OPS) measured microvascular perfusion sublingually using side stream darkfield imaging in small, medium and large sized microvessels. Forearm blood flow (FBF) was measured by strain-gauge plethysmography during local intra-arterially infusion of endothelial-dependent vasodilatory acetylcholine.</p></sec><sec id="Sec256" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Endotoxin tolerance developed during 5 consecutive days of LPS administration as demonstrated by the attenuated release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and absence of symptoms and fever on the fifth day. Both NIRS and OPS did not demonstrate changes in microcirculation during endotoxemia or endotoxin tolerance in vivo. FBF measurements showed an acetylcholine dose-dependent attenuation (from 5.7±2.6 to 2.6±2.0) after the first administration of LPS (p=0.01), but not after acetylcholine stimulation when tolerance was present (from 6.1±2.1 to 5.8±3.7) on day 5(p=0.25).</p></sec><sec id="Sec257" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this human endotoxin tolerance model, no significant effect of repeated LPS administrations on microcirculatory perfusion could be observed using NIRS (thenar muscle) and OPS (sublingual). The forearm blood flow however, was attenuated after the first administration of LPS, indicating an endothelial dysfunction in endotoxemia in vivo. This attenuated response to acetylcholine was not present after the fifth administration of LPS, which may indicate that tolerance is also present at the levels of the endothelium.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec258"><title>0392</title><sec id="Sec259"><title>Microvascular Density is Strongly Correlated to Oxygen Extraction and Cardiac Output in Septic Shock Patients</title><p>A.

Non-survivors had higher AVP levels than survivors at day 28 (p &lt; 0.001). In SIRS patients without shock, serum osmo-larity was indirectly associated with AVP levels, while mean arterial blood pressure and se-rum osmolarity were associated with AVP in SIRS patients with shock.

Comparisons were tested by the t-test and the Bland-Altman method.</p></sec><sec id="Sec319" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>62 critically ill children, 36 males and 26 females were included. In the 24 EC patients, mean age (±SD) was 19.8±20.1 months with a body weight and body size of 8.0±4.3 kg and 72.7±18.1 cm, respectively. In the 38 non EC patients, mean age was 22.5±1.2 months with a body weight and body size of 9.8±5.1 kg and 77.3±20.7 cm, respectively. These results did not differ between groups. On day 1, CRP was 110.5±65.1 mg/dl in EC and 78.8±87.7 mg/dl (ns) in non EC. 337 indirect calorimetry measurements (5.4±2.5 per patient) were performed; 138 in EC and 199 in non EC. REEm was higher in EC compared to non EC with 57.9±12.3 kcal/kg/d (median 57.5 range: 31.5 to 97.0 and IQ 47.6 to 65.8 kcal/kg/d) in EC and 53.7±10.8 kcal/kg/d (median 52.9, range: 27.8 to 94.1 and IQ 45.6 to 60.3 kcal/kg/d) in non EC (p&lt;0.01).

All patients were sedated and paralyzed, connected to a pneumotach (Hans Rudolph, Inc.) including esophageal pressure and proximal airway flow and pressure monitoring. After having a thorax CTscan, a transverse region 2 cm over the diaphragm was chosen and cine-CTs of 8 seconds at this fix transverse region were performed at each ventilator mode (LightSpeed VCT, GE; image reconstruction at 0,25sec-32 images, 0.4 sec / rotation, 16 × 1,25 mm slices, matrix of 512 × 512).

ALI was then induced by means of surfactant depletion until PaO2 ≤ 200 mmHg. The VT was then set at 6 ml/kg and RR increased to keep the PaCO2 lower than 55 mmHg. After stabilization, a recruitment maneuver was performed (50 cmH2O, 40 s). Thereafter, PEEP was set at 24 cmH2O and decreased to zero in steps of 4 cmH2O (10 min/step). At each step, arterial and mixed venous blood samples were obtained and cardiac output (CO) was measured.

However, neither hospital stay nor days on ventilator or mortality could be positively influenced by CLRT. Most studies, however, lack to report on standards of VAP prophylaxis as well as on duration and practicability of CLRT. We performed a prospective randomized trial of the efficacy of CLRT in mechanically ventilated patients with respect to VAP prophylaxis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec381"><title>Methods</title><p>Patients were eligible if not suffering from pneumonia or acute lung injury but in the need for mechanical ventilation. Patients were randomized within 48 hours after intubation to undergo CLRT in a specially designed bed allowing continuous rotation of the upper part of the body through an arc of 90° or to be treated in supine position. Rotation had to be performed for at least 18 hours per day. All patients were in a semirecumbent position of at least 30°. Suctioning and change of ventilator circuits were standardized. Sedation was allowed only if clinically indicated. All patients received enteral nutrition if possible. Endpoints of the study were spontaneous breathing, death, lack of tolerance, or development of pneumonia defined as newly acquired infiltrate in two consecutive chest x-rays plus signs of inflammation plus purulent bronchial secretions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec382" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Of 150 consecutive patients enrolled, 75 underwent CLRT (mean age 59 ± 16, 50 male) while 75 (age 60±15, 48 male) were randomized into the control group.

In the CLRT group, 7 patients developed VAP (9%) versus 20 patients (27%) in the control group (p &lt;0.01). ICU and hospital survival were 70% and 63% in the CLRT group and 74% and 63% in the control group, respectively (p = n.s.). Comparing CLRT to control group, days on ventilator were 8 ± 5 and 14 ± 23 days (p=0.02), length of hospital stay was 24 ± 22 and 39 ± 45 days (p=0.02), and ventilator free days during the first 28 days were 15 ± 10 versus 11 ± 10 (p=0.04), respectively.

Each answer represents the usual practises in their ICUs, not their personal thought.</p></sec><sec id="Sec421" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Midazolam (MID) is the most common sedative employed for tracheal intubation (TI) (42% of ICUs), followed by propofol (PRO) (36%).Thirty per cent of ICUs do not use NMBs for TI, 27% employ succinylcholine, 24% cisatracurium and 16% rocuronium. For short-term sedation, patients in shock, a midazolam-opioid combination is preferred (50%), followed by remifentanyl combined or not with low doses of other sedatives. For long-term (i.e. ARDS) a midazolam-opioid combination is employed by 71%; 13% employ a midazolam-propofol-opioid combination. 40% of the ICUs do not have a protocolised midazolam or propofol maximum dose limit. For sedation monitoring 51% of the ICUs use the Ramsay scale, 5% the SAS and 3% the RASS; 41% never use sedation scales. 21% use train-of-four monitoring to titrate continuous neuromuscular blockers. No ICU uses pain scales in non-communicative patients nor scales to detect delirium. 51% do not use strategies to avoid midazolam accumulation, 11% employ sequential sedation (replace midazolam with propofol or remifentanil), 11% employ a daily sedation break, 8% bispectral index monitoring and 19% use two or more of the previous strategies. Bispectral monitoring is used by 49% of ICUs, 6% to adjust deep sedation, 6% to titrate barbiturate treatment, 3% to monitor sedation during neuromuscular blockade and 34% in two or more of these situations. Morphine, fentanyl and remifentanil are the most used analgesics in critically ill patients, but ketorolac is still employed in patients with hemorrhagic risk and meperidina in patients with severe acute pancreatitis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec422" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>There is considerable variation in clinical practises.

Input data for the model were obtained from UltiSAFE, a Dutch open-label trial with 205 critically ill patients with the exception of unit costs. In UltiSAFE patients received CS according to Dutch guidelines (predominantly fentanyl or morphine combined with midazolam or propofol) or RS (remifentanil, combined with propofol if required) for up to 10 days. Unit costs were measured in a separate microcosting study in a German mixed 12-bed adult ICU using the hospital perspective and prices of 2006. Material, staff and overhead costs were considered.

Fentanyl or morphine is commonly used to provide analgesia. However, both medications can promote adverse consequences, including hypotension, prolonged mechanical ventilation, increased ICU duration of stay and high costs. Comparative trials of both opioids have not been performed in critically ill patients and the selection of an agent depends on its pharmacology, adverse effects and costs. Many ICU physicians preferred fentanyl to morphine in hemodynamically unstable patients due to the risk of additional hypotension. However, both drugs accumulate and may cause similar adverse effects when continuously infused. The aim of this study was to compare the hemodynamic effects of morphine and fentanyl in hemodynamically unstable patients under mechanical ventilation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec445"><title>Methods</title><p>Prospective, randomized, open-label trial including mechanically ventilated patients &gt;16 years and hemodynamically unstable (cathecolamine requirement &gt;1 hour). Exclusion criteria included patients after cardiac arrest or with Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order. All patients received continuous I.V. midazolam in association with either morphine or fentanyl. The endpoint level of sedation was a Ramsay scale 2–4 and of analgesia was a Behavioral Pain Scale (BPS)&lt;5. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), rate of opioid and of benzodiazepines, rate of catecholamine (noradrenaline), BPS score and adverse effects (bowel distention and vomit) were measured every 6 hours.

There were no differences for heart rate (103 ±23 vs.101±23) and MAP (82.5±16.1 vs. 83.5±17.5).

We also examined whether other factors needed to be considered to ensure such changes brought long-term benefits. Between 2003–2006, the ICU at the Princess Alexandra Hospital (PAH) operated 4–5 Level 3 beds with a mean occupancy of 103%, admitting a mean of 326 patients with an mean LOS of 6.27 days, requiring a mean of 35 non-clinical transfers (NCT).There was a need to maximize capacity by investigating methods of reducing LOS and the need for NCT via efficient use of available resources. One likely method was through modifications to the ICU sedation protocol.</p></sec><sec id="Sec451"><title>Methods</title><p>The original PAH sedation protocols utilized morphine and midazolam for long stay ICU patients, with propofol and alfentanil used for short stay patients. In 2006, protocol modifications introduced the use of remifentanil and propofol in Specifically selected patients. Published evidence suggests a reduction in LOS of a day is possible under similar protocols(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2</xref>). A mobile simulation course on the use of remifentanil was arranged. A retrospective audit was carried out, using the controlled drug register, the ICU admission register and ICU database. Data was collected on the total number of patients admitted to the ICU, those who received remifentanil, the total duration of use of remifentanil and the total LOS of those patients receiving remifentanil, and compared to the average LOS in the PAH's ICNARC data(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec452" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Our data shows 29%(n=110) of our patients received remifentanil with average duration of 2.2 days.

We have also noticed a marked reduction in number of nonclinical transfers to 4(from 35), reduction in average occupancy to 97% (from 103%) and average LOS to 5.18 (from 6.27)against an increase ICU admission to 337 (from 326).</p></sec><sec id="Sec453" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data demonstrated a reduction in LOS of 1.1 days, based on appropriate use of Remifentanil in 84.5% of cases.

Proposed daily drug costs of sL70 resulted in a saving of approximately sL1500(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">4</xref>) through the reduction in LOS enabling more efficient use of available resources. These findings have shown that there is not only economic benefit to be gained with introduction of remifentanil but that we have improved overall performance and efficiency of our Intensive Care Unit.

M group (64 patients): 70% men, median age 52 (38–67) years, median weight 72 (65–77)Kg, median SAPS II score 41 (33–50), the admission diagnosis was trauma in 25%, medical in 54,6% and surgical in 20.4%. P group (51 patients): 64.7% men, median age 50 (35–62) years; median weight 70 (64–75)Kg, median SAPS II score 41 (34–49), the admission diagnosis was trauma in 35.3%, medical in 47% and surgical in 17.7%. The mean LOS was 11.76±7.57 days for M group and 11.67±9.26 days for P group (p=0.48). The mean time of sedation was 5.96±5.48 days for M group and 4.27±3.31 days for P group (p=0.028); the mean duration of mechanical ventilation was 7.23±5.61 days for M group and 5.03±3.51 days for P group (p=0.008). The mean time of tracheal intubation was 8.52±5.82 days in M group and 6.22±3.94 days in P group (p=0.009). In M group the mean consume of midazolam was 0.107±0.179mg/Kg/h and morphine 0.007±0.204mg/Kg/h.

There was no statistical difference in LOS in ICU. There is a statistical difference between the two groups that should guide towards propofol use. Nevertheless most of the times probably the choice is based on the admission diagnosis and hemodynamic parameters.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec466"><title>0425</title><sec id="Sec467"><title>Implementation of Assessment and Management of Pain: Introduction of a Painsedation Treatment Algoritm</title><p>H.

Implementation of assessment and management of pain also seems to be difficult. This investigation by questionnaire is performed to see whether it was desired to protocolize our pain and sedation therapy. After that, we introduced an algorithm, based on the Critically Ill Assessment score (CIA-score), and analyzed the compliance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec469"><title>Methods</title><p>We investigated attitude versus behaviour towards a new clinical strategy. Attitude was analyzed by the results of the questionnaire, where behaviour was analyzed as compliance of a new analgeso-sedation algorithm. This algorithm implies a regular assessment every 4 hours of the CIA-scale and a treatment algorithm in case of high (CIA&gt;9) (with reassessment within 1 hour) or low scores (CIA&lt;7) (with reassessment within 4 hours).</p></sec><sec id="Sec470" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Attitude : all responders (29 nurses and 7 doctors) feel the need for a good management and assessment of pain. 83% of the responders agreed that medication can be administered indepentdently by nurses, when a good analgeso-sedation algorithm is available. Behaviour : the data of 73 patients were analyzed, in total 2596 CIA-scores. There was an adequate score (CIA 7–9) in 69.7% of the assessments. In 9.5% the CIA-score was &lt;7, according to the algorithm reassessment should be performed within 4 hours and this was done in 64.6%. In 20.8% the CIA-score was &gt;9, and reassessment within 1 hour was done in only 26.1% of the cases. Scores &lt;7 indicate a high probability for oversedation, treatment only occurs when a repeated CIA-score is too low, which resulted in weaning in 14.1% and no intervention in 85.9% of the cases with a score&lt;7. For the high scores(CIA &gt;9) 49.7% did not result in a medical intervention within 1 hour. If an intervention was performed, it was more often increasing the sedative drugs (31.8%) than of the analgesive drugs (10.5%).</p></sec><sec id="Sec471" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In almost 70% of the patients on our ICU the analgesosedative strategy is according to department-guidelines.

Category of patients included in the study were Guillain Barre Syndrome, Myasthenia Gravis, Motor neuron disease, Status epilepticus, Community acquired pneumonia and Acute exacerbation of COPD requiring mechanical lung ventilation. From each patient the following data was collected at ICU admission:Age,Gender, hospital-admission diagnosis (Any co-morbid conditions),details of prior use of anticoagulant therapy, presence of other risk factors for DVT Exclusion criteria included: Age less than 16 yrs, patients with liver disease, contra-indication for use of Vit K antagonists(eg.Pregnancy)and any anticoagulation. Drug Protocol: After informed consent patients were randomized either to oral anticoagulant therapy (Acitrom) or for low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)group. In the Acitrom group LMWH was given along with oral anticoagulant for 4–5 days until we achieved the target INR of 2–2.5. Elderly, diabetics and hypertensive patients received 1mg/day and all other patients received 2mg/day. After achieving the INR LMWH was stopped and the patient was maintained on Acitrom. INR was done every fifth day or whenever any change in dosage of Acitrom was required. In the LMWH group daily prophylaxis was given based on international practice. Any complication related to anticoagulant therapy was taken into account in both the arms. Therapy was continued until the patient became ambulatory or was discharged from ICU.

Mean VRC lung concentration amounted to 1.30 ± 0.63 µg/ml. In the lung of patient 1, VRC levels reached 0.72 – 0.76 µg/ml after a single dose. In patient 2, lung concentrations ranged between 1.47 and 2.04 µg/ml. In different areas of brain tissue VRC was below the limit of detection (&lt;0.25 µg/mL) in patient 1 and achieved levels of 3.34 ± 0.18 µg/mL in patient 2. There was no difference in VRC concentrations between different areas of the brain, such as cortex, hippocampus, nucleus caudatus, medulla oblongata and cerebellum. VRC concentrations amounted to 1.31 ± 0.03 µg/mL and 2.95 ± 0.05 µg/mL in samples of the spleen of patient 1 and 2, respectively.

VRC accumulates in the liver and the kidneys, which are also the routes of elimination. Its penetration into brain and heart is probably slower.</p></sec><sec id="Sec524"><title>Grant Acknowledgement</title><p>We thank Pfizer Austria for financial support.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec525"><title>0434</title><sec id="Sec526"><title>Candidemia in Critically Ill Patient in Tertiary Care Intensive Care Unit</title><p>K.

Mean APACHE II score was 21.4 (SD: 7.7), mean time at ICU was 44.3 (SD: 32.9) days and mortality rate at ICU was 48.8%. Most common causes of admission at ICU were medical pathology (43.9%) and surgery (41.5%), and 65.9% of the patients had severe sepsis or septic shock. In most of the cases candidemia was due to Candida albicans (65.9%), follow by C. parapsilosis (9.8) and C glabrata (7.3%) and others (9.7%).

Infectious complications associated with the use of pulmonary artery catheters (PACs) are a significant source of morbidity and mortality. Shielded (“hands-off”) PACs have been found to reduce PAC-related systemic infections. However, there is a risk that mobilization of a PAC within a contaminated sleeve may result in inoculation of organisms into the patient's bloodstream. We conducted a prospective observational trial to address the question whether it is safe to manipulate the PAC within the protective sleeve.</p></sec><sec id="Sec546"><title>Methods</title><p>We prospectively enrolled 102 patients with PACs and collected the following data: APACHE II and SOFA scores, patient demographics, type, site, date and time of PAC insertion, type of surgery, antibiotic therapy at PAC insertion and removal. Upon PAC removal, 4 specimens were taken under sterile conditions: Saline reaspirated from the protective sleeve (1, “sleeve fluid”), the distal 5 cm of the PACs (2, “tip”), swab specimens from the introducer hub (3, “hub swab)” and from the skin at the PAC exit site (4, “exit swab”). In the microbiology laboratory, sleeve fluid and tips were inoculated onto horse blood agar and incubated. After 48 hours, colony counts were performed. Catheter hub and exit swabs were also inoculated onto horse blood agar and incubated. After 48 hours, growth of organisms was classified as “Nil” (no growth), “Colonization” (scanty growth) or “Infective” (moderate/abundant growth).</p></sec><sec id="Sec547" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Mean duration of PAC residence was 39.1 (24) hours. 92 PACs were internal jugular, 8 subclavian and 2 femoral. 11 patients had blood cultures (all negative), and there was no episode of catheter-related bloodstream infection. 6 patients had an infective shield fluid (5 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), 1 mixed gram-negative bacilli (GNB)). 4 catheter tips were infective (3 CNS, 10 Escherichia coli), 6 introducer hubs were colonized (4 CNS, 1 GNB, 1 diphtheroid). Patients having PACs with an infective sleeve fluid did not differ significantly from those without an infective sleeve fluid in terms of APACHE/SOFA scores, age, gender or site of insertion. There was a highly significant association between a colonized introducer hub and growth of organisms in the shield fluid, OR 30 (4–213, p&lt; 0.001). Neither a positive PAC tip nor a positive exit site swab was associated with an infective sleeve fluid culture.</p></sec><sec id="Sec548" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this cohort of 102 patients with a short duration of PAC residence, 6 patients had potentially infective cultures of sleeve fluid.

First phase: multi-professional work group was created (4 physicians, 6 nurses and 2 respiratory therapists) who performed a meeting with the “brainstorm” technique. All the infections data were reviewed. The group identified main risk factors related to the problem using a diagram cause-effect. Then, it was established corrective measures, deadlines and ways for execution. The second phase was the implementation of the measures chosen: team for catheter insertion; full-barrier precautions for insertion of central venous catheters; semi-permeable and transparent dressings; avoiding the jugular and the femoral sites whenever possible; routine replacement of the catheters after ten days insertion; removal of the unnecessary catheters. The target was the return of catheter-related infection rates of the previously year.</p></sec><sec id="Sec559" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Sixty-one patients were followed during their stay in the ICU.

The median of catheter indwelling time was 10 days (SD de +/− 5,16). Regarding the rates or infection, there was a reduction in average rate from 13,08 to 7,43 per 1000 days of catheters (p&lt; 0,05), with almost the same density of use (54,25 in 2007 versus 54,67 in 2006). The bacterial related to the infections were: BGN in 58.4% (n = 7), MRSA in 33.3% (n = 4) and staphylococcus coagulase negative 8.3% (n = 1).

Post-operatively patients were regularly reviewed by our acute pain team until no further acute pain input was required.</p></sec><sec id="Sec578" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Of all the epidurals 38 were sited in theatre and 14 in the ICU for analgesia and as an aid to weaning from mechanical ventilation. The ratio of male to female was 27:25. The overall perioperative mortality was 42% (22/52). Two or more organ failure was seen in 33 patients. Positive blood cultures were identified in 5 cases. Of the epidurals 18 required two or more level attempts and the mean duration of in-situ catheter days was 4.7 (+/−1.3). At the time of insertion patient temperatures ranged from 35.6 to 38.9oC. Associated complications occurred in 6 cases with one epidural haematoma, one subdural catheter placement, two vascular punctures and two dural punctures despite the epidural insertions being made by senior trainees or consultants in 49/52 cases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec579" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Due to the rarity of epidural complications in the general surgical population it is not possible to conclude whether the serious complications are greater in septic patients per se, however, it is a question of risk versus benefit in such a patient group.

Few patients in either group had a past cardiac disease history (10% cTnI≥0.3ng/ml vs 7.2% cTnI&lt;0.3ng/ml, p=.448). A significant relationship existed between elevated cTnI and older age (mean 57yrs±11 cTnI≥0.3ng/ml vs 53yrs±11 cTnI&lt;0.3ng/ml, p=.002), but not race or gender. A significant relationship existed between cTnIC0.3ng≥ml and greater bleed severity by Hunt/Hess (p=&lt;.0001) and admission Glasgow Coma Scale (p&lt;.0001). Patients with higher cTnI were significantly more likely to have initial 12-lead ECG findings of prolonged Qtc (mean 484ms±51 cTnI≥0.3ng/ml vs mean 452ms±47 cTnI&lt;0.3ng/ml, p&lt;.001), but not PR (p=.688) or QRS (p=.217) duration.

Diffusion tensor MR imaging (DTI) maps the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) that characterises tissue water. Higher ADC values are associated with vasogenic edema, and lower ADC with cytotoxic oedema. DTI shows regional differences in contusions, with a central core and a surrounding region of vasogenic oedema. Many contusions also demonstrate a region of cytotoxic oedema, peripheral to the vasogenic oedema. We have used oxygen-15 positron emission tomography (15O PET) to characterise physiology in these brain regions in TBI.</p></sec><sec id="Sec603"><title>Methods</title><p>Six patients (median GCS 5) who required sedation and mechanical ventilation for ICP control underwent DTI at 3Tesla, and 15O PET imaging studies within 24 hours post injury. Four regions of interest were manually drawn around the contusion in order to quantify cerebral physiology respectively in the core of the lesion (low ADC core) in the surrounding vasogenic oedema (high ADC region), in the adjacent rim of tissue with low ADC (cytotoxic edema) and on a control region (structurally normal appearing tissue).

The rim of cytotoxic oedema showed intermediate CBF and CMRO2 values (25 ml/100g/min and 43 µmol/100g/min), with CMRO2 values that approached previous defined survival thresholds.1 OEF was not abnormally elevated in any of the regions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec605" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>These distinct patterns of physiology in contusions recapitulate a probable evolution of pathophysiology, with incorporation of the cytotoxic rim into the vasogenic oedema and, eventually into the contusion core.

Some studies note an association of poor outcome with patients with high BP on hospital admission. Others have noted a decreased risk of neurologic deterioration from stroke with higher BP and worse outcomes in patients who have a decrease in BP after admission. Therefore accurate measurement of blood pressure is crucial in the acute phase of stroke. Besides, the institution of suscessfuly treatments of blood pressure reduction or augmentation depends on it. Either non invasive or intraarterial blood pressure monitoring is commonly used in ICU. In different populations have been proved that non invasive method does not achieve right accuracy. In acute stroke population discrepancies between direct intraarterial blood pressure (IABP) and indirect blood pressure measurements (NIBP) can adversely affect therapeutic decisions and may have a negative impact on outcomes. The aim of this observational study was to test the hypotheses that IABP measurements are not accurately reflected by NIBP in a population of acute stroke patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec609"><title>Methods</title><p>A total of 52 first ever stroke patients underwent simultaneous noninvasive automatic oscillometric and intra arterial blood pressure monitoring.

Agreement between methods was assessed using Bland Altman analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec610" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Overall 520 pairs of simultaneous oscillometric and invasive blood pressure measurements were collected in 52 patients.

Mean arterial blood pressure ranged from 52 to 165 mmHg. The overall discrepancy between methods of measurement to mean blood pressure was 7,8 +/− 9,6 mmHg (p&lt;0,001). The estimation of systolic blood pressure (SBP) using oscillometric recordings underestimated radial artery SBP by 12,7 mmHg (95% confidence interval :7,2–15, p&lt;0,001 In contrast an upward bias of 6,7 mmHg (95% confidence interval: 4,5 +/− 7,2, p&lt;0,001) was documented when noninvasive diastolic blood pressure (DBP) recordings were compared with intra arterial recordings.

The median delay from the onset of symptoms to the CVT diagnosis was 5.63 days ± 5 SD days and from the diagnosis to ICU admission was 3.96 days ± 3SD days. Diagnosis of CVT was established by MRI/MR venography in 8 patients (35%), intra-arterial angiography in 3 (13%), CT venography in 12 (52%) Monitoring: intra-arterial catheter (20 patients, 87%), transcranial Doppler (14, 61%), capnography (13, 56%), continuous jugular oxygen saturation (4, 17%). Treatment: all patients received heparin at therapeutic dose; 18 patients (78%) were intubated and mechanically ventilated; 14 (61%) received antiepileptic drugs ventilation. Norepinephrine was used in 10 patients (43.5%) to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure. Within the first 24 hours in ICU, fluid balance was negative in 9 patients (39%) because of brain edema and in 10 patients at day 5 (43.5%). Intra-cranial hematoma was drained in 1 patient, another had a brain abscess drainage, 3 patients had a decompressive craniectomy (2 died). Outcome : 5 patients (22%) died in ICU, four in relation with refractory intracranial hypertension, and 1 for lethal pulmonary embolism.

The BCT was evaluated by a radiologist. An “expectation” was radiologically confirmed if the finding was new or increased and negative if unchanged, decreased or not found. Treatment strategy after BCT was registered (unchanged, changed according to plan or otherwise).</p></sec><sec id="Sec652" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>189 clinical questions in 117 BCT's were evaluated. The most important expected findings were shift, edema, ischemia/infarction, hematoma and hydrocefalus. In 20% these expectations were radiologically confirmed. After the BCT, the physician changed the treatment strategy in 53%. This was based on positive radiological confirmation in only 24%. Strikingly, in 76% the treatment was changed although no radiological confirmation of an expected finding was obtained. The chance of a therapy change after a positive CT scan finding is 1.5 times greater than an unchanged policy after a positive CT scan. However, non of the predefined expected abnormalities showed a significant change to be followed by a change in policy. The confidence limits of the crude overall risk tells us that the chance that the policy will be adjusted due to the CT scan can be as small as 1.04 (almost non) and as large as 2.4 (almost 2.5 times).

Nicotine, a nonselective alpha7nAChR agonist has been shown to inhibit cytokine release in human PBMCs and monocytes as well as in animal models of inflammation. Due to its lack of selectivity however, nicotine has many unwanted side effects. Therefore, selective targeting of the alpha7nAChR may be promising for the treatment of inflammatory conditions. We compared the effect of the selective alpha7nAChR agonist GTS-21 and nicotine on LPS-induced cytokine release in human blood cells. Furthermore, because pattern recognition of the diverse classes of microbial products causing infection involves various TLRs, we investigated whether the immunomodulating effect of alpha7nAChR stimulation is dependent on the TLR stimulated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec684"><title>Methods</title><p>Isolated monocytes and PBMCs of healthy male volunteers were incubated with the TLR4 agonist LPS in combination with GTS-21 (1 nM — 100 uM) and nicotine (100 uM — 1 mM). Furthermore, whole blood of healthy male volunteers was incubated with TLR2, TLR3, TLR4 and TLR5 agonists in combination with GTS-21, nicotine and the alpha7nAChR antagonist mecamylamine. TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta, IFN-gamma and IL-10 production was determined by ELISA and multiplex cytokine assays. All described changes are statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec685" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Stimulation of the alpha7nAChR by both GTS-21 and nicotine resulted in a dramatic dose-dependent inhibition of LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine release in human monocytes and PBMCs. Likewise, pro-inflammatory cytokine release induced by stimulation of the various Toll-like receptors in human whole blood was dose-dependently inhibited by both GTS-21 and nicotine. Production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was not inhibited but stimulated by GTS-21. GTS-21 inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine production stronger than nicotine at equimolar concentrations. Finally, inhibition of the alpha7nAChR did not have any effect on cytokine production.</p></sec><sec id="Sec686" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Selective stimulation of the alpha7nAChR by GTS-21 has a profound antiinflammatory effect by inhibiting pro-inflammatory and stimulating anti-inflammatory cytokine release. In addition, GTS-21 proved to be more potent than nicotine in inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine release. The anti-inflammatory effect of alpha7nAChR stimulation was not restricted to a specific TLR. Therefore, this pathway appears to modulate the inflammatory response by a general mechanism. The lack of an effect of inhibition of the alpha7nAChR suggests that this receptor is not constitutively activated. Selective targeting of the alpha7nAChR using GTS-21 holds promise for future treatment options to modulate the innate immune response.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec687"><title>0460</title><sec id="Sec688"><title>Activation of Rxr Attenuates Cytokine and Chemokine Production in Human Monocytes</title><p>I.

The TLR expression and the synthesis of the cytokines Tumour Necrosis Factor α (TNF-α), Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) were analysed on mRNA-level (RT-PCR). Results are presented as mean ± SEM. P-values ≤ 0.05 were considered to be significant. 2) To determine, whether MXF activates TLRs, a HEK293 cell line, which expresses a reporter gene driven by NFB, was cultivated MXF. Consequently, the activation of TLR activation was estimated by luminecence measurement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec725" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>1) The mono-stimulation with MXF has no effect on TLR-expression and cytokine production. However, in contrast to the mono-stimulation with LPS, MXF in combination with LPS mediated significantly the up-regulation of TLR3 (15.08±1.81 Arbitrary Units (AU) vs. 0.36±0.38 AU), TLR4 (3.38±0.77 AU vs. 1.02±0.18 AU), TLR6 (3.62±1.40 AU vs. 0.76±0.29 AU), TLR7 (12.36±3.05 AU vs. 1.35±0.23 AU), TLR8 (56.30±3.52 AU vs. 6.20±0.75 AU; all p&lt;0.001). In addition, the production of TNF-a (138.2±31.72 AU vs. 30.56±6.8 AU), IL-1b (2529±777.4 AU vs. 4.97±1.82 AU) and IL-6 (646.8±159.6 AU vs. 1.42±0.72 AU, all p&lt;0.001) was raised after stimulation of MXF with LPS. In contrast, TLR2 expression is significantly higher for LPS stimulation in combination with MXF than LPS alone (2.25±0.47 AU vs. 1.46±0.28 AU; p&lt;0.01). 2 MXF does not show any direct TLR activation in the TLR ligand screening.</p></sec><sec id="Sec726" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>MXF leads to a differential regulation of the TLR expression and cytokine production only in LPS-stimulated monocytes. However, MXF does not stimulate TLRs itself. Thus, it has been shown that MXF modulates the innate immune system in a gramnegative in-vitro model of sepsis.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec727"><title>0466</title><sec id="Sec728"><title>Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Drotrecogin Alfa (Activated) on Solid Organ Tissue in Murine Sepsis</title><p>T.

This respiratory distress, with symptoms of upper airway obstruction, is commonly called laryngeal edema. Further studies have shown that different types of laryngeal or tracheal injuries and not only edema could be responsible for upper airway obstruction[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">1</xref>].

Patients with audible inspiratory wheeze after extubation were classified as postextubation stridor (PES). PES with laryngeal endoscopic lesions were defined as Laryngeal dyspnea (LD).</p></sec><sec id="Sec815" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Thirty-six patients had a normal exam with a shorter duration of intubation (3.7±4.9vs8.0±9.3; p &lt; 0.01), a lowest APACHE II at admission (23.1±7.2vs 26.3±7.8;p=0.03), and were intubated more frequently with neuromuscular blockade than patients with laryngeal injuries (97%vs81% p=0.04). We found 45 patients with ulceration, 74 with edema, 15 with granulation and 26 patients had vocal cord mobility altered.18 patients (13.2%) presented PES. Five patients did not have laryngeal injury. Two of them had postextubation tracheal injuries : sub-glottic stenosis and obstructive fibrinous tracheal pseudomembrane. Three patients had saliva over the larynx making obstruction associated with poor cough reflex. 13 patients developed LD (9.6%). Endoscopic findings were: 12 patients with grade 2 vocal cord edema and altered mobility. One patient had a grade 2 vocal cord granulation with obstruction of the laryngeal lumen. In unvaried analysis, risk factors of LD were: gender female, duration of translaryngeal intubation, number of intubation and a smaller height/ETT diameter ratio. Height/ETT diameter ratio was the only clinical independent risk factor of LD (OR 0.90 [0.85–0.96]; p&lt;0.001). 17 patients (12.5%) needed to be reintubated in the 48 hours following extubation. In unvaried analysis, these patients had more frequently: a GCS&lt;15 at extubation (11/17 vs 27/119; p&lt;0.01), a longer duration of intubation (13.7 ±13.8 days vs 5.9 ± 7.2; p&lt;0.01), a LD (5/17 vs 8/119 LD; p=0.01), they presented more frequently abnormal vocal cord mobility (10/17 vs 16/119; p&lt;0.01) and grade 1 or 2 granulation (5/17 vs 10/119; p=0.02). Independent risk factors of extubation failure were: GCS&lt;15 at extubation, grade 1 or 2 granulation of vocal cord and abnormal vocal cord mobility.</p></sec><sec id="Sec816" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Laryngeal injuries following intubation are frequent and could be associated with a use of large diameter of ETT, a long duration of intubation, and the absence of using curare during intubation. These injuries could have several localization and different patterns, but all of these injuries can potentially result in significant airway obstruction. It not seems possible to recognize each type clinically, only endoscopic examination could determine it and the best treatment to avoid recurrences and extubation failure.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec817"><title>0480</title><sec id="Sec818"><title>Patient Outcomes after Extubation in an Adult Intensive Care Unit</title><p>P.

Immediate complications such as bleeding from the stoma, transient hypoxemia (SpO<sub>2</sub>&lt;95%) and hypercarbia (&gt;5 mm increase in ETCO<sub>2</sub> from the baseline) were recorded. Bleeding was classified in four grades: I :&lt;5 mL, II : 6–10 mL, III : 11–20 mL and IV :&gt;20 mL.

A retrospective audit of case records and radiological images was undertaken from 1996 to 2001. This was followed by a prospective cohort study from 2002 to 2005 where every PDT was followed by a chest radiograph (CXR) and compared to the most recent CXR taken as part of routine clinical practice. The responsible physician commented as to whether the PDT was routine and if the CXR changed post-procedure management. A review in January 2006 changed practice and a post-procedure CXR was required only if there were technical difficulties or concerns with ventilation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec839" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 221 patients were identified in the retrospective study from 1996–2001. The overall complication rate was 8.6% subdivided as follows: bleeding (5.4%), mispositioned tube (0.9%), surgical emphysema (0.9%), pneumomediastinum (0.45%). All cases with radiographic abnormalities had been technically difficult with a high index of clinical suspicion for injury. The prospective cohort studies from 2002–7 identified a total of 478 cases − 218 cases had a mandatory post-procedure CXR (before the change in practice in 2006) and 260 with CXR only if clinically indicated. Of the mandatory post-procedure CXRs following routine PDT, there was no evidence of barotrauma or tube misposition. Following routine PDT the CXR altered management in only one case where a higher level of positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) was used to treat radiographic atelectasis. From 2002–7 there were 2 cases of surgical emphysema with immediate clinical manifestation. Both cases required no specific treatment and had been difficult with multiple tracheal cannulations. CONCLUSION. We have studied a total of 699 PDTs over 11 years and after routine PDT no evidence of barotrauma or other problem requiring urgent intervention was identified on CXR. On one occasion the post-procedure CXR affected management, treating radiographic atelectasis, however derecruitment of bronchopulmonary segments is common after PDT and can be anticipated [2]. In uncomplicated, bronchoscopically guided PDT a routine postprocedure CXR is unnecessary in the absence of clinical deterioration. We recommend that a chest radiograph is mandatory in the following circumstances — anticipated postoperative complications secondary to technical difficulties, visualised tracheal damage or pre-procedure pneumothorax.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec840"><title>0484</title><sec id="Sec841"><title>Safety and Complications of Percutaneous Tracheostomy in a Cohort of 800 Mixed ICU Patients</title><p>G.

In order to find a reliable marker for the diagnosis of meningitis in these patients we measured interleukin-6 (IL-6) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in CSF and we compared them with standard markers (CSF leucocytosis, glucose, proteins).</p></sec><sec id="Sec886"><title>Methods</title><p>17 neurosurgical patients (13men) with intracerebral or/and subarrachnoid hemorrhage, aged 52±15 years, septic with clinical suspicion of meningitis were enrolled. All patients had intraventricular catheters for external drainage of CSF. 8 had proven meningitis. Samples of CSF and blood were taken at time of suspected meningitis and in meningitis group at time of clinical improvement also. Leucocytes, glucose and proteins were measured in blood and CSF. The samples were centifigurated and frozed in − 4oC and IL-6 and VEGF were measured in CSF and serum (the upper limit measured for IL-6 was 5000 pg/ml).</p></sec><sec id="Sec887" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>IL-6 concentrations in CSF were extremely high in all patients (3649±1914pg/ml). IL-6 levels were higher in CSF from patients with meningitis compared with those from patients without meningitis (5000±0 versus 2449±1971 pg/ml, p=0.002). In all patients CSF levels of IL-6 were higher than plasma levels (p&lt;0.0001) and in meningitis group were over 100fold higher, (p&lt;0.0001). In meningitis group, CSF IL-6 levels decreased significantly as patients improved (p=0.03). In contrast VEGF levels performed high in serum as well as in CSF (842±166pg/ml vs 130±47pg/ml), but did not differ in two groups. Between two groups (meningitis and no meningitis group) there was no difference in CSF pleocytosis (523±318,7 vs 273±137,9) CSF glucose (57,1±14,7 vs 85,2±11,6mg/dl) and CSF proteins (275±49,5 vs 225,7±59,4gr/dl).</p></sec><sec id="Sec888" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>It seems that CSF pleocytosis and glucose are not efficient markers to establish meningitis in neurosurgical patients.

Therefore, the causative pathogens and/or antibiotic resistances are to be determined as early as possible. The traditional gold standard blood culture (BC) usually takes at least 2–3 days. Facing the time-to-result, nucleic acid based technologies (NAT) are increasingly desirable. The aim of this study was to compare the sensitivities and specificities of BC with a novel molecular-biological pathogen detection method. The NAT-system includes a sample preparation technology, which enables the enrichment of bacterial and fungal DNA out of whole DNA-samples. Cell lysis within whole blood and subsequent DNA preparation are followed by multiplex PCR to rapidly identify 99% of clinically relevant sepsis causative pathogens. At the same time, five of the most common antibiotic resistance genes are detected.</p></sec><sec id="Sec892"><title>Methods</title><p>In a prospective study (6/2006–7/2007), a totality of 35 peripheral blood samples from 25 patients (septic group) were consecutively drawn for the evaluation of possible sepsis by culture (e.g. BC) and molecular diagnosis. 32 whole blood samples were taken from 22 patients (control group) without the clinical indication of sepsis. The DNA preparation was performed according to a standard DNA extraction protocol combined with protein-based affinity chromatography (LOOXSTER®, SIRS-Lab). All purified DNA specimens were analyzed by multiplex PCR (VYOO®, SIRS-Lab). The blood samples were incubated in an automated blood culture device (BacTAlert®, BioMerieux). Positive isolates from BC were determined for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility by standard laboratory procedures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec893" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In the septic group, 20% of the patients were tested BC positive with none of them belonging to the positive 28 day mortality group. In the 58% NAT positive patients, four non-survivors (80%) were included. The NAT method was negative as expected for all samples of the control group patients. In contrast, 23% BC were positive in this group. Concerning the clinical microbiological evaluation, the BC positive controls can be considered as false positive results. The positive results from blood cultures were not available before 72 hours whereas the NAT method delivered results within 6–8 hours.</p></sec><sec id="Sec894" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Compared to the gold standard and other culture-based methods, the NAT method was in significantly less time more sensitive and specific. This might be a milestone allowing “same day diagnosis” of sepsis and SIRS as well. Further, the results revealed the expanding potential of NAT-based methods for the diagnosis of systemic microbial infections.</p></sec><sec id="Sec895"><title>Grant Acknowledgement</title><p>This study was supported by grants from the TMWFK.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec896"><title>0493</title><sec id="Sec897"><title>IL-6 Gene Transcription in Infection and Severe Sepsis Displays Distinctive Characteristics</title><p>M.

IL-6 has been reported as a possible diagnostic marker for the presence of bacteraemia and serves as a marker of disease severity in sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">1</xref>]. Indeed recently adverse outcome in community-acquired pneumonia has been reported in the context of elevated IL-6 levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2</xref>].

As early recognition of the delirium is important for adequate treatment routine screening of the patients is necessary. To be meaningful for practice this screening should be performed frequently and interrater reliability (IRR) should be high. The aim of our study was to implement the validated confusion assessment method-ICU (CAM-ICU) in our ICU, aiming at a scorings rate of &gt;80%, an IRR score of &gt;0.80 and a high level of knowledge concerning delirium.</p></sec><sec id="Sec938"><title>Methods</title><p>The implementation strategy focused on potential barriers for screening with the CAM-ICU, i.e. lack of knowledge and availability of the assessment tool. We integrated the CAM-ICU in our patient data management system (PDMS). Necessary testing tools became available at every bed. Every patient had to be assessed once a shift, if not a pop-up on the PDMS-screen appeared. We used ‘delirium key-nurses’ for further instruction and introduction in the ICU. In addition, instruction posters for nurses and the medical staff were distributed. Feedback about results and performance of the CAM-ICU was supplied weekly by mail and during clinical meetings. Scoring rate was calculated by the percentage scored patients per day. IRR was assessed by calculating the Cohen's Kappa between the score on the CAM-ICU by the ICU nurse with the score by an expert psychiatric nurse. To assess the knowledge level (on a scale for 0–10), all ICU nurses performed a test prior to group training and a post-test 4 months later.</p></sec><sec id="Sec939" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>During 4 months, 78 patients were screened for IRR.

Members of an American Association of Critical Care Nursing (AACN) local California chapter in the United States reported significant barriers that prevent them from incorporating research findings into their practice. Subsequently, a masters-prepared advance practice nurse developed a unique “Journal Club” to reduce these barriers and increase awareness of Evidence- Based Practice (EBP).</p></sec><sec id="Sec944"><title>Methods</title><p>In 2002, a monthly Journal Club was initiated to engage acute and critical care nurses from local regional hospitals in discussion of current, recently published research findings. The monthly topics were selected based on clinical relevance, educational needs assessment, and requests by members. The monthly Journal Club meetings take place at the same time and place in a local restaurant, usually with vendor sponsored dinners. Methods to decrease the inherent barriers related to critiquing academic research included a chapter led critique and review of research findings. This method decreased anxiety related to lack of skills to critique or synthesize the literature and difficulties interpreting the findings by many nurses. Chapter facilitated discussion of complex research by placing less emphasis on interpretation of statistics and research methodologies and focused on adaptation of findings into real clinical practice. The confidential, non-threatening, supportive environment promoted open, frank discussion and diminished intimidation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec945" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Over the past five year period, the monthly Journal Club attendance increased from 4–6 members in 2002 to 40–50 members currently and continues to grow. Several members travel over 100km to attend. Community subgroups of interest have also been established to review sedation protocols and other hot topics prompted by an initial Journal Club discussion. Many hospitals are willing to “share” policies, guidelines, and tools that they have created with other nurses/institutions in the community to avoid having to “reinvent the wheel” to get things rolling in their hospital of practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec946" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The regional Journal Club has grown to be a huge success. The creator of the Journal Club and the Board of Directors of the AACN chapter have received numerous member anecdotal accounts of the influence meetings have played in their professional lives by sharpening their professional interest and increasing awareness. The use of research in everyday practice is promoted by simplification of complex research topics and promotes replacing practice based on tradition with practice based on evidence and results in positive patient outcomes.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec947"><title>0502</title><sec id="Sec948"><title>Improving Postoperative Pain Relief by Extending Services Beyond the ICU Walls</title><p>M.

A standardized mixture for epidural pain relief consisting of Bupivacain, Adrenaline and Fentanyl was given to all patients. All data was entered into the form described above by the nurses responsible for the patient on the wards. In this study we have retrieved the following information: Age, type of operation, level of catheter insertion, duration of treatment, average dose (ml/hour), total dose, reason for unscheduled termination of treatment, side effects and patient satisfaction — whether the overall treatment was perceived as poor, acceptable, good or excellent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec951" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>From 2002 to 2006 the number of patients indicating that their pain relief was excellent rose from 32% to 73%. The number of patients reporting that their treatment was poor fell from 12% to 3%. In 2002 13% of the patients had to terminate the treatment due to technical problems, in 2006 only 5% of them had to do the same. In 2002 12% of the patients had to terminate the treatment due to side effects. In 2006 only 5% had the treatment stopped due to this.</p></sec><sec id="Sec952" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that the improvement we have seen in the postoperative treatment with epidural infusion is due to the organizational changes we have introduced. We believe that informing those closest to the patients — the nurses on the wards — is the single most important initiative we introduced in order to improve the postoperative pain treatment. The effect of this has been a better communication and understanding of the patients needs. A more vigilant set of observations and hence swifter response from the staff when the pain treatment was not satisfactory, or when side effects occur. It is also likely that similar improvements can be obtained in other areas where ICU treatment strategies are supposed to continue after the patients have left the ICU. Well-established and documented treatments may result in sub optimal results due to lack of communication and knowledge, and poor implementation of protocols between the ICU and all other involved personnel and departments.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec953"><title>0503</title><sec id="Sec954"><title>Service Gap: Pregnant and Postnatal Women in ICU</title><p>W.

The aim of this study was to examine the health services provided to parturient women in ICU to identify if a service gap existed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec956"><title>Methods</title><p>A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted in four tertiary-level intensive care units (ICU) in Melbourne, Australia. Only one ICU was in a hospital that provided obstetric services. All pregnant and postnatal women admitted to ICU were eligible for the study. Nurses formed core research teams and assisted with the auto-enrolment of eligible women, time-critical data collection and the obtaining of consent. Additional data were gathered from the medical history following discharge. Data were entered in SPSS (v12) and analysed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec957" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Of the 43 known eligible women, 35 were enrolled, and 33 gave consent; 8 were pregnant. Two of the eight pregnant women were 8 weeks’ and 14 weeks’ gestation respectively. The gestation of the other six pregnant women ranged from 27 to 36 weeks'. Of the six women with a viable pregnancy, three had a fetal ultrasound when in ICU, five out of six had at least one cardiotocograph and one woman had no fetal assessment in ICU. None of the pregnant women gave birth during the ICU admission. Of the 25 postnatal women, 92% were admitted in the first 24 hours following birth. Four women saw their baby whilst in ICU, with the remaining women needing to wait until they were transferred out of ICU. An obstetric condition was the principle diagnosis for two thirds of women. However, pregnant and postnatal women were seen by 23 different types of medical specialties whilst in ICU. The mean number of specialties seen by individual women was 3.6 (median 4.0). 53% of women were seen by an obstetrician when in ICU: 100% of women with private health insurance (n=11) compared with only 29% of public patients (p&lt;.05). Having the ICU and obstetric services on the one-site increased the chance of the woman being seen by an obstetrician, but did not guarantee it. Only 30% of the pregnant and postnatal women in ICU were seen by a midwife. Whether the woman was pregnant or postnatal did not affect her chance of being seen by an obstetrician or midwife in ICU. 70% (n=23) of women were transferred by ambulance between hospitals to access the ICU bed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec958" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Women received fragmented care from many health professionals and service providers.

Odell*</p><p>Critical Care, Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust, Reading, United Kingdom</p><sec id="Sec980" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ward patients can experience unexpected physiological deterioration that can lead to critical outcomes and death. This deterioration can be signalled in the patients physiological signs that are monitored by ward nurses as part of routine practice. In many cases these physiological signs have been missed, neglected or poorly managed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2</xref>). Systems designed to track patients physiological signs and trigger referral to an expert team have been widely implemented. Proving effectiveness of these systems has been problematical, partly due to the reliance on a timely and robust system of observation monitoring, plus compliance by the ward teams in the referral process to response teams. It is vital that we understand these ward processes. A systematic literature review is presented that critically evaluates research describing or appraising the nursing practice of taking and recording observations in the detection and management of the deteriorating ward patient.</p></sec><sec id="Sec981"><title>Methods</title><p>Eight data bases were systematically searched from 1990 to 2006, plus citations from key articles and reports. Experts in the field were contacted. All study designs were incorporated. Eligible studies were assessed for quality using an assessment tool for both qualitative and quantitative studies. The findings from the studies were critically evaluated using a narrative technique.</p></sec><sec id="Sec982" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Fifteen studies were eligible from 740 titles. Study quality varied. Findings are presented using the Record, Recognise, Report and Rescue (4R) model that outlines a series of actions that characterises the optimal process of detection, recognition and appropriate management of the deteriorating ward patient. Complex dichotomies exist in each of the 4R model categories that show ward nurses struggling to adequately detect and manage the deteriorating ward patient, hampered by inexperience, lack of skill and excessive workloads. Where support systems are in place, they require skilled and complex collaboration with medical staff and can be inconsistently activated and utilised.</p></sec><sec id="Sec983" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Effective detection and mangement of patient deterioration relies on robust patient observation practice and adherence to track and trigger referral triggers. In order to see the benefit of these systems we need to understand the issues that enhance and inhibit the practice of recording, recognising, reporting and rescuing (4Rs) by ward nurses. We can then find ways to better equip wards to deal with these issues and improve patient outcome.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec984"><title>0508</title><sec id="Sec985"><title>Medical Art Therapy: Influence on Quality of Life and Compliance of Patients with Advanced Heart Failure</title><p>N.

The setting was a nursing school situated in a thousand bed general hospital. The participants were twenty-five trained nurses working in adult intensive care, neurosurgical, internal medical and recovery departments. The facilitators were the nurse tutor intensive care course and two nurses trained in group dynamics and with expertise in End of Life and ethics. Two six hour sessions were held. Use of a group dynamic allowed each nurse to express how they view EOL care in their own personal practice. This opening was followed by a group exercise using collage, an art therapy technique adapted to allow exploration of painful feelings on death and dying. By promoting self awareness into individual attitudes on death the caregiver is strengthened when caring for others.

However, since CO2 is driven through the membrane lung only by the partial pressure of the dissolved CO2, which is less than 10% of the total CO2 content, extracorporeal blood flow as high as 2 liters/min are required to remove the total CO2 production of an adult patient. We hypothesized that acidification of the blood entering the ML could convert the CO2 contained in blood as bicarbonate ions to dissolved CO2, hence increasing the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2). The consequent increase in CO2 transfer though the ML should allow for a reduction of extracorporeal blood flow.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1011"><title>Methods</title><p>Six pigs (37±2 Kg) were sedated, intubated, mechanically ventilated and connected to a veno-venous extracorporeal circuit comprising a ML (Quadrox D).

A continuous infusion of 0.5 N lactic acid was added to the extracorporeal blood flow before the ML at a rate of 1, 2 and 5 mEq/min for 15 minutes each. After each infusion we waited at least 30 minutes to allow the acid to be metabolized. Each infusion was repeated two times.

New treatment options for hypoxemia are necessary, even for patients primary located in outlying medical facilities. We report our experience with a new developed, portable Mini-ECMO (Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation) system for emergency treatment of hypoxemia caused by ARDS, cardiogenic shock or septic shock. We describe out-of-centre emergency percutaneous ECMO implementation and additional air- and ground ambulance transfer for referral centre treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1024"><title>Methods</title><p>Between March 2006 and April 2008, we treated 15 adult patients located in outlying medical facilities with the new portable Mini-ECMO system and carried out interhospital transfer on the running system. Diagnosis included ARDS (n = 6), cardiogenic shock (n = 6) and septic shock (n = 3). Bedside cannulation was achieved percutaneously. In respiratory failure, we used a femoro-jugular veno-venous vessel access, in cardiocirculatory failure we implementated the Mini-ECMO system using a femoro-femoral veno-arterial vessel access. The new portable Mini-ECMO system consists of a centrifugal pump and a membrane oxygenator. Because of tip-to-tip heparin bonded circuits, we need no full dose heparinization. The system (27kg) is capable for hand-held use and suitable for storing on a standard gurney. With its inbuilt battery pack and oxyen-supply the hole system can act as a stand-alone device (e.g. during patient transfer from ICU to the ambulance).</p></sec><sec id="Sec1025" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Bedside cannulation was uneventful, bleeding complications did not occur. After start of the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation the systemic blood-flow and oxygenation were restored. During extracorporeal assistance, including air (n = 12) and ground (n = 3) ambulance transfer, no technical complication arrived. Limb ischemia due to the arterial cannula was observed in two cases. Hospital survival rate was 66%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1026" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The use of this new portable MINI-ECMO system is safe and high effective for management of hypoxemic patients with severe respiratory and cardiocirculatory failure, resistant to conventional critical care treatment. Especially patients in outlying medical facilities can now be first time treated with bedside ECMO support without extended technical or personnel support. Interhospital transfer for ARDS centre treatment or urgent coronary interventions can now be handled in re-established cardiac output and oxygen delivery. The new hand-held MINI-ECMO device enables emergency treatment of hypoxemia and improves survival rate in critically ill patients.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1027"><title>0515</title><sec id="Sec1028"><title>Major Thoracic Surgery During Extracorporeal Life Support In Ards</title><p>M.

Of these 15 patients, 5 (33%)were successfully deconnected from ECLS, and discharged alive from the hospital, 2 remained on ECLS for more than 2 weeks after the first thoracotomy. In one patient a sternotomy with pericardiectomy, following three episodes of cardiac tamponade, was performed; the patient was deconnected from ECLS after operation and survived. In 4 patients thoracothomy indication was to control the source of septic shock and concomitant bronchopleural fistula, 3 pneumonectomy and 1 lobectomy were performed, none survived. One patient underwent a first thoracotomy for bleeding and subsequentely a pneumonectomy due to lung colliquation, and died.

Surgery is frequently not possible because of the poor patient's general conditions and high operative risk. The treatment of BPF using Endobronchial Spigots was recently described. This perendoscopic technique makes use of silicone stoppers to obstruct segmental bronchi in the area of a BPF. We report our experience of therapeutic bronchial obstruction for persistant BPF mechanically ventilated patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1079"><title>Methods</title><p>Indications for endobronchial spigots were association of (1) distal BPF in a mechanically ventilated patient with weaning failure (2) persistent pleural leakage after several days of drainage (3) patient not suitable for surgery. The technique comprises 2 steps: 1. Localization of one or several bronchi related to the fistula, using a Fogarty balloon catheter introduced through the bronchoscope working channel. The leakage is localized by inflating the balloon catheter in the selected bronchi until the bubbling stops in the pleural drainage system. 2. Introduction of the silicone stopper (Novatech ® “EWS” or Endobronchial Watanabe Spigots) previously attached to a biopsy forceps through the bronchial tree, down to the localized segmental bronchi. Complete success of the technique was defined by an absolute control of the air leakage, allowing pleural tube removal. The partial success of the technique was defined by the persistence of a reducted air leakage associated with patient's improvement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1080" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Between January 2003 to November 2007, 9 mechanically ventilated patients with untractable BPF were treated by therapeutic bronchial occlusion using EWS. The cause of BPF was an empyema in 6 patients, traumatic pneumothorax in 2 patients and complication of lung surgery in one. In one case, a spigot migration produced a tracheal tube obstruction which obliged to emergency reintubation. In 2 cases (3,4) the air leakage reoccured due to collateral ventilation leading to a second EWS positioning. Results are detailed in table.

Multivariate logistic regression identified high preoperative LDH, urea plasma levels and Redo as independent predictors of intensive care mortality (Table I) with a high specificity and sensitivity (Area under the ROC curve = 0.94). A score was computed using these factors and the coefficients to predict mortality. No mortality was observed for a score value &lt; 3.5.</p><p>For postoperatives factors, the prolonged use of inotropes was independently associated with intensive care mortality. Failure to wean patients from inotropes during the first 48 hours was associated with very significant higher mortality rate (odds ratio = 12).

Most aged people residence have some relationship with supporting hospitals or clinics because most aged people have some medical problems, who usually regularly consult a doctor of these hospitals or clinics. However, in emergency condition, particularly in the night or holly day, these inhabitants can not be transferred to these hospitals and are transferred near emergency department in which hospital doctors have no information of the patients’ medical condition and their philosophy for living and dying process. We often perform aggressive resuscitation against the patient's mind.

The mean age was 66,5 ± 20 years. The mean APACHE II and SAPS II score were 10,2 ± 5,1 and 25,9 ± 11, respectively. The mean occupancy rate was 95%. A total of 222 patients were under ventilatory support (20,36%) on admission. When stratified by disease group 228 patients were gastrointestinal (20,8%) and 155 patients (14,1%) were respiratory. In total of admissions 60,7% were nonoperative and 39,3% were operative reason. In relation to origin of admission 70,6% were from ICU, 10,9% from general ward, 10,8% from emergence department, and 7,7% from operating room.

Invasive mechanical ventilation was used in 48,4% of patients. The most frequent ventilatory mode was continuous positive pressure (CPAP) in 65,2% of patients. The mean positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) was 9,17 ± 1,04 cmH2O, the mean time under ventilatory support was 7,7 ± 7,8 days. Nocturnal mechanical ventilation was used in 3,6% of patients.

A proportion of ICU admissions can be considered low risk for receiving services that are unique to or best provided in an ICU. Despite the widespread notion that larger ICA (above 10 beds) can show low occupancy rates, our data is in contrast and shows that a high occupancy rate is feasible and leads to a better utilization of critical resources.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1132"><title>0532</title><sec id="Sec1133"><title>Predictive Factors of Invasive Procedures in a Cohort of 407 Severe Postpartum Haemorrhage</title><p>E.

Around 90% of the respondents worked in the ICUs which admitted both medical and surgical patients. Only 50% of the respondents had a written protocol for sedation in their units and assessed sedation level every 4-6 hours. A sedation scoring system was used by 90% of the respondents, with Ramsay scoring being the most frequently used system (60%). 21% of the respondents use Bispectral monitor to assess the sedation level, of which 50% were Neurocritical care units. There were only 13% of the respondents who preferred to use propofol for sedation in children, and the youngest age they would use ranged from 6 months to 16 years in children. Only 50% of the respondents admitted that they would adjust the calorie requirement when patients are on propofol infusion. 22% of the respondents have encountered propofol infusion syndrome in their clinical practice. 53% used rise in lactate and 3% used Acyl or malonyl carnitine levels as a marker, if they suspected propofol infusion syndrome. 96% of the respondents used continuous infusion for sedation, with propofol being the preferred drug used by 83% of them for short term sedation (less than 48 hours). Midazolam was the second common drug used for short term sedation (around 58%) but it was the preferred drug (85%) for long term sedation (more than 48 hours).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the user-friendliness of 7 new generation ICU ventilators.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1196"><title>Methods</title><p>10 Physicians well trained in mechanical ventilation, but without knowledge of the 7 ICU ventilators tested, performed 8 tasks per machine. Time performances were compared between each other and with a reference time established by a trained respiratory therapist (RT). Tasks were to successively: switch on the ventilator, recognize the already adjusted mode, recognize and set alarms, change mode, find the pre-oxygenation command, adjust parameters for pressure support mode, stand-by and find NIV mode. Physicians rated their subjective assessment of task difficulty on a visual analogue scale (0: very easy-10 very difficult).</p></sec><sec id="Sec1197" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Results are expressed as medians and interquartile range (IQR: 25th–75th percentile). For each task physicians were slower than the RT: 44 (25–89) s for the most rapid, vs. 14 (5–22) s for the RT. A mean of 9 (7–13) failures was observed by ventilator; on 3 machines more than 10 failures occurred. The most rapid task with the fewest failures was pre-oxygenation (5, 3–17 s). Tasks with the most failures were adjusting pressure support mode and finding NIV mode. The longest task was mode recognition (106, 74–146). The most common errors were: confusion between adjusted and measured parameters, type and level of trigger and plateau pressure assessment. Visual analogue difficulty scores ranged from 3.8 to 7.3.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1198" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Physicians without prior experience with specific ICU ventilators perform poorly when confronted with specific tasks. These results suggest a need for standardization between machines and improved interface user-friendliness in the design of ICU ventilators.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1199"><title>0543</title><sec id="Sec1200"><title>Ultrasonography of the Neck Prior to Percutaneous Tracheostomy</title><p>M.

There is no standard treatment for this disease. The treatments of choice are :suctioning, positional therapy, bronchoscopy and conservative treatment. The patient with atelectasis suffers from impaired ventilation capacity and impaired oxygenation in most cases. Therefore the atelectasis should be cleared. We investigated the role of a new external pneumatic oscillation device, The Vest® system compared with suctioning in combination with exprimation and hyperinflation, which is the standard therapy for atelectasis in our intensive care unit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1234"><title>Methods</title><p>We performed a single centre randomised open study to investigate the effects of The Vest® system in atelectatic ventilated patients who were hospitalised in our ICU in 2007. After approval of our ethical committee, 6 patients were studied with the Vest® system. They were treated 3 times a day with the use of an external vest, which contained an air chamber. A pulse generator was connected with the airspace in the Vest®. In this way pulsatile, oscillative compressions were made around the thorax, during 20 minutes. Standard manual hyperinflation in combination with exprimation and suctioning was done 3 times a day in 6 patients. After maximal 12 treatments, the study was stopped. Complete atelectasis of one lobe was scored as 3 points, major atelectasis of one lobe was 2 points and minor atelectasis of one lobe was scored as one point. Complete atelectasis of the right lung should be scored as 9 points. One independent radiologist reviewed the X rays.

Pathologic phenomenons, such as “crackles”, are usually heard on auscultation.

Breath sounds as well CT scans were recorded at each PEEP level. Pathological changes detected by Fast-Fourier-Transform (FFT) frequency analysis of the sounds were compared to the quantity of non-aerated and very poorly aerated (+100/−300 HU) lung tissue present in the 9 mm CT images.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1241" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The acoustic spectra recorded in healthy condition were mainly within 400−500 Hz for both lungs. After unilateral oleic acid injury, the breath sounds recorded over the injured lung, but not over the non-injured lung, turned highly pathologic in all animals, showing increased spectral frequency content above 500 Hz and −70 dB. During stepwise increase of PEEP, the proportion of pathologic sounds gradually decreased and with a PEEP of 20 cmH2O, the breath sounds recorded over the injured lung were significantly decreased. The gradual decrease in acoustic pathology corresponded to a gradual transition of lung tissue from non-aerated or very poorly aerated to aerated in end-expiratory CT images (Table).

The medium age was 6.5 months, with no statistical significant difference between the groups. The average PRISM scores were equivalent for both groups (14 and 13.9). The therapeutical interventions for each group were similar, including the total amount of analgesics and sedatives administered. There was statistical significant difference between the COMFORT scale scores of the children which the parents stayed continuously and the other group (7.6 and 13.4, p= 0.0423). There was no significant difference between the cortisol of the children that stayed with parents and the children that stayed without parents (25.5 ± 16.2 and 52.2 ± 42.8, p= 0.07). There was no significant difference between the measured glycemia in the two groups (99.3 ± 20.7 and 111.1 ± 34, p= 0.21).

Mortality associated with pediatric AHRF is also dependant on other organ failure rather than lung dysfunction. The objective of this study is to quantitate contribution of the nonpulmonary organ failure to poor outcome of pediatric patients with AHRF managed with HFOV.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1266"><title>Methods</title><p>Forty two consecutive pediatric patients (median age : 4 months, IQR:2–10) with AHRF (pneumonia: 35, sepsis with ARDS: 3, Others: 4), failing conventional ventilation (alveolar-arterial oxygen difference (P(A-a)O2) of 580 torr (453–645), Oxygenation index (OI) of 30 (22,5–37)) were ventilated with HFOV.

Grzeszczak*, F. E. Barr</p><p>Pediatric Critical Care, Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt, Nashville, United States</p><sec id="Sec1271" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>The rate of severe pertussis infections has increased in recent decades. It mostly affects young children with the most severe cases and a highest mortality occurring in infants less than 6 months of age. Severe pertussis infections can cause respiratory and cardiovascular failure with an extremely high mortality rate (above 70%). The primary cause of death in severe pertussis is severe refractory pulmonary hypertension (PHT). PHT can progress very rapidly and in general is not responsive to any treatment modalities including extracorporeal support. The exact mechanism of PHT in pertussis is not completely known but hyperleukocytosis with leukostasis and leukocyte thrombi in pulmonary vasculature are thought to be contributing mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1272"><title>Methods</title><p>After IRB approval, the medical records of all patients admitted to our PICU with diagnosis of pertussis between 1997 and 2007 were reviewed. Patients with severe pertussis requiring intubation and mechanical ventilatory support and with a echocardiographic diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension were analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1273" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Six patients were identified who met the above criteria. We have previously described 4 of these patients who required ECMO support for severe pertussis and who all died from severe refractory pulmonary hypertension (Pediatrics 2003; 112:1274–78). Since 2003, we identified 2 subsequent cases of severe infantile pertussis with good outcome. Both patients were treated with leukopheresis to achieve leukoreduction. The first patient had significant respiratory and cardiovascular instability and was initially placed on ECMO for stabilization and then underwent leukopheresis. We previously reported this case in detail (PCCM 2006; 7:580–582). A second more recent unreported patient is now described in more detail. The patient was a 5 wk old male infant who was admitted to PICU on his 5th hospital day. Two days later he was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilatory support for respiratory failure and a presumed diagnosis (subsequently confirmed) of pertussis was made. Within following 2 days he had ECHO evidence of PHT and his WBC rose to 90.8K. He underwent leukopheresis. His WBC was reduced to 28.4K and follow up ECHO had no evidence of PHT. He survived and was discharged home.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1274" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on our recent experience and other previously published cases we propose an algorithm for approach in critically ill infants with severe pertussis.

The median age of the 11 patients included was 3 years and 3 months (3 months to 7 years). All patients were volume resuscitated to CVP&gt;10 cmH2O. Dopamine was the first inotropic agent used in all patients. Milrinone was the second agent used in 4 patients. The average interval between admission and milrinone administration was 15 hours. Only one patient received a milrinone loading dose (50mcg/Kg). The initial infusion dose varied from 0.25–0.75 mcg/kg/min; the maximum infusion dose was 0.82mcg/kg/min. The median duration of milrinone infusion was 72 hours. Nine patients needed 3 or more inotropic agents (7 received norepinephrine). Cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography in 8 patients before and after milrinone was started: 5 improved, 2 had no change and 1 worsened cardiac contractility. Blood lactate level increased in 2 patients and decreased in 7 patients (a mean decrease of 20.1 mg/dL) after starting milrinone. Concerning the adverse effects of milrinone: mean arterial pressure decreased in 4 patients (a mean decrease of 10 mmHg); 5 patients needed norepinephrine or an increase of dosage after milrinone infusion started; heart rate increased in 7; none had disrythmia; 2 patients developed secondary thrombocytopenia. Seven patients needed mechanical ventilation, 4 needed renal replacement techniques, none had ARDS and 1 patient had severe ischemic sequelae leading to lower limb amputation. The median PRISM scale value was 23.

Detailed informations were obtained on 305 children. LTV users were classified in three disorder categories: neurological (n=229; 75%), thoracic (n=13; 4%), lung/ upper airway (n=63; 21%). The age of institution of LTV according to disorder category is shown in Table <xref rid="Tab67" ref-type="table">1</xref>. One hundred twenty two (40%) children were ventilated via a tracheotomy with the highest percentage (89%) being neurological patients (Thor 2%, Lung/airway 9%). The majority of non invasively ventilated children used nasal masks (87%). All of the LTV users had positive pressure ventilators. Pressure-limited and volume-limited modes were equally distributed among patients with neurological and thoracic disorders. Patients with lung/upper airway disorder preferred pressure-limited ventilation. Twenty one % of LTV users required mechanical ventilation for more than 20 hours per day, 20% were ventilated 12–20 hours per day, and 59% received ventilation only when asleep. The majority of LTV children requiring mechanical ventilation for more than 20 hours per day were neurological patients. Three hundred (98%) children were cared at home. Only five neurological patients remained in hospital.

It's main indication is when mechanical ventilation is expected to be prolonged. However, optimal timing for tracheostomy insertion is unclear, and whilst it has traditionally been viewed as a minimally invasive procedure, serious complications can occur. The requirements for anaesthesia and necessity to teach trainees to become familiar with this procedure are further potential hazards.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1334"><title>Methods</title><p>Retrospective data for all tracheostomies inserted in our intensive care unit at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital from 2006 – 2007 were analysed. The following data was collected: indication for tracheostomy, period from endotracheal intubation to insertion of a tracheostomy, quality of documentation of the procedure, level of supervision, use of fibreoptic bronchoscope, and early and late complications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1335" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>36 patients had percutaneous tracheostomies in our unit between 2006 and 2007.

Complete documentation of the procedure occurred in 91% of cases with bronchoscope guidance and full monitoring in 100%. A consultant (64%) and/or Specialist Registrar was directly involved in the procedure in all cases. If a consultant was not directly involved, they were present at the bedside. We had one early complication of minor bleeding and late complications (at 1 year) in 8% cases (2 stomal infections and 1 symptomatic tracheal stenosis). There was no case of mortality related to tracheostomy insertion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1336" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results from our audit compare favourably with previous studies. A sound level of supervision was achieved in all cases and our complication rate was low. All procedures were successful, and subsequently during this period there were no surgical tracheostomies performed. The one case of tracheal stenosis did not require any intervention and continues to be followed up with no evidence of progressive sequelae. Our level of documentation was below the gold standard as stipulated by the Royal College of Anaesthetists. Since this audit, we are in the process of addressing this, by producing a self-adhesive tracheostomy label to be inserted into the notes. We hope this will not only encourage a more complete documentation of this procedure, but also make identifying insertion details easier.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1337"><title>0565</title><sec id="Sec1338"><title>Bedside Endoscopically Guided Percutaneous Tracheostomy: A Five Year Routine Use of Percutwist (PDT) Technique</title><p>P.

Alarms were responsible for 72.2% and staff for 22.2% of the noise discomfort. Heat, saturometer sensor and hunger were less frequently reported (20%, 18% and 14%). PSYCHIC DISCOMFORT: The main psychic discomfort was anxiety (38%), which was relieved for 66% of the patient, mainly by the staff presence and support (64.2%), more rarely by families and drugs (14.2%). 28% of the patients suffered from a lack of information, 20% felt isolated from their family and 12% complained from a lack of privacy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1378" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>43 patients reported at least 3 sources of discomfort, and 7 report 2. Thirst concerned more than half of the patients, despite the use of water sprays and wet compresses. The pain relief protocol is still insufficient, and analgesia alone does not resolve discomfort caused by decubitus or by the endotracheal tube. Noise and light, which are more bothering at night, participated to a lack of sleep that is often complicated by confusion and agitation. Different measures have to be taken in order to improve the well-being of intensive care patients: early screening of physical and psychological pain, changes in the patients environment and in our habits to preserve their nycthemeral rhythm. Once these measures will be built-up, we will evaluate their effect by further surveys.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1379"><title>0572</title><sec id="Sec1380"><title>Post-ICU Visit: Feasability and Results in Patients with Multiple Organ Failure</title><p>R.

Monitoring peripheral perfusion could be an early and sensitive way to detect vital organ hypoperfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR203">1</xref>). Transcutaneous oxymetry (TO) allows a non invasive measurement of oxygen trancutaneous pressure (PtcO2) which is related to arterial oxygenation pressure (PaO2) and circulatory status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR204">2</xref>). A recent study emphasizes the pronostic value of parameters from TO in patients in SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR205">3</xref>). We hypothesized that variations of PtcO2 (DeltaPtcO2) induced by variations of oxygen arterial content estimated by PaO2 (DeltaPaO2) during an oxygen challenge test could be related to outcome in SS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1487"><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a prospective, observational study, in a universitary hospital. From January to August 2007, all consecutive patients admitted for severe SS requiring mechanical ventilation and vasopressor therapy after early hemodynamic optimisation were included. PtcO2 was measured (Tina 4, Radiometer®, Copenhagen, Denmark) in basal condition and at the end of an oxygen challenge test (OCT: FiO2 1.0 during 15 min.). Arterial blood gaz were performed before and after OCT. DeltaPtcO2/DeltaPaO2 (%) during OCT was calculated 3 times during the first 2 days of hospitalization (H0, H24, H48). The time course of DeltaPtcO2/DeltaPaO2 was analysed and compared between survivors (S) and non survivors (NS) at day 28th (D28), as well as usual hemodynamics and metabolic parameters: mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac index (CI), central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2), norepinephrine infusion amount and lactatemia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1488" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Twenty one patients were included. Eight of them had died at D28 (NS: n=8; S: n=13). Hemodynamic parameters (MAP, CI, ScvO2), infusion of vasopressor and lactatemia were similar between S and NS at H0, H24 and H48. There was no significant difference in the oxymetric index between the 2 groups at H0 (DeltaPtcO2/DeltaPaO2: S:57±31% vs NS:36±38%, p=0.17). However, at H24 and H48, patients showed a DeltaPtcO2/DeltaPaO2 index significantly higher in group S compared with NS (S:83±40% vs NS:37±22%, p=0.01 at H24; S:105±54% vs NS :43±34%, p=0.02 at H48).</p></sec><sec id="Sec1489" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>These preliminary results suggest that increase in DeltaPtcO2/DeltaPaO2 seems to predict better outcome in severe septic shock while circulatory and metabolic parameters such as ScvO2 or lactatemia during the first 2 days of resuscitation remain similar.

In the pathogenesis of septic shock, endotoxin plays an important role. Recently, endotoxin adsorption therapy, polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column (PMX) hemoperfusion, has been widely used in patients with septic shock in Japan. PMX tretment has been based on the binding property of polymxin B to lipid A of endotoxin. Endotoxin induces excessive generation of cytokines which increase systemic inflammatory response and cause tissue damage.

These data suggest a possible correlation between the post-treatment IL-6 levels and a more favourable outcome, whereas pre-treatment IL-6 levels do not seem to be predictive. In contrast, high pretreatment levels of IL-10 and TNF-alfa appears to be related with a poor outcome (Table 2). Finally, significant reduction in cytokine levels seems to be linked with an improvement of hemodynamic and respiratory parameters (Tables 1–2), according with literature.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1529"><title>0596</title><sec id="Sec1530"><title>Polymyxin B Treatment in Septic Patients with Peritonitis Developed after Abdominal Surgery</title><p>G.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the haemoperfusion with PMX (HP-PMX) on organ function and mortality in septic patients undergoing surgical abdominal toilette for peritonitis developed after abdominal surgery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1532"><title>Methods</title><p>12 septic patients (age 63±12, male/female 6/6)were studied. Inclusion criteria were: peritonitis due to gut perforation and/or anastomotic leakage after abdominal surgery, and diagnosed organ failure (two or more organs). Exclusion criteria were: age&lt;18, thrombocytopaenia, hemophilia, PMX allergy. After the intensive care unit (ICU) admission, wound, blood, and peritoneal liquid cultures were performed. At the same time, a single 2- hours-cycle of HP-PMX with the Aquarius haemofiltration machine (Edwards, Edwards Lifesciences) was started at 80ml/min. Haemodynamic parameters were derived with a minimally invasive pulse contour monitoring system (Vigileo, Edwards Lifesciences). Several haemodynamic, respiratory, renal and liver data were collected before starting the HP-PMX (T0), at the end of the HP-PMX (T1), at 24 (T2), and at 48 (T3) hours. T-test and analysis of variance for repeated measures were applied.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1533" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Haemodynamic data: a significant increase in systolic arterial pressure from T0 to T3 (121±15 vs 145±10) was observed. From T0 to T2, a significant reduction in norepinephrine infusion occured (0,26±0,07, 0,14±0,09, 0,09±0,04 mcg/Kg/min, T0, T1,T2, respectively). A T3, only two patients received norepinephrine infusion (0,1 and 0,14 y/Kg/ min). Central venous pressure (CVP, mean at T0 =12,7±1,5) and stroke volume variation (SVV%, mean at T0 = 4,5%) did not show significant difference over the time of the study. Respiratory data. a significant increase in PaO2/FiO2 ratio from T0 to T1 (180±42,1 vs 295±43, p&lt;0.05), and from T2 to T3 (304±65 and 298±60, p0.05) was found. The average time of mechanical ventilation was 10,2±8 days. Renal data: serum creatinine values decreased from T0 to T1 (3,1±0,6 vs 2,3±0,7, p&lt;0.05) and from T1 to T2 (2,3±0,7 vs 1,9±0,6 p &lt; 0,05). Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was applied for 3 patients at T3. Only one of them underwent CRRT up to the fifth day because he had chronic renal failure requiring preoperative dialysis. No statistical significance was found for liver function indexes. The ICU stay resulted 15,8±8 days. The 28 days mortality rate was 25%. The cultures confirmed the presence of Gram- bacteria in each patient.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1534" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In our institution the mortality rate of this kind of patients was about 65%. An optimal timing about the use of the HP-PMX depends on the pathology. In septic patients, with peritonitis due to perforation and/or anastomotic leakage after abdominal surgery, the presence of Gram- bacteria is actually a common condition. Our findings demonstrated that a single 2-hours-cycle of treatment with HP-PMX seemed to reduce the incidence of organ dysfunction and mortality. An earlier surgical toilette of the infected site, combined with a treatment with HP-PMX, may significanlty improve the outcome in these critically ill subjects.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1535"><title>0597</title><sec id="Sec1536"><title>Pmx Treatment of Septic Patients Improved Viability of Pulmonary Epithelial Cells</title><p>V.

Removal of circulating LPS via hemofiltration through a polymyxin-B (PMX-B) filter has recently been tested, and a meta analysis has confirmed that this treatment is effective at reducing circulating endotoxin levels, improving organ function and decreasing overall mortality. Particularly, the lung was observed to have improved gas exchange following treatment; however, the cellular mechanism for this improved pulmonary function remains unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of PMX-B treatment of septic patients on pulmonary epithelial cell viability.

After purification of plasma in a first resin filter, a second blood filter could be used for the removal of excessive fluid and small molecular weight substances. The resin cartridge nonselectively removes circulating inflammatory mediators. This reduction in cytokine load could possibly attenuate their negative effects on organ function and restore leukocytes function (3).

Untreated, it is responsible for an early mortality of approximately 80% and is the leading cause of death among patients hospitalised with AMI. Evidence from studies such as SHOCK (Should we emergently Revascularise Occluded Coronaries for Cardiogenic Shock?) have demonstrated a survival benefit from early revascularisation compared to medical therapy, however this is most beneficial in &lt;75 years old.

The average age was 75 (range 40–90). 20 people were aged &lt;75, and 26 above. There were 28 STEMIs and 18 NSTEMIs. Of the 28 STEMIs, 22 were thrombolysed, those not thrombolysed were due to contraindication or late presentation. In the &lt;75 group, 9 (45%) patients were considered for urgent revascularisation and were discussed with tertiary centre. 3 were transferred acutely (within &lt;24 hours), all received intervention and were alive at both 30 days and subsequently at 1 year. The remaining 6 patients were managed aggressively with medical therapy on ITU but were thought to be clinically unstable/unsuitable for acute transfer so were planned for intervention at a later date. 11 patients &lt;75 were not considered for early revascularisation due to co-morbidity, instability and poor pre-morbid function. Total of 3/20 (15%) of patients &lt;75 underwent early revascularisation in target group. In Hospital Mortality (IHM) for &lt;75s was 13/20 (65%). In patients &gt;75, 2/26 (8%) patients were considered for urgent revascularisation, however neither was transferred, meaning there was 0% early revascularisation in &gt;75s.

Current treatment strategies aim to recruit alveoli. Collapsed alveoli opened by a recruitment manoeuver (RM) tend to recollapse without adequate positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). RMs followed by inadequate PEEP permits unstable alveoli. The resulting cyclic recruitment/derecruitment during mechanical ventilation may contribute to ventilator associated lung injury (VALI) despite improved oxygenation. Results from a previous animal study suggest that total input reactance (Xrs) measured by the forced oscillation technique (FOT) at 5 Hz can be used to assess at the bedside the development of atelectasis and to monitor the efficacy of RM. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a strategy of RMs followed by ‘optimal’ PEEP titrated according to optimal reactance measured by FOT could reduce VALI compared to a standardized strategy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1770"><title>Methods</title><p>In 14 anesthetized and mechanically ventilated pigs, ALI was induced by saline lavage, and the degree of damage was assessed by whole-lung computed tomography. The animals were then studied for 12 hours by continuous monitoring of lung mechanics, gas exchange, FOT and hemodynamics. The animals were randomized into two groups: group A was treated with RMs and PEEP titrated according to optimal reactance measured by FOT every two hours. Titration of PEEP was performed by continuously monitoring reactance during RMs with stepwise reduction of PEEP from 20 cm H20 by steps of 2 cm H2O. PEEP was considered optimal at the step before which the reactance started to decrease. Group B was treated with RMs every two hours and PEEP was adjusted according to the ARDSnet protocol. Plasma TNF-alfa, IL6 and IL8 were measured at baseline and at the end of the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1771" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>At the beginning of the ventilation trial the PEEP level determined by the two approaches were very similar (9.5±2.7 and 8.8±3.0 for group A and B, respectively). After 10 hours of ventilation, PEEP titration by FOT resulted in higher levels of PEEP (9.0±2.1 cm H2O) compared to PEEP set according to the ARDSnet protocol (5.0±0.0 cm H2O) (p=0.01). However, these higher levels of PEEP improved respiratory mechanics as shown by the lower peak inspiratory pressure (14.3±1.9 cm H2O) in group A compared to group B (23.0±6.1 cm H2O) (p &lt; 0.05).

So far, data from mechanically ventilated (MV) patients have been compared with normal lung weights obtained in spontaneously breathing (SB) subjects. However, lung weights of SB patients with normal lungs may differ from those of MV patients with normal lungs because of factors such as raised intrathoracic pressure or intravenous volume-expansion.

Inhospital mortality was 63.3%. At the time of the study, 82 of 119 survivors were available to participate. There were 26 responders(31.7%) none of whom were on long term RRT. 19% had returned to their previous level of QOL, 27% had 90% of their previous QOL and a further 19% had attained 70% or more of their previous level of QOL. 30.8% managed only between 30 and 60% of their previous level of QOL. 24 out of 26 responders consented to readmission to ICU in the future if required, 2 had no preference and none refused re-admission. The analysis of SF-36 revealed a statistically significant reduction in the physical component summary (p=0.000001) of these patients compared to the general UK population.

These patients can be cared for in a weaning unit, a cost-effective alternative. The UK Department of Health has recommended that Trusts should review the need for such a service on a regional basis. We used a retrospective cohort of ICU admissions in Lothian, a region of Scotland, to characterise the PMV population, report incidence and outcomes, and define predictors of PMV. These data were used to model a weaning unit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1827"><title>Methods</title><p>The study population comprised ICU admissions to the three adult ICUs in Lothian recorded in the Scottish Intensive Care Society Audit Group (SICSAG) database. The study period was from Jan 2002 to Dec 2006. Exclusions were: transfers to or from other ICUs, readmissions and those aged &lt;16. Patients ventilated for &gt;=21 days were defined as the PMV group and &lt;21 days the non-PMV group. Baseline characteristics were compared between groups. Annual incidence was determined and outcomes compared between groups. Trend in mortality was assessed adjusting for age, sex, APACHE II score, hospital site and operative status. Predictors for PMV were assessed at both day 1 and day 7 of ICU stay using binary logistic regression. Weaning unit models were defined assuming PMV patients would be transferred to the weaning unit following 21 days of ventilation and a period free from vasoactive and renal support.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1828" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>7419 patients fulfilled inclusion criteria. In comparison to the non-PMV group (n=7094), PMV patents (n=325) were older (59.6 vs 56.9, p=0.007), had a higher APACHE II score (20.9 vs 18.8, p &lt; 0.001), and were more likely to have a non-operative diagnostic code (79.6% vs 63.7%, p &lt; 0.001). Incidence of PMV was 4.4 per 100 ICU admissions, or 6.2 per 100 ventilated admissions. This was equivalent to 27.2% of funded ICU bed-days in Lothian. PMV incidence showed a downward trend over the 5 years (chi<sup>2</sup> for trend=10.4, p=0.001) using ICU admissions as the denominator; this was confirmed using ventilated patients as the denominator (p=0.02). Mortality for PMV patients was higher at ICU discharge (28% vs 23%, p=0.046), and at hospital discharge (42.1% vs 33.9%, p=0.003). Mortality remained static in the PMV group over the 5 year study period. Adjusting mortality for confounders, however, showed a downward trend. Significant predictors of PMV on day 1 were: APACHE II score, previous cardiopulmonary resuscitation, admission diagnosis, operative status, PaO<sub>2</sub>:FiO<sub>2</sub> (PF) ratio, ventilated on day 1 and vasoactive support on day 1. On day 7, only diagnosis on admission, PF ratio, ventilated on day 1, and requirement for renal or vasoactive support on days 5 or 6 were significant. The weaning unit models showed a potential saving of 1.6-2.0 ICU bed-days/year, equivalent to an annual cost saving of £300000 (€380000).</p></sec><sec id="Sec1829" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have characterised the PMV population and established PMV incidence in Lothian ICUs. Mortality remains higher amongst PMV patients. Predictors have been identified which may aid early identification of PMV patients. Models for a weaning unit show substantial cost savings. This subgroup of ICU patients remains important due to its resource utilisation, using around one quarter of funded ICU bed-days.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1830"><title>Grant Acknowledgement</title><p>N I Lone received funding from an MRC studentship and Eli Lilly to attend the ESICM.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1831"><title>0644</title><sec id="Sec1832"><title>Agitation in the ICU: Description of Its Incidence and Associated Risk Factors</title><p>A.

Main patient characteristics were similar between both non-TP vs. TP (age, 56±17 vs. 57±17 years, P=0.67; female sex 41% vs. 39%, P=0.72; APACHE II 16±8 vs. 17±9, P=0.42; medical/ surgical admission, 48%/52% vs. 49%/51%, P=0.64). In 67% of transfers, the main reason for referral was the need for specific surgical procedures (neurosurgery and interventional radiology) or ICU expertise (24% of referrals). General condition of TP was better than non-TP as demonstrated by blank history, less cancer, and less end-stage renal failure (P&lt;0.001; P=0.02 and P=0.006). During ICU-stay, TP more frequently needed respiratory support (P&lt;0.001), vaso-active and sedative medication (P=0.01, and P&lt;0.001), and had higher mean SOFA score (5±4 vs. 4±4, P=0.03); however, no difference was found in need for dialysis (P=0.47). The latter finding could be probably explained by a higher number of TP on DNR-code while in the ICU (15% vs. 6%, P=0.007). A trend towards higher admission rates during the weekend was observed for TP vs. non-TP (34% vs. 24%, P=0.06), respectively. Among the TP-group, higher ICU re-admissions rates (18% vs. 10%, P=0.03), longer ICU-LOS (9±11 vs. 5±7 days, P&lt;0.01), and increased ICU-mortality (17% vs. 9%, P=0.03) was observed when compared to the non-TP-group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1860" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In our ICU, TP were found to be more severely ill, to have worse prognosis and poorer outcomes than non-TP.

Over 4 million units in the UK and USA are transfused each year. Despite comprehensive guidelines as many as half of all transfusions in the critically ill may be inappropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR254">1</xref>). FFP transfusion in critcal care is associated with significant morbidity, including an increased risk of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR255">2</xref>) and Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR256">3</xref>). Conventional coagulation assays including International Normalized Ratio (INR) are often used to guide FFP transfusion, however a moderately deranged INR (&lt;1.9) is not an accurate predictor of bleeding.

Administration to patients with mildly deranged coagulation assays is common. Transfusion is unlikely to be beneficial in these patients in the absence of active bleeding. In addition a large number of FFP transfusions use sub-therapeutic doses — prominent guidelines suggest volumes of 12–15 ml/kg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR257">4</xref>).</p><p>It is important to carefully assess the indications for FFP administration as transfusion is associated with significant adverse effects.

Acute AAA was defined as either acute non-ruptured (N=82) or ruptured (CT or laparotomy-proven, N=183). There were 228 men and 37 women with a mean age of 71.9± s.d. 7.8 years (range 54-88). 16% of the patients was 80 years of older (N=42). Open treatment was performed in 191 patients (72%) and endovascular treatment in 74 (28%). When divided in a younger (&lt;80 years) and an older (≥80 years) group, no differences were observed, except for more women in the older group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1975" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The mean follow-up was 33.8± 30.4 months (including early deaths). Mean hospital length of stay was 17± 20 days for patients younger than 80 and 15± 17 days for patients older than 80 years of age. Fifty-two patients (20%) died during postoperative ICU and hospital stay. Kaplan Meier survival analysis revealed a significantly better survival for the younger either with a cut off at 75 years (log rank test p&lt;0.001) or 80 years (p&lt;0.05). Stratification based on urgency or type of treatment did not change the difference. Two-year actuarial survival was 72.1% for patients younger than 80 and 59.5% for those older than 80. At 5 years follow-up, these figures were 66.7 and 47.6%, respectively. Mean survival in patients older than 80 was 43.6± 7.2 months versus 65.4± 3.0 months in those younger than 80.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1976" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our liberal strategy of treating patients with AAAA was associated with satisfactory short and long-term outcome, also for octogenarians. Even with a devastating event such as AAAA, a mean survival of more than 3.5 years can be achieved in octogenarians, while hospital length of stay is not prolonged compared to the younger, and natural history of disease would give a survival of virtually zero %. Assuming an integrated system for managing AAA is in place, advanced age is not a reason to deny patients surgery or ICU-admission.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1977"><title>0667</title><sec id="Sec1978"><title>Neurotoxicity Induced by Cefepime : A Retrospective Review of 51 Cases</title><p>J.

It was speculated that neurotoxicity induced by cefepime could be associated to it. The aim of our study was to review all cefepime-induced neurotoxicity cases published in medical literature. It was focused on predisposing factors and clinical characteristics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1980"><title>Methods</title><p>We have searched in the PubMed, Scielo and Lilacs databases for cefepime publications from 1998 to april of 2008. We selected the pertinent publications dealing with cefepime induced neurotoxicity. The main search term used was ‘cefepime’, combined with one of the following: ‘encephalopathy’, ‘neurotoxicity’, ‘cerebral toxicity’, ‘seizure’, ‘status epilepticus’ and ‘neuropsychiatric’. Data about these articles were retrospectively analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1981" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The search retrieved 19 articles reporting a total of 51 patients (26 men), aged from 15 to 94 years old (mean = 63.6 years).

The dosage of cefepime ranged from 1–9g/day (mean: 3.7). Renal failure of varying degree and time of onset was present in almost all cases. Fifty-two percent of them have had ClCr&lt;15ml/min and 60% of these patients were in renal replacement therapy. The common neurologic symptoms reported were myoclonus (n= 27), confusion (n= 24), coma (n= 12), agitation (n= 10) and seizure (n= 9). About 70% of the patients had an encephalopathy-compatible EEG. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus developed in 3 men and 5 women, with a mean age of 62.6 (17.8) years, all of them had renal failure. The mean latency to develop symptoms was 6.5 days.

Arterial hypertension is a wellknown risk factor for postoperative intracerebral hemorrhaghe, while hypoxia and arterial hypotension might exacerbate neuronal injury. Therefore, emergence from anesthesia for brain tumor surgery should guarantee stable systemic (cardiovascular as well as respiratory) parameters. This prospective study was performed to compare early postoperative systemic complications after emergence of anesthesia in pts awakened in the operating room at the end of surgery or on the ICU (within a max of 4 hours of ICU admission).</p></sec><sec id="Sec1986"><title>Methods</title><p>Over a 2-years period, 142 pts scheduled for elective brain tumor surgery were randomised into early awakening (71pts) or postoperative short-term sedation with propofol (71pts). We analysed and compared the incidence of respiratory events (hypoxia defined as PaO2&lt;90mmHg, hypercapnea defined as PaCO2 &gt;46mmHg) and cardiovascular events (arterial pressure increase above 30% of baseline, systolic arterial pressure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1987" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Patients who were awakened in the operating room revealed a 5.3% incidence of arterial hypoxia, while in 27.3% of them hypercapnea was observed.

In late awakening pts, incidence of arterial hypoxia was 18%, while incidence of hypercapnea was 8.3%.</p><p>Analysis of cardiovascular complications revealed that no pt in the early awakening group developed postoperative arterial hypotension necessitating administration of vasopressors. In the late awakening group, 4.3% of pt revealed hypotensive values (2.9% necessitating the use of vasopressors). In the early awakening group, incidence of arterial hypertension (necessitating antihypertensive medication) was 14.3%, while for the postoperative short-term sedated pts, incidence of arterial hypertension (with antihypertensive medication) was 21.5%. We observed no difference in duration of postoperative ICU stay between both groups and no difference in incidence of major neurological complications (postoperative hemorrhaghe or cerebral edema).</p></sec><sec id="Sec1988" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Pts allowed to early awakening after brain tumor surgery revealed an increased incidence of hypercapnea, while pts submitted to postoperative short-term sedation with propofol appeared to be more vulnerable to arterial hypoxemia and especially to arterial hypertension.

Yeoman</p><p>Adult Intensive Care, Queens Medical Centre, Nottingham, United Kingdom</p><sec id="Sec2042" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cerebral damage arising from traumatic brain injury (TBI) can occur primarily at the time of injury or can occur secondarily at a temporally distant time point post insult1. Low haemoglobin concentration (Hb) occurs in 17–58% of head injured patients and may exacerbate secondary brain injury2,3. Anaemia may occur as a result of blood loss from extra-cranial trauma, pre-existing disease or dilution from fluid replacement during resuscitation. Low Hb will lead to reduced oxygen delivery to cerebral tissue and may contribute to ischeamic brain injury4. However, high Hb levels or blood transfusion may increase blood viscosity, reducing cerebral blood flow or result in transfusion related side effects5. We have studied the admission Hb in moderate to severe TBI patients, examining its role as a prognostic indicator in these patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2043"><title>Methods</title><p>All patients admitted to the Queens Medical Centre from 1993 to 2002 with a recorded Glasgow Coma Score of 13 or less within 48 hours of a TBI were included in the Nottingham Head Injury Register.

We looked at the strength of the association between the admission Hb and the outcome.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2044" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Data were available on 487 patients. The mean age was 36 years (range 16–91). 76% of the patients were male. Of the 487 patients 165 died at one year. The Hb was abnormal in 37.57% of patients (decreased in 37.16%, increased in 0.41%). Linear regression and logistic regression after group division into Dead versus Alive and Favourable versus Unfavourable outcome were significant for the whole range of decreased Hb but particularly striking and clinically relevant outcome difference was found where the Hb was less than 8g/l (Chi squared p value &lt; 0.001).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2045" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Decreased Hb was observed in patients presenting with moderate or severe TBI and was associated with unfavourable outcome. An admission Hb less than 8g/l is a statistically significant indicator of poor prognosis in moderate to severe TBI patients and may be useful prognostic markers in these patients. This may be a valuable addition to prognostic scoring systems.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec2046"><title>0678</title><sec id="Sec2047"><title>Prevalence of Admission Arterial Paco2 Impairment in Severe Brain Injury Patients</title><p>E.

Morita Department of Anesthesiology andResucitology, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, Japan</p><sec id="Sec2055" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hypothyroidism is well known to be associated with end-stage liver disease. Changes in pituitary-thyroid function occur in patients undergoing major surgical procedures. Such changes are referred to as the euthyroid sick syndrome, which decreases in serum Triiodo-thyronin (T3) and Thyroxine (T4) concentrations. This hypothyroidism has different causes in different patients, and has different effects on different tissues. The literature on hypothyroidism after liver transplantation is limited. The influence of hypothyroidism in liver regeneration is controversial. We have prospectively studied thyroid function and its association with liver function during postoperative course after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2056"><title>Methods</title><p>Seventy-two patients who have received LDLT at our institution between November 2004 and September 2007 were registered. The thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free T3 and free T4 levels were investigated at consecutive time points (preoperatively, Postoperative day 1, 7). We have also investigated the influencing factors on the thyroid function at POD1, including preoperative factors. We collected postoperative liver function tests, such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), International normalized ratio (INR) of Prothrombin time (PT) and Total bilirubin (T-Bil) taken at postoperative day 1, 2, 4 and 7. Finally, we have investigated the relationship between postoperative thyroid function and liver function. Data were expressed as means with standard deviations. Analyses were conducted using Student's t test and logistic linear regression as appropriate. A p &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2057" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Eleven patients (15%) had preoperatively hypothyroidism who had received thyroxine. TSH, free T3, and free T4 showed a significant decrease compared with pre-operative level at POD1. (pre-TSH: 2.76±3.47, POD1-TSH: 0.53±0.54; p0.0001, pre-freeT3: 2.24±0.60, POD1-free T3: 1.44±0.50; p0.0001, pre-T4: 1.20±0.20, POD1-free T4: 1.03±0.2; p=0.0005). POD7-TSH increased compared with POD1 (p=0.005), while POD7-free T3, T4 did not change compared with POD1 (p=0.37, 0.13). Any patients except for pre-hypothyroidism did not have thyroxine during postoperative course. By linear regression analysis, we could find that age and MELD score were associated with the decrease of free-T3 at POD1. (R2: 0.07, p=0.03; R2: 0.07, p=0.04). We also could find the positive correlation between the decrease of free-T3 at POD1 and serum TBil at POD 4, 7 (p=0.04, 0.04), although we could not find any significant relationship between free-T3 at POD1 and postoperative liver function, complication, and outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2058" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Patients undergoing LDLT exhibit marked decrease in serum thyroid hormones, especially in older and higher MELD score patients. Stress response, anesthesia, and perioperative fasting may be decisive factors eliciting this response. These metabolic derangements do not deteriorate the clinical outcome and subsequently may be an adaptive response for energy preservation in various organs.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec2059"><title>0680</title><sec id="Sec2060"><title>Continuous Postoperative Blood Glucose Monitoring and Control by Artificial Pancreas in Patients Undergoing Pancreatic Resection: A Prospective Randomized Clinical Trial</title><p>H.

Twenty four hours later bilateral swelling of the upper legs was observed and the patient gradually started complaining of weakness in both lower limbs with impaired sensation below the right knee. Nerve conduction studies and electromyography confirmed bilateral sciatic nerve injury. Three weeks after admission, he developed sepsis treated with IV ciprofloxacin. Cultures from the gluteal discharge confirmed the presence of Pseudomonas and Bacteroides fragilis, requiring adjustment of the antibiotic therapy to meropenem. Despite this he remained febrile; both buttocks were very tense and edematous up to the lateral aspect of both thighs and associated with severe pain. An MRI of the gluteal region/lower limbs showed bilateral multiple gluteal compartment syndrome, intramuscular hematoma and swelling of both thighs with edema of both sciatic nerves. Urgent fasciotomy of the gluteal and right thigh was performed with drainage of the collection followed by three more sessions of debridement of necrotic tissue and muscle.

In an age of early warning systems, Outreach and Medical Emergency teams there is ever increasing interest around inhospital cardiac arrests. It is well recognised that many cardiac arrests, particularly those presenting with pulseless electrical activity (PEA) or asystole are predictable and potentially preventable consequences of suboptimal medical care. Southend hospital is a large district hospital serving an aged population of approximately 300,000. The aim of this audit was to establish the incidence, type and outcome from cardiac arrest occurring amongst in patients on the acute wards at our hospital. The secondary aims were to highlight some of the strengths and weaknesses of our acute care services, and to guide future developments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2145"><title>Methods</title><p>Data collected daily by the Resuscitation Officer was retrospectively analysed for all ward cardiac arrests occurring between 1 June 2005 and 31 May 2007.

Overall survival to discharge was 5.8%, survival to discharge for asystole/PEA was 1.6% and for VF/PVT 27.7%. Survival to 1 year was 0.5% and 27.7% respectively. The figures in brackets in the table demonstrate the number of patients on the Coronary Care Unit (on CCU) for each type of cardiac arrest and outcome. There is a preponderance of asystolic/PEA cardiac arrests on the general wards and the outcome is very poor.

The introduction of Medical Emergency Teams (METs) in our hospital has led to a significant reduction in the mortality of risk patients. Data from several studies indicate that in a large number of cases, although patients met criteria for MET activation, that action was not performed. Several important barriers to staff calling for higher assistance have been identified. In the present study we tried to evaluate the occurrence of MET calls in patients who died during their hospitalization and their association with the presence of MET calling criteria in the 24 hours before death and the existence of a do not resuscitate (DNR) order.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2151"><title>Methods</title><p>An integrated emergency program is implemented in our hospital since 2003, which includes continuous training of all staff, METs, widened calling criteria, and periodical audits. In order to evaluate the impact of this program in hospital mortality we conducted a retrospective analysis of the medical records of the patients that died between October 2007 and January 2008. Studied variables included demographic variables, MET calls, the presence of MET calling criteria within the 24 hour period before death and the existence of a DNR order. Patients from the emergency and intensive care department were excluded, as METs are not activated for these places.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2152" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>6507 patients were admitted in the hospital.

From the remaining 46 patients, we gathered complete data in 37. MET was called for 9 of these 37 patients. From the remaining 28 patients, there were alarm signs registered in 12 patients, who had a presumed DNR order. There were no registered alarm signs in the other 16 patients. Further analysis of these patients revealed that the majority had a presumed DNR order (12 patients) and that MET calling criteria weren't properly recognized in 4 patients (3%).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2153" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>More than half of the patients had registered alarm signs, although they might have a DNR order. On those patients without a DNR order, MET was called in all that had an alarm sign. Alarm signs were not properly recognized in only 3% of the patients who died. This low percentage might be explained by the integrated emergency program, which includes training and education of all the staff.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec2154"><title>0695</title><sec id="Sec2155"><title>Procalcitonin — A Predictor Of Outcome After Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation?</title><p>N.

Important features of ECG consisted of ventricular bigeminism, then severe bradycardia (20 bpm), long QTc (524 msec) and polymorphic ventricular extrasystoles. Activated charcoal was administered but no gastric lavage was performed seeing severe arrhythmias and hemodynamic compromise. Saline infusion, atropine (3 mg loading dose, and 0.5 mg/6 hours during 48 hours) and magnesium sulfate (6 g loading dose, and 3 g/24 hours for 48 hours) were administered to treat hypotension, muscarinic signs and arrhythmias, respectively.

LD50 is about 5 mg which represents 2 to 4 grams of crushed roots. Cardiac and neurological toxicities, as well as increased vagal tone, are due to activation of voltage-dependent sodium channels. Cardiotoxicity consists in early and delayed afterdepolarisation. Indeed, during late repolarisation (phase 4 of the action potential) of the Purkinje cells, aconitine-attached Na channels open, allowing sodium influx and depolarization (“delayed afterdepolarization”). This results in increased automaticity (premature ventricular beats). During late phase 2 or early phase 3 (repolarisation), aconitine-induced Na accumulation induces depolarization (“early afterdepolarisation”). This results in long QT interval with a risk of torsades de pointes. Antiarrhythmic agents have inconstant results in aconite intoxication. Especially amiodarone could promote torsades de pointes. The effects of magnesium sulfate on aconitine-induced ventricular arrhythmias have been studied in animal models (1). In contrast to other antiarrhythmic agents, it abolishes early afterdepolarisation and shortens the prolonged duration of the Purkinje cell action potential.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2177" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first clinical report of aconitine-induced polymorphic ventricular arrhythmias successfully treated with magnesium sulfate..</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec2178"><title>0699</title><sec id="Sec2179"><title>Stress Reactions Of Medical Students Responders To A Simulated Cardiac Arrest</title><p>C.

Anaesthesia standards for intra-hospital patient transfer &amp; anaesthesia in A&amp;E were audited according to the RCoA (6).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2201" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The results demonstrated deficits in training &amp; knowledge of the equipment &amp; assistance. 71.4% of trainees responded &amp; only 5% had received training in anaesthesia in non-theatre environments within the last year; 13% had received a orientation session. During transfers 65% patients had minimal monitoring, 28% patients had no physiological parameters recorded despite transfer up to 135 min. 67% trainees believed their assistant was suitably trained for induction of anaesthesia &amp; 14.7% described poor assistance with RSI; 21% found minimal monitoring unavailable.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2202" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Changes implemented included the creation of transfer training for trainees. A 24 hr outreach service has now been created in one hospital &amp; a vital part of the role is to support anaesthetists; this data was a major part of the business case to justify its establishment. Reaudit of trainees demonstrated a substantial improvement, but training in emergency situations has now been set up. We recommend that all ICU review their training for the nontheatre environment. New staff should undergo an orientation that is regularly up-dated. We believe that trainees should undergo specific training &amp; demonstrate proficiency in anaesthesia in the non-theatre environment.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Evidence of the inadequacy of intensive care provision.
