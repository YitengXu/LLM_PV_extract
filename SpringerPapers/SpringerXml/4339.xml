This experiment was carried out to investigate the effect of organic photovoltaics (OPV) and red-foil (RF) transmittance on growth, yield, photosynthesis and SPAD value of spinach under greenhouse and field conditions. Three OPV levels (P0: control; P1: transmittance peak of 0.11 in blue light (BL) and 0.64 in red light (RL); P2: transmittance peak of 0.09 in BL and 0.11 in RL) and two spinach genotypes (bufflehead, eland) were combined in a 3 × 2 factorial arrangement in a completely randomized design with 4 replications in the greenhouse, while two RF levels (RF0: control; RF1: transmittance peak of 0.01 in BL and 0.89 in RL) and two spinach genotypes were combined in a 2 × 2 factorial in randomized complete block design with four replications in the field. Data were collected on growth, yield, photosynthesis and chlorophyll content. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed significant reduction in shoot weight and total biomass of spinach grown under very low light intensities as a function of the transmittance properties of the OPV cell used (P2). P1 competed comparably (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) with control in most growth and yield traits measured. In addition, shoot to root distribution was higher in P1 than control. RF reduced shoot and total biomass production of spinach in the field due to its inability to transmit other spectra of light. OPV-RF transmittance did not affect plant height (PH), leaf number (LN), and SPAD value but leaf area (LA) was highest in P2. Photochemical energy conversion was higher in P1, P2 and RF1 in contrast to control due to lower levels of non-photochemical energy losses through the Y(NO) and Y(NPQ) pathways. Photo-irradiance curves showed that plants grown under reduced light (P2) did not efficiently manage excess light when exposed to high light intensities. Bufflehead genotype showed superior growth and yield traits than eland across OPV and RF levels. It is therefore recommended that OPV cells with transmittance properties greater than or equal to 11% in BL and 64% in RL be used in APV systems for improved photochemical and land use efficiency.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Agrophotovoltaics</kwd><kwd>Photovoltaic transmittance</kwd><kwd>Photochemical yield</kwd><kwd>Non-photochemical energy

environmental friendly sources of renewable energy as a consequence of climate change, and the bid to meet the global energy demand have led to increased use of solar energy or PV panels in homes and offices. This trend has led to land use crisis between food production and energy (Weselek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>) as PV installations on open areas remains the most cost effective option (Fraunhofer ISE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2015</xref>). There is a growing concern about the loss of agricultural land to the more lucrative PV energy production. Unfortunately, with the global population projected to rise from its current 7.7 billion to 8.5 billion in 2030 (UN Report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2020</xref>), the competition for limited agricultural land is expected to rise with greater impacts in very densely populated regions with small land area.</p><p id="Par37">Agrophotovoltaics (APV) is an emerging technology that integrates food production under PV panels (Trommsdorff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2021</xref>). Organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells are small, flexible and semi-transparent type of PVs that uses organic semi-conductors to produce electricity from sunlight (Cheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2018</xref>; Hou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2018</xref>). It has absorption properties that can be modified to complement the light spectral range (400–700 nm) of photosynthesizing plants (Ravishankar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2021</xref>) while selectively using irradiance outside the plant light range for electricity production. Due to its small sizes, it can be installed over plants in limited space. APV has the potential to provide the right balance between food and energy needs of the future populace (Ravishankar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2021</xref>), increase land use efficiency by up to 80% (Touil et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2021</xref>), reduce photodamage by cutting the proportion of irradiance reaching the plants by up to 40% (Allardyce et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2017</xref>; Dijk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2021</xref>), and increase efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry (Ravishankar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2021</xref>) which is directly correlated with yield (Xu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2020</xref>). In addition, electricity produced from the PV cells can be used to power farm appliances, and the shading effect can help conserve water during dry spells which are invaluable cost saving benefits to a farmer.</p><p id="Par38">Spinach (<italic>Spinacia oleracea</italic>) is a very nutritious leafy vegetable of the amaranth family with huge potentials to thrive in shade and extreme cold conditions in addition to its short life cycle. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of integrating spinach under OPV cells (in greenhouse) or simulating red foils (RF) (in field) on growth and yield performance, photosynthesis and chlorophyll content of two spinach genotypes in greenhouse and field conditions during the winter season.</p><p id="Par39">Recent studies involving APV have been done using opaque panels and largely on PV cover ratios. For instance, Ezzaeri et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2018</xref>) observed similar growth and yield patterns in shaded and control treatments when tomato was grown under 10% PV cover ratio; Liu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2019</xref>) reported comparable stem length in mungbean grown under PV shading; Zisis et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2019</xref>) reported 21.8% taller plants in pepper grown under PV with 22% cover ratio; Tang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2020</xref>) observed 30% and 20% increase in chlorophyll content and fruit weight, respectively for PV shaded strawberry at 25.9% cover ratio relative to control; Thompson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2020</xref>) reported 14 and 53% increase in protein content of basil and spinach, respectively for PV shaded treatment compared to control, and up to 68% in pepper in addition to improved photosynthetic efficiency (Ravishankar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2021</xref>); Hassanien et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2022</xref>) reported taller plants with higher fruit yields (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) in PV shaded (13–26% cover ratio) chili pepper compared to control.</p><p id="Par40">This study provides the first report on APV using OPV cells and RF in literature. We hypothesized that growing spinach under OPV cells or RF could produce comparable yield under strong light intensities to growing them in open field. We investigated the response of two spinach varieties to different light transmittance provided by two OPV cells and an RF. We constructed photo-irradiance curves over a wide internal PPFD range to ascertain how increasing light intensities and quality of light transmitted interact. We quantified photosynthesis, SPAD value, and growth indices over a less variable sun-induced PPFD range to understand how these variables were affected by transmittance quality and genotype.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Experimental site</title><p id="Par41">Two experiments were carried out at the Institute of Bio-and Geosciences (IBG-2), Plant Sciences, Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH, 50.9096° N, 6.4130° E, Germany.

Y(II), Y(NPQ), Y(NO) and ETR were computed following the procedures of Genty et al.

These traits are fundamental in partitioning the proportion of absorbed energy that is actually used for PSII photochemistry, the proportion of excess excitation energy that is harmlessly dissipated at the antenna, and the proportion of excess excitation energy that reaches reaction centers (RC) which could potentially cause photodamage under very high intensity. For instance, at very high irradiance, higher Y(NPQ) values relative to Y(NO) implies that excess light were successfully dissipated at the antenna before reaching the RC and that photosynthetic fluxes are well regulated. In contrast, higher Y(NO) over Y(NPQ) is an indication that excess light is reaching the RC causing strong reduction in PSII acceptors and photodamage (Genty et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1996</xref>).

It is a very important parameter because; it regulates the amount and quality of light absorbed by leaves. It also provides a basis to explain variation in photosynthetic efficiencies as a function of different light spectra it transmits. According to Liu and Van lersel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2021</xref>) light intensity and quality can affect physiological and yield processes. In this study, P1 with a higher transmittance of red light (RL) (64%) and blue light (BL) (11%) was statistically similar (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) to P0 in FSW, DSW, TBW and was superior to P0 in TED. However, P2 with lower transmittance of RL (11%) and BL (9%) influenced lower values in all the yield traits (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The higher root weight of P0 plants (0.15) in contrast to the higher TED of P1 (15.27) and P2 (10.99) is an indication that OPV plants utilized greater proportion of the absorbed light energy for shoot production as against root development. LMA was not significantly different among treatments although P1 and P2 had insignificantly higher value (0.02) compared to P0 (0.01) implying that the plants did not sufficiently adjust their leaves to reduced light.

For instance, at low light intensity, plants tend to increase the size of their antenna and reduce it at very high light intensity (Fryer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1998</xref>) as a protective mechanism to regulate the quantum of light energy that is absorbed and transmitted to the reaction centers, which explains why P2 with the least transmittance recorded the largest LA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>RF transmittance reduced yield attributes of spinach under extreme cold conditions in the field</title><p id="Par65">RF transmitted majorly monochromatic RL (89%) with very infinitesimal proportion of BL (&lt; 1%), which impacted on shoot weight, total biomass weight and photosynthesis of spinach in extreme field condition. RF in contrast to full irradiance significantly reduced FSW, DSW, TBW, LMA and TED under field conditions. The reduction in shoot weight, biomass, leaf mass per area and total energy distribution of spinach across genotypes is suggestive of the RF’s inability to supply complementary blue light spectra which is a major contributor to photosynthesis as it has been reported to influence leaf expansion, stomata increase and opening as well as maximum and effective quantum yields of photosystem II photochemistry (Miao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2015</xref>) which directly impacts crop yield.

The higher photochemical efficiencies of OPV and RF treated plants and the lower non photochemical energy losses at the antenna Y(NPQ) and reaction centers Y(NO) could be implicated on the effect of the materials in reducing the incident radiation reaching the plants thereby minimizing the potential for photo-oxidative damage. P0 and RF0 plants were unable to effectively convert greater proportion of their excitation energy to photochemistry due to higher non-photochemical energy losses via the regulated Y(NPQ) and unregulated (Y(NO) pathways. Increased photosynthetic efficiencies and decreased non photochemical quenching in reduced light have been reported in other crop species (Gong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2015</xref>; Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2016</xref>; Song and Li <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2016</xref>; Ravishankar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2021</xref>; Schmierer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2021</xref>).

Light quality and intensity can affect physiological and yield processes of plants. In this study, we confirmed significant reduction in shoot weight and total biomass of spinach grown under very low light intensities as a function of the transmittance properties of the OPV cell used (P2). Interestingly, P1 with high transmittance properties and good balance of blue and red light was comparable to control in most of the growth and yield traits measured which confirms our hypothesis. In addition, it influenced better shoot to root distribution than control. In general, greenhouse plants outperformed field plants due to the improved micro-climate environment of the greenhouse relative to the field.</p><p id="Par72">Light quality in terms of spectra or colors of light that a plant is exposed to can also influence performance. This was confirmed in this study as RF reduced shoot and total biomass production of spinach in the field and could be implicated on its inability to transmit other complementary light spectra aside RL. OPV-RF transmittance did not affect plant height (PH), leaf number (LN), and SPAD value but leaf area (LA) was highest in P2. Photochemical energy conversion was higher in P1, P2 and RF1 in contrast to control due to lower levels of non-photochemical energy losses through the Y(NO) and Y(NPQ) pathways.</p><p id="Par73">Photo-irradiance curves showed that plants grown under reduced light (P2) did not efficiently manage excess light when exposed to high light intensities.

This study is also a confirmation that photovoltaics can successfully be integrated with crop production without significant reduction in yield traits. P1 installed over spinach plants in the greenhouse competed favorably with the control plants in fresh and dry shoot weight, fresh and dry biomass weight and leaf mass per area. However, decrease in shoot and biomass yield was observed with RF1 plants in the field, and also with P2 plants in the greenhouse principally as a result of insufficient light. It is therefore important to strike the right balance in terms of using the right PV materials, transmittance, distance from the plant, installation angle etc., to resolve some of the challenges at least in the short term. Perhaps with further experimentations, the ideal mix with respect to the panel type, transmittance, installation angle and height for enhanced efficiency of the system will be obtained. On the basis of these findings, it is recommended that OPV cells with transmittance properties greater than or equal to 11% in BL and 64% in RL be used in APV systems for improved efficiency.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful to the BMBF for funding.
