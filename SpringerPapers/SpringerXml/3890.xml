One of the most exciting prospects to realize this goal is the photocatalyst-biocatalyst integrated artificial photosynthesis system which affords solar fuel/chemicals in high selectivity from CO<sub>2</sub>. Graphene based photocatalysts are highly suitable for the system, but their industrial scale use requires immobilization for improved separation and recovery of the photocatalyst. Therefore for practical purposes, design and fabrication of film type graphene photocatalyst with higher solar energy conversion efficiency is an absolute necessity. As a means to achieve this, we report herein the successful development of a new type of flexible graphene film photocatalyst that leads to &gt;225% rise in visible light harvesting efficiency of the resultant photocatalyst-biocatalyst integrated artificial photosynthesis system for highly selective solar fuel production from CO<sub>2</sub> compared to conventional spin coated graphene film photocatalyst. It is an important step towards the design of a new pool of graphene film based photocatalysts for artificial photosynthesis of solar fuels from CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></abstract><kwd-group

ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. This has triggered keen interest in the development of graphene based nanoparticle powder or nanocomposite photocatalysts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. However the industrial scale application of these photocatalysts is largely limited due to difficulty in their filtration and separation. Therefore for practical and economic purposes design and fabrication of film type graphene photocatalyst with higher solar energy conversion efficiency is an absolute necessity.</p><p id="Par3">Graphene films have been previously fabricated by spin coating method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Although easy to formulate, uncontrolled capillary flow and dewetting processes during solvent evaporation result in non-uniform films with random orientation of graphene-chromophore units leading to increased charge recombination and consequently lower photocatalytic activity. Moreover, chromophore coupling to graphene sheet is usually carried out through functional groups such as –COOH present on graphene oxide (GO) or its reduced forms such as chemically converted graphene (CCG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. They contain a large number of non-conjugated tetrahedral sp<sup>3</sup> carbons which lie slightly above or below the graphene plane, further limiting electronic conductivity of the photocatalyst<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Keeping in view these crucial bottlenecks, it is imperative to develop a new design and fabrication strategy for graphene film photocatalysts.</p><p id="Par4">Here we report the successful development of a new type of flexible graphene film photocatalyst (hereinafter GFPC 1; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) that leads to a 2.3 fold rise in visible light harvesting efficiency of the resultant photocatalyst-biocatalyst integrated artificial photosynthesis system (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) for highly selective solar fuel production from CO<sub>2</sub> compared to conventional spin coated graphene film photocatalyst. The monolayer graphene for this work was supported on a flexible polyimide sheet leading to a practical and easy to use photocatalyst. It also helped to solve the problem of insufficient mechanical strength of monolayer graphene film photocatalyst. The lack of functional groups on graphene monolayer for chromophore attachment presented another major challenge. This was ingeniously overcome by attaching chromophore units to sp<sup>2</sup> carbon centers on graphene <italic>via</italic> 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction. To the best of our knowledge, graphene film photocatalyst for solar fuel production using this approach has not been fabricated prior to this work.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Photograph of GFPC 1 along with the detailed structure (gray = C; red = O; blue = N).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2018_35135_Fig1_HTML.png"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic illustration of highly selective formic acid production from CO<sub>2</sub> by the graphene film based photocatalyst-biocatalyst integrated artificial photosynthesis system.

At the same time it also ensured improved π electron delocalization, reduced recombination probability of photoexcited charge carriers and direct electron transfer from covalently attached chromophore to graphene. As a consequence the graphene film based photocatalyst exhibited higher photocatalytic activity for solar fuel production from CO<sub>2</sub> in comparison to conventional spin coated sample.</p><p id="Par6">One may assume that this work is conceptually similar to the literature examples. However one must note that the current protocol is more environmentally friendly as it eliminates the use of thionyl chloride which was essential for preparing the previously reported graphene-chromophore photocatalyst. It is equally important to note that here that the graphene and chromophore were bonded together previously by amide bond. On the other hand, in the current protocol direct covalent attachment of the chromophore to the sp<sup>2</sup> carbon centers on graphene occurred. These advantages make the newly reported graphene film based photocatalyst highly practical with vastly improved visible light harvesting efficiency than the previously reported graphene-chromophore systems.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Photocatalyst-biocatalyst integrated artificial photosynthesis system for formic acid production from CO<sub>2</sub></title><p id="Par7">Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> depicts the photocatalyst-biocatalyst integrated artificial photosynthesis system for formic acid production from CO<sub>2</sub>. The light-harvesting DdIC chromophore (as an electron donor) collects incident photons as an electronic transition between localized orbital around it (HOMO to LUMO) and conducts <italic>via</italic> graphene (as a multi electron acceptor) to reduce the rhodium complex <bold>Rh</bold> ([Cp*Rh(bpy)H<sub>2</sub>O]<sup>2+</sup>;Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl, bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine). Upon reduction, the rhodium complex abstracts a proton from aqueous solution and transfers hydride ion to NAD<sup>+</sup>, which gets converted into NADH, thus completing the photocatalytic cycle. In this way, <bold>Rh</bold> behaves as an electron mediator between the graphene film photocatalyst and NAD<sup>+</sup> leading to regeneration of NADH cofactor. Finally the enzymatic (Formate Dehydrogenase) conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> substrate to formic acid consumes NADH. The NAD<sup>+</sup> thus released again acts as a substrate for photocatalytic cycle, leading to photoregeneration of NADH. The photocatalytic-enzymatic cycles thus couple integrally, leading to exclusive formic acid production from CO<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Preparation and characterization of GFPC 1 photocatalyst</title><p id="Par8">The GFPC 1 photocatalyst for this research work was obtained by coupling graphene film (hereinafter GF) with 1,3-Dioxo-1H-dibenzo[de,h]isoquinoline-2[3 H]-carbaldehyde (hereinafter DdIC chromophore) <italic>via</italic> 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. More details are provided in the experimental section. The integration of GFPC 1 photocatalyst with biocatalyst (formate dehydrogenase enzyme) afforded the integrated artificial photosynthesis system for carrying out highly selective formic acid production from CO<sub>2</sub> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">The existence of DdIC in GFPC 1 was confirmed by UV-vis spectroscopy. A strong soret band at 433 nm was observed in the absorption spectrum of DdIC chromophore in DMF (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). On the other hand, the absorption spectrum of GFPC 1 exhibited a broad peak from 400–470 nm with a blue shifted maxima of DdIC unit (415 nm)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. This blue shift in absorption maxima can be attributed to the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of DdIC to GF. This observation indirectly suggested the covalent attachment of DdIC chromophores on the monolayer graphene.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Absorption spectrum of GFPC 1 and DdIC chromophore.

The GF spectrum was nearly featureless, while in GFPC 1 some features of DdIC chromophore were observed in the fingerprint region (1500–550 cm<sup>−1</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Moreover in GFPC 1, the C=O stretching was observed at 1772 and 1707 cm<sup>−1</sup> while C=C stretching was observed at 1670 and 1597 cm<sup>−1</sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). In comparison the C=O stretching was observed at 1775 and 1710 cm<sup>−1</sup> while C=C stretching was observed at 1597 cm<sup>−1</sup> in case of DdIC chromophore. The coupling was further confirmed from the C-H stretching vibration of aldehyde group at 2783 cm<sup>−1</sup> in DdIC. The absence of this peak in GFPC 1 provided decisive evidence for the coupling of DdIC chromophore with GF.</p><p id="Par11">The AFM analysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) of GF revealed monolayer graphene with thickness of 0.9344 nm with identical values reported in literature (0.6–0.9 nm)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. An increased thickness of 1.4681 nm in GFPC 1 indicated functionalization on the GF surface. Apart from increased thickness, the presence of DdIC on the GF surface was further supported by the bloated appearance and roughness of the sample. The difference in the high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) images of GF and GFPC 1 further support the AFM data.

Upon coupling of DdIC chromophore to GF, the G and 2D bands in GFPC 1 shifted to 1569 and 2686 cm<sup>−1</sup>, respectively.

Besides this the appearance of peak at 1341 cm<sup>−1</sup> in case of GFPC 1 due to D band of graphene can be further attributed to covalent bond formation between graphene film (GF) and DdIC chromophore<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par13">While there was no peak in N1s XPS spectrum of GF, following 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition coupling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> of DdIC a single new peak at 397 eV ascribed to N atoms of the C-N bond appeared (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.

On the other hand, 24.63% weight loss due to the DdIC chromophore attached to GF was observed in GFPC 1 from 200 to 600 °C. Accordingly, the loading of DdIC chromophore in GFPC 1 was also determined by TGA and estimated to be one DdIC group per 70 carbon atoms of graphene in GFPC 1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Photocatalytic NADH Regeneration and Formic Acid Production from CO<sub>2</sub></title><p id="Par15">The most critical part of the work was to evaluate the photocatalytic performance of the GFPC 1 in comparison to the DdIC chromophore, graphene-DdIC powder photocatalyst and its spin coated film sample (hereinafter GFPC 2; details in experimental section). Therefore, visible light-driven 1,4-NADH photo-regeneration ability of all these were examined along with GF. While GF failed to carry out any NADH regeneration, DdIC chromophore afforded 21.8% NADH regeneration over a period of 120 minutes. On the other hand, graphene-DdIC powder photocatalyst and GFPC 2 afforded 48.9 and 40.1% of NADH regeneration over a period of 120 minutes, respectively. Since GFPC 2 was obtained by spin coating the graphene-DdIC powder, a lower NADH regeneration by GFPC 2 can be clearly attributed to irregular orientation of the photocatalyst species on the polyimide sheet. In comparison to this 91.8% NADH regeneration was observed when GFPC 1 was evaluated for the photocatalytic activity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). In other words, more than 225% higher NADH regeneration was carried out by GFPC 1 in the same time period when compared to spin coated GFPC 2.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Photocatalytic activity of GF, DdIC chromophore, graphene-DdIC powder, GFPC 1 and GFPC 2.

The results obtained were similar to NADH regeneration. While as expected GF failed to carry out any formic acid formation, DdIC chromophore afforded 48.6 µmol of formic acid over a period of 120 minutes. On the other hand, graphene-DdIC powder photocatalyst and GFPC 2 afforded 129.8 and 95.2 µmol of formic acid over a period of 120 minutes, respectively. Similar to NADH regeneration results, GFPC 1 photocatalyst afforded 228.6 µmol of formic acid which is also 2.3 fold higher formic acid production compared to GFPC 2 in 120 minutes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). Undoubtedly this remarkably higher photocatalytic activity of GFPC 1 can be attributed to the regular arrangement of light harvesting units with spatial orientation towards the visible light as well as improved delocalization of π electrons and direct electron transfer from covalently attached chromophore to monolayer graphene. At the same time it was also evident from these experiments that spin coated film sample show lower photocatalytic performance compared to powder type photocatalysts which can be attributed to irregular orientation of the photocatalyst species on the film substrate. Overall these experiments clearly verify the success of our new design and fabrication strategy for graphene film photocatalysts.</p><p id="Par17">The stability and reusability of GFPC 1 photocatalyst were examined by subjecting it to 6 cycles of formic acid production from CO<sub>2</sub>. In comparison to the first cycle wherein the photocatalyst carried out 228.55 μmol of formic acid production, remarkably high 187.89 μmol of formic acid was obtained in the 6<sup>th</sup> cycle (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S7</xref>). These results indicate that GFPC 1 is a stable and reusable film photocatalyst for practical use.</p><p id="Par18">The high formic acid production led us to consider the possibility of photocatalytic decomposition of GFPC 1 photocatalyst to carbon residues that may subsequently produce additional formic acid photocatalytically without CO<sub>2</sub> consumption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. To discount this possibility, a control experiment in the absence of CO<sub>2</sub> was performed. A lack of formic acid formation in this control experiment confirmed photocatalytic NADH regeneration under visible light irradiation. In a related fashion, a control experiment without the GFPC 1 photocatalyst (but with formate dehydrogenase enzyme) and another one without visible light irradiation were also carried out which also failed to show any detectable amount of formic acid. Additionally, no formic acid formation was detected in another set of control experiments carried out in the absence of rhodium complex <bold>Rh</bold> and/or NAD<sup>+</sup> which confirmed their vital role in the functioning of the photocatalyst/biocatalyst integrated artificial photosynthesis system. To evaluate the possibility of rhodium complex <bold>Rh</bold> functioning as the CO<sub>2</sub> reduction photocatalyst a control experiment consisting of rhodium complex and CO<sub>2</sub> was performed. However, no formic acid was detected in this case also. This indicated that rhodium complex does not carry out photocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub> reduction. Along with the high stability of GFPC 1 under visible light irradiation the various control experiments clearly point towards exclusive visible light driven photocatalytic NADH regeneration followed by enzymatic CO<sub>2</sub> reduction as the sole route for formic acid production. This was further confirmed by C-13 isotope labelling experiment which clearly indicated that CO<sub>2</sub> is the sole source of formic acid formation in our system (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S8</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Cyclic Voltammetry Studies</title><p id="Par19">To understand the electron transfer pathway, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out. The reduction potential at cathodic peak current of GFPC 1 was observed at around −1.2 V (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S9</xref>). On mixing GFPC 1 with rhodium complex <bold>Rh</bold> ([Cp*Rh(bpy)H<sub>2</sub>O]<sup>2+</sup>; Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl, bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) reduction was observed at −0.97 V (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). This is an anodic shift of GFPC 1 reduction which is clearly indicative of electron transfer from GFPC 1 to <bold>Rh</bold><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Moreover, the GFPC 1-<bold>Rh</bold> system revealed reduction potential at −1.05 V with NAD<sup>+</sup>, implying that the system consisting of GFPC 1 and <bold>Rh</bold> catalyzed the reduction of NAD<sup>+</sup> to NADH (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>).

At first, electronic structure calculations were performed separately on the DdIC chromophore and the graphene monolayer (an 8 × 8 unit composed of 128 carbon atoms). The Fermi level of graphene was calculated to be 4.20 eV lower than vacuum level, which lies around the center of bandgap of the chromophore, about 0.6 eV lower than the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of chromophore. Although this “divide-and-conquer” method is simple and powerful to deal with a large system without too much computational burden, the two components (DdIC chromophore and graphene monolayer) of the photocatalyst are tightly bonded <italic>via</italic> strong covalent bond. Thus the electron can be transferred spontaneously to make the Fermi levels equal. So, electronic structure calculations of the whole system were performed, secondly. The optimized atomic geometry and electronic band structure are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>. The chromophore and graphene are tightly combined by four covalent bonds between two carbon atoms in chromophore and 4 atoms in graphene; the C-C bond lengths are within the range of 1.54–1.60 Å. The binding is further enhanced by π-π stacking between aromatic rings in chromophore and graphene. The band structure plot clearly shows that the Dirac point of graphene lies between the HOMO-LUMO energy-gap of the chromophore. The LUMO of chromophore lies ~0.3 eV higher than Dirac point. The localized molecular orbitals of chromophore are almost unaffected at Γ and M point but significantly hybridized with orbitals of graphene around K point. The incident light is absorbed at the chromophore, where occurs photoexcitation, and the created electrons move into the graphene via stable covalent bonds. The electron transfer efficiency could be estimated by the energy level alignment between the Fermi level of graphene and the LUMO of chromophore and also on the overlap of molecular orbitals. The existence of hybridized orbitals near Fermi level makes the ballistic transport of photoexcited electrons possible from the chromophore to graphene. The DFT calculation results clearly suggested that the photoexcited electrons transfer from chromophore finally to hydrogen reduction site via graphene.
