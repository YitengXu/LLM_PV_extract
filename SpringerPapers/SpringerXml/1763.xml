Efforts to build the energy infrastructure needed to meet this demand must reflect (1) regional differences in economic growth rates and energy resources, (2) policy and social considerations such as safety, (3) environmental concerns such as ecosystem health and climate change, (4) the technological maturity of various options, and (5) the availability of sufficient supplies of water.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref> This article focuses on the last aspect, as many forms of power generation, including the dominant modes used today, require copious amounts of water. The largest use of water in power generation, by far, is for the removal of waste heat.</p><p>Currently, global water use in power generation ranks second only to that in agriculture, although there is wide variation between countries. The challenges posed by water scarcity are expected to grow more acute because of increasing demand from the power generation, agriculture, industrial, and municipal sectors.

This article provides a framework for prioritizing materials R&amp;D efforts in water use for electricity generation. The discussion is divided into three parts. The first section reviews trends in power generation and water use and introduces a metric for comparing different technologies. The second section focuses on water use in power plants and considers ways in which materials innovations can reduce water demand. These include improving the efficiency of gas and steam turbines through the development of next-generation superalloys, high-temperature materials such as ceramic matrix composites, and hydrophobic condenser surfaces. Because cooling accounts for the majority of water use in thermal systems, lower-cost heat-transfer materials can improve the economic competitiveness of air-cooled condensers and other low-water-demand cooling options. The final section addresses ways in which materials R&amp;D can help to expand the supply of water suitable for power-generation use, particularly for cooling in thermal plants. Nontraditional water sources such as brackish aquifers and produced water from oil and gas operations have a higher tendency to foul equipment, and materials advances such as biofilm resistance coatings and membranes have the potential to enable the use of these water resources for cooling.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Water use trends and metrics</title><p>Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> provides a snapshot of global power generation and its associated water footprint. Thermal processes, which generate electricity from heat, account for almost 80% of total generating capacity—including fossil-fuel, nuclear, geothermal, solar-thermal, and biomass sources. A necessary step in these cycles is the rejection of lower-grade waste heat to the environment, for which water-based methods are among the most effective.

where ΔLCOE is the difference in the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) between the alternate power generation system and a baseline pulverized-coal plant employing cooling towers that withdraw surface water and ΔWD is the reduction in specific water withdrawal rate between the same two systems. The LCOE accounts for the cost of power generation over the lifetime of the power plant, including both initial capital investments and fuel costs. The cost of conserved water is a simple way to rate the economic impact of adopting less-water-intensive technology against the local cost of water. If water is relatively abundant and inexpensive, it makes economic sense to simply use it for evaporative or once-through cooling. In regions where water is scarce, the higher cost of water can justify the deployment of alternatives.</p><p>Several approaches can improve water utilization in power production. This article focuses solely on thermal processes, because of their dominant share of electricity generation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref> nonthermal processes are discussed in Reference 8. On the demand side, this means reducing the cost of conserved water by decreasing specific water use through (1) the use of alternate cooling fluids such as air and (2) increased power-plant efficiency. A complementary approach is to tap nontraditional water resources. Seawater, brackish aquifers, processed municipal wastewater, produced water from hydrocarbon extraction, and abandoned mine drainage are all potential sources that could conserve freshwater for other uses. Materials breakthroughs can help in each of these areas, but it is necessary to critically evaluate where investment is justified, as not all opportunities have equal potential impacts.</p><p>As a concrete example of how the cost of conserved water can be used to benchmark the competitiveness of a water-saving technology, consider air-cooled condensers (ACCs), which are being deployed as an alternative to wet cooling. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) estimated that, for a 500-MW subcritical pulverized-coal plant, this technology increases the LCOE by $3.50/MWh, while eliminating ~90% of water withdrawals (2300 l/MWh). 14 Substituting these values into Equation 1 gives a CCW of about $1.50/m<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, so dry cooling becomes economically competitive where the cost of available water is more than this. Put another way, ACC technologies have the potential to reduce water use in coal plants by up to 90% but result in an increase of about 5% in the LCOE.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></p><p>Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">I</xref> compares water costs from the United States and China and provides context for the economic competitiveness of the alternate cooling technology.

where <italic>T</italic><sub>h</sub> is the temperature of the heat source and <italic>T</italic><sub>c</sub> is the temperature of the heat sink. The Carnot efficiency is maximized by high-temperature sources and low-temperature sinks. Heat-source temperatures are usually limited by material constraints (e.g., maximum temperature for combustors and turbine blades in gas turbines). Heat-sink temperatures are set by local climate and water availability.</p><p>In practice, about 80% of all electricity is produced using steam turbines configured in a Rankine cycle. In a Rankine cycle, the heat-sink temperature is governed by the steam condenser. For maximum power output and efficiency, the condenser should be as cool as possible. In a typical steamturbine system, the condenser is cooled to about 40°C, so the condensed steam is under a vacuum (~0.1 bar absolute). This low condenser pressure is transmitted to the last stage of the steam turbine and governs how much power can be produced. The heat at 40°C is truly waste heat, as it is presently uneconomical to extract more work from it.</p><p>Condensers are cooled by water or air. The choice depends on the local climatic, environmental, and regulatory conditions. Water-cooled condensers are smaller and less expensive, and they provide lower, more stable temperatures than air-cooled condensers, but their water requirements are greater.</p><p>When surface water is available and regulations allow, once-through water cooling is usually the most cost-effective solution.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref> In once-through cooling systems, water is withdrawn from the source, pumped through the condenser, and returned to the source at a higher temperature (typically 10–15°C warmer). For a 33% efficient Rankine cycle, each megawatt of power production requires approximately 30 l/s of water withdrawals. A 500-MW plant withdraws nearly 1.4 × 10 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref> m<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>/day [250,000 gallons per minute (gpm)] of water.</p><p>Plants that use cooling towers withdraw less water but consume more, relative to once-through systems. Cooling towers remove heat primarily through evaporation after the water has been heated in the condenser. A typical cooling tower evaporates 0.5 l/s of water per megawatt of generated power. To prevent salts from building up in the cooling water, a “blowdown” stream comprising concentrated salts is also removed from the cooling loop. This blowdown typically accounts for 10–20% of the total water consumption. A 500-MW plant consumes approximately 26,000 m <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>/day (4800 gpm) of water.</p><p>The two main themes for reducing water demand for power-plant cooling through materials innovations are developing alternate cooling fluids to replace water and improving thermal efficiency in the turbine. Following the first approach, air or hybrid cooling can eliminate most of the water demand, but progress is needed to make these approaches economical. To increase power-plant efficiency, specific materials needs include next-generation superalloys and coatings for higher-temperature gas and steam turbines.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Air cooling</title><p>Air-cooled condensers (ACCs) work by blowing ambient air over a set of finned condenser coils. Because of the lower heat capacity and density of air compared to water, the heat-transfer area of an ACC is 20–50 times larger than that of a water-cooled condenser. In addition, ACCs penalize power-plant performance more than water-cooled condensers, because the air is usually much warmer than local water. This problem is particularly acute in warm locations, where the power demand peaks during the hottest part of the day.</p><p>As discussed in the previous section, cost reductions on the order of 25–50% are needed for ACCs to become economically competitive in most regions of the world. The footprints and heights of current ACC configurations are about twice those of conventional cooling towers, leading to twice the capital cost. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref> R&amp;D efforts are progressing on several fronts, including more compact designs that use less material and the development of wind-guide technology to better manage performance under changing ambient conditions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Improved efficiency in the steam cycle</title><p>Increasing the thermal efficiency of power plants is another way to reduce water demand. In a Rankine-cycle plant (see Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), the working fluid (usually water) is pumped to high pressure in the liquid state and heated in a boiler to create high-pressure, high-temperature vapor. The vapor expands through a turbine, generating power, and then condenses back to a liquid by rejecting heat to the environment in a condenser, which is where most of the water is used. The cooled liquid is then pumped back to high pressure, completing the cycle.</p><p>Thermal efficiencies over 45% have been achieved by increasing the steam temperature and pressure to supercritical (600°C, 250 bar) and ultrasupercritical (720–760°C, 340 bar) conditions. Because water usage in a thermal power plant scales inversely with efficiency, shifting to supercritical plants could reduce water usage by 27% compared to the installed base.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref> Materials are needed for next-generation turbine components, because advanced 9–12Cr martensitic–ferritic steels approach their operating limit at around 620°C.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref> Nickel and nickel–cobalt superalloys offer the necessary creep strength and steam oxidation resistance for steam turbine blades and heat-transfer surfaces that operate near and above 700°C, but development is needed to bring down manufacturing costs. Austenitic stainless steels and alloys offer designers an intermediate option, with temperature capabilities between those of existing steels and nickel-based superalloys but at lower cost than superalloys.</p><p>Materials advances can also improve the operation of condensers in steam cycles, leading to both economic benefits and reductions in water use. Laboratory studies have shown that hydrophobic and superhydrophobic surfaces improve heat-transfer rates by promoting dropwise condensation over film condensation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref> The benefits of higher heat-transfer coefficients would be accrued mainly through cost savings due to smaller heat exchangers. Savings in water use are possible if the improved heat transfer leads to lower temperatures and pressures on the vapor side of the condenser. This would increase the power and efficiency of the plant. To date, most studies have used organic coatings, and work is needed to move to more robust materials for energy applications. Efforts to develop inorganic coatings with hydrophobic properties are still at a relatively early stage.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></p><fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Steam cycle for a power plant, showing the two main areas for reducing water use: improving the thermal efficiency of the turbine (for example, through high-temperature-tolerant turbines, combined cycles, or solid-oxide fuel cells) and using alternative cooling fluids (such as nontraditional water, air, or a combination of water and air).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/43577_2012_37040439_Fig2.jpg" id="MO2"/></fig></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Gas-turbine and combined-cycle plants</title><p>Further water savings can be achieved by using power cycles that do not require cooling water. After steam turbines, gas turbines are the most productive power-generation method. They operate with much higher heat-source temperatures than steam turbines and, therefore, higher efficiencies. In a simple gas-turbine, or Brayton, cycle, the exhaust is released to the environment after passing through the turbine and a recuperative heat exchanger. No cooling water is required, although water is often used to cool the inlet air for power augmentation and to provide a diluent for combustion to control NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> formation. As examples, wet NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> control uses approximately 0.05 l/s of water per megawatt of generated power, and steam injection for power augmentation uses about 0.1–0.2 l/s per megawatt of generated power. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></p><p>In a combined-cycle power plant, the exhaust from the gas turbine is used to generate steam that runs a steam turbine. Thermal efficiency in combined-cycle systems approaches 60%, with the gas turbines accounting for about 65% of the total electrical generating capacity. Because most of the water use is for cooling the steam-turbine condenser, the specific water usage of combined-cycle plants is about 35% that of a simple steam turbine plant (see Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

Examples include brackish aquifers, municipal wastewater, produced water from hydrocarbon extraction processes, and acidic mine-pool waters. In 2006, the U.S. DOE set a goal of increasing the current utilization rate of about 8% to 25% within 10 years and has funded a range of activities including cataloguing potential sources, developing treatment technologies, and evaluating system integration issues.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></p><p>Materials innovations can contribute to expanded use of nontraditional water supplies in two ways. The first involves upgrading the water quality to match that of existing fresh water supplies. This includes removing problematic components, reducing variability, and improving the robustness of treatment equipment to handle “impaired” water. A second approach is to improve the ability of cooling systems to directly use impaired water. In both cases, the goal is to make the cost of the treated water competitive with that of freshwater or alternate cooling technologies.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Upgrading nontraditional water quality</title><p>Water used for cooling in thermal systems must be treated to manage scale deposition, fouling through biofilm formation, and corrosion. In freshwater systems, these challenges are managed through chemical additives, along with careful operation of the cooling system. Nontraditional water resources present two challenges. First, they can contain elevated concentrations of components that can foul or damage equipment. Examples include (1) dissolved hardness or silica (brackish water) leading to enhanced scaling tendencies, (2) residual organics (municipal wastewater or produced water) leading to elevated microbiological activity, and (3) extremes in pH (acidic mine pools) leading to accelerated corrosion. Second, the water volumes and quality, especially from natural aquifers or hydrocarbon extraction operations, can vary with time, making it difficult to achieve stable performance. Variability also increases maintenance requirements and, consequently, the cost of treatment.

Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows some recent examples for membranes. Membranes are typically classified according to pore size. In general, reducing the pore size improves the selectivity but diminishes the flux. Membranes with pores in the range of micrometers to tens of nanometers are used to remove suspended solids, emulsified oil, microbes, and colloidal material through microfiltration or ultrafiltration processes. Smaller pores, such as those in the nanometer range, can allow removal of multivalent ions and some biological molecules through a nanofiltration process. Reverse-osmosis membranes are used to remove dissolved salts as part of a desalination process.</p><p>A wide range of activities are underway to improve the permeability of reverse-osmosis membranes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref> One approach involves the modification of commercial membrane materials to adjust their surface charge or to attach molecules that sterically hinder the adsorption of foulants (Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). Another interesting direction involves new membrane materials based on carbon nanotubes or aquaporin proteins. Laboratory studies suggest that these materials have the potential to increase permeability by up to two or three orders of magnitude over those of conventional polymer materials (Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref> In both cases, the underlying idea is to incorporate the carbon nanotubes or protein into a polymer matrix to provide pathways for water transport.

Over the past decade, there has been considerable work on coatings with modified surface properties that could be useful for this application. For example, wet-surface air coolers are hybrid water-cooling systems that direct a co-current flow of air and water droplets over closed-loop cooling tubes. A uniform distribution of water over the tubes is essential to minimize scale deposition. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref> To this end, surface-energy modifications through the use of hydrophilic or superhydrophilic coatings could promote wetting to help manage scaling problems and prevent oil deposition.

Work is needed to tailor materials for the specific extracellular polymeric substances secreted by microorganisms encountered in power-plant environments.

Given the increasing demand on water resources from all sectors, significant innovations will be required to ensure that adequate supplies are available to meet both global and regional needs. Opportunities for materials research that helps address this challenge are numerous and diverse. Superalloys and ceramic-matrix composites to improve gas-turbine efficiency, hydrophobic and hydrophilic coatings to improve heat-exchanger performance, and low-cost materials for compact air-cooled condensers are a few examples. This article has proposed a framework for evaluating different technology options for reducing water use in power production, namely, calculating the cost of conserved water based on the change in levelized cost of electricity and improved specific water usage. The hope is that this article has provided guidance to the materials research community in identifying some of the most pressing needs and opportunities for innovation in this area.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="box"><title>A closer look at the global water footprint for electricity production</title><p>Here we present the relative water footprints of different modes of electricity production and explore how the overall footprint could evolve in coming decades. In the <bold>figure</bold>, the area of each block corresponds to the projected water footprint for each power-generation mode. Separate blocks are shown for the footprint in 2007 and the projected increment by 2030, based on projections from the EIA base-case scenario.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref> The potential increment associated with adoption of carbon capture and storage (CCS) for coal and the projected reduction of liquid (oil) generation are also shown.</p><p>Several assumptions were used to construct this figure. First, the specific water requirements are weighted averages for each fuel source, based on available data for different modes (open-loop versus closed-loop) of cooling. Such data exist in detail only for fossil-fuel-based systems in the United States, so the U.S. distribution was assumed to apply globally. Because growth forecasts do not provide projections for changes in the distribution of cooling modes, current distributions were assumed to remain constant. Second, the utilization of the installed generating capacity ranges from 90% for baseload systems to 30% for intermittent sources, reflecting the complexity of matching real-time variations in demand. Finally, water requirements are sensitive to technology innovations that reduce the specific water use, as well as policy decisions such as emissions controls. Without specific projections for how these capacity factors or technologies might change in the future, we simply extrapolated from current values.</p><p>Several major trends emerge from the figure:

Recent developments that can help manage the growing water demand in China include (1) consolidation of older, smaller units into larger, more thermally efficient plants; (2) use of lower-water-intensity designs (higher-efficiency pulverized-coal and integrated gasification combined-cycle plants); and (3) further deployment of air cooling in its arid northern regions (where air cooling had been installed on 35 GW of capacity by 2008).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></p></list-item><list-item><p>Carbon-capture technologies can significantly increase the water footprint of fossil-fuel-based power generation (see the CCS scenario in the figure).
