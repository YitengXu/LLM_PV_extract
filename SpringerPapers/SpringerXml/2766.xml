However, the rate of electron transfer has not been controlled by the remote input of an external field without changing the geometries or materials of the systems. We demonstrate here that an applied microwave field can enhance the photocatalytic reduction of bipyridinium ion using CdS quantum dots (QDs) by accelerating electron transfer. Analysis of the time-resolved emission decay profiles of CdS quantum dots immersed in aqueous solutions of bipyridinium exhibited the shortening of their emission lifetimes, because of the accelerated electron transfer from QDs to bipyridinium under microwave irradiation. This discovery leads us to a new methodology using microwaves as an external field to enhance photocatalytic reactions.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>10933</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>17</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep11308.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>9</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep11308" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep11308</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Electron transfer is the key for increasing the efficiency of photocatalysis and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.

Focusing on photocatalysis and DSSCs, the electron transfer between an organic moiety and the surface of an inorganic semiconductor plays a key role in charge separation, determining the final efficiencies of the photocatalytic reactions and the photoenergy conversion efficiency of DSSCs. Many studies have been performed to control the behavior of the excited electrons generated by the photon absorption in photocatalysis and DSSCs. For example, the rapid transfer of an excited electron followed by the absorption of photons is important for efficient charge separation in photocatalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The excited electrons and the simultaneously generated holes are transferred to the reaction sites for reducing the electron acceptor molecules and oxidizing the donor molecules, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In DSSCs, the excited dye injects a hot electron into the conduction band of TiO<sub>2</sub>, which is immediately transferred to the transparent conductive layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p>Effects of various microwave on chemical reactions have been observed, reported and compared with those reactions performed using conventional heating. These effects are classified into thermal effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and non-thermal effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Microwave thermal effects can be realized by applying the characteristics of microwave heating such as rapid heating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and substance-selective heating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and are attributed to the mechanism of microwave heating in which the alternating electromagnetic fields interact with substances. However, the non-thermal effects are yet to be studied in the appropriate manners and need to be investigated to clarify their mechanism. Microwave non-thermal effects have been extensively studied in the organic synthesis field and in reactions at solid surfaces in several systems. Horikoshi <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> showed that a photodegradation reaction of a Rhodamine B organic dye with a TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalyst was enhanced under microwave irradiation and this observation was attributed to microwave non-thermal effects on photocatalytic redox reactions. Recently, our group reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> that the dechlorination reactions of an organohalide by Fe particles were accelerated under microwave heating compared with those reactions performed under conventional heating. These observations of the enhanced reaction rates under microwaves have led us to a hypothesis that the electron transfer reaction occurring at the interface between a solid surface and a liquid phase is accelerated by microwaves, which may be the origin of the microwave non-thermal effect observed in redox reactions. This study exhibits a direct evidence of microwave non-thermal effects observed as the acceleration of electron transfer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>First, we attempted to observe the enhanced photocatalytic reduction of bipyridinium by CdS quantum dots under microwave irradiation. We selected N, N’-bis(3-sulfonatopropyl)-4, 4′-bipyridinium (PVS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>) as an electron acceptor and CdS quantum dots (QDs) anchored on SiO<sub>2</sub> particles as a photocatalyst. Because the PVS anion radical generated by photoreduction absorbs visible light, the concentration of anion radicals was determined using UV-Vis spectroscopy. The UV-Vis absorption spectra are shown in Extended data <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. Peaks at 602 nm are attributed to the PVS radical anion. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> shows the time variation plots of the anion radical concentrations under microwaves and conventional heating. The temperature of both systems was kept at 52 °C. The generation rate of the anion radicals under microwaves was two times faster than that under conventional heating, exhibiting the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of CdS QDs. Large error bars were observed in the latter stage of the microwave experiments, whereas the error bars were smaller while conventional heating. Because SiO<sub>2</sub> particles with anchored CdS QDs were dispersed in the reaction solution by ultrasonication before starting the reaction and the solutions were not stirred during the experiments, they were sinking during the reaction time. The scattering caused by dispersed SiO<sub>2</sub> particles was reflected as a strong background in the absorption spectra, as shown in Extended data <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a,c</xref> and was lowered with the reaction time because of the sinking of SiO<sub>2</sub> particles. The error bars were estimated as the standard deviation from three experiments. Sinking SiO<sub>2</sub> particles with anchored CdS QDs in the solution may cause the unstable distribution of the microwave’s electromagnetic field, probably giving larger errors in the microwaves experiments than the conventional heating ones.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Photocatalytic reduction of PVS by CdS QDs <bold>(a)</bold> Chemical structure of N,N’-bis(3-sulfonatopropyl)-4,4′-bipyridinium (PVS). <bold>(b)</bold> Time variation plots of the PVS radical anion concentration under microwaves at 1.5 W and conventional heating.

We planned to observe the electron transfer distinguished from the other elementary steps using the accurate measurement of the reaction temperatures proposed by Kappe <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Consequently, we selected time-resolved photoemission decay measurements of CdS QDs occurring in a sub-nanosecond order, which allow for the evaluation of the electron transfer rates from photoexcited CdS QDs adsorbed on SiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticle thin films (CdS QDs/SiO<sub>2</sub> thin films; <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>) to liquid phase bipyridinium derivatives (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). The relaxation processes of the photoexcited state of CdS QDs can be accurately analyzed by measuring the time-resolved photoemission of CdS QDs. Furthermore, the adsorption and desorption processes can be excluded and only the electron transfer process is studied using time-resolved photoemission decay measurements because the time constants of the adsorption and desorption of the electron acceptor molecules are extremely slow compared with those of electron transfer.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Structure of CdS QDs/SiO<sub>2</sub> thin films and electron transfer scheme.</p><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Structure of CdS QDs/SiO<sub>2</sub> thin films.

We obtained no experimental results to support that the electron transfer from the QDs surface defect level to organic molecules is faster than that from the QDs conduction band in the present study. However, we observed the behavior of the majority of electrons, which is reflected as fast electron transfer. Furthermore, the longer the lifetime of the excited electron, the more observable are the effects of microwaves. The lifetime of the excited electron in the conduction band was reported to be much shorter than that in the defect level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Finally, we selected the photoemission at 520 nm (excitation of 365 nm), which is attributed to the photoemission process from a surface defect level of CdS QDs for the analysis of time-resolved emission decay spectra. Temperature measurements were performed using a fiber-optic thermometer (Opsens, Picosens) installed in close proximity to the sample. The input power generating the microwaves was 1.0 W. The emission decay measurements were initiated when the temperature of the solution containing the immersed samples reached 52 °C. The temperature setting under conventional heating experiments performed as a control measure was also kept at 52 °C. The temperature profiles under microwaves and conventional heating during the time-resolved emission decay measurements are shown in Extended data <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, indicating that the same temperatures were retained for both experiments.</p><p>The time-resolved emission decay profiles of CdS QDs/SiO<sub>2</sub> thin films immersed in water or PVS aqueous solution are shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>. The emission lifetime of CdS QDs/SiO<sub>2</sub> thin films immersed in PVS solution was clearly shortened under microwave irradiation, whereas no change in water is seen under microwave irradiation. The emission decay was measured three times (Extended data <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Because the profile in water without PVS under conventional heating is the same as that under microwave irradiation, the luminescence and non-luminescence processes in CdS QDs were unaffected by microwaves. The time-resolved emission decay profiles of CdS QDs/SiO<sub>2</sub> thin films immersed in PVS solution under conventional heating at 42 °C, 52 °C and 62 °C (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>) exhibited no significant change on temperature alteration. Therefore, we suggest that the change in emission lifetime under microwave irradiation was not caused by “nonequilibrium local heating,” as reported by Tsukahara <italic>et al</italic>. for Co particles dispersed in dimethyl sulfoxide under microwave irradiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the result that the temperature did not affect the time-resolved emission decay profiles strongly supports that the adsorption–desorption processes can be excluded from the analyses performed in this study. Data led us to conclude that the shortening of the lifetime is not because of the changes in temperatures, i.e., the microwave thermal effects, but because of the microwave non-thermal effects shown by the acceleration of excited electron transfer from CdS QDs to PVS.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Measured time-resolved emission decay profiles.</p><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Time-resolved emission decay profiles of CdS QDs immersed in deionized water or PVS aqueous solution under microwave irradiation or conventional heating (time range = 100 ns).

All fitting results are shown in Extended data <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>. When the profiles of CdS QDs in water were fitted by a biexponential function, the τ values and relative amplitudes, <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>Normalized</italic></sub>, under microwave irradiation are nearly identical to those under conventional heating. The τ<sub>1</sub> and τ<sub>2</sub> values were ca. 2 ns and 35 ns, respectively. The shorter lifetime, τ<sub>1</sub>, was attributed to the reassociation process of the surface defect level electrons effectively relaxing from the conduction band, whereas the longer lifetime, τ<sub>2</sub>, was assigned to the reassociation process of electrons that diffuse in the crystal lattice before relaxing into the defect level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In contrast, the time-resolved emission decay profiles of CdS QDs in PVS solution were fitted by a triexponential function because the chi-square values were large when the decay profiles were fitted by a biexponential function (see Extended data <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). The longest lifetimes under microwave irradiation and conventional heating were almost the same, ~35 ns. Because the longest lifetime value in PVS solution, τ<sub>3</sub>, was equal to the longest value in water, this lifetime was attributed to the same emission process. The two shorter lifetimes, τ<sub>1</sub> and τ<sub>2</sub>, that appeared in the time-resolved emission decay profiles of CdS QDs in PVS solution were attributed to the electron transfer from CdS QDs to PVS and are the processes that only exist in the presence of PVS.

The emission decay was measured three times. (Extended data Fig. 4) The reduction potential of DQS (−0.75 V vs. NHE) is more negative than that of PVS (−0.41 V vs. NHE). Because the decay measured in the time range of 20 ns partially included the process with a lifetime of 35 ns in the latter time stage of the measurement, τ<sub>2</sub> was fixed as 35 ns when the time profile of CdS QDs in water were fitted by a biexponential function and τ<sub>3</sub> was fixed as 35 ns when the time profiles of CdS QDs in PVS solution or DQS solution were fitted by a triexponential function (<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). All fitting results are shown in Extended data table 3. From the fitting results, the average lifetime, τ<sub>av</sub>, was calculated using the following equation:<disp-formula id="Equ2"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep11308_Equ1_HTML.gif"/></disp-formula></p><p>where τ<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>iNormalized</italic></sub> are fluorescence lifetime and relative amplitudes of <italic>i</italic>th component, respectively. Using the τ<sub>av</sub> value, the electron transfer reaction rate, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>ET</italic></sub>, was determined by the Stern–Volmer equation:<disp-formula id="Equ3"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep11308_Equ2_HTML.gif"/></disp-formula></p><p>where τ<sub>Water</sub> and τ<sub>bpy</sub> are the average lifetimes of CdS QDs immersed in water and PVS or DQS aqueous solutions, respectively and [bpy] is the PVS or DQS concentration, 2 mM. The Stern–Volmer equation was used for calculating the electron transfer rate under the supposition that the reaction mechanisms are the same under microwave and conventional heating. The obtained electron transfer rates from CdS QDs to PVS under microwave irradiation and conventional heating were 2.6 × 10<sup>11</sup> M<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup> and 1.0 ×  10<sup>11</sup> M<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. However, the electron transfer rates from CdS QDs to DQS under microwave irradiation and conventional heating were estimated as 2.4 × 10<sup>11</sup> M<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup> and 6.8 × 10<sup>10</sup> M<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. These values of the electron transfer rates clearly demonstrate the acceleration of the transfer of the excited electron generated from CdS QDs to bipyridinium derivatives.</p><p>We emphasize that no acceleration of the electron transfer was observed for the dispersion of CdS QD in the presence of methyl viologens under microwaves. Extended data Fig. 5 exhibits the time profiles of the photoemission decay of the freely dispersed CdS QDs for microwave irradiation and conventional heating. A physical insight to an origin of the acceleration of the transfer of the excited electron is discussed below.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The Marcus theory of electron transfer reactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> is employed to discuss the acceleration of electron transfer observed in the present study. This theory can be applied to asymmetric non-adiabatic electron transfer reactions between semiconductor crystals and organic molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. According to Marcus theory, electron transfer rates depend on the electronic coupling matrix element related to the electron orbital overlap of the donors and acceptors (<italic>H</italic><sub><italic>AB</italic></sub><sup>2</sup>) and the reorganization energy (λ), which is described as follows:<disp-formula id="Equ1"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep11308_Equ3_HTML.gif"/></disp-formula></p><p>where ℏ is the reduced Planck’s constant, <italic>R</italic> is gas constant, <italic>T</italic> is the reaction temperature and <italic>ΔG</italic> is Gibbs free energy change.</p><p>We assume that the electron transfer occurs from only the CdS QDs surface defect level. The potential of the surface defect level corresponding to the 520 nm emission is approximately −0.8 V vs. NHE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Then, we can estimate the two important values of <italic>H</italic><sub><italic>AB</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> and λ for comparing microwaves and conventional heating. The <italic>H</italic><sub><italic>AB</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> values under microwave irradiation and conventional heating were estimated by <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="disp-formula">equation (3)</xref> as 3.8 × 10<sup>−26</sup> kJ<sup>2</sup> mol<sup>−2</sup> and 2.0 × 10<sup>−26</sup> kJ<sup>2</sup> mol<sup>−2</sup>, respectively, whereas the reorganization energies were estimated as 21.5 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup> under microwave irradiation and 22.8 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup> under conventional heating. By using microwave irradiation, the <italic>H</italic><sub><italic>AB</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> value increases more than double, whereas the reorganization energies are approximately the same under microwave irradiation and conventional heating. Therefore, the acceleration of electron transfer observed in the present study can only be attributed to the change in <italic>H</italic><sub><italic>AB</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> values. As for the mechanisms of microwave non-thermal effects, we raise an explanation of the accelerated electron transfer using the collective vibration of electron clouds in the CdS conduction band induced by microwaves, which is similar to the action of local surface plasmon resonance observed in metal nanocrystals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Furthermore we cannot exclude other explanations such as Maxwell–Wagner polarization effects at the interface between CdS quantum dots and their surroundings (electrolyte or surface-modified molecules on CdS) and the promotion of electron mobility in CdS conduction bands induced by the alternating electromagnetic field. Such mechanisms were hypothetically applied to explain the measurements of the charge-carrier concentrations in semiconductors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p>In conclusion, we reveal that the photocatalytic reduction of bipyridinium ion using CdS QDs is enhanced by microwaves. The determination of the electron transfer rates from CdS QDs to bipyridinium derivatives (PVS or DQS) under microwave irradiation or conventional heating using time-resolved emission decay measurements demonstrates that the electron transfer rate under microwave irradiation is higher than that under conventional heating. The acceleration of electron transfer can be explained by the collective vibration of electrons by microwaves. These observations provide a new aspect to understanding microwave non-thermal effects, which was previously unknown, leading to systematically extending new chemistry using externally applied electromagnetic fields.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Synthesis of CdS QDs</title><p>We synthesized CdS QDs with a diameter of ~2.4 nm by a procedure adapted from Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>.
