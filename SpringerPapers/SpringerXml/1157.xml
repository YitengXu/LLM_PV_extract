The aim of the study is to create an optimum strategy through an optimization of an energy management system. The study implemented an onsite model, two numerical approaches, and an optimization analysis on a Mediterranean port. Two approaches have been used: solar energy is applied experimentally and numerically, and then wind energy is simulated. An optimization analysis integrated the two approaches together to control their operation. The results showed the installed solar panels provided sufficient generated power for the buildings. Also, the simulated wind arrays showed good behavior with increased power coefficient for the wind turbines, for future implementation. These results were validated using the DesignBuilder software and showed accurate values regarding the experiment for solar panels and CFD simulation. Eventually, a Pareto optimality analysis is applied between the solar and wind energies to reveal an energy management plan. Renewable energy offered energy to support the consumption of the port’s buildings.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Solar energy</kwd><kwd>Wind energy</kwd><kwd>Numerical approaches</kwd><kwd>Energy management</kwd><kwd>Egyptian green ports</kwd><kwd>Environmental pollutions</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Arab Academy for Science, Technology &amp;

Ports are accessible gates for the global networks that could be an indicator of economic performance. Those logistics platforms have caused a wide urban expansion, which integrates the high-density harbor front areas. The concept of port developments has become one of the most competitive among worldwide ports. Integrations of the port’s systems improve this competitiveness in the global maritime supply chain. Despite the growing ports, strategies are set to reduce emissions in shipping and ports.</p><p id="Par16">Ports are a major emitter of environmental pollutants and noises, to both marine and ecosystems. If the port is located within the city limits, environmental factors should be considered when evaluating port efficiency. Shipping accounts for environmental impacts such as GHG emissions (Tovar and Wall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2019</xref>). Greenhouse gas (GHG) is one of the root causes of climate change and global warming (Tovar and Wall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2019</xref>). The main sources also inside the port are cargo loaders, such as trucks, trains, ships, and pipelines. The port industry has a great desire toward mitigating climate change as a target of environmental protection (Iris and Lam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par17">Few port authorities have actively pursued energy management strategies (Acciaro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2014</xref>). Comparing the competitive developments among ports, independent power producers at the port have their own benefits over the dependent ports. Several innovative technologies of operational strategies and energy usage patterns are obtained to enhance zero-energy ports. In the order of investigation of the green port’s conversion, several perspectives are undertaken into considerations, including the port’s characteristics, best practices, limitations, opportunities, and key issues (Alamoush et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Background</title><p id="Par18">Several studies have tackled the emissions of ports and the conversion into green seaports. Some of these studies were numerically, as follows.</p><p id="Par19">The researchers in Chang and Wang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2012</xref>) numerically studied an energy management model to reduce port emissions for green port conversion. The results showed that reducing the ship’s speed approaching the berth to 12 knots could reduce the emissions. However, using the onshore power supply could reduce the CO<sub>2</sub> emission by 57.16% and PM by 39.4%. Decreasing the ship’s speed by policies at a range of 20 nautical miles, as well as using the cold ironing, would cut down the emissions by 71 to 91%. Hou and Geerlings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2016</xref>) numerically studied the sustainability measures and their effectiveness through a conceptual framework in the port of Shanghai. The study focused on both the qualitative and the quantitative outputs. The results concluded that the process has to be organized as well; new policies should be produced to control the transition.</p><p id="Par20">Then, Chang and Jhang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2016</xref>) numerically conducted a green flag program to specify the emission reductions caused by the bulk and container ships entering the port of Kaohsiung. That model is used to account for fuel consumption as well the emissions when using a lowered speed of 12 knots at 20 nautical miles. Also, that model can be used when the speed of ships are lowered to 12 knots and 20 nautical miles far from the port. The results showed a CO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction of 41% and 14% for the container and bulk vessels, respectively. Meanwhile, the SO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction rates are 48% and 43% for the container and bulk vessels, respectively. The results showed that large-sized ships produce less emission, while container ships adopted low speed and fuel transportation, unlike bulk carriers.  Kotrikla et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2017</xref>) numerically estimated the particle matter and the CO<sub>2</sub> emission values emitted by ships at the port using the bottom-up methodology. Also, they investigated the shore connection possibilities to reduce those emissions. The study investigated renewable energy applications by using the HOMER Energy microgrid simulation software. The study showed that 40 ships in the port of Mytilene during 10 days produced 441 kg of PM and 282 metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub>. Around 63% and 77% of PM and CO<sub>2</sub> are emitted by the maneuverability at the berthing phase only. The study concluded that emissions could be avoided by using solar wind renewable system.</p><p id="Par21">Tovar and Wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2019</xref>) numerically accounted for the environmental efficiency of 28 Spanish port authorities in 2016. The nonparametric program of data envelopment analysis (DEA) is used to measure the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by an output-oriented directional distance frontier. The novel dataset showed that environmental efficiency could improve the CO<sub>2</sub> emission by 63%. Controlling the cargo and passenger traffic achieves an emission reduction of up to 82%. Wang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2020</xref>) investigated the maritime port developments using a numerical regression model. The study has provided the intragroup cooperation and out-group competition development model. The results showed that green efficiency model evaluated through 18 ports in China’s five-port groups is compared from 2012 to 2016 using the data envelopment analysis. The study found low efficiency of Chinese ports, due to the numerous problems existing in developing the ports, while the proposed model would improve the ports and reduce the emissions.</p><p id="Par22">Song et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2020</xref>) numerically implemented a comparative study of 5 scenarios to find the best minimum planning cost while investigating the daily operating conditions. The study showed a framework for modeling an integrated port energy system. Also, the study conducted an analysis on the ships using shoreside power on planning costs. The study showed the effectiveness of the port with different energy infrastructures, as well as the planning cost decreasing significantly. Hua et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2020</xref>) numerically suggested and studied the green port indicator system tailored-made at the Zhuhai Port. The study used a fuzzy importance-performance analysis (FIPA) method to find out the port’s performance. The results indicated that the port has to overview and monitor its energy consumption, pollutant emissions, applied technologies, and development. Those observations could be the concept of green development at the port’s facilities.</p><p id="Par23">Dan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2013</xref>) statistically simulated the efficiency of coastal container terminals in China. A three-stage data envelopment analysis model is used for 42 coastal container terminals, which aimed to find higher port efficiency and an improved development mode. The results revealed that efficiencies of coastal container terminals are lower than those of the other ports; however, the scale inefficiency is the primary reason, which is causing a big difference of different port groups. The results showed excessive waste in the input phases. Hanssen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2014</xref>) investigated the possibilities of applying bio-solar energy systems in the Netherlands. The study aims to use the renewable method to produce clean fuel and reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The conducted study evaluated two technological features concerning the energy port and energy farm, which are introduced at workshops of researchers and policymakers. Gibbs et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2014</xref>) analyzed the port’s data to reduce the greenhouse gases, especially in the UK. The provided data are collected from reports and interviews. This analysis showed that the amount of emission produced by the ship at sea is greater than that of their counterpart at ports. However, the ship emission would be reduced; the port’s emission is still high and could be reduced through different plans. Acciaro et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2014</xref>) analyzed the energy flows of two ports (Hamburg and Genoa) to investigate their energy flow.</p><p id="Par24">The results showed that the proposed energy management plans could provide substantial efficiency gains. This in turn contributes to the development of new alternative revenue sources, which enhance the competitive position of ports.</p><p id="Par25">Huertas-Fernández et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2021</xref>) theoretically and numerically introduced and analyzed a novel method to use the wave energy converters as the oscillating water column to produce green hydrogen gas. Hydrogen gas could be used as a clean source of fuel for the energy management strategy. Simulation was implemented using a dynamic financial index and Monte Carlo techniques to determine the repayment period, as well the performance of the power plant for the port of Motril, Southern Spain. The results indicated that it can provide sufficient power for the repayment period. Damman and Steen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2021</xref>) implemented a multi-level perspective (MLP) to investigate three Norwegian ports to figure out zero-emission energy hubs. The study also showed the importance to be a green port by using different disciplines such as hydrogen and LNG. That study revealed that there is an interaction between geographical factors and institutional influences, which could lead to new solutions, feedback, and contributions toward green ports.</p><p id="Par26">Abdeen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2019</xref>) simulated several geometric parameters to investigate heat transfer processes and airflow in a Trombe wall during winter in Alexandria, Egypt, using the DesignBuilder software. While the Trombe walls have massive natural convection and energy storage capability, solar energy is used for decreasing the heating load. The results showed the optimal design of the Trombe wall has a height of 1.7 m by a thickness of 0.3 m and a channel depth of 0.22 m, which enhances the thermal comfort by 38.19% during winter. Fouad et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020</xref>) modeled 8 building designs with 52 buildings using the DesignBuilder and EnergyPlus software to investigate a zero-energy city, in Egypt. The study results showed that renewable energy achieved reduction by 57.6% of the energy consumption, with CO<sub>2</sub> reduction by 390 tons. The study also may help policymakers and governments to achieve zero-energy cities.</p><p id="Par27">Roos and Neto (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2017</xref>) exploratory investigated the environmental performance of Brazilian ports by two state agencies and data of two port authorities. The study found the environmental management should be consolidated before any advanced environmental discussions. Laxe et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2017</xref>) investigated the sustainability synthetic indexes on a specific port in Spain; however, one simple consideration is used such as the ecological footprint. The study showed that, unlike the local synthetics, the global synthetics are a multidimensional nature that uses economic, institutional, environmental, and social dimensions to investigate the port area. Arena et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2018</xref>) utilized a pilot feasibility analysis of integrating green energy, which was applied to passengers and freight mobility near the Italian port area. The utilized sea-to-grid system that provides electricity by harvesting the sea wave energy, as well the green system, would use fully electric vehicles (FEVs) in and close to the port area. The results showed that the energy-producing technology cut down the emissions. The sea-to-grid system provides sufficient electrical power to the green system that leads to experimentation of medium size urbanized areas to small size ports.</p><p id="Par28">Aregall et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2018</xref>) reviewed any possibilities to improve the environmental performance of ports across the globe. The results indicated that 76 out of 365 ports were examined. Several major measures are applied, and three are found as the most common, such as technology improvements, infrastructure development, and monitoring programs. Hentschel et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2018</xref>) investigated the design and application of renewable energy cooperatives at the Port of Rotterdam. The study revealed an action plan to precede a successful cooperative at the port, which could be a guide for stakeholders. Di Vaio and Varriale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2018</xref>)  implemented a numerical qualitative method for the Italian seaports to assess the managerial key performance indicators. The study’s aim is to reduce the environmental impact and energy effects from ports. The results revealed a decision-making tool to achieve high competitiveness of the port that supports interorganizational relationships with shipping lines.</p><p id="Par29">Sun et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2017</xref>) evaluated and analyzed the efficiency of Chinese ports. The study used a proposed model that implemented a nonradial (data envelopment analysis) preference model and used some assumptions to carry out the analysis. The study output showed that the efficiency was low for all ports when environmental factors were considered. It also showed that the port assets, berth quantity, and geographical location can significantly impact environmental performance. Nebot et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2017</xref>) assessed 6 strategies for improving the ports’ energy management. The strategies are used before in different discipline works, such as the marine strategy and integrated coastal management, sustainable port infrastructures, port networking initiatives, regionalization of ports, urban and landscape connectivity, and social integration of ports.</p><p id="Par30">Castellano et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2020</xref>) used a multistep strategy to evaluate an environmental management system. Two indicators are introduced, i.e., environmental quality and port authorities’ efforts, based on 24 Italian ports in 2016. Then, the port efficiency-related economic efficiency is used to enhance the environmental management system. The study found that a used framework is crucial for ports’ environmental and economic performance and to avoid any partial judgments. Also, the system has been optimized by the adoption of green port policies, which use economic performance and minimize undesirable output. The implemented proactive green policies achieved the efficiency converges.</p><p id="Par31">Lee and Nam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2017</xref>) analyzed the green shipping market to assess the benefits of each stakeholder in major countries. The system also aims to study the eco-friendly vessels and the involved regulations, affected by the shipping companies, shipyards, ports, and policies. The results introduced strategic plans towards green shipping in South Korea, such as initiating a shipping-shipbuilding collaborative network, sharing information, increasing the investment in R&amp;D, and using an advanced fueled ship.</p><p id="Par32">Poulsen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2018</xref>) studied the limitations and any possible future potential of initiatives to enhance environmental management. That analysis found from the global chains that low tool implementation complexity and high emission visibility are crucial for recovering the environment. The results showed two major ways to improve the environmental performance of maritime ports. Firstly, it could be achieved by increasing the collaboration between global chains to lower the implemented tool complexity. Secondly, it should enhance emission visibility by cargo owners and regulators. Oh et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2018</xref>) investigated the port’s sustainability to specify the crucial criteria in South Korea. The study used the importance-performance analysis technique to assess the sustainability-environmental, economic, and social aspects by 27 sustainability items. The study findings showed that the most important factor is economic issues followed by environmental concerns and then social factors. Through interviews, port managerial insights are explained to provide more improvement areas to enhance port competitiveness.</p><p id="Par33">Hossain et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2019</xref>) evaluated the sustainability and environmental performance of 18 Canadian major ports. The study has undertaken twenty-five pre-defined indicators of the operational trends to investigate its sustainability. Also, the study analyzed annual performance reports of all Canadian major ports to assess several pollutant performances. The study showed that all Canadian ports have to participate in the annual performance report and use the proposed initiatives to enhance their overall environmental performance. Li et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2019</xref>) optimized numerically the installation and operation strategy of a hybrid renewable energy system especially offshore wind energy for container terminals in Northeast China. The mixed-integer optimization model is used and has concerned with maximizing environmental and economic benefits. That optimization model is considered with two objectives, with several constraints, such as energy supply, demand balances, energy storage balances, technical constraints, and quantity limitations. The model was obtained to specify the hourly energy demands in the terminals, under three evaluation strategies, such as cost-saving, low-carbon, and trade-off strategy. The results revealed that the optimization algorithm would provide references for designing and construction policy of green container terminals.</p><p id="Par34">Martínez-Moya et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>) investigated the energy consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the container terminals of Valencia, Spain. The study showed that the yard had a large value of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions at 68.1%, as the tractors and rubber-tired gantry cranes (RTGs) ran.

Fine sizing functions are used for each of the edges and faces of the blade, domains’ interfaces, connecting links’ surfaces, and the shaft’s surfaces, to handle the mesh quality. A geometric expansion ratio of 1.2 was employed to accurately resolve near-wall flow structures. Each of the rotating domains had finer mesh for its body of 1.5 mm for the rotor’s domain and 1.5 mm for the blades’ domains (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). Inflations to enhance the mesh quality of 5 layers are set around each of the blades, the connecting links, and the shaft, with a minimum cell sizing of 1.5 mm (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>).

The analysis is used the given data by the power generations of photovoltaic systems and the wind turbines. Collected data from the installed weather station is fed to the DesignBuilder software. That data is used to simulate the solar energy generation with respect to the energy consumption by the port’s buildings and validated to the actual solar generated power. Therefore, the simulation resulted a monthly photovoltaic power generation (KWh) through a full year January 1–December 31 at the MIDTAP port (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig22" ref-type="fig">22</xref>). Meanwhile, the turbine power coefficients (see Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>) are fed to the DesignBuilder software to simulate the wind energy generation this time with respect to the energy consumption by the buildings too.

The maximum and minimum power generations through the whole year are 3046.5 KWh and 1232.9 KWh achieved on May and December, respectively. Meanwhile, the power generation of the wind turbines showed kind of different behavior than the solar generation. The generated power is maintained in a fixed range for the year, except for November and December (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig23" ref-type="fig">23</xref>). The maximum and minimum power generations are 1152.3 KWh and 579.9 KWh for months of July and December, respectively. All values are negative because it cut down the power consumption of the main grid.</p><p id="Par91">Pareto optimality analysis between the power generations of photovoltaic systems and the wind turbines for the hybrid system is applied to evaluate the energy management plan. All port’s buildings consume power from the main national grid. However, solar energy and wind energy are providing a scheme to cover the used power, which would be a strategy of reducing these consumptions. This analysis consists of one objective function, which is selecting the best power generation method to cover up the power usage by the buildings on a large time scale. Pareto optimality solution investigated variations between the power generations of solar energy and wind energy over time.</p><p id="Par92">Figure <xref rid="Fig24" ref-type="fig">24</xref> shows a chart of a simple Pareto solution revealing that the maximum power generation was on July, June, and May. December, November, and January had the lowest power generation, in which the rest of the required power from the main grid could be used. Therefore, the power consumed from the main grid could be reduced or even some of the generated renewable energy charges to the main grid during the summer months. However, during the winter months, the power generation sometimes may not be sufficient for all the port’s buildings, and the system will draw from the main grid unlike the summer months. Therefore, the power generations from the solar energy and wind energy will provide the required energy consumption for the port’s buildings for the rest of the year.<fig id="Fig24"><label>Fig. 24</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Pareto optimality analysis chart between the power generations of photovoltaic systems and the wind turbines for the port’s hybrid system</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11356_2023_25403_Fig24_HTML.png" id="MO27"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Discussion of results</title><p id="Par93">Due to the solar panels for both buildings have been installed, the total nominal output is 13.26 kWp at an operating condition of 11.82 kWp. The simulation showed that the buildings have saved energy consumption and reduced the emission of course by around 42.19 MW/year with an average of 72.25%. On the other hand, the system is providing around 42.191 MWh to be returned to the main national grid as an added value.</p><p id="Par94">The wind system, on the other hand, has a great chance to be implemented in the future. The front area of the port has a good wind speed without any obstacles affecting the wind flow. With the good power coefficient of the wind rotor, the wind system will help the solar system to support all the port’s buildings, especially with the increased power coefficient as shown by the simulations. The wind system will be addition to the whole renewable energy system as the intuition of the port authority to go with the green seaport.</p><p id="Par95">The DesignBuilder software showed the compatibility of both the wind and the solar systems together. Then, the Pareto optimality analysis method approved that by showing that the wind and solar systems can work simultaneously to provide green energy through the whole year. Power generation is increased during the summer months because the addition of the solar system and the increased efficiency of the PV panels.</p><p id="Par96">To sum up, the uncertainty of the solar and wind energy is covered by using two renewable energy systems instead of one, plus an energy management plane, which manages the operation of both systems. However, the energy demand here is considered the energy required for the buildings. The DesignBuilder software is described and how the energy distribution through the whole year would be covered. That is the role of the energy management plan, which plays a critical role of providing the energy and ensure the reliability of the system. Mainly, based on the results of the DesignBuilder results, solar energy supports the system during the summer months, and wind energy supports the winter months. On the other hand, solar energy works only during the daylight; therefore, a storage system would help provide energy for the building during the nighttime, if needed. However, wind turbines provide energy during the whole day. Notice, the DesignBuilder software analyzed the energy input and output based on the given system, while the Pareto optimality method is used to evaluate the operation of the energy management plan.</p><p id="Par97">Energy supply is the energy that could be provide by the national grid or could be provide by the solar and wind energy, in the case of green port. The seaport in that case uses the national grid for providing the energy needs for workshops, machineries, and buildings. However, the solar system is working properly to provide energy supply to the building and reduce the consumption of the national grid.</p><p id="Par98">Based on the given case, the buildings demand energy daily, which is covered by the energy supply of the national grid. Adding renewable energy application to the port’s buildings made the port self-sufficient. However, the plan is to have a full coverage of the renewable energy to cover the energy demand. Thus, the energy supply of the port will have excess generated energy. That excess amount could be store into a battery system; however, the plan is to send it to the national grid, which will make profit and reduces the operational cost of the system.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusion and future works</title><p id="Par99">Solar energy and wind energy have been applied at the port of Alexandria, practically and theoretically, respectively. At the meantime, no research tackles the problem in Egypt. Solar energy is investigated using onsite arrays, and then energy management is carried out to the installed system using the DesignBuilder software. The energy management also included wind energy, which is examined numerically, as an initial step. However, there is no study which investigated the optimum strategy for solar and wind energy in maritime ports. The solar panel experiment showed a sufficient generated power for all the port’s buildings, while the numerical model validated the real testing. Also, the wind arrays simulation had good behavior with power coefficient more than the single wind turbine, due to the array interaction. Finally, Pareto optimality analysis is carried out between the generated powers from solar and wind energies over the year to reveal an energy management plan for the power generation and the power usage of all buildings. Therefore, the solar energy and the wind energy will reduce the energy consumption of the port by reducing the energy consumption of the port’s buildings. Nevertheless, an onsite wind turbines array will be experimented as a future investigation to ensure the best design validation, while using machine learning code for an advanced optimization.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Limitation of the study</title><p id="Par100">The use of renewable energy application in a maritime port in Alexandria, Egypt, is a challenge.
