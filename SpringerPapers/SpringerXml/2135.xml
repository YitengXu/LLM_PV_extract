To date, laboratory-scale all-perovskite tandem solar cells have only been fabricated using non-scalable fabrication techniques. In response, this work reports on laser-scribed all-perovskite tandem modules processed exclusively with scalable fabrication methods (blade coating and vacuum deposition), demonstrating power conversion efficiencies up to 19.1% (aperture area, 12.25 cm<sup>2</sup>; geometric fill factor, 94.7%) and stable power output. Compared to the performance of our spin-coated reference tandem solar cells (efficiency, 23.5%; area, 0.1 cm<sup>2</sup>), our prototypes demonstrate substantial advances in the technological readiness of all-perovskite tandem photovoltaics. By means of electroluminescence imaging and laser-beam-induced current mapping, we demonstrate the homogeneous current collection in both subcells over the entire module area, which explains low losses (&lt;5%<sub>rel</sub>) in open-circuit voltage and fill factor for our scalable modules.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">All-perovskite tandem photovoltaics hold technological potential yet their upscaling is not trivial.

Several studies reported efficiencies of laboratory-scale 2TPT-SCs exhibiting a PCE of &gt;23% (refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>), with the current certified record being 26.4% (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>). Considering that these values exceed the PCEs of commercial single-junction multicrystalline silicon or copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, it is time to take the next step and develop scalable fabrication processes and interconnection schemes for 2TPT-solar modules (2TPT-SMs).</p><p id="Par4">While laser-scribed interconnection schemes of single-junction perovskite solar modules were successfully implemented in the past at very high geometrical fill factors of &gt;98% (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>), there is yet no report addressing the very specific challenges of the monolithic all-perovskite tandem module. Similar to single-junction perovskite solar modules, scaling 2TPT-SCs will adapt the established thin-film module interconnection concept of elongated PSC stripes that are separated by equidistant interconnections formed by three scribing lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. However, realizing laser-scribed interconnection lines in 2TPT-SMs necessitates processing in an inert atmosphere and a scribing process that is compatible with a tandem solar cell layer stack containing two types of perovskite thin films.</p><p id="Par5">Next to the module interconnection, 2TPT-SM device architectures processed with industrially scalable deposition methods need to be developed. So far, all 2TPT-SCs have required several spin-coating steps, which limited the device area to a laboratory scale of up to around 12 cm<sup>2</sup> (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>). For large areas, scalable methods such as thermal evaporation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, blade coating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, spray coating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> and slot-die coating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> have been investigated for perovskite photovoltaics. Among them, blade coating (PCE: 17.8%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> and slot-die coating (PCE: 20.8%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> have demonstrated remarkable potential in processing single-junction perovskite solar modules. The key challenge in processing 2TPT-SMs with scalable solution-based methods is the sequential layer deposition considering the similar solubility of the WBG and NBG perovskite layer in the top and bottom cell, respectively. The latter poses a major hurdle to the sequential deposition of the 2TPT device architecture as it induces facile degradation of the underlying layer (for example, the WBG perovskite) when processing the solution of the NBG bottom solar cell.</p><p id="Par6">In response to the above-mentioned challenges in upscaling 2TPT PV, this study reports on laser-scribed 2TPT-SMs processed exclusively with scalable fabrication techniques. The study introduces the scientific and technological advances that led to these prototypes. First, we introduce our reference device architecture, which benefits from reduced optical losses and shows close performance in small-scale 2TPT-SCs (aperture area of 0.1 cm<sup>2</sup>) compared to the record devices reported in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Second, we report on a high-throughput laser-scribing process in an inert atmosphere and demonstrate high geometric fill factors (GFF) in small-scale spin-coated 2TPT-SMs (aperture area of 2.25 cm<sup>2</sup>, referred to as ‘spin-coated 2TPT-SMs’). Using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), we reveal the highly selective laser patterning of the scribing lines.

Xiao et al. showed that by the use of surface-anchoring zwitterionic molecules in the NBG perovskite, a uniform layer of NBG perovskite can be achieved by spin coating. This enabled them to reach a higher active area of 12 cm<sup>2</sup> in the 2TPT-SCs with a notable PCE of 21.4% (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>). Upscaling to larger areas requires the development of thin-film modules with two-terminal interconnected cell stripes, which allows operating the module at high voltages and low currents. The established route to realizing an efficient thin-film module interconnection employs three interconnection lines (called P1, P2 and P3), as shown schematically in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref> (for more details see Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">21</xref>). The area between P1 and P3 interconnection lines is inactive, which denotes an associated area loss quantified by the GFF (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">21</xref>). Mitigating the risk for interconnection-induced shunts between the back or front contact and the recombination layer, we note that the percolated Au layers provide a higher yield compared to ITO recombination layers. We attribute this to the low lateral conductivity of our percolated Au layers (in the range of MΩ), which makes this architecture less sensitive to shunts from either electrode to the recombination layer at or near the scribing lines (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">The disadvantage of the percolated Au layers is a reduced transmission compared to ITO recombination layers (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>). According to our observations, even the conductivity of thin ITO layers of thickness ~15 nm (~450–500 Ω sq<sup>−1</sup> sheet resistance) is sufficient to induce notable shunt resistance losses. For this reason, a percolated Au recombination layer is employed here despite the high parasitic absorption losses. These absorption losses are attributed to plasmonic losses of percolated Au layers in the recombination junction (SnO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>/Au/PEDOT:PSS), even at the lower nominal thicknesses of Au down to 0.3 nm (Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref> and Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref>). However, neither a percolated Au recombination layer nor a thin ITO recombination layer (~15 nm) are optimal and substantial future improvement potential lies in the development of improved recombination or tunnel junctions for all-perovskite tandem PVs.</p><p id="Par10">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref> shows an all-laser-scribed spin-coated 2TPT-SM comprising four serially interconnected cell stripes with a total aperture area of 2.56 cm<sup>2</sup> and a 94.7% GFF (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d,e</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">21a,b</xref>). It should be noted that the low stability of mixed Sn/Pb-based perovskite narrow-bandgap bottom solar cells poses a general challenge to the industrial upscaling of all-perovskite-based tandem photovoltaics. Exposure of the devices to the ambient atmosphere needs to be avoided at any stage. For this purpose, a custom-built laser-scribing set-up is employed for the fabrication of the monolithic interconnections of 2TPT-SMs; the set-up allows patterning in an inert atmosphere to prevent O<sub>2</sub> exposure and degradation of the NBG bottom subcell during the scribing process.</p><p id="Par11">Compared to other thin-film module technologies (GFF up to 96% (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>)), as well as single-junction perovskite modules (GFF ~95% (refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>)), the achieved GFF of 94.7% is very respectable. For details on the laser-scribing process, we refer to the experimental section and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">21</xref>. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>, the <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> of each cell stripe of the spin-coated tandem module corresponds to around 2.01 V, while the total <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> of the module equates to the expected 8.0 V (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). This implies a minimal loss in <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> of only 10 mV per cell stripe (0.5% relative). Moreover, our modules retain a high FF of 75%, demonstrating a negligible detrimental effect of introduced module interconnections (compared with single-junction solar cells showing FF of ~75%; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Our in-house measurement of the champion module (without encapsulation and masking, measured in ambient atmosphere) with an aperture area of 2.56 cm<sup>2</sup> (defined by laser scribing) exhibits a high PCE of 22.2% (23.7% active area PCE) with <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> = 8.0 V, short-circuit current <italic>I</italic><sub>sc</sub> = 9.57 mA and FF = 75% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). The MPP tracking of the modules under continuous illumination (1 Sun) shows a SPCE of 21.4% (and stable power output of 54.7 mW) for 15 hours (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). Moreover, the module shows stable power output at the maximum power point for 3.5 hours and 85°C in an inert atmosphere (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>).</p><p id="Par12">The good performance of the spin-coated 2TPT-SM was certified by the accredited CalLab PV Cells of Fraunhofer ISE. Given the sensitivity of the NBG perovskites towards ambient atmosphere and the requirements of the certification standards, the module was encapsulated and covered with an additional external mask. The encapsulated and masked champion module (aperture area of 2.43 cm<sup>2</sup>) exhibited an in-house PCE of 19.8% (<italic>I</italic>–<italic>V</italic> measurement, backward scan) and an externally measured PCE of up to 18.3% (Fraunhofer ISE CalLab PV Cells). The certified PCE determined by steady-state MPP is 17.99% ± 0.63% (Fraunhofer ISE CalLab PV Cells, see Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">22</xref>). The apparent difference between the certified and in-house PCE is attributed to degradation losses that originate from the encapsulation process (which is conducted in ambient atmosphere) and the extended time of transfer (see Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">22</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref> and Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref> for a detailed discussion). Therefore, to reach higher stability for the 2TPT-SMs, proper encapsulation under an inert atmosphere is required.

To discriminate between the photogenerated current in the top and bottom subcells, the LBIC set-up is expanded by a second excitation laser, and now comprises laser sources of wavelength 530 nm and 850 nm, respectively. First, exciting the module with the 530 nm laser, we track the LBIC signal in the top subcell, as photons of this wavelength are fully absorbed in the WBG perovskite absorber layer (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d,e</xref>). The corresponding LBIC map shows uniform photocurrent generation in the entire active area of the module. Second, using the 850 nm laser, we selectively excited the bottom subcell, as photons of this energy are not absorbed by the WBG perovskite top subcell, but only by the NBG perovskite bottom subcell (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d,f</xref>). Similar to the LBIC map of the top subcell, the LBIC signal of the bottom subcell also exhibits a homogeneous signal over the entire module area. Interestingly, some defects are apparent as dark spots in the LBIC signal of the top subcell but appear bright in the LBIC signal of the bottom subcell. These defects are attributed to pinholes in the top subcell and inhomogeneity in the perovskite thin-film thickness. Overall, the LBIC data prove an even photocurrent generation and extraction over the entire active area for both the top and bottom subcells of our module.</p><p id="Par16">To study the distribution of local defects and confined local charge barriers in our tandem modules, we further employ electroluminescence imaging, which exhibits only indirect information on current collection but at much higher resolution (for our set-up a pixel coarsely represents about 13 µm × 13 µm) compared to LBIC (our LBIC resolution is limited by laser spot diameter;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> ~200 µm and 500 µm in our measurements). To distinguish the electroluminescence signal of the two subcells in our tandem module (1.78 eV WBG perovskite top subcell (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">24</xref>) and 1.26 eV NBG perovskite bottom subcell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>), the electroluminescence signal is imaged with: (1) a neutral density filter to track the full electroluminescence signal; (2) a longpass filter (~760 nm) for imaging the bottom subcell; and (3) a shortpass filter (~775 nm) for imaging the top subcell (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>, Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">27</xref> and Supplementary Video <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">1</xref>).

As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h,i</xref>, the recorded electroluminescence images reveal overall good homogeneity, confirming the LBIC data. However, several local defects are present in the active area (indicated by black arrows for the top and bottom subcells). We attribute these defects to either local variations in charge-carrier injection (due to different series resistance) or local variation in out coupling of luminescence from the device (for example, due to variations in surface roughness and thickness).</p><p id="Par17">At the same time, most features are visible in both electroluminescence images, indicating that the fabrication defects in the top subcell affect the quality of the bottom subcell too.

Although electroluminescence and LBIC analyses agree in terms of homogeneity in the active area as well as laser-scribed interconnection lines, electroluminescence imaging allows us to reveal individual fabrication defects of the modules in both deposition and laser-scribing steps, facilitating process optimization towards high-efficiency 2TPT-SMs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e,f,h,i</xref>).

Interestingly, the 2T module shows a remarkable electroluminescence signal at a starting voltage of ~12 V (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>) with emission from the WBG (688 nm) and NGB (977 nm) perovskite layer, which itself highlights the high quality and homogeneity of our 2TPT modules (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>). To investigate the photocurrent generation in the subcells over the entire module, LBIC measurement on a different module is conducted (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">29</xref>).

To prevent degradation of the WBG perovskite top solar cell during the subsequent deposition step of the NBG perovskite layer, in addition to the use of robust interlayers, the resting time of the NBG perovskite solution on the sample needs to be minimized. As we show in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">30</xref>, notable corrosion of the WBG subcell, due to penetration of NBG solution through the interlayers, is already apparent after 6 s. For spin-coated devices, the resting time is &lt;5 s (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">31</xref>), as most of the solution already evaporates during the early phase of the spin rotation, leading to high-performance devices (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). For blade-coated NBG thin films, a simple VAGC step already helps to accelerate the solvent extraction (PV0), but crystallization of the blade-coated NBG perovskite still takes longer (~18 s) than small-size spin-coated samples due to the high amount of DMF:DMSO vapour and thicker perovskite solution (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a,c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">31</xref>).

Therefore, we show that scaling up the 2TPT-SM architecture by scalable deposition methods is feasible as long as very fast extraction of solvents of the bottom subcell is guaranteed. In this work, we employ a combination of VAGC with nitrogen gas flow to realize fast drying of the solution-processed NBG perovskite thin film in a mild vacuum range of 10<sup>4</sup>–10<sup>5</sup> Pa.

For this purpose, a combination of vacuum deposition and blade coating (blade gap of 100 μm) was employed. Substrates of 6.4 × 5 cm<sup>2</sup> IO:H were used such that the inhomogeneous region in the blade-coating procedure (7 mm from the beginning and 7 mm from the end of the blade-coated substrates) can be cut away. The final substrate size for our modules was 5 × 5 cm<sup>2</sup>, in which a 0.5 mm distance from each edge was reserved for the glass–glass encapsulation. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, the modules have an aperture area of 12.25 cm<sup>2</sup> (3.5 cm × 3.5 cm), which contains seven cell strips (with an active area of 1.75 cm<sup>2</sup> on each). The fabrication of two-terminal tandems was conducted as follows. (1) After P1, deposition of the 2PACz was conducted by blade coating with a rate of 15 mm s<sup>−1</sup> followed by drying in a nitrogen atmosphere and annealing at 100 °C for 10 minutes. (2) The WBG perovskite layer was blade coated from a diluted WBG solution (40 vol%) with a solvent mixt (4:1) of DMF:DMSO. Optimal device performance and perovskite thin-film quality (thickness: 400–430 nm, root mean square (r.m.s. roughness: ~20 nm) were obtained for a blade speed of 15 mm s<sup>−1</sup>. To realize this rather low roughness, a short vacuum quenching step (30 s, 200 cm<sup>3</sup> min<sup>−1</sup> nitrogen flow) was implemented. The vacuum quenching enables homogeneous crystallization of WBG perovskite thin film. The dry perovskite thin films were annealed at 150 °C for 20 min. It should be noted that the roughness of the WBG perovskite thin film is key to the fabrication yield of the tandem device. While the spin-coated WBG perovskite thin films exhibit an r.m.s. roughness of &lt;10 nm, the blade-coated perovskite thin films exhibit an r.m.s. roughness of ~20 nm. The r.m.s. roughness was assessed by atomic force microscopy measurements. In our optimization procedure, we realized a rougher surface of the WBG causes a low yield of tandem devices due to the degradation of the WBG perovskite by the solvent of the NBG perovskite during deposition. (3) After deposition of the WBG perovskite layer, 1 nm LiF and subsequently 15 nm C<sub>60</sub> were deposited by thermal evaporation. (4) Later, a 35 nm thin layer of ALD-deposited SnO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> was employed for the protection of WBG perovskite while deposition of PEDOT:PSS and NBG perovskite solution occurred. (5) After deposition of the recombination layer (here 1.2 nm Au to avoid shunting between metal rear contact and recombination layer through P2 scribing line), a 10× diluted PEDOT:PSS (aqueous dispersion) with IPA was blade coated on the substrates. Note that to avoid degradation of WBG perovskite by a small trace of water in PEDOT:PSS and to produce a uniform layer of PEDOT:PSS, a 25 mm s<sup>−1</sup> blading speed and 80 °C blade-coating plate temperature is required. (6) Deposition of NBG perovskite layer was conducted by blade coating the diluted solution of NBG (50 vol%) with DMF to reach the same thickness as we could reach by spin coating (~800 nm). After blade coating of the NBG solution, the layers were immediately transferred into the vacuum chamber to extract the solvents and produce the NBG perovskite layer. During this procedure, we realized there was an intensive degradation of the WBG top subcell by solvents of the NBG solution, which deteriorates the entire performance of the modules. Therefore we designed an alternative drying procedure to accelerate the solvent extraction and crystallization of the NBG perovskite. In this regard, the growth of the NBG perovskite was conducted in the vacuum chamber with the assistance of controlled and optimized nitrogen flow to swap the evaporated solvents from the surface of the modules during the crystallization. For this purpose, different nitrogen flows of 0, 180, 260 and 285 cm<sup>3</sup> min<sup>−1</sup> were investigated. After drying the NBG perovskite layers, they were annealed at 100 °C for 7 minutes. (7) Next, a 10× diluted PCBM solution was blade coated on the NBG layer and dried in the vacuum chamber without any annealing procedure. (8) After deposition of PCBM, 30 nm C<sub>60</sub> and 5 nm BCP were deposited on the substrate by thermal evaporation. (9) After the P2 scribing line, a 100 nm thin Au layer was deposited by thermal evaporation, and, finally, P3 scribing lines were used to define the cell strips and final aperture area. (10) Later, a 125 nm MgF<sub>2</sub> layer was used as an antireflection coating layer on the glass side of the modules. Finally, (11) the modules were encapsulated with butyl rubber in the glass–glass encapsulation. To define the accurate aperture area, an additional black-painted metal mask was used to define the 12.25 cm<sup>2</sup> aperture area for <italic>J–V</italic> and MPP characterizations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Current density–voltage measurements</title><p id="Par36">The <italic>J–V</italic> characteristics of the single-junction solar cells, tandem solar cells and tandem modules were measured with a class AAA solar simulator (Newport Oriel Sol3A) at a power density of 100 mW cm<sup>−2</sup>, simulating AM 1.5G solar irradiation. The scan rate during measurement was set to 0.6 V s<sup>−1</sup> using a source meter (Keithley 2400 A). For NBG single-junction and all tandem solar cells and modules, the solar simulator was calibrated with a certified silicon solar cell (Newport, #2446 and #1758). For <italic>J–V</italic> measurements of the WBG single-junction perovskite solar cells, a silicon solar cell (Newport) equipped with a KG5 bandpass filter was used for calibration. The stable power output efficiency of the PSCs was determined by tracking the MPP under continuous AM 1.5G illumination. The temperature of the solar cells was actively controlled by a Peltier element connected to a microcontroller and set to 25 °C (85 °C for MPP tracking at thermal stress) while conducting the <italic>J–V</italic> analyses and MPP tracking. As the <italic>J–V</italic> characteristics are measured with a single lamp solar simulator, the <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub> reported is adapted to the external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements. The <italic>J–V</italic> measurement of the modules was conducted without controlling the temperature, which caused an increase in temperature up to 60 °C in the long-term measurement. The active area of the WBG and NBG single-junction perovskite solar cells was defined by a mask of 0.1 cm<sup>2</sup>. The aperture area of the laser-scribed modules was defined by laser scribing (2.56 cm<sup>2</sup>). For the certification, additional external manual masking of the module was required, which decreased the aperture area to 2.43 cm<sup>2</sup>. For the measurements of the 12.25 cm<sup>2</sup> modules, a metal mask with a 12.25 cm<sup>2</sup> aperture area was used. For the latter device, no difference with and without a mask was apparent, highlighting the accuracy of the laser scribing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>SEM</title><p id="Par37">Field emission cross-sectional and top-view SEM images of two-terminal all-perovskite tandems solar cell, interconnection of the module, thermal-evaporated Au layer and sputtered ITO thin film were taken with a ZEISS Supra60 VP scanning electron microscope.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Optical characterization and EQE measurements</title><p id="Par38">The absorption spectra of the perovskite thin films and devices were measured with a Bentham PVE300 photovoltaic service characterization system by illuminating the solar cell with modulated monochromatic light.
