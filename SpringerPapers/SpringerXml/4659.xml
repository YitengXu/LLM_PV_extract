In this work, hydrogen doped brookite (H:brookite) nanobullet arrays were synthesized via a well-designed solution reaction for the first time. H:brookite shows highly improved PEC properties with excellent stability, enhanced photocurrent, and significantly high Faradaic efficiency for overall solar water splitting. To support the experimental data, <italic>ab initio</italic> density functional theory calculations were also conducted. At the interstitial doping site that has minimum formation energy, the hydrogen atoms act as shallow donors and exist as H<sup>+</sup>. which has the minimum formation energy among three states of hydrogen (H<sup>+</sup>. H<sup>0</sup>, and H<sup>−</sup>). The calculated density of states of H:brookite shows a narrowed bandgap and an increased electron density compared to the pristine brookite. The combined experimental and theoretical results provide frameworks for the exploration of the PEC properties of doped brookite and extend our knowledge regarding the undiscovered properties of brookite of TiO<sub>2</sub>.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>21028</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>10</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>26</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep36099.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>21</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep36099" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep36099</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over the past few decades, photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen generation through solar water splitting has drawn increasing attention as a promising way of renewable energy production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. One of the crucial issues in the development of the ideal PEC cells having high solar-to-hydrogen conversion (STH) efficiencies is the synthesis of effective photoelectrodes. The ideal photoelectrode should satisfy several requirements, such as wide range of light absorption, fast charge separation/transport, high H<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> gas generation rate, long stability, and economic feasibility. Among various photoelectrode materials, a metal oxide semiconductor is considered as a strong candidate for an efficient photoelectrode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p>TiO<sub>2</sub> is a representative stable metal oxide, which has been extensively investigated since the discovery of the photocatalytic property of TiO<sub>2</sub> by Fujishima and Honda<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. As a candidate for a suitable photoelectrode, TiO<sub>2</sub> has unique merits, such as excellent stability, low cost, and nontoxicity; however, it also has a fatal demerit of having a large band gap energy of 3.2 eV (in the case of anatase), which restricts the utilization of solar energy. The utilization of visible light, which constitutes 45% of the total amount of solar energy, is essential to achieve a high STH efficiency. Several attempts have been made to utilize visible light with TiO<sub>2</sub>, e.g., quantum dot (QD) or dye sensitization, metal loading, and anion/metal ion doping of TiO<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The development of heterostructures of TiO<sub>2</sub> with a narrow band gap QD or dye, which can assist visible light absorption, has some obstacles, such as complicated fabrication processes that require several steps and instability of QD or dye (which can be decomposed and corroded in solution reactions). Another approach to utilize visible light is anion/metal doping of TiO<sub>2</sub> to narrow the bandgap of the photoelectrode material. Since it was reported in 2001, doped TiO<sub>2</sub> has been attracting great interest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p>TiO<sub>2</sub> has three major crystalline polymorphs: rutile (tetragonal, space group: P42/mnm), anatase (tetragonal, space group: I41/amd), and brookite (orthorhombic, space group: Pbca). Most of the previous research studies of hydrogen treated TiO<sub>2</sub> only focused on the anatase and rutile phases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>; in contrast, brookite TiO<sub>2</sub> has scarcely been studied because the brookite phase rarely exists in nature and is difficult to synthesize<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Although some research has been performed to discover the properties of doped brookite with calculated densities of states (DOSs), no single study has attempted to investigate the experimental analysis of properties of doped brookite due to the problem of the difficult synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p>The aim of this research is to prepare and explore the undiscovered properties of hydrogen doped brookite (H:brookite), which can be fabricated using an innovate approach, and compare the experimental results with the theoretical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). This work is the first study reporting the preparation and enhanced PEC overall solar water splitting properties of hydrogen doped brookite nanostructure. The high-quality single crystalline brookite nanostructures were prepared using a hydrothermal solution reaction and then doped with hydrogen gas using a high temperature furnace system. The morphologies and atomic structures of pristine and hydrogen doped brookite were compared, and doping of hydrogen in interstitial sites in brookite was confirmed by experimental and theoretical methods. H:brookite showed overall water splitting and enhanced PEC properties owing to narrowed bandgap and increased electron density which was analyzed experimentally and theoretically. The combined experimental and theoretical analysis results suggest that H:brookite TiO<sub>2</sub> has a promising potential as a efficient photoanode for overall solar water splitting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Morphology and crystal structure of brookite and H:brookite</title><p>The brookite samples were synthesized using a well-designed solution reaction method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The bullet shaped TiO<sub>2</sub> nanostructures are vertically aligned on the titanium foil and thus do not require additional film deposition process for working electrode preparation, as is necessary for the powder materials. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> compares the morphology and crystal structure of brookite and H:brookite via field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) images.

In addition, the SEM analysis confirms that the morphology of the samples is not changed after annealing with a H<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> mixed gas for hydrogen doping.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a,b</bold>) Top-view SEM images of (<bold>a</bold>) pristine brookite and (<bold>b</bold>) H:brookite; the insets show the tilt-view SEM images.

Both of their atomic structures were investigated using high-resolution TEM images that are recorded along the [001] zone axis, which show the high quality single-crystalline atomic arrangement. It can be seen from the left-bottom side insets in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c,d</xref> that the fast-Fourier-transform (FFT) patterns corresponding to the HR-TEM images coincide with the diffraction patterns of brookite recorded along the [001] zone axis; thus, we believe that the crystal structures are not changed after annealing with a H<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> mixed gas. The distance between atomic planes, which are verified by the FFT patterns, were measured, indicating the d-spacings of the (210) and (200) atomic planes are 0.341 and 0.483 nm, respectively.</p><p>The unique bullet shape of the brookite TiO<sub>2</sub> crystal is due to the exposed specific facets with low surface energies. Gibbs conclude that the crystals having the same volume should have a minimum surface energy at equilibrium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Thus, when the crystals grow, they tend to adopt the shape that minimizes the total surface energy. Previous studies have reported that, according to their theoretical calculations, the most stable facet of brookite due to its low surface energy is {210}<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. According to Curie’s theory regarding the formation of crystals, the growth rates of the crystal facets are proportional to the surface free energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. As the reaction progresses, the crystal facets with fast growth rates disappear, and the most stable {210} facets with slow growth rates are extended to minimize the total surface energy. A kinetic roughening transition also occurs during the growth reaction at the crystal surface. In the case of metal oxide crystals, it is well known that the de-oxidation process ensues to preserve electronic neutrality, which can be deneutralized by adsorption of ions with different charges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. An illustration in the black dashed rectangle in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref> shows that, as a result of the roughening transition, stepped face (S) transform into a kinked face (K), which results in the sharp tip of crystal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. From <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, we can see that lattice fringes of bottom edge are sharply enclosed. From the FFT, it can also be found that the sharply enclosed edges are {210} facets, supporting the explanation that brookite has dominant {210} facets by virtue of their low surface energy (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1f</xref> shows the scheme of brookite structure and the structure of the exposed {210} surface, which is the most stable facet.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>SIMS and XPS analysis of brookite and H:brookite</title><p>As shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, the brookite crystal structure has two nonequivalent doping sites. In the case of substitutional doping, shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S2d,e</xref>, hydrogen atoms will replace oxygen atoms, causing changes in the number of chemical bonds between titanium and oxygen atoms. However, as seen from <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, interstitially doped hydrogen atoms will bond to oxygen atoms perpendicularly, which produces no changes in the number of chemical bonds between titanium and oxygen atoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Thus, there are four possible means for hydrogen doping, substitutional or interstitial doping on the two different sites, and all of their formation energies were calculated and compared in detail (see the theoretical analysis results presented in section <italic>Formation Energy</italic>). To verify the doping of brookite nanoarrays by experiments, we performed secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. SIMS is a widely used technique for determining the elemental distributions in a semiconductor (especially the dopant distribution), and it is applied to obtain depth profiles of elements in brookite and H:brookite. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c,d</xref> provide the SIMS depth profiles of brookite and H:brookite, respectively. The pristine brookite was immersed in an HCl solution during the fabrication process, which can provide the residual content of hydrogen in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>. Contrary to the similar intensities of oxygen and titanium, the hydrogen ion intensity displays a remarkable increase in H:brookite samples compared to pristine brookite. From these results, we can surmise that H:brookite contains more hydrogen ion than pristine brookite.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Crystal structure, which has two nonequivalent doping sites of (<bold>a</bold>) brookite and (<bold>b</bold>) interstitially hydrogen doped brookite.

The Ti 2p and O 1s XPS spectra for brookite and H:brookite are presented in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e,f</xref>, respectively. As shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref> and its inset, the Ti 2p XPS spectra of both samples are almost identical. Their Ti 2p<sub>1/2</sub> and Ti 2p<sub>3/2</sub> peaks occur at the binding energies of 458.5 and 464.3 eV, respectively, which correspond to the lattice chemical bonding of TiO<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Their identical Ti 2p peaks indicate that the chemical bonding of titanium is not affected by heat treatment with hydrogen. On the contrary, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref> and its inset show a slight but noticeable change of the O 1s XPS spectra of the samples. The O 1s peak can be deconvoluted into two sub-peaks, which have binding energies of 529.8 and 531.4 eV, corresponding to the chemical bonding of TiO<sub>2</sub> and OH, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. It can be observed from <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S1</xref> that the deconvolution results of two samples show that the O 1s peaks appear at same peak positions, but have different ratios of the peak areas. The peak area ratio of OH to TiO<sub>2</sub> of H:brookite is increased compared to that of pristine brookite. A possible explanation for these SIMS and XPS data might be that the hydrogen ions are doped into interstitial sites of the brookite after annealing with a H<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> mixed gas. If the hydrogen ions were doped into the substitutional sites, then the chemical bonding of brookite at Ti 2p should be changed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. However, according to our results in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>, this change is not the case in our samples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Photoelectrochemical properties of brookite and H:brookite</title><p>A heat treatment of brookite TiO<sub>2</sub> with a H<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> mixed gas was conducted at various temperatures ranging from 500 to 800 °C. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) experiments were performed in a three-electrode electrochemical cell, with brookite or H:brookite, Pt flag, and Ag/AgCl as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively, incorporating a 1 M NaOH electrolyte solution. The PEC characteristics of the cells were measured under a simulated air mass 1.5 G solar spectrum with intensity of 100 mWcm<sup>−2</sup>, which was adjusted using an NREL-certified silicon reference cell equipped with a KG-5 filter. The photocurrent density-voltage graphs under chopped illumination are shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>. The 700 °C annealed sample has the best performance, whereas the heat treatment above 700 °C causes the sample to become exfoliated and wrecked.

Stabilized structure parameters of brookite have been calculated, revealing that the brookite possesses two distinguishable oxygen sites that are represented by different bond lengths and bond angles with nearby Ti atoms. Thus, hydrogen atoms could be interstitially or substitutionally doped at two different sites. Consequently, four distinct cases of hydrogen-doped brookite (after structural relaxation) have been calculated. The calculated structure parameters are described in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">supporting information</xref>. When hydrogen atoms doped into the brookite structure, they would form a stable structure having the lowest formation energy, and it can be evaluated by using following equation:<disp-formula id="Equ4"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep36099_Equ6_HTML.gif"/></disp-formula></p><p>Where <italic>E</italic><sup><italic>f</italic></sup>(<italic>H</italic><sup><italic>q</italic></sup>) is the formation energy of doped hydrogen atom, <italic>E</italic><sup><italic>tot</italic></sup>(<italic>H</italic><sup><italic>q</italic></sup>) is the total energy including doped hydrogen, <italic>E</italic><sup><italic>tot</italic></sup>(<italic>bulk</italic>) is the total energy excluding doped hydrogen, <italic>μ</italic>(<italic>0</italic>) is the chemical potential of oxygen atom, <italic>μ</italic>(<italic>H</italic>) is the chemical potential of hydrogen atom, <italic>q</italic> is the charge and <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>f</italic></sub> is the Fermi energy. As shown in the <xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="disp-formula">equation (6)</xref>, the formation energy depends on the charge state and the Fermi level. The computed formation energies at the zero Fermi energy of H<sup>−</sup>, H<sup>0</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> for the four possible doping states are compared in <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Regarding the formation energies of H<sup>0</sup>, which is independent of the Fermi energy, the interstitial doping at the site 2 has the lowest formation energy. As shown in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>, there is a significant difference in the formation energy between interstitial and substitutional doping. Thus, one can conclude that the hydrogen atoms will be doped at interstitial sites. At the interstitial site 2 which is the most stable doping site (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>), the formation energy of H<sup>+</sup> is much lower than those of H<sup>0</sup> and H<sup>−</sup> at the zero Fermi energy level (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). From this result, one can deduce the following scenario: The interstitially doped hydrogen atoms donate electrons and oxidize to H<sup>+</sup>. which has the lowest formation energy. As presented in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>, the formation energy of charged states, such as H<sup>−</sup> and H<sup>+</sup>. depends on the Fermi energy. Considering the band gap of brookite, which was measured as 3.35 eV, one can clearly conclude that H<sup>+</sup> always has the lowest formation energy throughout the bandgap (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). Therefore, when hydrogen atoms are doped into brookite, they act as electron donors and oxidize to H<sup>+</sup> states.

From the band structures, we can find that the bandgap of the interstitially doped brookite is narrowed down, from 3.20 to 3.09 eV. The narrowed bandgap of the doped brookite results from the deformation of crystal structure in the course of the structural relaxation. The strong O-H bonds were formed by the interstitial doping; and after the relaxation, the configuration of crystal structures was changed. The changed bond length and angle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Table S1</xref>) caused by the doping consequently led to a narrower bandgap. On the contrary, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figures S3 and S4</xref>, the substitutionally doped brookite shows a high Fermi level and similar bandgap compared with brookite. <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows that H<sup>+</sup> has the lowest formation energy when they doped into substitutional sites, thereby acting as an electron donor in the sites, and it leads to an increased electron density and a high Fermi level.

Because brookite is difficult to synthesize, no single study has previously reported the properties of doped brookite. We successfully fabricated high-quality single crystalline brookite nanobullet arrays via a hydrothermal method and doped the brookite nanostructure with hydrogen for the first time. H:brookite shows excellent stability and enhanced photocurrent and can split water into hydrogen and oxygen gas with extremely high efficiency. We performed extensive analysis to elucidate doping effect. After hydrogen doping, the following were observed: (1) narrowed bandgap of H:brookite, as confirmed by DRS and IPCE tests, thus enabling utilization of the longer wavelength region of visible light and (2) increased electron density of H:brookite, as proved by the Mott-Schottky plot, due to increased number of electron donors caused by interstitially doped hydrogen. The <italic>ab initio</italic> prediction based on the DFT calculations further supports the experimental findings. The narrowed bandgap of the H:brookite was confirmed by the DOS and band-structure calculations.
