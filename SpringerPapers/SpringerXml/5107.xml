Compared with the traditional methods, the vacuum activation involves a low temperature and low-costing, which can achieve the reduction of GO, the self doping of Ti<sup>3+</sup> in TiO<sub>2</sub> and the loading of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles on GR surface at the same time. These resulting TiO<sub>2</sub>-graphene composites show the high photodegradation rate of MO, high hydrogen evolution activity and excellent IPCE in the visible light irradiation. The facile vacuum activation method can provide an effective and practical approach to improve the performance of TiO<sub>2</sub>-graphene and other metal oxides-graphene towards their practical photocatalytic applications.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>10933</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>26</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep08591.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>15</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep08591" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep08591</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nanoscaled TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalyst has attracted much more attention due to its stable chemical and physical property, lower cost and excellent photocatalytic performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, the broad bandgap of TiO<sub>2</sub> seriously restrains its practical application in the area of full-wavelength of solar spectrum. Recently, graphene (GR) is used as an ideal supporter to load with TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles, due to the excellent conductive properties, mechanical properties and chemical stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Although the TiO<sub>2</sub>-graphene has become a new photocatalyst with efficient photoactivity, there are also some problems on this novel photocatalytic composites, such as the origin of its visible light response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. And another problem is the choosing of the appropriate reductant using for the reduction of GO. Hydrazine hydrate is widely used as the reductant in application of the reduction of GO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, but it has high-toxicity and is easy to cause the secondary pollution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. As a nontoxic reductant, alcohols are also usually used to reduce the GO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Its reducing capacity is relatively weak, which can only reduce the epoxy groups in GO. The hydroxy and carboxyl groups are difficult to be reduced by the alcohols. Actually, the GR obtained by the alcohol reduction is the intermediate and transition state, whose structure and property are falling in between the GO and the entirely reduced GR. Most importantly, the wet chemical reduction method can easily introduce some impurities. Hence, it is necessary to develop a clean technology for the reduction of GO, which becomes a research hotspot on the studying of graphene-semiconductor composites.</p><p>Herein, we developed a one-step vacuum activation method to achieve the reduction of GO, the self doping of Ti<sup>3+</sup> in TiO<sub>2</sub> and the loading of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles on GR surface at the same time. The GO and the commercial P25 were mixed together and activated in vacuum at 300°C for 3 hours. The obtained composites were denoted as “V-P25/nGR” (“V” indicates the vacuum activation; “n” indicates the volume of GO, n = 0.02, 0.05, 0.10, 0.50, 1.0 mL). For comparison, The pure P25 heated in vacuum without the addition of GO was denoted as V-P25. The vacuum activated GR and vacuum activated P25 were mixed together by the mechanical mixing method, which was denoted as the “M-P25/0.10GR” (“M” indicates the mechanical mixing process). H-P25/0.5GR (“H” indicates the hydrothermal process) was prepared through a hydrothermal method.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The earthy yellow GO was heated at 300°C in vacuum for 3 h to obtain the black reduced GR and its TEM spectrum in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S1</xref> indicated that the GR still keeps the large two-dimensional structure after the vacuum activation. XRD patterns and C1s XPS spectra are given to demonstrate the reduction of GO in the one-step vacuum activation process. After heated in vacuum, the characteristic peak for GO shifts from 10.2° to 16.7° (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>), which indicates the reduction of GO to obtain GR. The peak at a small angle of 16.7° is indicative of GR with lower crystallinity and some defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Except the introducing impurity of C-C (284.4 eV), there are major four fitting peaks in the C1s XPS spectrum of GO (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). The peaks at 283.7, 285.7, 286.8 and 288.7 eV are ascribed to the skeleton C = C, the surface C-OH, the surface epoxy group of C-O-C and the surface carboxyl group of C = O respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. After treatment of the vacuum activation, the peaks of C-OH, C-O-C and C = O on GO have a distinct decrease, resulting from the reduction of GO in the vacuum heating process. This result is consistent with our previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Different from the wet reduction process involving the reductants of hydrazine hydrate and ethanol, vacuum activation is a nontoxic and highly reduction degree technology, which can reduce the surface hydroxyl group, epoxy group and carboxyl group, simultaneously.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>XRD patterns and XPS analysis of samples.</p><p>XRD (a) patterns and C1s XPS (b) spectra for the GO before and after vacuum activation.

The large two-dimensional structure of GO is cut into a small size of GR with lamellar structure. Compared with the morphology of blank GR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S1b</xref>), the decrease of dimensions of GR after loading with P25 indicates that the interaction between TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles and GR not only can promote the transportation and separation efficiency of photoexcited charge carriers, but also cut the large GR into small pieces to form the nanosheets. Before vacuum activation treatment, the TiO<sub>2</sub> are loaded on the surface of large sheet of GO (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>), however, after the vacuum activation, the nanoparticles are composited with some smaller sized GR sheets (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). In order to overcome the localised analysis of TEM characteriztion, we randomly chose a location to observe the mophology of V-P25/0.10GR, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S1c,d</xref>. There are some obvious smaller sized GR sheets existence in the composite of V-P25/0.10GR after vacuum activation, which indicates the "cutting" of large GO sheets into smaller size during the vacuum activation treatment. In order to investigate the interaction between TiO<sub>2</sub> and GR, some other characterizations are also provided. The G band in the Raman spectrum of V-P25/0.10GR exhibits a distinct decrease from 1610.7 to 1598.7 cm<sup>−1</sup>, indicating the reduction of GO to GR in the vacuum activation process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S2</xref>). The obvious increase of the intensity ratio of D/G bands after vacuum activation treatment confirms the reduction of GO and the cutting of large GO sheets into smaller sized GR sheets (from 0.91 to 1.10). The smaller GR sheets should contain higher density of edge carbon (associated with the defect D band), which induces the increase of the intensity ratio of D/G bands. The characteristic peaks of TiO<sub>2</sub> in XRD patterns of V-P25/nGR are still changeless (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>), which suggests the mild process of vacuum activation technology with few effects on the crystal form of P25. It is a remarkable fact that the peak assigned to GR is changing from 16.7° to 18.0° after loading with TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles. The shift may be resulted from the existence of chemical connection between TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles and GR surface carbon groups. In our previous work, we have found that the macro-residual stress induced by the foreign impurity of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles can give a macro-residual stress to the GR and cause the anisotropic lattice contraction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, which is the reason for the cutting of large GR into small pieces. When the macro-residual stress is the pressure stress, the diffraction peaks will shift to the high angle, whereas the tensile stresses will make the diffraction peaks shift to the low angle. The loading of TiO<sub>2</sub> on GR surface exhibits a distinct pressure stress, which leads to the characteristic peak of GR changing from 16.7° to 18.0°. The C1s XPS spectra also indicate the existence of chemical binding between TiO<sub>2</sub> and GR (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>). Compared with the blank GR, the two new peaks at 282.5 and 285.5 eV are ascribed to the O-Ti-C and Ti-O-C respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, accompanying with a relative decrease of characteristic peak of C-O-C after loading with the P25 nanoparticles. In addition, the Ti2p XPS spectra (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>) shows that the Ti2p<sub>3/2</sub> peak of V-P25/0.1GR shifts from 458.6 eV to a lower binding energy owing to the increasement of the electron density of Ti atom in TiO<sub>2</sub>, suggesting the existence of Ti-O-C bonds on the surface of TiO<sub>2</sub>. Moreover, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref> shows the FIRT spectra of the V-P25/0.1GR and P25, respectively. For V-P25/0.1GR, the small peak around 628 cm<sup>−1</sup> is assigned to the vibration of Ti-O-Ti bonds and the peak at 798 cm<sup>−1</sup> is corresponded to the the vibration of Ti-O-C bonds. Besides, the peak around 1726 cm<sup>−1</sup> is assigned to C = O stretching of the residual COOH groups. However, pure P25 only shows a small peak at 628 cm<sup>−1</sup> at low frequency (below 1000 cm<sup>−1</sup>), which is corresponded to the vibration of Ti-O-Ti bonds. The above results further confirm the existence of Ti-O-C bonds and the reduction of GO. Different with our previous work for the preparation of the composite of P25/boron doped GR by a stirring-ultraphonic method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, the P25/GR prepared by the vacuum activation is beneficial to the formation of O-Ti-C bonds between P25 and GR, which are expected to narrow the bandgap of TiO<sub>2</sub>. It can be deduce that the –OH on TiO<sub>2</sub> surface is reacting with the C-O-C groups on GO surface to form the Ti-O-C and O-Ti-C bonds in the vacuum activation process. These new bonds will introduce a distinct pressure stress on GR surface to divide the large scaled GR sheet into smaller pieces, as shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>. Much more exposed edges on GR can give a fringe effect and facilitate the further modification on the edge of GR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Hence, the interaction force between GR and TiO<sub>2</sub> is a chemical interaction, which can divide the large scaled GR into small pieces and provide a new approach to synthesize GR nanosheet. This chemical interaction also can supply a transmission electron bridge between TiO<sub>2</sub> and GR.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>TEM images for different samples.</p><p>TEM spectra for the V-P25/0.10GR before (a) and after (b) vacuum activation.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep08591_Fig2_HTML.jpg"/></fig><fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>XRD, XPS, FTIR, EPR and UV-DRS analysis of different samples.</p><p>XRD patterns for the TiO<sub>2</sub>-Graphene composites (a); C1s XPS spectra for the GR with and without P25 loading (b); Ti2p XPS spectra for pure P25 and V-P25/0.10GR (c); FTIR spectra of pure P25 and V-P25/0.10GR (d); EPR spectra for the composite after vacuum activation (e); UV-DRS spectra for the TiO<sub>2</sub>-Graphene composites (f).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep08591_Fig3_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>In addition to the reduction of GO and the generation of new bonds at the interface of TiO<sub>2</sub> and GR, the Ti<sup>3+</sup> self-doping modification on TiO<sub>2</sub> also can be achieved at the same time by the one-step vacuum activation method. Our previous reports have confirmed that the low temperature vacuum activation method is an effective technology to produce stable active Ti<sup>3+</sup> in TiO<sub>2</sub> bulk, which could enhance the visible light absorption of TiO<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The EPR spectrum for V-P25/0.10GR shows a very strong signal at g = 1.99, indicating the generation of Ti<sup>3+</sup>, while no signal is observed for the pure P25 (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref>). The Ti<sup>3+</sup> is responsible for the enhancing absorption of V-P25 in the visible light region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, as shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3f</xref>. The composites of Ti<sup>3+</sup> self-doped TiO<sub>2</sub> loaded with GR exhibit a strong red shift of absorption band. Compared with vacuum activated composites, the M-P25/0.10GR prepared by the mechanical mixing method only shows an obvious visible light absorption, but its absorption band does not change too much. There is also changeless for the absorption band of V-P25/1.0GR before vacuum activation, indicating that the vacuum heating process plays an important role in the narrowing of bandgap of TiO<sub>2</sub>. Kubelka-Munk function is used as the vertical axis and plotted against photon energy, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S3</xref>. The corresponding band energies of different composites obtained from <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S3</xref> are shown in <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. A little decrease band energy of V-P25 from 3.03 eV to 3.01 eV is induced by the formation of Ti<sup>3+</sup> local state inside the TiO<sub>2</sub> band gap. After P25 loading on GR surface through a vacuum activation method, its band gap has been reduced to 2.96 eV, which results from the formation of some surface shallow defect states in TiO<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Several groups have reported that various composite synthesis techniques result in the formation of Ti-O-C and O-Ti-C bonds which cause a red-shift of the TiO<sub>2</sub> absorption band edge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Ti-O-C and O-Ti-C bonds have the same effect on TiO<sub>2</sub> as impurities: they introduce defect states into the TiO<sub>2</sub> band gap, allowing the photogeneration of electrons from lower-energy photons. However, the band energy of M-P25/0.10GR being similar with the pure P25 suggests the mechanical mixing is only a physical process, which is difficult to give an obvious reduction of the bandgap of TiO<sub>2</sub>.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The band energies of different samples</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="justify"><p>Samples</p></th><th align="center"><p>P25</p></th><th align="center"><p>V-P25</p></th><th align="center"><p>V-P25/1.0GR</p></th><th align="center"><p>M-P25/0.10GR</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><p>Band Energy (eV)</p></td><td align="center"><p>3.03</p></td><td align="center"><p>3.01</p></td><td align="center"><p>2.96</p></td><td align="center"><p>3.04</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>All the TiO<sub>2</sub>-graphene composites show an excellent adsorption capacity of MO in the dark because of the π-π conjugation accumulation effect between GR and dyes (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. And the adsorption rate is increasing with the increase of GR added. However, with the increase of GR addition, the photodegradation rate of MO over P25-graphene composites in the visible light irradiation increased first and then decreases obviously (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>). When the GR addition amount is 0.05 mL, the corresponding catalyst has the optimal photocatalytic activity. Analogous activity trend for photodegradation of methylene blue (MB), is also observed over the P25-GR nanocomposites in some other previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. The catalyst of M-P25/0.10GR prepared by the mechanical mixing method also has a high adsorption capacity, but its photocatalytic activity is much lower than that of V-P25/0.10GR. This result indicates that the interaction between TiO<sub>2</sub> and GR plays an important role in the enhancing of visible light photoactivity.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Photocatalytic activities of different samples.</p><p>Adsorption capacities of MO on different samples (a); Visible light photocatalytic activities of different samples (b).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep08591_Fig4_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>We also studied the photocatalytic activity of P25 and V-P25/0.5GR nanocomposites in hydrogen evolution, using Pt as a co-catalyst under visible light irradiation (λ &gt; 400 nm) (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). P25 exhibits a moderate hydrogen evolution rate of 200 μmol·h<sup>−1</sup>, whereas V-P25/0.5GR nanocomposite shows an obviously increased hydrogen evolution rate of 400 μmol·h<sup>−1</sup>, which is around two times higher than that of P25. Moreover, the production of H<sub>2</sub> increased steadily with irradiation time, without inactivation after five cycles. These experiments results indeed prove the stability of the structure and reactivity of V-P25/GR. Meanwhile, these results indicate the potential application and promising prospect of V-P25/GR composites in photocatalytic devices.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Photocatalytic H<sub>2</sub> evolution.</p><p>Photocatalytic H<sub>2</sub> evolution performance and stability test on V-P25/0.5GR and P25 under visible light irradiation (λ &gt; 400 nm).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep08591_Fig5_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>Next, we have used the photoelectrochemistry to characterize the lifetime and transfer rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. The transient photocurrent response measurements exhibits the photocurrent of V-P25/0.5GR is much higher than that of P25, P25/GO or V-P25 (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a</xref>), testifying the low efficiency of recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs in the V-P25/0.5GR, that is, vacuum activation process and graphene addition can greatly promote the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. We have also noticed that the IPCE in the UV-visible light region for V-P25/0.5GR is significantly higher than that of other samples (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b</xref>). Even under the illumination at the wavelength of 550 nm, the IPCE for V-P25/0.5GR still remains at the value of ~2. The catalyst of H-P25/0.5GR prepared by the hydrothermal method presents a lower IPCE than V-P25/0.5GR. That is, compared with the hydrothermal method, it is well established that more Ti<sup>3+</sup>-dopant through a vacuum activation process leads to better visible light absorbance. This result is also consistent with the result of photoactivity. Meanwhile, it deserves to be mentioned that the value of IPCE for V-P25/0.5GR is up to ~16.5% under the illumination of at the wavelength of 300 nm. This outstanding IPCE of V-P25/0.5GR is ascribed to the reduction of GO, the self-doping of Ti<sup>3+</sup> and the loading of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles on GR surface. The excellent IPCE of V-P25/0.5GR indicates its large application potential in solar cell.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Photoelectrochemical Tests.</p><p>Transient photocurrent responses for different samples under the simulated solar light irradiation (a); Incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of different samples under different wavelength illumination (b).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep08591_Fig6_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>In the one-step vacuum activation process, there are major three modifications occurring at one time: 1) the reduction of GO to GR; 2) the formation of Ti-O-C and O-Ti-C structures; 3) the self-doping of Ti<sup>3+</sup>. The produced Ti<sup>3+</sup> could introduce some local states inside the band gap of TiO<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, as shown in <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>. These states will narrow the bandgap of TiO<sub>2</sub> and benefit to the separation of photo-generated electrons and holes, which is the reason for the higher photoactivity of V-P25. The Ti-O-C and O-Ti-C structures could introduce some shallow trap states at the surface or intersurface of TiO<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> and further narrow the TiO<sub>2</sub> bandgap from 3.03 eV to 2.96 eV (<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This providential decrease of bandgap can increase the light absorption of TiO<sub>2</sub>/GR composite in the visible light region without significant decreasing the reducing power of electrons in TiO<sub>2</sub> and GR sheets. In addition, the introduction of shallow trap states can improve the transfer efficiency of electrons between TiO<sub>2</sub> and GR, which will enhance the life-times of photogenerated carriers. Thereby, the V-P25/0.5GR has an enhanced hydrogen evolution capacity in the visible light irradiation. The chemical bonds also can provide a transmission bridge to efficiently transfer the electrons from TiO<sub>2</sub> to GR. The reduction of GO could promote the electrical conductivity of GR and improve the transfer efficiency of photo-electrons from TiO<sub>2</sub> to GR. The electrons on GR surface will produce a large number of active species such as ·O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> to degrade the dye pollutants. Certainly, the electrons on GR also can directly split water to produce H<sub>2</sub> under the visible light irradiation. Seen from the <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>, the MO molecules prefer to be adsorbed on the surface of GR sheets, which means the active species on the surface of GR play an important role in the degradation of MO under the visible light irradiation. On the other hand, we cannot completely eliminate the dye photosensitization in the photodegradation of MO. Under the visible light irradiation, the adsorbed MO molecules also can generate the electrons and transfer them to the GR sheets, which will increase the number of active species of ·O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> to degrade the dye pollutants. Simultaneously, in the photo-degradation of MO, the absence of sacrificial hole scavenger promotes the collective holes on TiO<sub>2</sub> VB reacting with H<sub>2</sub>O molecules to generate many mobile free OH radicals (<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). A large number of generated mobile free OH radicals are also beneficial to the photocatalytic activity of V-P25/GR for the degradation of MO under the visible light irradiation.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic representation of the Photocatalytic reaction.</p><p>Band structure model for Ti<sup>3+</sup> self-doped TiO<sub>2</sub>-Graphene composite and schematic diagram of photo-excited electrons transfer among Ti<sup>3+</sup> doped TiO<sub>2</sub> and GR sheets.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep08591_Fig7_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>The above mentioned synergistic effect among Ti<sup>3+</sup> doping, new bonds generation and the reduction of GO is the reason for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of V-P25/nGR. To the sample of M-P25/0.10GR, the decrease of Ti-O-C and O-Ti-C bonds makes the photo-excited electrons only localized on the TiO<sub>2</sub> surface, which cannot transfer from TiO<sub>2</sub> to GR. The lower transfer efficiency of electrons leads to the lower photocatalytic activity of M-P25/0.10GR, which makes the photodegradation rate much lower than V-P25/0.10GR (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, a one-step vacuum activation method was exploited to successfully prepare the Ti<sup>3+</sup> self-doped TiO<sub>2</sub>-graphene composites. The reduction of GO, the self-doping of Ti<sup>3+</sup> and the loading of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles on GR surface were achieved at the same time. The loading of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles could produce a pressure stress on GR surface to divide the large scaled GR sheet into small pieces, which could expose much more edges to give a fringe effect and facilitate the further modification on the edges. The synergistic effect among Ti<sup>3+</sup> doping, new interface bonds generation and GO reduction are responsible for the high photodegradation rate of MO and high hydrogen evolution rate in the visible light irradiation, which supplied an economic and powerful way in environmental cleaning. The high photocatalytic activity and IPCE of V-P25/nGR suggest its large application potential in energy development and solar cell.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Preparation of GO and blank GR</title><p>Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized from natural graphite powder using a modified Hummers methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.
