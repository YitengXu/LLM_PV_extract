This has led to the increase in interest in biofuels, especially third-generation biofuels produced from microalgae since they do not compete with food and land supplies. However, the global share for these biofuels has been inadequate recently, especially due to the ongoing global pandemic. Therefore, this paper offers a review of the state-of-the-art study of the production field of third-generation biofuel from microalgae. The current review aims to focus on the different aspects of algal biofuel production that requires further attention to produce it at a large scale. It was found that several strategies during the life cycle of algal biofuel production can significantly increase its quality and yield while reducing cost, energy, and other related attributes. This paper also focuses on the challenges for large-scale production of third-generation biofuels pre and post COVID-19 to better understand the barriers. The high cost of this fuel’s production and sale tends to be the major reason behind the lack of large-scale production, hence, inadequacy to meet the global need. Third-generation biofuel has so much to offer including many integrated applications and advanced uses in the future fuel industry. Therefore, it is important to cope with the ongoing circumstances and emphasize the future of algal biofuel as a sustainable source.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Algal biomass</kwd><kwd>Biofuel</kwd><kwd>Renewable energy</kwd><kwd>Biodiesel</kwd><kwd>Third-generation biofuel</kwd><kwd>Advanced biofuel</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>Green recovery</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>19</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/12667_2022_Article_514.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>ReviewPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy Policy, Economics and Management</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Operations Research/Decision Theory</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Optimization</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy Systems</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">We are currently living through a dynamic phase of civilization where technological advancement has made drastic shifts in our lives. The rapid growth of industries, transport systems, and types of machinery leads to a leisurely lifestyle, but they are costing us greatly by depleting the earth’s natural resources. The extensive use of fossil fuels and various human activities are the primary causes of the depletion of resources and the global climate crisis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A recent journal article reported that 87% of the global CO<sub>2</sub> emission is resulted from using fossil fuels, in which coal, oil, and natural gas contribute 43%, 36%, and 20% respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Specifically, transport systems are accountable for about one-third of the global energy usage, half of which is related to oil. As the world's human population is expected to increase, which will cause a 40% rise in the usage of fossil fuels in the years 2040–2050 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. According to a report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), around 2 billion vehicles will be on roads in the year 2020, along with the increment in global carbon emission by aviation which alone contributes 3% of the total emission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Therefore, alternative energy sources like solar, wind, and biomass are in high demand to fulfill global energy requirements.</p><p id="Par3">Bioenergy is the oldest known form of renewable energy produced from organic matter, called biomass which is the key for producing biofuels. Initially, biomass is divided into conventional and renewable resources, or feedstocks (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Renewable biomass is then branched into generations depending on the type of feedstocks. First and second-generation biomass includes food and waste crops such as rice, wheat, sugarcane, barley and their straws, and husks, cultivated energy crops such as woody crops, forest residues, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Currently, a major portion of biofuels is derived from these biomasses, especially from palm oil, corn, and soybean oil. First and second-generation feedstocks require a huge amount of arable lands along with state subsidies and other resource consumption which conflicts with the world’s food production. For example, The US biofuel industry highly depends on agricultural products as their biofuel feedstock, which required 24% of their total cropland to meet half of the transport fuel necessity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In this regard, third-generation biofuels, with algae as the feedstock, have been thought to have huge potential to meet future biofuel demands without compromising arable lands and food sources. Particularly, algal biomass is considered a promising candidate for its higher oil contents than oil crops, which exceeds almost 60–70% of the dry weight of biomass in some species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Microalgae have a very high growth rate where it takes only a few days to complete its entire growth cycle and high photosynthetic abilities compared to plants. Biomass production of microalgae is also almost 5–10 times more than terrestrial plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Moreover, higher adaptability to different environmental situations enables microalgal cultivation independent of fertile lands. <italic>Spirulina</italic> for example can be cultivated in both closed PBR or open-pond systems, therefore, requires less area. Its biomass concentration can double every 2–5 days and yield 20–400 times more protein compared to many food sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, microalgal biomass can be considered as a better renewable source of biofuel feedstock. Furthermore, growth conditions for some algal species can also be engineered to maximize their oil content. The biomass leftovers after oil extraction can be used as animal feed, which makes it economically beneficial for mass production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Furthermore, the microalgal efficiency of photosynthesis is high, converting 3–8% of solar energy during the process, which is only 0.5% in terrestrial crops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In addition to being a sustainable feedstock, they can also contribute to CO<sub>2</sub> and nutrient fixation, wastewater treatment, resulting in wide scope for third-generation biofuels to take over conventional fuels.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Classification of biomass into generations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/12667_2022_514_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par4">With the outbreak of the COVID-19, the world has undergone a significant economic crisis, facing a sharp drop in fuel demand and price. Moreover, global precautionary measures have also affected the agricultural practices and transportation of feedstocks, reducing the production of biofuels. Various sustainable organizations worldwide have already started strategies to utilize this situation to shift the global energy and fuel to renewables. Therefore, effective actions are highly needed to develop third-generation biofuel production and gradually promote them to replace the previous generation feedstocks. The importance and scope of biofuels derived from algal biomass have been studied previously in numerous works of literature. This paper aims to study those works of research and analyze the current state amidst COVID-19 to review the prospects of third-generation biofuels.</p><p id="Par5">The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">2</xref> explores the present status of third-generation biofuel production from algal biomass. The existing technologies for cultivation, harvest, and other applications of algal biomass will be discussed in Sect. <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">3</xref>. In Sects. <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">4</xref>, and <xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec">5</xref>, the life cycle assessment of third-generation biofuels in terms of cost, water, and CO<sub>2</sub> footprints and energy footprint is discussed followed by future scopes and challenges. Next, these scopes and challenges for the algal biofuel will be assessed through a keen review of the pre-and post- COVID-19 status of the global biofuel sector in Sects. <xref rid="Sec20" ref-type="sec">6</xref>, and <xref rid="Sec21" ref-type="sec">7</xref>. Furthermore, future scopes and recommendations for third-generation biofuels will be provided based on the reviewed prospects, considering the earlier sections of the paper are discussed in Sect. <xref rid="Sec25" ref-type="sec">8</xref>. Finally, Sect. <xref rid="Sec26" ref-type="sec">9</xref> concludes the paper.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Algal biomass and their conversions to third-generation biofuels</title><p id="Par6">Algae are aquatic organisms that take CO<sub>2</sub> from the air and convert it into oxygen as well as possess oil through their cell structure breakdown due to the high amount of lipids present in them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In comparison to land plants, algae have higher photosynthesis levels and high growth rates along with high CO<sub>2</sub> sequestering efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. They can be either unicellular (Microalgae) or multicellular (Macroalgae). Being the third-generation biomass, microalgae is the one that is used mostly in conversion processes as they contain more lipids than macroalgae and have faster growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Most species of macroalgae contain lipids less than 5% of their dry weight and can go a maximum of 20% in a specific species call <italic>Dictyotales</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. On the contrary, a normal range of lipid content in microalgae is 20–50% of the dry weight and can reach as high as 80% under specific conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Apart from lipids, proteins and carbohydrates are the other two main components of algal biomass that can be converted into various by-products, like animal feed, supplements, or biofertilizers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Major components of microalgae and their products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/12667_2022_514_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par7">Biofuels have a long history of being utilized in transport, power, and energy, so as the use of algae. Production of methane gas from algae was proposed in the 1950s which received attention in the 70s during the energy crisis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Later, the Aquatic Species Program (ASP) supported by the US Department of Energy invested in the goal of producing oil from microalgae between 1980 and 1996, and commercialization for their fatty acids and lipid contents began in the mid-1900s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Algal biomass can also be converted into various third-generation biofuels and other by-products through mainly three types of processes: biochemical, thermochemical, and chemical, utilizing a series of conversion methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Bioethanol: Production of bioethanol by fermenting crops dates back to the 1800s when the oil crisis led bioethanol to be mixed with petrol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. According to a 2018 report, The US accounts for 56% of global ethanol production, the majority of which is produced from first and second-generation feedstocks like maize, sugarcane, and corn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. But considering algae as the biomass, they can produce ethanol two times higher than sugarcane and five times higher than corn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Being low in energy consumption, the pre-treatment of bioethanol is an efficient process to produce bioethanol. Many works of literature developed suggested algae as a promising resource for bioethanol production and can replace food and energy crops.</p><p id="Par9">Biogas: Another ancient use of biomass for using as fuel is the production of biogas for heating purposes. Biogas is also highly used for electricity generation and its usage has been increasing exponentially since the year 2000. Based on a report by International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the cumulative electricity generated by biogas was 13,185 GWh in 2000, which raised to 88,378 GWh in 2018 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Several works of literature over the years have found algae to be an efficient feedstock for biogas production, Marine algae, especially seaweeds, are getting remarkable attention for the production of biogas due to their high amount of polysaccharides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Biogas from algae is produced through various stages of anaerobic transformation. According to a study done by the International Energy Agency (IEA) Bioenergy, biogas from algae (seaweed) can reach up to 20,800 m<sup>3</sup>/ha per annum, compared to terrestrial crops yielding a maximum of 6624 m<sup>3</sup>/ha per annum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Current methods of algal biogas production still have major potentials for development due to a few limitations like land area for seaweed cultivations, water footprint, etc.</p><p id="Par10">Biodiesel: Biodiesel is the most significant biofuel at present which has been produced and studied widely for development. The first-ever biodiesel was used in the 1890s by Rudolf Diesel who used vegetable oil, which continued its trend after the fossil fuel crisis in the 1930s. From the 1970s onwards there have been more researches and developments in the field of biodiesel from biomass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Biodiesel from algae started to be researched and adopted from the 1978–1996 period which was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Fuels Development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Although the global biodiesel industry depends on second-generation biomass, the need for a huge amount of arable lands along with state subsidies has created a challenge to meet their consumption requirements. Researchers have found a wide range of advantages of third-generation biodiesel as algal biomass has a high growth rate and oil productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Thus, algal biomass offers a favorable and sustainable solution for issues related to previous generation biomasses.</p><p id="Par11">There are other biofuels derived from algal biomass such as biohydrogen, bio-oil<italic>,</italic> and syngas, whose contributions are minimal to the overall global production. Algal biohydrogen is a common product in recent years as gaseous fuel or generating electricity. It is usually produced through processes like bio photolysis, where water separates into hydrogen and oxygen molecules in the algal biomass in the presence of light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and photo fermentation, a process of hydrogen production from biomass containing organic acids with the help of sunlight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Although, compared to terrestrial plants, biohydrogen yield from algae is low. Thus, to make algal biohydrogen useful in the future, pre-treatment methods are needed to be implemented. Recent studies are also focusing on optimizing enzymatic reactions to produce better biohydrogen yield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Bio-oil and syngas on the other hand are products obtained from various thermochemical conversion routes, like pyrolysis, combustion, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), or gasification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, crude bio-oil cannot be used directly as fuel due to high viscosity, high corrosiveness, and the presence of water, oxygen, and other unsaturated contents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Hence, several steps and treatments can improve their quality, such as fluidized fast pyrolysis for higher yields. For instance, fast pyrolysis of <italic>Chlorella protothecoides</italic> was found to result in the highest 57.9% yield of bio-oil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].On the other hand, syngas is produced by oxidation at high temperatures and can be used directly as fuel or in gas turbines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Third-generation biofuels have been found by researchers as a remarkable feedstock for biofuel productions than first and second-generation feedstocks. However, it was found after reviewing several works of literature that the technologies for algal biofuel, especially the cultivation and harvesting processes are still required to be developed. Currently, bioethanol and biodiesel are the main biofuels that are produced globally. According to a report published by IEA showing the trend from 2017 to 2020, the production of bioethanol and biodiesel stayed stable which is 1.2–1.3 mb/day and 0.6–08 mb/day respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. While third-generation biofuels from algal biomass possess great potential for contribution, other aspects of their production need to be explored to identify the barriers to commercialization and scopes of improvement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Current technologies for algal cultivation and harvesting</title><p id="Par13">The latest technology for algal biofuel production involves algal cultivation, harvest, drying, extraction of oil, and transesterification to convert algal oil to biodiesel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These cultivation methods vary according to the type, quality, and commercial value of the biofuel that will be produced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Thus, algae harvesting processes for biofuel production have major significance.</p><p id="Par14">Microalgae being very small in size are usually cultivated by immersing into the water which is checked for important parameters, such as temperature, pH level, CO<sub>2</sub> level, nutrients, and amount of light penetrating the water body and photoperiod. Matured microalgae are then harvested using various mechanical, biological, and chemical-based systems and dried to produce the biomass feedstock for further conversion procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Likewise, transesterification can, in turn, be of two types, direct and conventional. In-direct or in-situ transesterification simultaneous extraction of lipid takes place in a single stage, eliminating any form of pre-treatments. It yields more biodiesel compared to the conventional type and is of significance in the further development field. The conventional method, however, is two-staged because they include a mechanical process before the lipid extraction. This method is time-consuming and consumes more energy due to pre-treatment steps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Algal biomass cultivation</title><p id="Par15">Currently, the algal cultivation method can be mainly photoautotrophic and heterotrophic, among which the photoautotrophic method is of two types, open and closed systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Open systems are simple and low-cost cultivation methods as they include the oldest and natural systems such as ponds, lakes, lagoons, etc. (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This cultivation system utilizes atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. The location of the open pond is the key as the amount of sunlight received depends on it. Light, water temperature, and evaporation are some of the main factors affecting this system since unregulated temperature, lack of sufficient light penetration, evaporation loss, contamination, etc. are some challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Since the cultivation process in the open pond system can be done in any suitable open surrounding, it is way cheaper to construct than photobioreactors. However, this system yields very little algal biomass, ranging from 0.02 to 0.20 mg/l/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. On the other hand, closed systems, also known as photobioreactors (PBRs) are high yield-controlled systems that allow the maximum amount of light and mixing of the system according to the biofuel requirements. They are mostly designed with transparent materials such as plastic or glass to allow the light to penetrate and are of various shapes, such as flat plate, tubular, vertical column, bubble column, etc. (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Auxiliary tanks are used to separate excessive oxygen and other highly maintained control systems are incorporated to ensure maximum efficiency, which makes PBRs expensive to set up and hence only used to produce high-quality biofuel rather than bio-oil only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold> Open pond, <bold>b</bold> plate photobioreactor, <bold>c</bold> tubular photobioreactor, and <bold>d</bold> bubble column photobioreactor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/12667_2022_514_Fig3_HTML.jpg" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p id="Par16">Attached growth or biofilm systems are simple, low-cost cultivation that does not require dewatering and is often combined with closed systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Recently, a combination of both closed and open systems has also been established known as a hybrid system which can ensure higher biomass productivity and excessive nutrient removal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These systems are also appropriate for large-scale algae cultivation for commercial purposes. Furthermore, heterotrophic cultivation is another cultivation method mainly for algal species that can survive in the dark and use organic carbon compounds as energy sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These kinds of algal biomass have a high growth rate, high biomass yield, and are cheaper to harvest.

In one of such TEA developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), four different PBRs were analyzed with respect to open systems (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. It was found that all PBR systems cost much higher than open ponds for operations, power generation for mixing, aeration and cooling, and capital cost. However, the annual average productivity of the algal biomass was found to be 25 g/m<sup>2</sup>/day for PBRs, which is double the amount in open ponds cases which yielded only 8–12 g/m<sup>2</sup>/day.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The cultivation area requirement is also less in PBR than in open systems. These results indicate that the cultivation system selection depends on the aimed scale of algal biomass production.

In an experimental study conducted recently, a small pilot-scale tubular PBR was tested against a mesh ultra-thin layer (MUTL) PBR with similar scale. After a series of experiments, the MUTL-PBR was found to yield almost three times the biomass than the tubular PBR, which were 6.6 g/L and 2.1 g/L respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Algal biomass cultivation productivity for various systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/12667_2022_514_Fig4_HTML.png" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p id="Par18">Furthermore, in recent studies, different bioreactors for algal biomass cultivation were explored.

It is challenging due to several factors like cost, proper utilization, and handling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. If the cultivation is done in saline water, the harvesting capital requirement is high. In mass harvesting of algal biomass, flotation, flocculation, and gravity sedimentation methods are used, followed by thickening centrifugation and filtration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Flocculation is a preliminary step for bulk algae harvesting and is suggested to be an excellent method of harvest. This process is done by microbes and chemicals where that flocculant will be algae species-specific, such as cations and its polymers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. During this process, algal cells are negatively charged, and flocculants are added which neutralize surface charge resulting in increased particle size and facilitate aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The flocculation method is suitable for handling large-scale algal cultures with less energy consumption than mechanical separation. Next, the floatation process gets facilitated by air/gas bubbles that get attached by algal cells, resulting in the formation of float on the surface for harvesting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This procedure could either be electrolytic or dispersed air floatation. In electrolytic type could be used in salt water and not applicable for microalgae, for which dispersed flotation is used where the air bubbles could be as tiny as 40 μm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Micro-, Macro and Ultra-filtration are designed to harvest algae of smaller sizes using membranes and pushing thickened liquid through it. It is best suited for delicate algal biomass that requires trans-membrane force and flow speed settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Membrane filtration is economical when compared to flotation but is expensive for large-scale membrane installation and maintenance. On the contrary, gravity sedimentation is a low-efficiency conventional method suitable for large particles and is utilized in wastewater treatment plants.

But, due to the small sizes of algal biomass, other methods are used for effective dryings, such as spray, drum, or freeze-drying methods. These methods are also cost and energy-intensive, therefore, often considered as one of the economical obstacles for the whole process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].

With limited current technologies, algal biomass often seems to be an expensive choice. Large-scale biofuel production from algae needing advanced types of equipment, water, nutrients, and energy is a challenge, especially from a commercial point of view. On the other hand, a variety of steps, like isolation, purification, and other conversion methods tend to be time-consuming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. To consider biofuels being used in current automotive or machine engines, they are required to be compatible with existing petro-fuels. Internationally, certain compatibility standards have been issued, like the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) by the United States and European Nation 14,214 by the European Union [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. If any algal biofuel does not meet these requirements, they are blended with petro-fuels to be used in engines. For example, the currently available B5–B20 blends of biodiesel (derived from microalgae <italic>Streptomyces platensis</italic>) and petrol. Therefore, producing efficient and cost-effective algal biofuel and using them directly in engines is a current challenge that requires further development.</p><p id="Par23">Life-cycle assessment (LCA) is a strong method for assessing various environmental aspects of a particular system and therefore is a significant part of analyzing the proficiency of third-generation biofuels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].

Likewise, various international organizations and research have investigated the LCA of biofuel production from algae. Therefore, in this paper, some of the major aspects are reviewed to get a broad idea of how much the production of third-generation biofuels is efficient following sustainability, energy consumption, and cost.</p><sec id="Sec7"><title>Economic outlook</title><p id="Par24">Cost estimation of algal biofuels is a significant measure to analyze the current status and future scope as a renewable energy source. Several parameters can be evaluated for cost analysis, such as feedstock, cultivation and harvest costs, production cost, energy cost, etc. A study was done by the US Department of Energy (DOE) in 2015 where it was noted that 87% of the total cost of biofuel production was cultivation costs. DOE estimated that 1 ton of dry algal biomass production cost around $1225 in 2015. The cost could be brought down to 60% in 7 years if there is a technological improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This is because algal biofuel selling prices differ based on cultivation systems.</p><p id="Par25">Techno-economic analysis (TEA) has become a significant tool in recent years to study and estimate the economic feasibility of algal biofuels. There are numerous TEAs conducted that integrate various aspects of third-generation biofuels, such as capital and operation costs, cultivation, harvest and production processes, cash flow, and risk assessments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. One of the most widely studied TEA is the cost of open/raceway ponds and the PBRs. It was found that PBR systems are roughly twice more expensive than an open pond, $8.52–$12.73 gal, and $18.10–$32.57 gal respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. A 2012 study revealed that PBR systems dominated in total capital cost are 12.7 times higher than the open pond system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Similarly, cost estimation conducted in a recent study on open ponds and different types of PBRs, the total cost of cultivation is least for the open ponds (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Additionally, operational costs like labor cost, power consumption, water, and nutrient costs are higher in the PBR system. As a result, these expenditure factors affect the final biofuel product extensively. However, in a 2011 study, estimated selling prices for biodiesel from the open pond and closed PRB were $2.97/L and $4.93/L respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Algal biomass selling price is also higher in PBRs, which can go up to $1,737/ton in PBRs and $494/ton in open ponds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Capital cost estimation of algal cultivation for open ponds and different PBRs in TEA model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/12667_2022_514_Fig5_HTML.png" id="MO5"/></fig></p><p id="Par26">Since PBR systems are highly commercialized for algal biomass, their high production costs resulted in increasing the final biofuel product. It was seen that crude oil from algal biomass tends to be expensive progressively. As per a study done in 2011, the production cost of crude oil from algae ranged from $2.87 to $3.51/L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], which increased in 2016, ranging from $4.40 to $4.62/L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is a need for overall improvement in algal biofuel production systems that will decrease capital and operating costs while maintaining the end products’ quality and efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Water footprint</title><p id="Par27">Water is one of the major elements in the cultivation and harvest of algal biomass because of its significant role in maintaining temperature and delivering nutrients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The estimated requirement for producing 1L of biodiesel is said to be 3000L of water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Therefore, major stress is imposed on water resources around the world because of algal biofuel production. The water footprint (WF) of algal biofuel production is calculated considering the direct and indirect usages of freshwater. Freshwater is directly used in the algae culture mediums, cultivation processes, and as makeup water for the losses during harvesting. Indirectly, they are used in operational processes, such as electricity, culture medium circulation, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. According to a study, the WF for algal biomass harvesting for biodiesel is 3726 kg water/kg without reusing the water. Additionally, among all the consumed freshwater, almost 84% is discharged after harvesting, and the remaining is lost through the evaporation or drying process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Hence, if the harvested water is not reused, WF goes very high. It could go down to 591 kg water/kg if 100% harvest water can be recycled. Few recent studies have reported ways of reducing WF in the production of algal biofuels. One such study suggested multiple strategies to reduce freshwater consumption such as recycling the harvested water, alongside using wastewater and seawater in the process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Additionally, this strategy is found to reduce the nutrient requirements by 55% if used wastewater and 90% if used seawater. While using seawater or wastewater can reduce the use of freshwater by 90%, but they cannot replace it. This is due to multiple reasons, such as lower lipid content in marine algae, difficulty in isolation and culture, expensive setup, various harmful components of wastewater [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], etc. Freshwater will still be needed as make-up water for dilution purposes and is also determined by region, climate, and other factors. High-density cultivation can be another method, which states that high biomass productivity species of algae like <italic>Chlorella </italic>sp. and <italic>Spirulina platensis</italic> consume less water than low biomass productivity species. Furthermore, multiple studies have demonstrated that conventional cultivation systems for microalgae consume the most water, and hence making non-suspended growth systems more effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Due to these reasons, biofilm reactors were suggested as a method to reduce WF, since they target wastewater, swine, and dairy effluents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Another strategy to cultivate high-density algal biomass is to use heterotrophic cultivation. This method was proven to increase lipid content in algal biomass by 55%, which creates a high-density situation and thereby reduces water consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">Despite implementing the strategies mentioned above, the WF issue of algal biofuel production is a challenge. This is because while methods like recycling reduce water consumption significantly, the production of biomass reduces in subsequent recycling processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Moreover, non-suspended methods also require special focus for different aspects like nutrients, and maintenance. According to IEA, currently, there is no compliance threshold to include water in the LCA of algal biofuel by the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

Although biofuel ranks lower than the current usage of solar and wind energy, their contribution to future sustainable development cannot be overlooked. Algal biomass has dynamic characteristics for higher growth rate, production of a variety of products along with the ability to carbon capture and wastewater treatment. However, their cultivation, harvest, and production systems still face several difficulties. Researchers have found several ways to make the total system carbon negative with CO<sub>2</sub> mitigation, low-energy consumption with reduced production costs. However, their application on a large-scale basis is still not performed. Current and potential data show that algal biofuels have a major opportunity to replace fossil fuels with increased use in electricity and heating sectors. Although the COVID-19 crisis anticipates an increase in biofuel production and consumption, the cultivation scope of algae for third-generation biofuels is yet to be set clear. Thus, development in making the production of algal biofuels efficient and cost-effective is highly recommended. Regulations and appropriate policies are required to boost the large-scale production of third-generation biofuels to meet future consumption needs. Similarly, co-products like food, fertilizer, animal feeds, pharmaceuticals, and supplements apart from biofuel production could be manufactured using biorefinery concepts. This, in turn, will aid in reducing production costs while significantly also optimizing algal biomass. Being non-competitive with food sources could give algal cultivation a significant advantage in this current situation. Investments and policies are encouraged to be made globally, which will support research development, improve infrastructure for large-scale production, and establish further genetic engineering for advanced algal biofuels.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>Additional declarations for articles in life science journals that report the results of studies involving humans and/or animals (NA).</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>None.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Availability of data and material</title><p>Not applicable.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Code availability</title><p>Not applicable.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement"><title>Declarations</title><sec><title>Conflicts of interest/Competing interests</title><p id="Par55">None.</p></sec></sec><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Raheem</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Prinsen</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Vuppaladadiyam</surname><given-names>AK</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Luque</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">A review on sustainable microalgae based biofuel and bioenergy production: Recent developments</article-title><source>J.
