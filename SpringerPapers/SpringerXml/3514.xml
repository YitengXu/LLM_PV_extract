This article investigates the suitability of coconut shell-derived producer gas (a secondary gaseous biofuel) as a substitute for coal gas from an environmental perspective using life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. Thermochemical gasification in an air-fluidized bed with steam injection is the gaseous fuel production process. LCA is carried out with respect to Indian conditions based on primary and modified Ecoinvent 2.0 data using IMPACT 2002+ environmental impact assessment methodology. The study indicates that coconut shell-derived producer gas life cycle is capable of saving 18.3% of emissions causing global warming potential, 64.1% of emissions causing ozone depletion potential, and 71.5% of nonrenewable energy consumption. The analysis of energy and exergy consumptions of the two life cycles reveal that the renewable fraction in the total energy demand is 62.9% for producer gas life cycle, while it is only 2.8% for coal gas life cycle. Allocation of the by-product, coconut palm residues, is the major responsible factor for this reduction in environmental burden. Based on the existing fertilization practice and the utilization of electricity from the Indian electric grid, substantial green house gas (GHG) emission savings cannot be achieved for producer gas life cycle over coal gas life cycle. However, the green electricity-aided catalytic gasification of coconut shell produced by organic farming can result in 43.4% reduction in GHG emissions, meeting European Union renewable energy directive.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Life cycle assessment</kwd><kwd>Coconut shell</kwd><kwd>Gasification</kwd><kwd>Coal gas</kwd><kwd>Environmental impact</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>45</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2013</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2012</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/40095_2012_Article_42.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Renewable and Green Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1186/2251-6832-4-8" ext-link-type="doi">10.1186/2251-6832-4-8</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a process of evaluating environmental burdens or benefits associated with the total life cycle of a product. This is conducted by identifying and quantifying the energy and materials used and waste products released into the environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is performed in accordance with ISO 14040:2006 and ISO 14044:2006 standards. In simple terms, LCA is a holistic tool for evaluating the environmental impacts associated with a product, process, or activity. The ecological or environmental impacts include effects on the ecosystem, human health, and natural resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Generally, LCA is termed as a ‘cradle to grave’ approach since it accounts the environmental impacts throughout the product's life, right from raw material acquisition, processing, manufacturing, use, and finally its disposal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The significance of LCA lies in the fact that it equips the policy makers and decision makers for adoption of suitable and sustainable energy supply systems. Increasing global concern due to air pollution and to limited oil reserves has generated much interest in environmental friendly alternatives to petroleum-based fuels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This is more prominent in the context of the current substantial contribution of fossil fuels (over 85%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] to the global energy supply. Generally, biofuels produced from renewable energy sources (biomass) are considered to be an effective alternative to fossil fuels, and the concerned production technology is sustainable. To identify savings in energy and emissions from biofuel production and utilization, a thorough evaluation of the corresponding life cycle is to be carried out carefully [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. LCA is an effective tool for this, which accounts for the relative environmental impacts of biofuel life cycle with respect to ‘base case’ such as fossil fuel-based life cycle. For example, for biodiesel, the base case may be petroleum diesel, and for producer gas derived from biomass, the base case may be coal gas. The adoption of LCA in the perspective of sustainable economy is more essential nowadays because of the boom in the installation of energy and heat production systems utilizing these sustainable energy techniques with the intention of meeting European Union (EU) targets of 20% renewable energy share by 2020.</p><p>The updated standard ISO 14044:2006 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] specifies requirements and provides guidelines for life cycle assessment including definition of goal and scope of the LCA, life cycle inventory analysis (LCI) phase, life cycle impact assessment phase, life cycle interpretation phase, reporting critical review of the LCA, limitations of the LCA, relationship between the LCA phases, and conditions for use of value choices and optional elements.</p><p>LCA approach was adopted for assessing the environmental suitability of the utilization of various renewable energy resources such as solar PV, wind, and biomass by Manish et al<italic>.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The base cases considered were coal-based thermal power generation and steam methane reforming for hydrogen production. The comparison of different options was made based on major indicators like life cycle cost, green house gas (GHG) emissions, and net energy ratio (NER). Secondary biofuels produced from unprocessed primary biomass-based materials are sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. Secondary biofuels may be of solid, liquid, or gaseous types which are produced by adopting various production routes. A state-of-the-art review of literature pertaining to liquid biofuels was reported by Nigam and Singh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Producer gas is a secondary gaseous biofuel generated by the thermochemical gasification of biomass. NER and total energy ratio of the life cycle of rice straw-generated producer gas were evaluated by Shie et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A comparison of biomass and coal in terms of several environmental indicators for integrated gasification combined cycles with [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and without [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] CO<sub>2</sub> chemical absorption revealed the superiority of biomass. On further analysis of the potential of biomass to produce hydrogen, Koroneos et al<italic>.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] reported the advantage of biomass gasification-syngas reformation-absorption route over biomass gasification-electricity generation-electrolysis route. Manish et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] on reviewing the LCA studies on gasification with biomass and with biomass-coal blends for electricity generation reported an evident reduction in environmental impacts when biomass is used as energy source. However, the life cycle of biomass-based systems can have higher eutrophication potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and acidifying emission potential. Consequences of using agricultural land for other purposes than food production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and the size and scale of the biomass-based combined heat and power (CHP) plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] are significant factors while utilizing biomass-based systems.</p><p>The choice of selected indicators for LCA can provide options for the improvement of the existing systems. Such a damage assessment based on the existing life cycle of natural gas combustion district heating system at a rural location in British Columbia was conducted by Pa et al<italic>.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] recently. Similar region-specific LCA studies for woodchip-based ‘green electricity generation’ in Austria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], post-consumer wood and forest residue-based gasification in a metropolitan area in Barcelona [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and carbonization of several woody biomass (found plenty in Singapore) to charcoal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] are worth mentioning. The comparatively lesser impacts on global warming, acidification, and eutrophication by the life cycle of biomass thermal technologies over that of biological routes were reported by Zaman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and Zhong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Iribarren et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], on considering biofuel production systems from poplar biomass, stressed on the need for plantation and harvesting of the lignocellulosic biomass in terms of land occupation and fertilizer requirements. The utilization of hydrogen as fuels in vehicles and the progress in fuel cells have necessitated the need for LCA of the concerned hydrogen supply chains. Such analyses were reported for urban transportation with hydrogen vehicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and for hydrogen refueling stations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A comprehensive state-of-the-art review of environmental impacts of hybrid and electric vehicles was reported by Hawkins et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Present study and its significance</title><p>India, one of the biggest agricultural countries in world, is in the process of setting up many large-and medium-scale biomass-based power plants for rural electrification, utilizing locally available feedstocks. Thermochemical gasification is a mature sustainable technology for gaseous fuel production from renewables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The country has declared its commitments to the implementation of clean development mechanism, which is an arrangement under the Kyoto protocol. The abundantly available biomass materials in the subcontinent include eucalyptus wood, rice husk, paddy husk, coconut shell, cashew nut shell, and bamboo. The climatic conditions are not uniform in the country, making it suitable for these agricultural and forest biomass to grow in different parts of the country. For example, in the southern part of India, the most abundantly available biomass feedstock is coconut shell. Thus, utilization of coconut shells for bioenergy production for electrifying rural areas in southern India has significance. The environmental burdens associated with the utilization of these biomasses (and more) are largely different since irrigation schedule (depends on rain fall), fertilization schedule (depends on soil conditions), land requirement, yield of biomass per hectare, and heating value are different for these biomasses. Thus, it is vital to make assessments about various biomass feedstocks suitable for such power plants from an energy and environmental perspective. As a first step in the venture, coconut shell is taken for assessment in the present study, which will be followed by several other probable feedstocks mentioned already. Hence, the present work is a region-specific study for LCA of coconut shell-derived producer gas life cycle in the third largest coconut-producing country in the world. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no work has been reported on a comparative LCA of coconut shell-derived producer gas and coal-derived coal gas with respect to Indian conditions.</p><p>As the world is heading towards hydrogen energy economy, many attempts were reported for enhancing the hydrogen concentration in biomass-derived producer gas for the onward utilization in fuel cells and in hydrogen-fuelled vehicles. Steam reforming the producer gas generated by air-fluidized bed (AFB) gasification is one of the options for achieving this. Syngas (producer gas) can be made further rich in hydrogen by supplying more amount of steam to the AFB gasifier. However, the most common production method of steam utilizes fossil fuels which generate greenhouse gases and ozone-depleting gases, necessitating the optimization of steam utilization. Thus, the present study is significant as a ‘well-to-tank’ LCA approach to make comparison between two solid fuel-hydrogen-rich gaseous fuel life cycles, that is, the life cycles of fossil fuel-derived coal gas and its potential renewable alternative (coconut shell-derived syngas) are compared with respect to India, the world's largest low-ash-content coconut shell producer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Location of the present study</title><p>Kerala, one of the southern states of India, is blessed with abundant rain fall in the range of 2,000 to 3,000 mm/year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The fertile soil conditions in the region are well suited for coconut cultivation. Researches on a variety of coconut palm species have succeeded in developing new hybrids suiting varying conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The specialty of coconut palm is that every part of it has valuable applications, as given in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The major use of coconut shell (main product) is for handicrafts and charcoal, the latter being one of the base materials for the manufacture of activated carbon. Coconut shell is also used as a primary biofuel for open combustion. The co-product (similar revenue to the main product) coconut oil can be used for edible and inedible (lubricant with nanoparticles addition) purposes. The by-product (lower revenue than that of the main product) palm residues find utilization as a fuel with energy content of 16 to 18 MJ/kg. The state is in the process of developing medium-scale gasification plants for rural electrification utilizing coconut shells as feedstocks for the past 2 to 3 years. The present study pertains to the conversion of coconut shell (primary biofuel) to producer gas (secondary biofuel), which has not yet been analyzed in this region on a life cycle basis.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>Products, co-products, and by-products during coconut shell production</bold></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th><p>Category</p></th><th><p>Item</p></th><th><p>Uses</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Product</p></td><td><p>Coconut shell</p></td><td><p>Charcoal, handicrafts, fuel for open combustion</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Co-product</p></td><td><p>Coconut oil</p></td><td><p>Edible oil, lubricant</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4"><p>By-product (coconut palm residues)</p></td><td><p>Petioles and leaf</p></td><td><p>Fuel, hut thatching, organic manure</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Coconut seed cake</p></td><td><p>Cattle feed, organic manure</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Coconut husk</p></td><td><p>Fuel, organic manure, raw material for coir</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Stem</p></td><td><p>Piles, pillars, fuel</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Life cycle inventory analysis</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Goal, scope, and functional unit</title><p>The major objective of the present analysis is to compare the environmental impacts of coconut shell-derived producer gas life cycle with that of the coal gas (generated by the gasification of coal) life cycle.

In this study, contributions of various LCA phases to the overall environmental impacts are analyzed to identify the most significant phase in the life cycle. The reference functional unit for the study is 1 MJ energy content in the gaseous fuel (producer gas generated from coconut shell gasification or coal gas generated from coal gasification).

For fertilizer production, Ecoinvent 2.0 data were modified with respect to Indian electricity generation and transmission.</p><p><italic>Coconut shell gasification.</italic> The technology for gaseous fuel production from solid feedstocks (coal or coconut shell) considered in this study is thermochemical gasification. Producer gas or coal gas with more hydrogen concentration is generated by steam injection into an AFB gasifier as mentioned in the section ‘Present study and its significance’.</p><p>A gasification module is developed for the thermochemical treatment of crushed coconut shell. The producer gas production phase consists of sub-modules such as steam and compressed-air generation, sand preparation for its utilization as bed material, physical infrastructure for the gasification plant, and electric furnace for maintaining the reactor temperature. A carbon conversion efficiency of 100% for gasification is assumed, and the by-products of gasification (tar and ash) are neglected. The energy requirements (data modified with respect to Indian electricity mix) for all the relevant processes such as fertilizer production, coconut crushing, steam and compressed-air production, irrigation, and thermochemical gasification are included while developing the model.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Coal gas life cycle</title><p>Coal gas life cycle is used as the reference system for comparison with that of coconut shell-derived producer gas life cycle. The important sub-modules involved are coal transport from foreign mines, coal mining in India from open and underground mines, transport of Indian and imported coal to regional storage, and gasification of this coal mix to generate coal gas. India is the third biggest hard coal producer (526 million tonne/year) after China (2,971 million tonne/year) and the USA (919 million tonne/year). Eighty-five percent of the total coal utilization in the country is from domestic production, and the remaining 15% is imported from countries like Australia, South Africa, and North America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Out of the domestic production, 85% is from open mining, and the remaining is from underground mining. Major domestic coal mining companies are Coal India Limited, Neyveli Lignite Corporation, and Singareni Collieries Limited. Thus, domestic coal is considered to be mined by these companies at locations in Dhanbad, Neyveli, and Hyderabad, respectively. The study pertains to Calicut, a northern city in Kerala, which is the regional storage location taken for modeling of the transport module for coal (imported and domestic). The mode of transport of coal to regional storage location and the corresponding distances are given in Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>. For coal transport, the Ecoinvent database is modified with respect to Indian electricity consumption for diesel production for fuelling the transport system (rail, road). The transports of the imported coal in other countries are modeled using the respective data source available in the Ecoinvent 2.0 database.

In such cases, it is necessary to divide the environmental impacts from the process between the products. Crude coconut oil and coconut residues are the co-product and by-product, respectively, of coconut shell production process. The utilization of energy in the coconut palm residues (by-product of coconut cultivation stage) and production of coconut oil are two major cases in the present LCA study. The ‘division’ of the environmental impacts may be done either by allocation or by system expansion. According to Gnansounou et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], environmental impacts in a life cycle may even vary with the allocation method (mass, energy, carbon content, or economy) adopted. In this study, system boundary expansion method is adopted for allocating the co-product and by-product.</p><p>Agricultural residues of coconut plantation play a significant role in the energy analysis because of its availability in large quantity and its energy content. As mentioned in ‘Inventory data for coconut cultivation’, palm residues include the leaves and the dried leaf weighing 2 kg/tree on average and have a heating value of 16,500 kJ/kg. The tree density is 175 palm/ha. The thermal energy that can be generated from the palm residues is calculated from its lower heating value (LHV), followed by the computation of its conversion into electrical energy with an overall conversion efficiency (from palm residues to electric energy) of 25%. This assumption does not take into account the technology used for this conversion. Based on the inventory data for coconut cultivation provided in ‘Inventory data for coconut cultivation’, the net electricity generated from coconut palm residues is computed for the reference functional unit (1 MJ) in SimaPro. This amount of electricity is assumed to offset the corresponding Indian electricity production from coal and natural gas. Thus, the system boundary (as explained in ‘System boundaries’) is expanded to include the system of processes which are involved in the production of Indian electricity from coal and natural gas.</p><p>The environmental burdens are allocated for coconut oil by assuming it replacing commercial paraffin oil lubricant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. As mentioned in ‘Inventory data for coconut cultivation’, 4.7 kg of husked nuts (9.4 numbers equals approximately 10) is required to produce 1 kg (or 1.08 l) of coconut oil. Thus, corresponding to the generation of 1 MJ of syngas energy (reference functional unit), the net quantity of ‘lubricant’ (coconut oil) production can be computed and modeled in SimaPro. A separate module is created for paraffin oil lubricant production (modified Ecoinvent module), and the producer gas life cycle system boundary is expanded to include the system of processes in the commercial paraffin oil lubricant production. By proceeding like this, the net emissions associated with the production of producer gas with 1 MJ of energy are determined by subtracting the sum of the emissions (or impacts) associated with the saved fossil fuel-based electricity production and the saved commercial lubricant production from the emissions associated with the generation of producer gas.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Life cycle impact assessment</title><p>Following cutoff criteria are adopted in the study:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>Since the maturity duration for coconut palm is 10 years, the study is conducted to analyze the impacts of producer gas life cycle corresponding to this duration.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Application of pesticides, insecticides, and herbicides for coconut cultivation is avoided due to lack of readily available local data.</p></list-item><list-item><p>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from the utilization of producer gas are taken as nullified by the CO<sub>2</sub> absorption during the growth of coconut tree.

This process is favorable (GWP is negative) since fossil fuel-based electricity production is offset by the energy content (16.5 kJ/kg) of the residues, as mentioned in ‘Allocation procedure’. In addition to this, allocation of the co-product (coconut oil) is also favorable since it replaces the commercial paraffin oil lubricant.</p><p>Two options are suggested for reducing the GHG emissions: (1) increasing the domestic mining capacity of coal, which will reduce the oceanic transport power requirement for importing the coal from other countries, as mentioned in ‘Coal gas life cycle’; and (2) increasing the share of renewable and hydroelectric energy source contribution to electricity generation. At present, they are contributing only 16% of the total production capacity, as mentioned in ‘Supporting process’. Promotion of these two energy sources, especially renewable bioenergy and small hydropower, shall result in reduction in the emissions of greenhouse gases for both the life cycles.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Ozone layer depletion potential</title><p>Ozone layer depletion is a situation of serious concern as it will increase the amount of ultraviolet rays from the sun entering the atmosphere. The emissions of stratosphere ozone layer-depleting gases in the two life cycles are given in Table <xref rid="Tab13" ref-type="table">13</xref>. The major gases responsible for the depletion of the ozone layer is CFC-10 (66.26% of ODP) for producer gas life cycle and halon 1301 (66.11% of ODP) for coal gas life cycle. The results provided in Table <xref rid="Tab9" ref-type="table">9</xref> show that ODP is reduced by 64.1% in the coconut shell-generated producer gas life cycle. The corresponding process contributions are provided in Tables <xref rid="Tab10" ref-type="table">10</xref> and <xref rid="Tab11" ref-type="table">11</xref>. The by-product and co-product allocations are responsible for the reduction in ODP for producer gas life cycle, as evident from Table <xref rid="Tab10" ref-type="table">10</xref>. Steam generation, fertilizer application, and irrigation are the significant contributors of ozone-depleting gas emissions for producer gas life cycle. Similarly for coal gas life cycle, in addition to steam production for gasifier operation, oceanic transport of coal (especially Australian coal for its large distance) and rail transport of domestic coal are decisive.<table-wrap id="Tab13"><label>Table 13</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>Major gas emissions causing ozone layer depletion</bold></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="3"><p>Producer gas life cycle</p></th><th colspan="3"><p>Coal gas life cycle</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p><bold>Gas</bold></p></td><td><p><bold>ODP (kg CFC 11 equivalent)</bold></p></td><td><p><bold>% of total ODP</bold></p></td><td><p><bold>Gas</bold></p></td><td><p><bold>ODP (kg CFC 11 equivalent)</bold></p></td><td><p><bold>% of total ODP</bold></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>CFC 10</p></td><td><p>5.87E−9</p></td><td><p>66.26</p></td><td><p>Halon 1301</p></td><td><p>1.58E−8</p></td><td><p>66.11</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Halon 1211</p></td><td><p>1.59E−9</p></td><td><p>18.49</p></td><td><p>CFC 10</p></td><td><p>5.95E−9</p></td><td><p>24.89</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>CFC 114</p></td><td><p>1.27E−9</p></td><td><p>14.76</p></td><td><p>Halon 1211</p></td><td><p>1.69E−9</p></td><td><p>7.10</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"/><td><p>CFC 114</p></td><td><p>9.85E−10</p></td><td><p>1.90</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>The major source of ozone-depleting gas emissions in both the cycles is the steam generation. The fossil fuel-based (natural gas and coal) electricity production for steam generation contributes 33% of the total ozone-depleting gas emissions. On analyzing the sub-processes, it is traced that 83% of the ODP of steam generation is attributed to the transport and storage of liquefied natural gas onshore and offshore for utilization in power plants. The liquefaction of natural gas is accomplished by cryogenic treatment, which is responsible for the emission of three gases, halon 1301, CFC 10, and CFC 114, to the atmosphere which deplete the ozone layer in the stratosphere. The remaining 17% is contributed by the utilization of diesel for the transport of hard coal to power plant locations. The diesel production stage (crude oil refining) involves many low-temperature extraction processes utilizing refrigerants, which emit ozone-depleting gases. It may also be noted that the other two major processes in producer gas life cycle are fertilizer production and irrigation, while transport of the coal through large distance (e.g., oceanic transport of the imported coal) is prominent for coal gas life cycle. The share of natural gas in electricity production and fueling (diesel) transport contributes ozone-harmful gases to these three sub-processes also.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Fossil fuel depletion potential or utilization of nonrenewable energy</title><p>Syngas produced from gasification of biomass feedstock is often cited as an effective alternative to fossil fuels, thus reducing the dependence on fossil fuel reserves. The utilization of nonrenewable energy or fossil fuel depletion potential (FDP) is expressed in megajoules of energy surplus. The FDP values for the two life cycles are shown in Table <xref rid="Tab9" ref-type="table">9</xref>. The results show that a reduction of 71.5% is possible regarding fossil fuel consumption for coconut shell-produced gas life cycle, compared to coal gas life cycle. This significant reduction is attributed to two reasons: (1) utilization of renewable biomass (coconut shell) instead of fossil fuel (coal) and (2) allocation of coconut residues for offsetting fossil fuel-based power production capacity. The process contributions of both life cycles are given in Tables <xref rid="Tab10" ref-type="table">10</xref> and <xref rid="Tab11" ref-type="table">11</xref>.

Table <xref rid="Tab17" ref-type="table">17</xref> lists the contribution of electricity production and supply to the emissions of the life cycles stages mentioned in Tables <xref rid="Tab15" ref-type="table">15</xref> and <xref rid="Tab16" ref-type="table">16</xref>. From Table <xref rid="Tab17" ref-type="table">17</xref>, it is evident that fossil fuel-based Indian electricity production almost completely controls the impacts from the stages coconut shell crushing (C) and gasification agent generation (D) in the producer gas life cycle. Similar is the case with stage ‘C1’ for the coal gas life cycle. Substantial electricity-consuming equipments such as crushing mill, boiler, and air compressor are responsible for this. It may also be noted that the emissions associated with coal transport dominates in the production and transport stage of the imported (A1) and domestic (B1) coal.<table-wrap id="Tab17"><label>Table 17</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>Percentage share of electricity production and supply to the emissions of the life cycle stages</bold></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2"/><th colspan="5"><p>Producer gas life cycle stage</p></th><th colspan="4"><p>Coal gas life cycle stage</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>A</p></th><th><p>B</p></th><th><p>C</p></th><th><p>D</p></th><th><p>E</p></th><th><p>A1</p></th><th><p>B1</p></th><th><p>C1</p></th><th><p>D1</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>GWP</p></td><td><p>57.6</p></td><td><p>26.8</p></td><td><p>93.8</p></td><td><p>99.8</p></td><td><p>1.6</p></td><td><p>2.1</p></td><td><p>29.3</p></td><td><p>93.8</p></td><td><p>1.5</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>ODP</p></td><td><p>61.1</p></td><td><p>17.1</p></td><td><p>98.1</p></td><td><p>99.3</p></td><td><p>2.3</p></td><td><p>0.8</p></td><td><p>7.2</p></td><td><p>98.1</p></td><td><p>2.3</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>FDP</p></td><td><p>63.1</p></td><td><p>19.9</p></td><td><p>99.5</p></td><td><p>99.7</p></td><td><p>7.9</p></td><td><p>0.2</p></td><td><p>0.03</p></td><td><p>99.5</p></td><td><p>7.9</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>A, coconut cultivation and husbandry practices; B, fertilizer production and application; C, coconut shell production and crushing; D, generation and supply of gasification agents; E, coconut shell gasification in gasifier including infrastructure development and waste disposal; A1,imported coal production and transport; B1,domestic coal production and transport; C1,generation and supply of gasification agents; D1,coal gasification in gasifier including infrastructure development and waste disposal.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>In short, it can be estimated from Tables <xref rid="Tab15" ref-type="table">15</xref> and <xref rid="Tab17" ref-type="table">17</xref> that the contribution of Indian electricity production and utilization to GWP, ODP, and FDP are 68.8%, 51.4%, and 56.3%, respectively, for the life cycle of producer gas.

Under these damage categories, another eleven impact categories (brief description is provided in the Appendix) are also identified, and the life cycles are compared in terms of these categories also, as shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. The comparison is related to coal gas life cycle which is assumed to be having 100% impact. As evident from the figure, all the impact categories calculated show an edge for producer gas life cycle over coal gas life cycle. Major sources of the emissions responsible for these impacts are represented in Table <xref rid="Tab18" ref-type="table">18</xref>. The difference in the impacts caused by these emissions is due to the contribution of electricity to the grid by coconut palm residues. This is because many of these emissions are resulting from the stack gas from fossil fuel-based power plants.

The present study is applicable to India, which is the third largest coconut-producing country, behind the Philippines and Malaysia, having an area of about 1.78 million ha under the crop. Annual production is about 7,562 million nuts with an average of 5,295 nuts/ha. The state of Kerala, where the study pertains to, tops in production accounting 39% of the total production in the country. Coconut farming provides employment to nearly 10 million people and makes a contribution of nearly INR 70 billion to gross domestic product. The electricity sector in India had an installed capacity of 205.34 GW as of June 2012, the world's fifth largest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In terms of fuel, coal-fired plants account for 70% (143 GW) of India's installed electricity capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. As per the data from the local agricultural university (as given in ‘Life cycle inventory analysis’), 3.1 numbers of husked nuts are required to produce 1 kg of coconut shell. The average calorific value (LHV) of coconut shell ranges from 16.5 to 18 MJ/kg. Thus, based on the above mentioned annual production of nuts, by allocating 100% of the coconut shell for the production of power by converting it into syngas (producer gas), 40.25 to 43.9 GW of power could be produced. This is 19.6% to 21.4% of the total energy demand in the country, offsetting almost 35% to 38% of coal consumption. Careful planning and long-term policies on coconut cultivation encouragement, effective utilization of energy from coconut residues, and coconut shell gasification practice will definitely help to build an effective alternative fuel sector in India.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec34" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Two gaseous fuels (coconut shell-derived producer gas and coal gas) were compared in terms of their environmental impacts by conducting a LCA study with respect to Indian conditions. The environmental impacts are quantified as 18.3% lower GWP, 64.1% lower ODP, and 71.5% lower FDP, indicating better environmental performance of producer gas life cycle. In addition to this, comparisons based on several other impact categories also confirmed the edge of producer gas life cycle. Steam and compressed-air generation for gasifier operation and fertilizer production and application for coconut cultivation are the major contributors to the environmental impacts for producer gas life cycle. Substantial contribution of the by-product allocation is the major factor responsible for lower emissions for the producer gas life cycle. Based on the existing fertilizing practice and the utilization of electricity from the Indian electric grid, substantial GHG emission savings cannot be achieved for producer gas life cycle. However, the green electricity-aided catalytic gasification of coconut shell produced by organic farming can result in 43.4% reduction in GHG emissions from fossil coal gas, meeting the EU renewable energy directive.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Appendix</title><sec id="Sec36"><title>Impact assessment methods and indicators</title><p>SimaPro contains several methods for the assessment of impacts of process and product stages. In these methods, multiple damage categories are taken into account, such as resource depletion, land use, climate change, and ecotoxicity. IMPACT 2002+ methodology proposes a feasible implementation of a combined midpoint/damage approach, linking all types of life cycle inventory results (elementary flows and other interventions) via 14 midpoint categories to four damage categories, as shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p><p>For the assessment of the impact of GHG emissions, global warming potential of the greenhouse gases are expressed in terms of kilograms of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent as per the IPCC fourth assessment report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p>Ozone depletion potential values have been established mainly for hydrocarbons containing combined bromine, fluorine and chlorine, or CFCs. Here, one of the substances (CFC-11) has been adopted as the reference.</p><p>For assessment of the resource depletion using fossil fuel consumption, a term ‘surplus energy’ is employed in IMPACT 2002+. Mankind will always extract the best resources first, leaving the lower-quality resources for future extraction. The damage of resources will be experienced by future generations as they will have to use more effort to extract the remaining resources. This extra effort is expressed as surplus energy. Thus, fossil fuel depletion is expressed as surplus energy per extracted megajoule fossil fuel as a result of lower-quality resources.</p><p>Emission of carcinogenic substance causing human cancer is expressed as kilograms of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>Cl (vinyl chloride) equivalent. The normalization is based on the probability of the number of people from a group of 1 million who will develop cancer with the exposure to vinyl chloride. Impacts depend on the amount of the substance that will be transferred to water, air, or soil, each having different acceptable levels for the carcinogenic vinyl chloride.</p><p>Other midpoint impact categories in IMPACT 2002+ leading to the mentioned four damage categories are listed below [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] in terms of the equivalent units of known factors contributing to the corresponding impact:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Non-carcinogens: Human toxicity is stated in non-carcinogenic effects of equivalent mass of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>Cl (vinyl chloride).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Respiratory inorganics: Respiratory health effects are stated in equivalent units of inorganic particulate matter smaller than 2.5 microns.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Respiratory organics: Respiratory health effects are stated in equivalent mass of ethylene.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Ionizing radiation: Irradiating impacts are stated in equivalent units of becquerels of carbon-14.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Aquatic ecotoxicity: Freshwater ecotoxicity is stated in equivalent mass of triethylene glycol released into water (streams and lakes).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Terrestrial ecotoxicity: Land-based ecotoxicity is stated in equivalent mass of triethylene glycol released into the soil.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Terrestrial acidification/nitrification: Land-based acidification and nitrification are stated in equivalent mass of sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) released into the air.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Land occupation: Units for land occupation are stated in square meters of arable land.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Aquatic acidification: Units are the same as for land-based acidification.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Aquatic eutrophication: Aquatic eutrophication is stated in equivalent mass of phosphate.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Mineral extraction: Mineral extraction impacts are stated in megajoules of surplus energy per kilogram of extracted substance.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Authors’ information</title><p>CCS is a PhD research scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering of the National Institute of Technology Calicut, India.
