id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted extensive research attention due to its low-cost, high-efficiency and non-pollution, it has been considered as one of the most promising alternatives to Si-based photovoltaic cells in the last two decades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Typically, DSSCs consists of nanoporous TiO<sub>2</sub> films, a monolayer of dye molecule, counter electrode and I<sup>−</sup>/I<sup>3−</sup> redox electrolyte solution. Among them, TiO<sub>2</sub> films serves as the transport media for photo-generated electrons and take charge for dye-loading and charge-collection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Therefore, the shape and structure of TiO<sub>2</sub> layer play an importance role in the photoperformance of DSSCs and continuous efforts have been made for synthesizing different structure of TiO<sub>2</sub> photoanode to improving the PCE of solar cells. The TiO<sub>2</sub> films with shape of cactus-like<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, treelike<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, forest-like<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, pine tree-like<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> have been successfully synthesized and applied as photoanode in DSSCs, these exhibited dramatic potential in improving performance for applications in solar cells.</p><p>Recently, TiO<sub>2</sub> photoanode with 1D/3D bi-layer structure have attracted much attention, such a structure may render fewer grain boundaries, larger surface area and better light scattering properties. For example, Hong et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> synthesized 1D vertically aligned rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorods and 3D TiO<sub>2</sub> nanostars by a single step hydrothermal route, the 3D nanostars/1D nanorods based DSSCs cell exhibited 5.39% power conversion efficiency (η), which is remarkably higher than that of bare 1D nanorods based (3.74%) photoelectrode. Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> reported a new type of crystalline rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorod based photoanode prepared by using a facile two step hydrothermal process, the bilayer photoanode has a bottom layer composed of oriented single-crystalline rutile nanorods and a top layer composed of loosely packed nanorods which not only increases the dye loading with a significantly increased surface area but also improves light scattering without sacrificing the electron-transport efficiency. Therefore, the resultant new structures delivered light-to-electricity conversion efficiency of 6.31% as photoanodes in DSSCs. Kim et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> reported 1D/3D nanorod network consisting of 1D nanowires bottom arrays and a three-dimensional (3D) dendritic microsphere top layer. These bilayer nanostructures simultaneous possess the incompatible features such as high specific area, fast electron transport and a pronounced light-scattering effect and demonstrated a high energy conversion efficiency of 5.6%. In addition, as we known, nanotubes structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> exhibited bigger specific surface area than that of nanorod<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Shao et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> reported 3D porous architecture composed of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotubes shown a large surface area of 502.9 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>−1</sup> has been obtained. So the transformation nanorods into nanotubes is a available method for largenning the surface area.</p><p>In this work, a novel 1D nanorods/3D nanotubes network structure was synthesized on a transparent conducting oxide substrates (TCO) by two-step hydrothermal. Relative to previous work and other related works<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, the 1D nanorod/3D nanotubes network structure was proposed as a derived structure of 1D/3D nanorod network. Compared with the nanorod network, the 1D nanorod/3D nanotubes network structure exhibited obvious advantages of larger specific surface area, due to the hollow of the 3D nanotubes. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report on 1D nanorod/3D nanotubes for DSSCs. The new structures delivered the highest power conversion efficiency of 7.68% to date for the DSSCs based on 1D rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorods photoanodes with further TiCl<sub>4</sub> treatment. In addition, we have compared the photovoltaic performance of 1D nanorods/3D nanotubes structure with 3D nanotubes photoanode and the detailed transient properties and electron transport resistance of these network structure in DSSCs were analyzed by open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), the 1D nanorods/3D nanotubes sample exhibits superior characteristics with longer life time and smaller electron transport resistance, indicating rapider electron transport rate than 3D nanotubes sample, which attributed to the electron pathway provided by 1D nanorod arrays.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p><xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> shows field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of 1D/3D TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorods prepared by hydrothermal method using a solution of 0.9 ml titanium butoxide, 16 ml hydrochloric acid, 16 ml deionized water at 150°C for 10 h while the FTO substrate lied flat on the bottom of the reactor with the conductive side facing up. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 (a)</xref> shows the cross-sectional SEM image of the sample. As the image shown, after a single-step hydrothermal synthesis, a bi-layer network nanostructure has been formed, which consists of the upper layer of 3D TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorods and the bottom layer of 1D TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorod arrays. The <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1 (b)</xref> and the inset of <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1(b)</xref> present the cross-sectional and top views of the 1D nanorod arrays, respectively. It reveals that the 1D TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorod arrays are very dense and little space exists between adjacent TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorods. The average length of the nanorods is ~4.4 μm with the average diameter of 150 nm. In addition, it can be seen from the plan view of 3D nanorods layer (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1c</xref>) that the upper layer of the superstructure consists of TiO<sub>2</sub> flower-like clusters. A close-up of a flower looks like a natural chrysanthemum. Each flower was composed of a large number of nanorods and every individual nanorod is tetragonal in shape with square top facets. The void in the bottom nanorod arrays provide nucleation site for the upper 3D nanorods layer, which grow randomly and subsequently form a flow-like structure. These spokewise nanorods radiated from a common central zone. The nanorods were roughly 3 μm long and 450 nm wide with an aspect ratio of about 6.7. Moreover, the top surface of a nanorod appeared to contain many step edges, which are the substrates for further growth of sub-nanorods, while the side surface was smooth. Clearly a fully grown flower possessed a spherical symmetry with an average diameter of approximately 7.5 μm. From the SEM image at low magnification (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure1 d</xref>), the TiO<sub>2</sub> flower–like clusters uniformly distributed on the surface of substrate and enough space emerged between two adjacent TiO<sub>2</sub> clusters which are benefit for dye loading. Moreover, during the hydrothermal process, while the FTO substrate lied flat on the bottom of the reactor with the conductive sides facing down, a network nanostructure of 3D TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorods can be synthesized as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">figure s1</xref> shown. The morphological and structural properties of 1D/3D nanorods are further characterized by TEM analysis. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 e</xref> shows a single flower made of several nanorod petals. The close image (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1g</xref>) of the single nanorod in bottom layer reveals that the top of nanorod was consisted of a lot of parallel ultrathin nanoneedles. Selected area electron diffraction patterns (SAED) for 3D nanorods (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1f</xref>) and 1D nanorods (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1h</xref>) exhibit that these nanorods have a single crystalline structure. The single-crystal characteristics of the nanorods are very crucial in DSC application, since they will provide fast electronic pathway through the nanorod with few boundary. Moreover, compared to the poor crystallization, the single crystal nanorods exhibited fewer surface defects trapping, it may be result in the lower electron recombination.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The cross-sectional (a) and plan (c, d) SEM images of 1D/3D TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorods, image (b) and the inset image of (b) correspond to the cross-sectional and top view of the bottom layer of 1D TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorod arrays.

Image (a), (b), (c) and (d) are the morphology of the 3D nanorods sample after etching post-treatment, it can be found that a portion of the TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorods in flower-like clusters were hollowed out, forming a structure of nanotubes with the average inner diameter of 150 nm and the wall thickness of 10 nm. Interestingly, the tip of the tube wall is assembled by some TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorods with smaller diameter and the petal of the flower-like cluster have converted into nanotubes. So we denoted the sample as 3D nanotubes in this work. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 (e) and (g)</xref> show the top and cross-sectional image of 1D/3D nanorods samples after acid etching treatment. As the images shown, the sample maintains bi-layer structure and the network structure exhibits the same thickness of 70 μm as the un-etched one. From the plan (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f</xref>) view of the bottom layer of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorod arrays, it can be found that the TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorods split into secondary nanorods with a reduced diameter. Obviously, through etching post-treatment, the compactly aligned nanorods arrays were replaced by loosely distributed secondary nanorods with diameter of 12–60 nm, which should be responsible for the enlarged space between the adjacent nanorods. In addition, etching treatment does not change the length of nanorod array significantly. After 12 h etching treatment, the thickness of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorod arrays is 4 μm, this is only about 400 nm thinner than the un-etched one. From the top view of the 1D/3D TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorods after etching at high magnification (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2h</xref>), the upper layer of 3D nanorods have been hollow, the petal of the flower-like cluster transform from nanorods to nanotubes with an average diameter of ~300 nm and the wall thickness of ~8 nm, which markedly enlarged the surface area of the sample and a 1D nanorods/3D nanotubes structure is formed. The morphological transformation of rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorods through etching can be understood as follows:<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>FESEM images of the cross-sectional (a, b) and top (c, d) views of 3D nanotubes.

The dissolve rate of different crystal faces in rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorods follows the sequence (110) &lt; (100) &lt; (101) &lt; (001)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Thus, the (001) planes of rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorods are the preferential etching planes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorods dissolved along the [001] direction, which leads to TiO<sub>2</sub> transform from 3D nanorods to 3D nanotubes. Moreover, there are more crystal defects existing in the grain boundaries among 1D rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorod arrays and these sits are favored etching position as well, so that the bottom layer of densely packed TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorod arrays split into secondary nanorods with small diameter.</p><p>As the SEM images present, we can control the morphology and dimension of TiO<sub>2</sub> films by experiment condition. It can be found that the TiO<sub>2</sub> films contain only 1D nanorod arrays while the mount of titanium precursor is less than 0.5 ml as we previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and the films present 1D/3D nanorods network structure as adequate titanium precursor is added. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> shows the schematic diagram of TiO<sub>2</sub> films with different network structures. The structures of 1D/3D nanorods and 3D nanorods were successfully synthesized by a single-step hydrothermal route. When the conductive side of FTO glass faces up during the hydrothermal process, a 1D/3D nanorods structure was obtained, on the contrary, a 3D nanorods structure would be presented when the conductive surface face down. In order to further improve the surface area of the TiO<sub>2</sub> films for DSSCs application, the network structure suffered from etching treatment. Finally, the structures of 3D nanorods and 1D/3D nanorods were successfully transformed into 3D nanotubes and 1D nanorods/3D nanotubes through the etching treatment.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>A schematic diagram of TiO<sub>2</sub> films with different network structures.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep09305_Fig3_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>The crystallinity of the hydrothermally deposited network structures were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 (a)</xref> shows the XRD patterns of the 1D/3D nanorods as prepared, which can be easily indexed to the tetragonal rutile structure of TiO<sub>2</sub> (JCPDS No.89-4920), indicating that a crystalline structure has been directly synthesized without annealing treatment. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 (a), (c) and (d)</xref> show the XRD patterns of TiO<sub>2</sub> 1D/3D nanorods, 3D nanotubes and 1D nanorods/3D nanotubes samples respectively.

The measured specific surface areas of the three sample were 75.53 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>−1</sup>, 103.42 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>−1</sup>, 134.06 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. This BET result is in accordance with the SEM image in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>. The two etching samples showed a larger surface area than that of the unetching sample. This indicates that the etching samples should provide larger sensitizer surface coverages than the unetching photoelectrodes. The amounts of dyes adsorbed on the three samples were measured by the UV-vis absorption spectra of the N719 dye-desorption solution, which were prepared by immersing the sensitized electrodes into a 0.1 M NaOH in a mixed solvent (water: ethanol = 1:1). The amount of dye adsorbed was determined by the molar extinction coefficient of 1.41 × 10<sup>4</sup> dm<sup>3</sup>mol<sup>−1</sup> cm<sup>−1</sup> at 515 nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. It is found that the two etched samples exhibit higher dye-loading capacity than the un-etched film. Especially for 1D nanorods/3D nanotubes sample, it has the largest amount of dye adsorption (236.16 nmol/cm<sup>2</sup>) and is about 3.6 times larger than that of the un-etched 1D/3D nanorods films (65.97 nmol/cm<sup>2</sup>), which result from the enlarged internal surface area via etching treatment, definitely contribute to the enhanced photocurrent density and thus higher DSSC efficiencies. This is well in agreement with J-V data.</p><p>In order to better understand the different photovoltaic performances of the three DSSCs, the UV/Vis reflectance spectra were further characterized and shown in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">figure 6 (a)</xref>. The light-scattering ability of the photoanode is crucial for efficient harvesting of the incident light, the sample with inferior light-scattering ability have a better chance to capture incident light. As the <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">figure 6 (a)</xref> shown, the reflectance of the 1D nanorods/3D nanotubes film (sample III) is about 85% in the range of 400–900 nm, which is higher than the other two films. It is worth noting that sample III and sample II, with etching treatment, shows higher diffuse reflection capabilities in the visible and near infrared regions compared to that of un-etched one (sample I), suggesting that the incident light was significantly scattered within film III and II, which can maximize the use of solar light to improve the light harvesting efficiency and definitely result in a higher photocurrent for DSSCs based on sample III and II. In addition, the reflectance of the 3D nanotubes (sample II) is about 70% in the range of 400–800 nm, it presents a little lower than that of sample III which fabricated by an aligned bottom layer of 1D nanorod arrays with better light-scattering capacity. The absorption spectra of the three TiO<sub>2</sub> network structure photoanodes sensitized with N719 dye have been shown in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">figure 6 (b)</xref>. It is found that the dye-sensitized 1D nanorods/3D nanotubes film have best light-harvesting capabilities in the range from 400–700 nm and the peaks around 530 nm are the characteristic absorption of the N719 dye. It reveals that the etched films show much higher light absorption, especially during the visible and near infrared regions compared to that without any etching treatment, which is consistent with result of the amount of dye molecules measurement in which etching sample showed the higher dye-loading.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(a) Diffused reflectance spectra of different network structures films before dye adsorption without electrolyte and illuminated from the TiO<sub>2</sub> side with integrating sphere.

Moreover, the IPCE of the etching sample III increased from 58% to 90% around 530 nm compared to the un-etching sample I. The higher IPCE of cell sample III over a wide range contribute to the increase in efficiency of light harvesting (larger dye molecular loading and higher light reflectance), which could lead to a higher short-circuit current density. In addition, it can be found that the IPCE data of cell sample III shows an obvious red-shift to a longer wavelength compared to the cell sample I and II due to the better light-scattering ability.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves of DSSCs based on TiO<sub>2</sub> photoanodes with different network structures.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep09305_Fig7_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>Transient photoconductivity and recombination kinetics of TiO<sub>2</sub> based cells were studied by OCVD measurements.

It is worth noting that the two etched samples exhibit superior characteristics with longer lifetime than the un-etched film, indicating fewer recombination centers in the etched sample. The grain boundaries among rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorods are favored etching positions, owing to their higher concentration of defects.

One well-known method is post-treatment the TiO<sub>2</sub> photoanode with titanium tetrachloride (TiCl<sub>4</sub>) solution. The TiCl<sub>4</sub> treatment can results in an improvement of 10–30% in photocurrent. It is claimed that the treatment by TiCl<sub>4</sub> could introduce 3–10 nm nanoparticles onto TiO<sub>2</sub> photoanode to increase the surface area. Accordingly, it improves the dye-loading capacity of the photoanode. In addition, the TiCl<sub>4</sub> surface treatment can improve the electron transport and light scattering. In this work, the as-prepared TiO<sub>2</sub> 1D nanorods/3D nanotubes sample was immersed in 0.2 M TiCl<sub>4</sub> aqueous solution at room temperature for 48 h and then was annealed in air at 450°C for 30 min. FE-SEM images of the modified sample are shown in <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10 (a, b, c)</xref>. As the plan-views shown, the sample maintains the flower cluster structures which composed of a large number of nanotubes, the inside and outside surface of the nanotubes are covered with a mass of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles and the surfaces become rough. From the top view at high magnification (<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10c</xref>), the diameter of nanoparticle is about 10–20 nm. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10 (c)</xref> gives the cross-sectional image of TiO<sub>2</sub> 1D nanorod arrays at the bottom layer, which shows a lot of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles also attach on surface of the nanorod arrays. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10 (d)</xref> presents the J-V curves and photovoltaic parameters of DSSCs based on the TiCl<sub>4</sub> modified 1D nanorods/3D nanotubes photoanode. After the TiCl<sub>4</sub> treatment at room temperature for 48 h, the cell attained an over efficiency of 7.68% with J<sub>sc</sub> of 18.3 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, V<sub>oc</sub> of 0.72 V and an FF of 58.29%, the J<sub>sc</sub> and conversion efficiency of the cell were increased through the TiCl<sub>4</sub> treatment by 36% and 20%, respectively, whereas the V<sub>oc</sub> and FF decreased a little after the TiCl<sub>4</sub> treatment, this result suggests that the increase in the solar cell performance was mostly derived from the increase in current density. The large increase of J<sub>sc</sub> can be explained as follows. After TiCl<sub>4</sub> post-treatment, a dense amorphous TiO<sub>2</sub> particles forming on the surface of bare anotubes or nanorods will facilitate electron transfer and increase the surface area for more light capture. The procedure leads to increased dye adsorption due to increased roughness. A thin blocking layer of TiO<sub>2</sub> is deposited on the naked FTO surface that reduces the recombination loss between accumulated electrons and electrolyte<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.
