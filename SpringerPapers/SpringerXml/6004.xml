These diseases are responsible for increasing morbidity and mortality and lead to other stresses within the population. Such stresses create continuous impacts on the health and well-being of the population, compounding their vulnerability and inhibiting their capacity to cope with frequent event-related shocks, such as floods and drought. A systems approach is taken to examine four important environmental hazards in Bangladesh—arsenic contamination of drinking water, arsenic transmission through the food chain, indoor air quality, and air pollution. A review of these hazards is presented in a conceptual framework that links human well-being with the key system components of infrastructure, institutions, knowledge, and behavior. This reveals key underlying factors between the hazards and uncovers system structures that can lead to more effective hazard mitigation, and the establishment of strategic intervention points. The article concludes that elimination of these continuous stresses will only come about through the culmination of multiple interventions over time, undertaken in an iterative manner that builds on the continual advancement of hazard understanding. The role of individual behaviors, together with factors such as risk awareness and perception of the hazards, has been identified as crucial for achieving successful mitigation solutions. Improved knowledge of the hazards, public awareness, and government accountability are focus points to reduce population exposure and enhance response capacity.</p></abstract><kwd-group

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Over the last decade, there has been a substantial amount of research on, and investment in, disaster risk reduction and developing the concept of urban resilience (Hernantes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2019</xref>; Kabir, Sato, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2018</xref>). A focus has been on mitigating the “shocks” of natural hazards and disasters (Birkmann and Peduzzi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>; Cai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2018</xref>; Zobel and Baghersad <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2018</xref>), and on understanding how to ensure that our socio-technical systems respond, adapt, and recover from natural and anthropogenic hazards (Moghim and Garna <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2019</xref>). However, in order to build climate-resilient societies, the human capacity of vulnerable populations to cope with long-term stressors arising from environmental hazards must also be enhanced (Akter and Mallick <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">The development of resilience requires the mitigation or elimination of ongoing vulnerabilities, including exposure to constant environmental stresses that damage the well-being and health of the population. Whereas shocks denote discrete event-based hazards, stresses refer to continuous perils and are derived from an ongoing situational context. It is important to think of not only how to prepare for, and recover from, a significant event in order to resume normal service, but to address the continuous degrading stresses that detract from these efforts. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> illustrates that, with the mitigation of climate shocks and the reduction of vulnerability to stresses, overall resilience can be improved and that it is not sufficient to respond to the shocks alone.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Closing the resilience gap in vulnerable populations</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13753_2019_239_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par4">Bangladesh is subject to events such as floods, droughts, and tropical cyclones that produce “shocks.” The country also suffers from continuous “stresses,” for example from arsenic contamination and poor air quality (Toufique and Islam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2014</xref>). Tens of millions of people in Bangladesh are at extreme risk from these environmental hazards and continued exposure leads to suffering, loss of potential, premature death, and the onset of debilitating non-communicable diseases (the leading cause of death globally) (Murcott <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2012</xref>; WHO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2017a</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">The resultant growing burden of degraded well-being is not only hampering development but reducing the population’s response capacity—that is, the system’s ability to react to a shock—and hence overall resilience (Akter and Mallick <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2013</xref>). The impact of these shocks is felt especially by the poorest segments of the population, and their vulnerability is compounded by the number of environmental hazards prevalent in Bangladesh (Ayeb-Karlsson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2016</xref>). Slow-onset natural hazards have driven migration from northwest rural Bangladesh (Kabir, Serrao-Neumann, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2018</xref>; Rahman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2018</xref>) as the most hazard-prone riparian rural households are unable to cope with the impacts of climate change and associated environmental hazards due to a lack of adaptation options along with their poor socioeconomic conditions (Alam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">This article uses a qualitative visual framework, based on a simplified systems approach—originally presented by da Silva et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2012</xref>)—to review current mitigation approaches to stresses in Bangladesh and identifies which system components hold the greatest opportunity to improve well-being, reduce vulnerability, and promote resilience. The existing barriers to the effective mitigation and prevention of continuous environmental hazards in Bangladesh are also identified.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Bangladesh Vulnerability</title><p id="Par7">Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries in the world with a land area of 147,600 km<sup>2</sup> and a population of 161.36 million (World Bank <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2018</xref>). The country ranks sixth on the 2018 Global Climate Risk Index and third in terms of the number of total events from 1997 to 2016 (Eckstein et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2018</xref>). It faces a multitude of environmental hazards due to its physical geography (Khan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2013</xref>) and is at specific risk due to its exposure to sea-level rise, cyclones, food insecurity, and exacerbation of health issues through climate change (ICCCAD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2014</xref>). Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh, is one of the largest cities in the world, with 14.65 million people (Shell Global <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2019</xref>) and a population density of 44,500 people/km<sup>2</sup>, resulting in significant pressures (Brodie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">In recent decades Bangladesh has been in the midst of a rapid transition and has made developmental progress in transforming the economy from agriculture-based to industry oriented, with significant investment in infrastructure and the penetration of micro-finance institutions into rural communities, having faced severe challenges, such as poverty, weak governance, political instability, and exposure to natural hazards (Sawada et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2017</xref>). In the United Nations Human Development Index 2018 update, the country was ranked 136th out of the 189 countries assessed, with a score of 0.608 (UNDP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2018</xref>). This compares with an HDI of 0.387 in 1990 and 0.477 in 2000 confirming this steady progress.</p><p id="Par9">The rise of chronic diseases related to environmental hazards has created major societal problems, limiting economic advancement and reducing human welfare. In 2015, 67% of deaths in Bangladesh were attributable to non-communicable diseases (WHO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2017a</xref>) and their prevalence is an increasing burden on the country (Karar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2009</xref>; Mirelman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2016</xref>). This situation is unsustainable, especially as Bangladesh’s population ages and continues to increase. Bangladesh has one of the world’s worst environmental and lifestyle risk profiles, characterized by severe air and water pollution, nutritional disorders, and risk behaviors associated with a “Western” lifestyle, such as unhealthy diets and physical inactivity. These social, environmental, and behavioral risk factors share antecedents and causes, amplify each other’s effects, and depend on one another in complex (and non-obvious) ways. Importantly, they can also exert different effects in varying contexts such as across rural, urban, and slum settings.</p><p id="Par10">The range of environmental hazards that Bangladesh faces is summarized in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> (Smith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2013</xref>).

A framework has been adapted based on the da Silva et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2012</xref>) approach to conceptualizing socio-technical systems in a way that does not require complex modeling and can be readily understood by city planners and key decision makers. This conceptual framework is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and expresses the link between well-being and the hazards that affect human well-being by identifying various “socio-technical networks” that are components of the wider system. Resilience can therefore be examined indirectly by the changing performance of these system components in response to shocks and stresses.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>System interactions between human well-being and environmental hazards.</p><p><italic>Source</italic> Adapted from da Silva et al.

In Bangladesh, 35–37 million people are prone to the chronic effects of this carcinogenic element (Nickson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">1998</xref>; Chaudhary et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2000</xref>; World Bank <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2005</xref>; Murcott <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2012</xref>; Johnston et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2014</xref>) resulting in an estimated 40,000 deaths per year (Pearshouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2016</xref>). The issue is one of the most serious health problems in history because of the coupling between high groundwater concentrations of arsenic and a drinking water and irrigation system reliant on groundwater supply (World Bank <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2005</xref>; Chakraborti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2010</xref>; Johnston et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2014</xref>; Sharma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2014</xref>). Millions of shallow tube wells have been installed and it is estimated that approximately 98% of the people in Bangladesh use groundwater for drinking (Shamsudduha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2019</xref>). The affected aquifers are generally shallow at less than 100 m deep and the majority of tube wells are at a depth of 15–80 m, with arsenic concentration peaking at 20–70 m (Murcott <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2012</xref>).</p><p id="Par25">More than 27% of the shallow groundwater aquifers in Bangladesh have been found to have As concentrations in excess of 50 µg/l (Khan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2000</xref>; BGS and DPHE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2001</xref>) posing a serious threat to 90% of rural populations consuming the water from 4–5 million tube wells anchored in these shallow water aquifers (Ahmed et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2014</xref>). In 2009 an estimated 5.6 million people were exposed above 200 µg/l (200 ppb) and in extreme health danger (UNICEF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2011</xref>). This concentration is four times the Bangladesh standard and 20 times over the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline value (WHO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2018</xref>). It was estimated that in 2012 about 19 million people in Bangladesh were still exposed to arsenic concentrations above the national standard of 50 µg/L, with fifty out of the 64 districts in the country having an arsenic concentration in the groundwater exceeding this level (Rahman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2018</xref>).

Physical infrastructure can provide a range of solutions ranging from adopting alternative water sources or removal of arsenic through filters and chemical treatment. One of the key themes from the literature is that the most preferred alternative water source is the use of deep tube wells (DTWs) (approximately &gt; 150 m deep) (Khan and Yang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2014</xref>) because the groundwater from deeper aquifers in arsenic-affected regions is for the most part free from contamination (Sharma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2014</xref>). The primary drawback of DTWs is their high cost that is prohibitive for households without any subsidies or interventions, such that the technology is only applicable on a community basis (Sharma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2014</xref>). This means individuals are likely to have increased walking distances to safe water, which has been shown to be a significant barrier and a reason why individuals persist in using contaminated wells (Shafiquzzaman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2009</xref>; Johnston et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2014</xref>; Khan and Yang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2014</xref>).

However, as long as DTWs are used for domestic water and not irrigation, flow models have shown water from deep aquifers to be viable over the long term (Johnston et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2014</xref>; Sharma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par29">The use of surface water, rainwater harvesting, and dug-well water have the risk of potential biological contamination and require ongoing maintenance by the community, involving appropriate management and accountability (Johnston et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2014</xref>; Chakraborti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2015</xref>). Piped water is a long-term aim and favored option, but the financial costs and practicalities of installation limit its current potential. However, there is already greater household willingness-to-pay for piped water supply than for other alternative arsenic-free water sources, primarily due to convenience (Khan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2014</xref>). Due to the variability of arsenic contamination in shallow groundwater, it is possible in many locations to find uncontaminated wells within reasonable distances. Hence switching to a safe tube well is considered a viable solution (Sharma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2014</xref>). This seems a straightforward option, but it relies on the identification, availability, and knowledge of safe wells, as well as the motivation of individuals to travel further and the absence of social barriers, that is, admittance to privately owned wells (Johnston et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2014</xref>).

Their reliance on maintenance and chemical replacement mean that although they are effective over the short term they cannot be considered a long-term solution.

Due to the delay in the appearance of serious health symptoms, it is easy for individuals to misunderstand the severity of long-term health risks from drinking contaminated water.

Even with the knowledge that the water is contaminated, individuals will still use bad sources because the perceived health implications do not outweigh competing drivers. The delay of serious health impacts reduces the inconvenience threshold, so perception of the hazard and awareness of the benefits to clean water can overcome this obstacle (Khan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2014</xref>). Inconvenience of additional walking distances and opportunity cost of time commitment are limitations to community-based measures and use of DTWs (Shafiquzzaman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2009</xref>; Johnston et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2014</xref>; Khan and Yang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2014</xref>). Similarly, maintenance requirements of arsenic removal technologies and poor flow rates lead to their abandonment (Sanchez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2016</xref>).

There are numerous exposure pathways, whether from eating crops grown in or irrigated by contaminated water; consuming livestock that have been fed with contaminated food/water, or through the use of arsenic-rich water in preparing meals. Groundwater is extensively used for irrigation in the dry season and rice is the most important food group with respect to exposure (Sharma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2014</xref>).

These schemes promote water efficiency as irrigation is limited and puts the crops under a certain degree of water stress. However, given that most surface waters have been exploited for irrigation and the high probability that farmers will continue to use groundwater for irrigation, adopting these mitigation strategies is a crucial step in limiting the exposure (Senanayake and Mukherji <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2014</xref>).

Contact with urban air pollution is unavoidable and affects everyone in a location. However, with arsenic contamination and indoor air quality, individuals have greater opportunity (and in some cases the choice) to prevent their personal exposure to the hazard through behavioral changes, given the knowledge of the hazard and access to possible mitigation actions.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Differentiating environmental hazards in Bangladesh</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13753_2019_239_Fig8_HTML.png" id="MO8"/></fig></p><p id="Par70">For all the hazards there exist short-term mitigation solutions and long-term strategies to eliminate the hazard entirely. In all hazards, uncertainty is a consistent factor. There is a recognized need for better understanding of the extent of the exposures, the health implications, and the economic impacts to stimulate action. But empirical studies into the effectiveness of mitigation solutions to inform decision making are required as well. Addressing the knowledge gaps—such as those related to the sustainability of deep tube wells, or the valued features that drive the uptake of improved cookstoves—will help build a unified response, rather than fragmented and sporadic efforts (World Bank and IHME <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par71">The inclusion of the behavior network in the preceding analysis captures some of the less tangible, but influential factors in the mitigation of the hazards. Of note is the perception of the hazard. This influences the decisions made by individuals at risk through their willingness-to-pay or the level of inconvenience they are prepared to accept to reduce exposure. In all hazards, improved knowledge and understanding is important for effective hazard mitigation.</p><p id="Par72">The enormity of the hazards, and the extended time frame over which they have developed, leads to a lack of responsibility and accountability of institutions. Numerous stakeholders at various levels make the response multidimensional, which in part contributes to a lack of sustained action as they operate with different capabilities and goals.</p><p id="Par73">Even if the hazards were immediately mitigated, there would still be health repercussions for years to come due to the delay in the onset of non-communicable diseases (Krajick and Funkhouser <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2015</xref>). The delayed onset of serious health implications is a significant factor in the system as it affects both the behavior and decisions made by individuals exposed to the hazards, but also the response and action delivered by institutions. The delay in health impacts creates indecisiveness as the urgency is masked and leads to a lack of accountability by policymakers, especially when the prevalence and effects are still being quantified. From the analysis, a high-level characteristic profile that describes the response to stresses is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>. <fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Profile of responses to stresses in Bangladesh</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13753_2019_239_Fig9_HTML.png" id="MO9"/></fig></p><p id="Par74">The ongoing stresses map onto different points in Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>, with different interventions suitable for each hazard, based on their position in the time line. In developing effective responses a focus on education must be a priority because changes in household knowledge, attitudes, and practices are essential. Often change is resisted due to a lack of understanding of the danger, with convenience prevailing over hazard mitigation (UNICEF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2013</xref>). One effective route to improving education could be through the use of schools, training teachers to disseminate the risk knowledge to the students. This not only has a wide reach, but means knowledge stays within the community and is provided by trusted individuals (Khan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par75">Improving the role of government is a key recommendation. Updating and implementing national management plans to a coherent strategy with quantifiable targets will help provide direction (Pearshouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2016</xref>; Krishna et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2017</xref>). However, speeding up implementation requires strengthening the capacity of national agencies and the subdistrict councils by giving them greater decision-making powers, increased funds, and trained manpower. Actions are needed to enforce regulation and eliminate political interference (Johnston et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2014</xref>; Luby et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2015</xref>; Ellis and Roberts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2016</xref>). The focus on non-communicable diseases in the healthcare system is currently less than optimal, and it is not helped by a critical shortage of skilled healthcare professionals (Islam and Biswas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2014</xref>; Islam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2017</xref>). There is an urgent need to strengthen the system so that it can respond more effectively to the growing burden and limit the declining health across the Bangladeshi population (Bleich et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2011</xref>; Islam and Biswas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2014</xref>). Health is a fundamental prerequisite for disaster resilience because without it the ability to achieve good social interaction, sufficient material conditions, and personal security are diminished (Ray-Bennett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2010</xref>; Hossain et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par76">A framework consisting of four networks was used to link the well-being of the Bangladeshi population to the environmental hazards that generate chronic stress in the population. This framework has facilitated cross-comparison between the four prevalent environmental stresses and an insight into the underlying system responses, highlighting barriers to effective mitigation that are in turn hindering the response capacity of the population. Elimination of the continuous hazards will only come about through the culmination of multiple interventions over time, in an iterative manner that relies on the continual advance of hazard understanding. The analysis revealed the significance of behavioral factors in the adoption of mitigation solutions. Equally, improved knowledge and understanding is central to the mitigation of all hazards. Underlying system characteristics, such as the delay in health implications and the sheer magnitude of the hazards, are significant barriers to effective mitigation.
