We have successfully prepared crumpled, sheet-like, sulfur-doped graphene by magnesiothermic reduction of easily available, low-cost, nontoxic CO<sub>2</sub> (in the form of Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) and Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> as the carbon and sulfur sources, respectively. At high temperature, Mg can reduce not only carbon in the oxidation state of +4 in CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup> to form graphene, but also sulfur in SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> from its highest (+6) to lowest valence which was hybridized into the carbon sp<sup>2</sup> framework. Various characterization results show that sulfur-doped graphene with only few layers has an appropriate sulfur content, hierarchically robust porous structure, large surface area/pore volume and highly graphitized textures. The S-doped graphene samples exhibit not only a high activity for ORR with a four-electron pathway, but also superior durability and tolerance to MeOH crossover to 40% Pt/C. This is mainly ascribed to the combination of sulfur-related active sites and hierarchical porous textures, facilitating fast diffusion of oxygen molecules and electrolyte to catalytic sites and release of products from the sites.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>10933</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>20</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep09304.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>14</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep09304" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep09304</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Because of the predicted detrimental effects (<italic>e.g.</italic>, global climate warming) of CO<sub>2</sub> emission, there is growing interest in designing novel materials and technologies for carbon capture and storage, as well as chemical fixation of CO<sub>2</sub> in constructing a future low-carbon global economy. CO<sub>2</sub> emitted from fuel-fired power plant is captured by a well-developed chemical absorption process using aqueous amine-ammonia solutions in industry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> and physisorption between solid adsorbents (<italic>e.g.</italic> zeolites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, mesoporous silicas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, activated carbons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, <italic>etc</italic>) and CO<sub>2</sub> molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> in laboratory research.</p><p>Except for CO<sub>2</sub> capture and storage, chemical utilization of CO<sub>2</sub> is another major concern with respect to the reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emission into the atmosphere. At the same time, it can exploit CO<sub>2</sub> as a non-toxic, economical, environmentally friendly and abundant carbon feedstock for the synthesis of useful chemical compounds. It has been reported that CO<sub>2</sub> could be used as raw materials to produce various valuable compounds including organic carbonates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, urea derivatives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, formic acid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, methanol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, carbon monoxide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> and even diamond<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, <italic>etc</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, in the presence of catalyst/reaction media.

The dye sensitized solar cell with CO<sub>2</sub>-derived graphene as a counter electrode shows a high energy conversion efficiency of 8.1%, 10 times higher than that (0.7%) of a cell with the conventional graphene <italic>via</italic> chemical exfoliation of graphite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Pure graphene with 3D honeycomb-like microstructure was prepared by the reaction of carbon monoxide and lithium oxide, reported by Hu and his co-workers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Herein, we describe a one-pot magnesiothermic reduction strategy to transform CO<sub>2</sub> (in the form of Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) in the presence of Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> as an inorganic sulfur source to graphitized, wrinkled, sulfur-doped graphene with only few layers.</p><p>Since the seminal work of Geim and co-workers on the preparation of single layer graphene (sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized carbon)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, immense excitement has ensued, with graphene and modified graphene structures being shown to have notable and potentially exploitable electronic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, optical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, catalytic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, physical properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Both theoretical and experimental studies have shown that the doping of heteroatoms (<italic>e.g.</italic> nitrogen (N, electronegativity: 3.04), phosphorus (P, electronegativity: 2.19), sulfur (S, electronegativity: 2.58), boron (B, electronegativity: 2.04), <italic>etc</italic>) with distinct electronegativity with respect to carbon atoms (electronegativity: 2.55) into sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized carbon frameworks can remarkably modify their electronic structures and chemical activities as well as the Fermi level of the host. This strategy is simple and efficient to improve the properties of graphene. At the same time, the robust framework and most of the intrinsic properties of graphene are maintained after the doping of the heteroatoms. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and the solvothermal pathway have been adopted to produce doped graphene using liquid precursors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the synthesis of heteroatom-doped graphene from natural graphite generally needs two steps: (I) the oxidation of graphite resulting in the formation of graphene oxide (GO); (II) post-reacting GO with various N-, P-, or B-containing precursors (<italic>e.g.</italic> urea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, ammonia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, tribenzylphosphine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, boric acid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, <italic>etc</italic>). Compared to N- (or B-) doped graphenes, little attention has been paid to the doping of S atoms into the graphene framework<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, although S-doped graphene has great potential as the electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which is of high industrial importance in fuel cells.</p><p>S-containing functionalities have been successfully incorporated into the sp<sup>2</sup> carbon lattice by two procedures: (I) CVD technique using liquid organics and (II) the pyrolysis of GO and S-containing precursors. For example, Gao and co-workers reported the formation of S-doped graphene on Cu foil using liquid S-hexane mixture vapor at 950°C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. However, the S content is as low as 0.6 at% and most of sulfur atoms exist in the linear nanodomain (2 ~ 4 nm) other than doped S atoms. The pyrolysis of BDS and GO at 600 ~ 1050°C leads to S-doped graphenes with 1.3–2.1 at% S atoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. The resulting S-doped graphene shows good electrocatalytic activity for ORR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> and it is also used as the support of synthesizing ultrathin Pt nanowires demonstrating higher catalytic activities toward methanol oxidation reaction compared with commercial Pt/C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Thermal exfoliation of GO in H<sub>2</sub>S, SO<sub>2</sub> or CS<sub>2</sub> gas is an efficient procedure of doping graphene lattice with S atoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> and the extent of S doping is evidently dependent on the type of GO used than the type of S gas atmosphere utilized during the synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. The H<sub>2</sub>S-treated GO at 500 ~ 900°C has the content of 1.2–1.7 at% S, which was employed as metal-free electrocatalysts for ORR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Furthermore, S- and N-dual-doped graphene materials were also prepared from GO using BDS/thiourea/thiophene as the S source and melamine/urea/pyrimidine as the N source, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, or ammonium thiocyanate as the N/S dual-containing precursors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Also, the synthesis of S-doped graphene using expensive GO (Sigma-Aldrich, product number: 763713, Price: 234 GBP/g) and toxic S-containing organics/gas in the reduced of forms rather than the oxidized forms generally abundantly present in nature is practically exclusively done at present. At the same time, the use of harmful S-containing (H<sub>2</sub>S, SO<sub>2</sub> and CS<sub>2</sub>) gas flow as the S source could result in the production of large amount of exhaust waste. It is, however, yet a big challenge to directly generate S-doped graphene from easily available, low-cost, nontoxic Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> and Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> inorganic oxide salts as the C and S sources, respectively.</p><p>Herein, we have employed a one-step magnesiothermic reduction strategy to transform greenhouse gas CO<sub>2</sub> (in the form of Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) in the presence of small amount of Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> as an inorganic S source to form S-doped graphene, as shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. At high temperatures, Mg metal could reduce carbon in the oxidation state of +4 in CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup> to form black graphene products. At the same time, the SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> ions could supply S atoms to build C-S sp<sup>2</sup> bonds integrated into the graphene lattice; S in its highest oxidation state of +6 in SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> is reduced to the lowest valence by Mg metal. It is observed that S-doping has a great influence on the morphologies of graphene sheets. Thus, the present novel procedure can efficiently reduce the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the atmosphere by chemically fixing carbon in CO<sub>2</sub> to valuable doped, high-quality graphene. We also showed that the as-formed S-doped graphene materials demonstrate high electrocatalytic activity for ORR with a dominant four-electron reaction pathway, as well as excellent durability and MeOH crossover compared to commercial Pt/C catalyst. Thus they can be considered as ideal candidates as metal-free ORR electrocatalysts.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The schematic illustration implying the production of S-doped graphene by magnesiothermic reduction of CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup> in the presence of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> in an Ar flow.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep09304_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>After the pyrolysis of the mixture of Mg powder and Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, the product has a dark black color, suggesting the formation of a graphitic structure. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a–b</xref> show the morphologies of pure carbon-based graphene (CG) prepared by pyrolysing the physical mixture of Mg and Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> at 800°C (CG-800), observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Low-magnification SEM image shows that CG-800 has a loose, porous structure (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). At high magnification, CG-800 is constituted of many crumpled and wrinkled sheets with sharp edges (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). The morphologies of these sheets with sizes of 100 ~ 200 nm are similar to those of sheet-like petals forming a flower. The yield of CG-800 is 55% calculated by the ratio of moles of graphene to Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>. This yield decreases a little to 48% when using Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> as a sulfur source added into the physical mixture to produce S-doped graphene (SG-800). SG-800 exhibits a similar morphology to that of CG-800, confirmed by low-magnification SEM image (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>). However, high-resolution SEM image indicates that SG-800 is porous and composed of irregular sheets and particles without any sharp edges (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>). This finding suggests that sulfate added took part in the reaction and thus changed the morphologies of the resulting S-doped graphene nanostructures. The sheet-like graphene nanostructures were also observed in those prepared by the carbonization of glucose in molten salts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>SEM images of CG-800 (a, b) and SG-800 (c, d).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep09304_Fig2_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>Further observation on the morphology difference between pure graphene and S-doped graphene was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref> (also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>), it is clear that CG-800 is composed of large, perfect two-dimensional (2D) sheets with the crumples, implying a 2D sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized nature. At the edge of the sheet, high-resolution TEM images clearly exhibit the signature image of the few-layer graphene with the number of lower than 10 layers (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). In <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>, the steps are formed at the edge of a graphene sheet due to the increment of graphene layers (from 1 to 6 layers). The morphologies of CG-800 prepared using Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> as the carbon source are different from those of graphenes prepared using CO<sub>2</sub> or CaCO<sub>3</sub> as the carbon source<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, implying the great influences of different carbon sources on final graphene materials. Moreover, the introduction of sulfate salt also significantly changed the morphologies of graphene products, as shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref> (also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). The resulting SG-800 demonstrates crumpled, porous structures which are distinct from CG-800. In most areas, the hollow spherical graphene nanostructures with more distorted morphology can be clearly observed in SG-800 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>).

These data slightly decrease to 188–199 m<sup>2</sup>/g and 1.383–1.604 cm<sup>3</sup>/g, respectively, for S-doped samples compared with those of pure graphenes. Among these S-doped graphenes, the sample prepared at 800°C demonstrates the largest specific surface area and pore volume. The specific surface areas of these graphenes are significantly lower than the theoretical surface area of 2630 m<sup>2</sup>/g for individual isolated graphene sheets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>, but they are comparable to those of N-doped thermally reduced GO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. The graphenes hardly adsorb nitrogen in the low relative pressure range, implying no micropores in these samples. This fact also hints that the resulting graphene layers are perfectly crystallized and no micropores are formed on the graphene layers during the magnesiothermic reduction. The hysteresis loop is located in the relative pressure (P/P<sub>0</sub>) of 0.45–1.0, which might be a result of small mesopores and intersheet textural large pores. The pore size distribution curves of pure graphenes and S-doped graphenes calculated by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model, show a single well-defined peak at 3.8 nm in all curves, implying that all graphene samples have narrow mesopores.

These voltammograms show that S-doped graphenes have higher selectivity for ORR with a remarkable improved ability to avoid the cross effects than commercial Pt/C. It is mainly ascribed to the highly graphitized nanostructures, which increase both the electronic conductivity and corrosion resistance of SG-800.

And sulfur in sulfate also can be reduced from its highest oxidation state to lowest valence and hybridized into the carbon sp<sup>2</sup> framework. The resulting graphenes possess crumpled, sheet-like nanostructures with hierarchically porous textures and the addition of sulfate during the magnesiothermic reaction results in the formation of S-doped graphenes with more distorted nanostructures. The sulfur doping of the graphene framework evidently decreases the ORR onset potentials and increases limited current densities compared with pure graphenes. The resulting S-doped graphenes demonstrate not only high electrocatalytic activity for ORR with a four-electron reaction pathway, but also much better stability and increased tolerance to MeOH crossover effects than commercial Pt/C. The high activity for ORR of S-doped graphenes is mainly ascribed to highly graphitized structures, S-related active sites and hierarchically porous textures. The present magnesiothermic reduction procedure is being investigated in the preparation of other heteroatom-doped (<italic>e.g.</italic> P and B) graphene materials potentially utilized in the fields of electrocatalysis, batteries, supercapacitors, biosensors, <italic>etc</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Synthesis of S-doped graphene</title><p>Anhydrous Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> and Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> were used as the C and S sources, respectively and magnesium (Mg) powder were utilized as the reducing reagent. A calculated amount of these powders were mixed together and then put onto an alumina boat which was inserted into a stainless steel tube. The reaction temperature was controlled to be 700, 800, or 900°C for 1 h at a ramp of 5°C/min under argon (Ar) atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, the resulting black solids were dispersed in sufficient 10% HCl solution and vigorously stirred for 4 h to remove any inorganic impurities. The carbon was collected by filtration and purified by distilled water and ethanol for three times each. Finally, the filtered product was dried at 80°C overnight and further annealed in Ar atmosphere. And the resulting S-doped graphene was denoted as SG-<italic>X</italic>, where SG is the abbreviation of S-doped graphene and <italic>X</italic> stands for the magnesiothermic reaction temperature in °C. For comparison, pure carbon-based graphene (CG) samples were synthesized by magnesiothermic reduction of Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> without any Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Structural characterization</title><p>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the graphene were recorded using a JEOL 2010F electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) attachment operating at 200 kV. Samples for analysis were deposited on a thin amorphous porous carbon film supported by copper grid from ultrasonically processed ethanol solutions. The morphology of the graphene was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a field emission microscope (S-4800, Hitachi). Samples were mounted using a conductive carbon double-sided sticky tape. Raman spectra were recorded on a DXR Raman Microscope (Thermal Scientific Co., USA) with 532 nm excitation length. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out on a Rigaku D/MAX-2250 V diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded with an ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with Al Kα (<italic>hυ</italic> = 1486.6 eV) radiation. The graphene powders were glued onto indium (In) metal particles by pressing for measurements. All spectra were calibrated using 285.0 eV as the line position of adventitious carbon. Nitrogen sorption isotherms were measured using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 surface area and pore size analyzer at liquid nitrogen temperature (−196°C). Prior to measurement, the hierarchically porous materials were dehydrated under vacuum at 200°C overnight. The specific surface areas were calculated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The total pore volume was calculated from the amount of nitrogen adsorbed at a relative pressure of 0.99. The pore size distribution curves were calculated from the analysis of the desorption branch of the isotherm using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Electrode preparation and electrochemical measurements</title><p>The graphene sample (5 mg) was dispersed in the mixture of 0.5 mL water and 0.5 mL ethanol under ultrasonic irradiation for <italic>ca</italic>. 2 h. Then 5% Nafion solution (25 μL) was added into the above suspension and the further ultrasonic treatment was performed until a homogeneous ink was formed. 20 μL ink containing 62.5 μg catalyst was transferred onto the glassy rotating disk electrode with 5 mm diameter, yielding a catalyst level of 0.32 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>. For 40% Pt/C commercial catalyst (JM company), 31.2 μg catalyst was deposited on the glassy rotating disk electrode. The electrode with the catalyst was dried at 50°C which was used as the working electrode for further electrochemical measurements. Electrochemical activity of the working electrode was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and rotating disk electrode (RDE) using a standard three-electrode cell with a Pt plate as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. An aqueous solution of 0.1 M KOH was used as the electrolyte for the electrochemical studies. The electrochemical cell was controlled by a bipotentiostat (Pine Instrument Co.) equipped with a RDE. Prior to the measurements, the electrolyte was saturated by bubbling O<sub>2</sub> or N<sub>2</sub> for 15 min. The working electrode was cycled at least thirty times before the CV data were recorded at a scan rate of 50 mV/s. The RDE measurements were performed at different rotating rates varying from 400 to 2025 rpm with the scan rate of 5 mV/s.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, the One Hundred Talent Plan of Chinese Academy of Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 21307145), the Youth Science and Technology Talents “Sail” Program of Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Commission (NO. 15YF1413800) and the Research Grant (No. 14DZ2261200) from Shanghai Government for the Financial Support.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>J.W. performed the experiments and wrote the manuscript; R.M., Z.Z. and G.L. analyzed the data; Q.L. designed the experiments; all authors reviewed the manuscript.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement"><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare no competing financial interests.</p></sec></sec><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Belloni, A., Ahner, C. &amp; Häring, H.-W.
