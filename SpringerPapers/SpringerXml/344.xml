It is also triggered with the impact of climate change. For sustainable management of soil salinity, it is essential to diagnose it properly prior to take proper intervention measures. In this chapter soil salinity (dryland and secondary) and sodicity concepts have been introduced to make it easier for readers. A hypothetical soil salinity development cycle has been presented. Causes of soil salinization and its damages, socio-economic and environmental impacts, and visual indicators of soil salinization and sodicity have been reported. A new relationship between ECe (mS/cm) and total soluble salts (meq/l) established on UAE soils has been reported which is different to that established by US Salinity Laboratory Staff in the year 1954, suggesting the latter is specific to US soils, therefore, other countries should establish similar relationships based on their local conditions. Procedures for field assessment of soil salinity and sodicity are described and factors to convert EC of different soil:water (1:1, 1:2.5 &amp; 1:5) suspensions to ECe from different regions are tabulated and hence providing useful information to those adopting such procedures. Diversified salinity assessment, mapping and monitoring methods, such as conventional (field and laboratory) and modern (electromagnetic-EM38, optical-thin section and electron microscopy, geostatistics-kriging, remote sensing and GIS, automatic dynamics salinity logging system) have been used and results are reported providing comprehensive information for selection of suitable methods by potential users. Globally accepted soil salinity classification systems such as US Salinity Lab Staff and FAO-UNESCO have been included.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Salinity</kwd><kwd>Sodicity</kwd><kwd>Diagnostics</kwd><kwd>Electromagnetic</kwd><kwd>Geostatistics</kwd><kwd>GIS</kwd><kwd>Kriging</kwd><kwd>Electron microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>chapter-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>chapter-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/978-3-319-96190-3_Chapter_1.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></book-part-meta><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Soil is a non-renewable resource; once lost, can’t be recovered in a human lifespan. Soil salinity, the second major cause of land degradation after soil erosion, has been a cause of decline in agricultural societies for 10,000 years. Globally about 2000 ha of arable land is lost to production every day due to salinization. Salinization can cause yield decreases of 10–25% for many crops and may prevent cropping altogether when it is severe and lead to desertification. Addressing soil salinization through improved soil, water and crop management practices is important for achieving food security and to avoid desertification.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>What Is Soil Salinity?</title><p id="Par3">Soil salinity is a measure of the concentration of all the soluble salts in soil water, and is usually expressed as electrical conductivity (EC). The major soluble mineral salts are the cations: sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>), calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>), magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>), potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) and the anions: chloride (Cl<sup>−</sup>), sulfate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>), bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>), carbonate (CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup>), and nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>). Hyper-saline soil water may also contain boron (B), selenium (Se), strontium (Sr), lithium (Li), silica (Si), rubidium (Rb), fluorine (F), molybdenum (Mo), manganese (Mn), barium (Ba), and aluminum (Al), some of which can be toxic to plants and animals (Tanji <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">1990</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">From the point of view of defining saline soils, when the electrical conductivity of a soil extract from a saturated paste (ECe) equals, or exceeds 4 deci Siemens per meter (dS m<sup>−1</sup>) at 25 °C, the soil is said to be saline (USSL Staff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">1954</xref>), and this definition remains in the latest glossary of soil science in the USA.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Units of Soil Salinity</title><p id="Par5">Salinity is generally expressed as total dissolved solutes (TDS) in milli gram per liter (mg l<sup>−1</sup>) or parts per million (ppm). It can also be expressed as total soluble salts (TSS) in milli equivalents per liter (meq l<sup>−1</sup>).</p><p id="Par6">The salinity (EC) was originally measured as milli mhos per cm (mmho cm<sup>−1</sup>), an old unit which is now obsolete. Soil Science has now adopted the Systeme International d’Unites (known as SI units) in which mho has been replaced by Siemens (S). Currently used SI units for EC are:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par7">milli Siemens per centimeter (mS cm<sup>−1</sup>) or</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par8">deci Siemens per meter (dS m<sup>−1</sup>)</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par9">The units can be presented as:</p><p id="Par10">1 mmho cm<sup>−1</sup> = 1 dS m<sup>−1</sup> = 1 mS cm<sup>−1</sup> = 1000 micro Siemens per cm (1000 μS cm<sup>−1</sup>)</p><p id="Par11"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par12">EC readings are usually taken and reported at a standard temperature of 25 °C.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par13">For accurate results, EC meter should be checked with 0.01 N solution of KCl, which should give a reading of 1.413 dS m<sup>−1</sup> at 25 °C.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par14">No fixed relationship exists between TDS and EC, although a factor of 640 is commonly used to convert EC (dS m<sup>−1</sup>) to approximate TDS. For highly concentrated solutions, a factor of 800 is used to account for the suppressed ionization effect on EC.</p><p id="Par15">Similarly, no one relationship exists between ECe and total soluble salts (TSS), although a factor of 10 is used to convert ECe (dS m<sup>−1</sup>) to TSS (expressed in meq l<sup>−1</sup>) in the EC range of 0.1–5 dS m<sup>−1</sup> (USSL Staff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">1954</xref>). One relationship between ECe and TSS is presented in the Agriculture Handbook 60 (USSL Staff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">1954</xref>). This relationship was developed using USA soils and has been widely used (worldwide) for over six decades. No efforts have been made to validate this relationship in other soils, though recently Shahid et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2013</xref>) have published a similar relationship for sandy desert soils ranging from low salinity (desert sand) to hyper-saline soils (coastal lands) in the Abu Dhabi Emirate. This latter work established a relationship between ECe and TSS which differs significantly from that of USSL Staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">1954</xref>), thus, opening the way for other countries to develop country-specific relationships which will allow better prediction and management of their saline and saline-sodic soils.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Why Total Soluble Salts <italic>Versus</italic> ECe Relationship Is Required?</title><sec><p id="Par16">Laboratories in some developing countries do not generally have modern equipment, i.e. flame emission spectrophotometer (FES), atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS), or inductively coupled plasma (ICP) in order to analyze soil saturation extracts or water samples for soluble Na<sup>+</sup> to determine sodicity (sodium adsorption ratio <bold>–</bold> SAR). In contrast, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> are easy to measure using a titration method, one which does not require modern instruments. Currently, these laboratories in many developing countries determine soluble Na<sup>+</sup> by calculating the difference between the total soluble salts (TSS) and the quantities of Ca<sup>2+</sup> + Mg<sup>2+</sup> in order to make the analyses affordable, as below:</p></sec><sec><p id="Par17"><disp-formula id="Equa"><alternatives><mml:math display="block" id="Equa_Math"><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">Na</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:msup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfenced close="]" open="["><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced close=")" open="("><mml:mrow><mml:mspace width="0.25em"/><mml:mtext mathvariant="bold">Total soulble salts</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mspace width="0.25em"/><mml:mtext mathvariant="bold">minus</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="0.25em"/><mml:mfenced close=")" open="("><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">Ca</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn mathvariant="bold">2</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">Mg</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn mathvariant="bold">2</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math><tex-math id="Equa_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

However, if this water is used over a long period without managing for salinity, a significant quantity of salts will be added into soil. A simple example is given below.</p><p id="Par63">Assume that fresh water (EC 0.2 dS m<sup>−1</sup>) is used for irrigating the crop and 8500 cubic meters per hectare (850 mm) of this water is used over the entire crop season. The water of EC 0.2 dS m<sup>−1</sup> contains approximately 128 mg l<sup>−1</sup> salts (0.2 × 640) which are equivalent to 0.128 kg per cubic meter of irrigation water. Over the crop season, 1088 kg of salts will, thus, be added to each hectare with the irrigation water. If we assume that the dry matter harvested from each hectare is about 15 metric tons, and there is 3.5% by weight of total salts in the harvested crop biomass, then the portion of salt harvested with the crop is 525 kg. This leaves 563 kg of salts in the soil directly or in the plant parts (belowground, stubbles, debris) which will be returned to the soil by cultivation and subsequent decay of the plant biomass left in the field. This example is a very conservative one. It is more likely that water of a higher salinity will be used for irrigation. Thus, a salinity management program needs to be implemented for virtually all irrigated agricultural crops, especially those growing in low natural rainfall areas.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Salinity Development in Soils – A Hypothetical Cycle</title><p id="Par64">Recently Shahid et al.

There are many causes of the rising water table, e.g. restricted drainage due to an impermeable layer, and when deep-rooted trees are replaced with shallow-rooted annual crops. Under such conditions, the groundwater dissolves salts embedded in rocks in the soil, with the salty water eventually reaching the soil surface, and evaporating to cause salinity. Dryland salinity can also occur in un-irrigated landscapes. There are no quick fixes to dryland salinity, though modern technologies in assessment and monitoring can allow one to follow and better understand how salinity develops. The most important of these new technologies utilizes the interpretation of remote sensing imaging over a period of time.</p><p id="Par66">The potential technologies to mitigate dryland salinity include the pumping of saline groundwater and its safe disposal or use, as well as the development of alternate crop plant production systems to maximize saline groundwater use, such as deep-rooted trees. Such a deep-rooted trees system utilizes groundwater and lowers water table, the process called <bold><italic>biodrainage</italic></bold> (or biological drainage). In Australia dryland salinity is a major problem, one which costs Australia over $250 million a year from impacts on agriculture, water quality and the natural environment.

It has, generally, been recognized that the sodicity affects soil permeability appreciably. The swelling and dispersion of soil clays ultimately destroys the original soil structure – likely the most important physical property affecting plant growth. The soil bulk density (the weight of soil in a given volume) and porosity (open spaces between sand, silt and clay particles in a soil) are mainly used as parameters for the soil structure. The hydraulic conductivity (the ease with which water can move through the soil pore spaces) is the net result of the effect of physical properties in the soil and is markedly affected by soil structure development. The effect of the sodicity of soil water on irrigated soils can be both a surface phenomenon, i.e. showing <bold><italic>surface sealing</italic></bold>, as well as a subsurface phenomenon (Box <xref rid="FPar5" ref-type="">1.2</xref>), one where <bold><italic>subsurface sealing</italic></bold> also occurs (Shahid et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">1992</xref>). In surface sealing, the soil water sodicity causes a breakdown and slaking of soil aggregates due to wetting. When the soil surface dries, a surface crust is formed. In subsurface sealing, the clay particles in the soil are dispersed and translocate to subsurface layers, where they are then deposited on the surface of the voids, thereby reducing void volume and blocking the pores, thus restricting further water movement, e.g. yielding non-conducting pores.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par139">The surface sealing and crusting due to either water sodicity, or through combined effects of sodicity and raindrop splash action, have both positive and negative effects.</p></sec><sec id="FPar5"><title>Box 1.2: Effect of Saline-Sodic Waters on Soil Hydraulic Conductivity and Structure in a Simulated System</title><p id="Par165">In a simulated system developed and used by Shahid and Jenkins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">1992a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">c</xref>) for quick screening of soils with regard to their salinity and sodicity, a laboratory experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of saline-sodic water on soil structure and hydraulic conductivity (Shahid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1993</xref>).

It is important to note that EC measurements based on extracts obtained from saturated soil paste or suspensions of fixed soil:water ratios (commonly 1:1, 1:2.5 or 1:5) do not give reliable correlations. Such extracts, or extracts with a wider soil:water ratio are, however, more convenient where the ability to sample soils properly is limited.

McNeill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1980</xref>) was among the first investigators to describe how the EMI method can be used in assessing soil salinity. He presented the theoretical basis for the use of EM ground conductivity meters to map lateral variation in subsurface electrical conductivity. The approach, and the instrumentation developed (GEONICS EM31, EM34-3, EM38), gained almost immediate acceptance as a replacement for the traditional use of the 4-electrode resistivity (galvanic) traversing techniques, especially when it was demonstrated that the two types of soil surveys produced very similar results (Cameron et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1981</xref>).</p></sec><sec><p id="Par231">Accordingly, the spatial distribution of soil salinity on the individual field (Cameron et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1981</xref>), the agricultural farm (Norman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1995a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">b</xref>), as well as district (Vaughan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">1995</xref>) and the regional (Williams and Baker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">1982</xref>) scales has been described. Baerends et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1990</xref>) used the EM38 for a detailed salinity survey in an experimental area of 37 ha. They measured electrical conductivity of the soil at more than 3600 locations, reporting significant difference between the salinity of barren, fallow and cropped fields. Thus, barren fields have a high salinity, fallow fields a moderate salinity, and the cropped fields showed the lowest salinity. Baerends et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1990</xref>) found good agreement between the EM38 survey and the results of the visual agronomic salinity survey, with EM38 survey yielding results with a better resolution.

The EM readings can be made with the sensor positioned at several different heights above the ground in both horizontal (EMH) and vertical (EMV) magnetic coil configurations. By this adjustment, each stop requires about 20–30 s, with multiple readings being needed to calculate ECa (and, in turn, salinity) within soil depths of 0–30, 30–60, 60–90, and 90–120 cm. The intensive data set of salinity by depth and location can also be used to assess the adequacy of past leaching/drainage practices (Rhoades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1992</xref>). For example, where salinity decreases with depth in the profile, the net flux of water (and salt) can be interpreted as being upward. This is reflective of inadequate leaching and/or poor drainage. Where salinity increases with depth in the soil profile, the net flux of water and salt can be inferred as being downward. This finding would be indicative of the adequacy of leaching/drainage. However, when salinity is low and relatively uniform with increasing depth, leaching is interpreted as excessive, probably contributing to waterlogging elsewhere, with a high salt loading of the receiving water supplies.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par233">Rhoades and Ingvalson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">1971</xref>) showed that soil salinity in the field could also be assessed with a conventional geo-electrical method.

Elaborating the same technique, Rhoades and Van Schilfgaarde (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1976</xref>) developed another electrical conductivity probe for measuring soil salinity distribution with increasing depth. With this probe, soil salinity is measured at specific depths in the root-zone. Thus, four electrode techniques can be successfully used for surveys of saline soils (Nadler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1981</xref>; Halvorson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1977</xref>).</p></sec><sec><p id="Par234">Williams and Baker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">1982</xref>) first recognized the possibility of using EM meters for reconnaissance surveys of soil salinity variation. The high values of apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) measured by the EM meters were positively correlated with increased amounts of salts in the soil. The correlation led to empirical relationships (Rhoades et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1989</xref>; Cook et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1992</xref>; Acworth and Beasley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1998</xref>) that allow a prediction of soil salinity based on the measurement of the ECa. The correlation between salt content and the ECa is very high for zones of uniform soil material; though with zones showing different electrical conductivity, it is necessary to obtain separate values of ECa for each zone.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par235">There is an electrical conductivity image method which provides an alternative approach. Here, the ECa function is sampled extensively in the vertical plane using a 4-electrode array. The method was described by Acworth and Griffiths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1985</xref>) and Griffiths and Baker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1993</xref>) but has not been widely used. There was difficulty in creating a starting model distribution of ECa values and extensive time consuming work was required in ‘forward modeling’ of the ECa data to achieve a match with the field data. Even so, the devices are used regularly for soil salinity surveys in different parts of the world (Boivin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1988</xref>; Job et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1987</xref>; Williams and Hoey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">1987</xref>). The main advantages of the EC image method are: i) measurements can be taken almost as fast as one can walk from one measurement location to another, and ii) the large volume of soil which is measured reduces the variability so that relatively fewer measurements yield a reliable estimate of the field’s mean salinity.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par236">In one study (Nettleton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">1994</xref>), the EM induction approach has been extended to identification of sodium-affected soils.

Shahid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2013</xref>) has recently made efforts to compile this work in order to provide useful information to the potential users of these tools in soil salinity research. A comprehensive review is presented in the following section.</p><p id="Par254">Salinity mapping can be accomplished by integrating RS and GIS techniques at both broad and small scales. The primary objective of reviewing publications dealing with these two techniques is to allow the prediction of sites vulnerable to the ‘salinity menace’. GIS is a computer application that involves the storage, analysis, retrieval, and display of data that are described in terms of their geographic location. The most familiar type of spatial data is a map – GIS is really a way of storing map information electronically. A GIS map has a number of advantages over old-style maps, a primary advantage being the fact that because the data are stored electronically, they can be analyzed readily by computer. In the case of soil salinity, scientists can use data on rainfall, topography and soil type (indeed, any spatial information that is available electronically can be used) to determine the factors which make soils highly susceptible to salinization with the aim of being able to predict other (similar) regions that may be at risk.</p><p id="Par255">RS imagery is well suited to map the surface expression of salinity (Spies and Woodgate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2005</xref>). For example, a poor cover of vegetation could be an indication of salinity, especially when combined with information on depth of soil to groundwater. The goal of such an exercise is to assess and map soil salinity in order to better understand the problem, and then provide information on how to take necessary actions to prevent increases in salinization of new areas over time. And finally, we need to know how to best manage salinity for sustainable use of land resources.</p><p id="Par256">Salinized and cropped areas can be identified and assigned a salinity index based on greenness and brightness – one that indicates leaf moisture of plants being influenced by salinity. Here, classical false-color composites of separated bands can be used, or a computer-assisted land-surface classification can be developed (Vincent et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">1996</xref>). A brightness index detects brightness as representing a high level of salinity. Satellite images can help in assessing the extent of saline areas and can monitor changes in real time. Saline fields are often identified by the presence of spotty white patches of precipitated salts. Such precipitates usually occur in elevated or un-vegetated areas, where evaporation has left salt residues. Such salt crusts, which can be detected on satellite images, are, however, not reliable evidence of high salinity in the root-zone. Another limitation in salinity mapping with multispectral imagery is where saline soils support productive plant growth such as areas of biosaline agriculture. There, plant cover obscures direct sensing of the soil because salt tolerant plants cannot be differentiated from other ground cover, unless extensive on-site ground investigations are made to corroborate the information.</p><p id="Par257">However, RS can provide useful information for large areas with differing water and salt balances and can identify parameters such as evapotranspiration, rainfall distribution, interception losses, and crop types and crop intensities that can be used as indirect measures of salinity and waterlogging as evidence in the absence of direct estimates (Ahmad <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec47"><title>Global Use of Remote Sensing in Salinity Mapping and Monitoring</title><p id="Par258">Salinity mapping and monitoring by using RS and GIS are common in many countries and such procedures have recently been used in Kuwait and Abu Dhabi Emirate as part of the National Soil Inventories (KISR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1999a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">b</xref>; Shahid et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2002</xref>; EAD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2009</xref>).

Here, GIS was used to integrate the available data and information to design the model, and to create different maps.

It is widely used in fields where ‘spatial’ data is studied. Geo-statistical estimation is a two-stage process. First step is studying the gathered data to establish the predictability of values from place-to-place within the study area. This results in a graph known as a semi-variogram, which models the difference between a value at one location and the value at another location according to the distance and direction between them. The second step is estimating values at those locations which have not been sampled. This process is known as ‘kriging’. The basic technique ‘ordinary kriging’ uses a weighted average of neighboring samples to estimate the ‘unknown’ value at a given location. Weights are optimized using the semi-variogram model, the locations of the samples, and all the relevant interrelationships between known and unknown values. The technique also provides a ‘standard error’ which may be used to calculate confidence levels. In mining, geo-statistics is extensively used in the field of mineral resource and reserve valuation, e.g. the estimation of grades and other parameters from a relatively small set of boreholes or other samples. Geo-statistics is now widely used in geological and geographical applications. However, the techniques are also used in such diverse fields as hydrology, groundwater, soil salinity mapping, and weather prediction. The application of geo-statistical techniques, such as ordinary- and co-kriging, have been applied to salinity survey data in an effort to represent more accurately the spatial distribution of soil salinity (Boivin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1988</xref>; Vaughan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">1995</xref>).</p><p id="Par263">In order to develop soil salinity maps, two approaches: Kriging and Inverse distance weighted (IDW) can be used, as explained below (Source: <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.esri.com" ext-link-type="uri">www.esri.com</ext-link>).</p><sec id="Sec49"><title>Kriging</title><p id="Par264">Kriging is an advanced geo-statistical procedure that generates an estimated surface from a scattered set of points with z-values (elevation) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">1.7</xref>). Kriging assumes that the distance or direction between sample points reflects a spatial correlation that can be used to explain variation in the surface. The Kriging tool fits a mathematical function to a specified number of points, or to all points within a specified radius, in order to determine the output value for each location. As noted above, Kriging is a multistep process; it includes exploratory statistical analysis of the data, variogram modeling, creating the surface, and (optionally) exploring a variance surface. Kriging is most appropriate when you know there is a spatially correlated distance or directional bias in the data. It is often used in soil science and geology.<fig id="Fig14"><label>Fig. 1.7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Kriging method to generate salinity map</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/466735_1_En_1_Fig14_HTML.png" id="MO14"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec50"><title>Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) Interpolation</title><p id="Par265">Inverse distance weighted interpolation determines cell values using a linearly weighted combination of a set of sample points (Fig. <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">1.8</xref>).

Soil thin sections are prepared by impregnating the saline soils with resin and hardened. After the resin has fully polymerized, the impregnated samples are cut into slices with diamond saw. The impregnated block is washed with petroleum spirit in an ultrasonic bath. One face of the impregnated soil block is then ground and polished successively with 6 and 3 μm diamond paste using Hyprez fluid as lubricant on polishing and lapping machine. The polished block is stuck to glass slide using resin and then ground to 25 μm thicknesses using lapping and polishing machine (Shahid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1988</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="FPar14"><title>Micromorphology</title><p id="Par270">submicroscopy: Is the resolution of details at the submicroscopic level (Plate <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">1.8</xref> bottom right) using an electron microscope (scanning and transmission). For submicroscopic investigation, the base of the sample and the surface of the stub are painted with a silver colloid suspension by a brush and then sample is mounted onto the stub using normal araldite. The prepared mounted samples are either carbon coated under vacuum or coated with a layer of gold-palladium (20–30 nm thick) to prevent charge buildup on the specimen, and to hold the surface of the sample and a constant electric potential. The prepared samples are then studied using the scanning electron microscopy.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par271">The above details can be obtained as required. The microscopy techniques can also be combined. For example, Bisdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1980</xref>) coupled optical microscopy with submicroscopic methods and later with contact microradiography (Drees and Wilding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1983</xref>).

To study salt crusts at the submicroscopic level, soil samples need coating with gold-palladium (an alloy), or carbon applied to salt crusts is needed to make the sample a conductor.
