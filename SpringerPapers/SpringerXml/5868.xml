Crews appointed with constructing and establishing planetary bases will require a superior level of physical ability to cope with the operational demands. However, the challenging environments of nearby planets (e.g. geological, atmospheric, gravitational conditions) as well as the lengthy journeys through microgravity, will lead to progressive tissue degradation and an increased susceptibility to injury. The isolation, distance and inability to evacuate in an emergency will require autonomous medical support, as well as a range of facilities and specialised equipment to repair tissue damage on-site. Here, we discuss the design requirements of such a facility, in the form of a habitat that would concomitantly allow tissue substitute production, maintenance and surgical implantation, with an emphasis on connective tissues. The requirements for the individual modules and their operation are identified. Several concepts are assessed, including the presence of adjacent wet lab and medical modules supporting the gradual implementation of regenerative biomaterials and acellular tissue substitutes, leading to eventual tissue grafts and, in subsequent decades, potential tissues/organ-like structures. The latter, currently in early phases of development, are assessed particularly for researching the effects of extreme conditions on representative analogues for astronaut health support. Technical solutions are discussed for bioengineering in an isolated planetary environment with hypogravity, from fluid-gel bath suspended manufacture to cryostorage, cell sourcing and on-site resource utilisation for laboratory infrastructure. Surgical considerations are also discussed.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Centre for the Replacement Refinement and Reduction of

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Ongoing technological advancements and the recent launch of the first phase of Artemis I (on November 16<sup>th</sup> 2022) are making a human return to the Moon and a first manned mission to Mars increasingly feasible. Detailed strategic plans have been created for the past 50 years by space agencies and governments (e.g. the Human Research Program at NASA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, ESA’s Space Resources Strategy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>) for efficiently utilising outer space resources and establishing a human-operated lunar base as a testbed for an equivalent structure on Mars. This infrastructure is intended to be a global endeavour, where international partners can ensure the continuous and sustainable presence on the lunar surface whilst focusing on scientific and engineering objectives. Most recent plans (2022)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> detailed an integrated, multi-system approach to allow a campaign of human-led exploration on the Moon, and subsequently Mars, that also ensures a safe return to Earth. Within the transportation and habitation objectives announced by NASA in May 2022<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> for generating a lunar infrastructure in preparation for a Mars settlement, the initial elements are focused on developing power grids that are evolvable to support continuous human and robotic exploration and that can be subsequently scaled-up to industrial levels. Ultimately, the aim is to develop the lunar infrastructure in terms of communications and architecture to support long-term science, advanced manufacturing capabilities and autonomy in construction, which is also considered at a large scale.</p><p id="Par3">Importantly, amongst the key scientific targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> are the establishment of a laboratory at the lunar South Pole, and undertaking a package of experiments in life sciences aimed at understanding the fundamental biological effects on human physiology and disease during short and long duration missions, as well as gaining new scientific information that could then guide system development. Finally, a requirement was identified for technologies that would monitor crew health and provide medical care in these environments, where emergency evacuation is not possible.</p><p id="Par4">Therefore, the return to the Moon and the multi-part journey to Mars will require a significant number of resources, with the most important being undoubtedly the human aspect.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Human missions - the physiological context</title><p id="Par5">Humans offer significant advantages to robotic exploration, such as the ability to execute intricate tasks based on feedback, improvise and make choices and complex decisions. Importantly, they are also able to conduct a large number of scientific procedures which can provide further information on the long-term effects of microgravity on physiology and the exposure to an extra-terrestrial environment, including across generations.</p><p id="Par6">At the same time, sending human crews to distant planets poses great physiological challenges which may become the biggest limiting factors in delivering a successful mission.</p><p id="Par7">Human physiology is heavily adapted to the gravitational environment on Earth and the absence or reduction of this stimulus in low earth orbit (LEO) and beyond, on the Moon or Mars, can have profound effects even during short sojourns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Some of the most immediate changes are in the hydrostatic pressure network formed by the cardiovascular system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> (caused by a shift of fluid to the upper part of the body), as well as a rapid reduction in tissue density and structure in muscular and skeletal sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> adapted to counteract the gravitational force during standing or ambulation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The microgravity-induced redistribution of fluid to the upper part of the body has profound effects on multiple organs. For example, it leads to an elevation of intracranial pressure, which increases to greater levels than intraocular pressure, leading to a pressure gradient that is thought to be responsible for a frequently reported visual impairment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Simultaneously, the reduction in gravitational force leads to significant changes in the vestibular system, leading to impaired balance, locomotion, eye-head-hand coordination as well as motion sickness within the first days of spaceflight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Physiological challenges on the skeletal system during deep-space missions.</title><p><bold>a</bold> An estimated timeline of a mission to Mars, involving approximately 7 months-long journeys between Earth and Mars, based on current technology. An extensive stay (approximately 26 months) on the planetary surface will likely be required as a minimum duration, while waiting for the Earth and Mars orbits to align in positions that will allow the most energy-efficient trip back. <bold>b</bold> Throughout the extended journey, the absence or reduction in the mechanical forces acting in the anatomical regions most adapted to withstand the gravitational force, such as the hip, femoral head, and lower back vertebrae, will lead to a significant loss of bone mineral in the form of Calcium and Phosphate deposits. <bold>c</bold> A range of relevant astronaut weights on Earth and the corresponding, reduced, weights in the gravitational environment of the Moon or Mars is presented. <bold>d</bold> Mars presents geographical features that are more challenging to navigate physically. For example, its highest mountain (Olympus Mons) is more than two times higher than Mount Everest.

Furthermore, the cardiovascular-fluid changes may also impair the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of medications taken by astronauts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, including supplements, which means that these agents may not be effective or sufficient at mitigating tissue degradation, as well as raising further questions regarding dosage and safety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the space environment poses additional issues in terms of radiation, a decrease in immune function and finally, confinement and isolation, all which have a combined effect on tissue health. In missions beyond the low-Earth orbit, radiation will be a significant challenge to manage, as crews will be exposed to several sources of energy, originating from solar particle events (SPEs, consisting of X-rays, gamma rays, and streams of protons and electrons), galactic cosmic rays (GCRs), which are high-energy protons and heavy ions from outside our solar system, and intravehicular secondary radiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.The exposure of tissues to ionising radiation can lead to the formation of free radicals, DNA and oxidative damage in numerous tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. It has been estimated that for a 3-years long mission to Mars, crews would be exposed to whole body doses approximating 1-sievert (Sv) or more<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Therefore, significant shielding and countermeasures are required in order to prevent acute radiation sickness, degenerative diseases and to ensure crew survival and mission success.</p><p id="Par9">In conclusion, the multitude of spaceflight-related changes will require an assessment of the extent of potential tissue damage and developing proportional countermeasures, such as enhancements in the life and health support systems. In the following sections of this article, we have placed a greater emphasis on considerations for the skeletal system and connective tissues, due to the operational scenarios that were considered, the available data on minor trauma throughout the US program, as well as the available technologies for prophylaxis and medical interventions in orthopaedics, which are likely to make the quickest progress in the basic and translational space applications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>The impact on the skeletal system</title><p id="Par10">The skeletal system is the most essential support structure in the body and maintaining its integrity is essential for performing any type of mechanical task. However, bones are some of the most affected and prone to damage organs during space missions. Bone tissue forms in response to mechanical demands and is heavily adapted at the tissue level from the nano to the anatomical scale to withstand compressive and tensile forces. In contrast, in microgravity, static and dynamic loading on this organ are absent due to the removal of external forces. Countermeasures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> designed to reintroduce these forces and mimic some of the ground reaction force, a factor that is key in bone stimulation, can only accommodate this need partially. However, a planetary environment, as opposed to the microgravity environment of LEO, might help in this respect. The presence of partial gravity on the Moon and Mars (1.62 m/s<sup>2</sup> and 3.7207 m/s<sup>2</sup> compared to Earth’s gravity of 9.807 m/s<sup>2</sup>, respectively)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> might help re-introduce this stimulus and slow down some of the tissue degradation. Therefore, during their stay, astronauts will experience approximately a sixth and a third of the Earth’s gravity. However, the lengthy journeys to these distant places will involve exposure to different phases of gravity and as such, different mechanisms of physiological re-stabilisation.</p><p id="Par11">For example, whilst a journey to Mars would require approximately 7 months (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), long durations/waiting times will likely be spent on the planetary surface (a minimum of 26 months between optimal planetary alignments based on current technology, such as the one used for the Perseverance mission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>) to allow for the most energy-efficient transfer between the two planets during the return journey (consisting of further 7 months in microgravity). Sustaining a presence on this planet will require even lengthier sojourns. The loss in tissue mass and structure during this time (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), is, based on current knowledge, likely to increase proportionally with longer durations spent in reduced gravity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. This will clinically manifest as a loss of tissue in the trabecular bone regions, increasing bone fragility and potentially compromising the ability to withstand re-entry forces on return. Although this tissue degradation may be slowed down by the presence of partial gravity, and in combination with adequate resistance exercise, it is possible that the loss of skeletal mass and demineralisation during the transfer period might increase the risk of damage shortly after landing on Mars. On arrival, setting up a base might require lifting and moving weights and equipment during construction - a representative range of weights experienced on Earth and the significantly different corresponding values in a Lunar or Martian gravitational field are presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>. In addition, Mars has more challenging landscapes with geographical features that are harder to navigate. For example, the summit elevation of the highest Martian mountain (Olympus Mons)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> is more than twice that of mount Everest (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>).</p><p id="Par12">There are additional secondary issues associated with bone demineralisation, as the persistent release of calcium deposits from bone tissue into circulation can lead to its accumulation as kidney stones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, which can lead to further complications and the need for surgical intervention.</p><p id="Par13">In addition, numerous studies suggest that the extensive exposure to galactic and solar radiation in deep-space environments will also contribute to bone and cartilage loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, further increasing the fragility of these key tissues. Therefore, the effects of microgravity will likely be exacerbated by exposure to radiation in a long-term mission. Moreover, in rodent models, a simulated partial gravity scenario that mimicked the lunar environment (a sixth of normal Gravity) combined with low-dose, high-linear energy transfer irradiation still resulted in bone loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, further highlighting the need for effective protective methods such as shielding materials and clothing.</p><p id="Par14">Whilst a whole range of countermeasures such as exercise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, negative pressure application<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and dietary supplements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> has been incorporated in space missions over the past decades with varying levels of success, considerations about mitigating likely tissue damage on-site in general, for multiple organs prone to damage, might be equally important in short-term and would need to be assessed simultaneously. This is particularly important for clinical contexts such as tissue rupture and dislocation, bone fractures, skin burns, abrasion or lacerations, tendon/ligament tears, and blood loss. Some of the reported tissue damage situations in space have involved small traumatic injuries to both the skin and mucous membranes, for example during the NASA-Mir programme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, and by 2009, 219 in-flight musculoskeletal injuries were identified throughout the U.S space program, most involving hand injuries during translation between modules, resistive exercise and extra-vehicular activity components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.

For example, the distance between Earth and Mars ranges between 54.6 million kilometres to approximately 200 million kilometres. In contrast to the Moon-Earth communication delay, which is in the order of seconds, there is a significant communication latency between Mars and Earth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, that can range between 5–20 min depending on planetary positions. Secondly, relaying/receiving information can require high data rates and in addition, it is unlikely that crews can rely on intermittent communications in those situations where expert medical support will be required immediately. These limitations mean that telemedicine, remote medical support and terrestrial assistance to the crew in real-time might not always be possible during complex medical procedures and could be further compromised by a potential equipment failure. Therefore, an operational shift is required towards autonomous medical activities, a challenge which requires careful considerations to ensure an adequate medical infrastructure at these sites. These include considerations regarding crew professional and mission-specific training during selection. In LEO (ISS), The Crew Medical Officer (CMO) was not necessarily a physician, and had received medical training instead<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, due to the ability to evacuate in case of an emergency. However, a general surgical specialist will be required to deliver complex interventions following severe incidents beyond LEO, while also coordinating with remote medical teams via telemedicine. Additionally, it might be necessary to incorporate robotic surgery as a supporting measure where medical crew selection will be limited. Ultimately, these aspects will guide habitat design, as well as the technical infrastructure required in both short and long-term sojourns. Therefore, it will be essential that the facilities to mitigate damage, particularly significant trauma or injury, are present on-site. Under normal clinical circumstances, tissue reconstruction or replacement is performed using a combination of medical and bioengineered solutions, which range from metallic implants and deproteinised xenografts to tissue engineered autologous cell-containing matrices, which can be customised to replace the deteriorated tissue.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Building a deep-space biomedical habitat to address the physiological challenges</title><p id="Par19">Crews will require access to a sustainable source of tissue substitutes, biochemical scaffolds, haemostatic agents, or biomaterials such as dental fillers in addition to specialised medical-surgical training in order to address a wide range of health challenges, from minor tears to serious emergencies. With longer sojourns, these will be needed in additional operational scenarios, such as a lack in response to countermeasures, the potential absence of adequate nutrition, or the likely failure of equipment. In addition, healing in connective tissue is known to be impaired in microgravity, as well as the response to growth factors, which suggests that spaceflight might impair the capacity of wounds to respond to exogenous stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par20">The need for a quick recovery of function means that some form of tissue replacement/analogue would have to be developed on-site in useful time, implanted or applied to the injured site shortly after, or incubated (in the case of biological implants) as per typical procedures until a desired morphology/maturation stage is achieved. The potential for a significant interval before astronaut tissue function is restored feeds into the wider issue of crew numbers, as well as redundancy in training and capabilities. The repair and reconstruction process will, in turn, require specialised equipment and simultaneous considerations that have to match safety and efficiency with sustainability and practicality from a space hardware perspective. In addition, these biological-surgical-rehabilitation facilities would have to be located in proximity to each other and constructed as a contained, multi-module habitat due to the requirements of both wet lab and surgical facilities to ensure sterility and biohazard containment, and the likelihood of complications arising during a recovery period post-implantation (e.g. infections, the need for further intervention).</p><p id="Par21">Therefore, estimating the requirements of a tissue substitute production module during deep-space missions, as well as the concomitant clinical requirements to support operations, is essential for a long-term sojourn and establishing a settlement on a different planetary surface.

Such a habitat would be beneficial not only for mitigating the impact of the space environment on human physiology, but also for conducting personalised research into astronaut health using both microphysiological systems, such as organoids, organotypic cultures, and organs-on-a-chip; but also, with time, multi-tissue constructs and eventually organ analogues, providing further information on long-term planetary colonisation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Habitat design considerations</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Energy and advanced life support</title><p id="Par22">A biomedical enclosure in deep-space would have to ensure a high degree of autonomy and sustainability and be adequate firstly in terms of environmental support (atmospheric, pressure, acoustic, microbial contamination, radiation protection) and sustaining human presence (air purification, water recovery, waste processing).

Although lunar missions will be ideal for identifying tasks which will help to reduce Earth dependence, the strikingly different environmental conditions between the Moon and Mars might require substantially different considerations. These differences include the available resources on-site, gravitational conditions, atmosphere presence/composition and mean surface temperature. Solar panel power generation will be key, although the energy storage capacities might be limited in early stages.

This could accelerate the healing process and was designed for use specifically in these types of settings, such as an isolated habitat. Advantageously, the device was designed to be mechanically-driven, which removes the need for power supply. The main parts consisted of a dosing device in the handle, an ink cartridge, a print head and support wheels to assist with application -an accessible feature that would help with use by non-medically trained staff.

Exhausted vials could be replaced during the mission if medically feasible. This bank would have to be separated to an auxiliary module to reduce traffic from other operations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). It is important to note, however, that production of a sufficient number of cells to cellularize large structures such as a large tissue section or an organ is currently a major challenge. The number of mammalian cells in the body is estimated to be in the trillion range, totalling approximately 30 × 10<sup>12</sup> for a 70 kg male and 21 × 10<sup>12</sup> for a 63 kg female<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>.

As such, many of the initial, engineered tissues would rely on cell proliferation at the site of implantation. In subsequent decades (e.g. 2040s–2050s+), the implementation of industrial-level stirred tank or roller bottle bioreactors might help with producing cell numbers at a larger scale (e.g. 10–20 m<sup>3</sup> or larger vessels)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup> for this application. In addition, if stem cells are to be used as an alternative source to primary cells, this would likely require a significant number of frozen supplements, growth and signalling factors to tune these cell populations into the relevant tissue types.</p><p id="Par41">In the short-term, these procedures would likely focus on the generation of basic personalised tissues which can range from constructs that can be applied on the skin surface to treat cuts, burns and other lesions to orthopaedic constructs that can be implanted to augment bone fractures or degradation; and subsequently, with further developments in the following decades, composite multi-tissue constructs which can also be vascularised. In contrast, the initial phases of damage mitigation and implant integration will most certainly rely on cell invasion and re-vascularisation from local tissue networks. A timescale of these incremental stages and their implementation is presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>.</p><p id="Par42">A second target for this module would also be developing matrices that can deliver therapeutics at the site of injury through minimally invasive methods such as skin patch application or injection, which would be less invasive and require less training/skills from a medical perspective.

This is necessary in the short-term also because a further operational objective of this module would be conducting personalised research into the physiological response and adaptations to the planetary environment using tissue avatars. Tissue-engineered constructs can also be applied to investigate preventative and therapeutic countermeasures, by conducting personalised research into astronaut health and studying the alterations in cells, tissues, genetic and molecular activity induced by the environmental conditions. For example, they may become a useful tool for studying the effects of radiation, pharmacokinetics, wound healing or screening loading and nutritional regimens to enhance tissue repair or prevent degeneration. Similarly, much larger and complex structures, such as multi-tissue prototypes, and early versions of organ analogues, which are many decades away from full development and operational-level technological readiness, will be essential in early stages not necessarily for applications in regenerative medicine, but as complex research platforms for conducting basic and translational investigations into the effects of environmental conditions on tissue architecture and organ functions. These true-scale analogues would facilitate the integration of a range of markers, reporters and sensors, which could provide information regarding protein and gene activity as well as histological changes. While representing simplified versions of the in vivo structures, they can recapitulate many aspects of tissue architecture and biochemistry, which is ideal for bioengineering research and could potentially be implemented within the required lunar and Mars mission timeframes.</p><p id="Par44">Finally, the interplay between surgery and tissue development (in terms of the order of procedures and multiple steps required) is another rationale for building these different modules within the same habitat. For example, minor tissue explants required for cell isolation, proliferation and incubation within matrices would need to be transferred from a surgical module to the tissue engineering module, whereas mature/ autologous grafts developed in the latter facilities would need to be subsequently transferred to the operating theatre for implantation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Cell culture, handling and incubation</title><p id="Par45">Our experience with wet lab operations outside of Earth developed with increased scientific activities on the ISS to study fluid dynamics, high-throughput biological processes, DNA sequencing and microbiological alterations in microgravity, which also facilitated the optimisation of these processes in terms of handling, efficiency and safety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>.

The ability to use multi-axis robotic arms to produce biological structures from 3D coded files (and hence patient-specific anatomical designs) offers the promise to produce structures of unmatched complexities.</p><p id="Par49">The application of bioprinting in microgravity is also a fast-evolving area of research and its current limitations as a technology for space exploration have been discussed recently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par50">The major advantages of bioprinting compared to traditional tissue engineering are perhaps that the required constructs could be manufactured in a personalised shape and size, can introduce structures such as pores in a controllable fashion; involve multiple biomaterials and integrate multiple types of additive layer manufacturing technologies into one system. It is important to stress, however, that printing of suitable matrices and cells in a suitable conformation does not automatically generate a functional tissue and multiple culture stages are required post-printing to allow the cell component to develop the native behaviours found in vivo.</p><p id="Par51">There are multiple types of bioprinting technologies available, including inkjet-based<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>, extrusion-based<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>, laser assisted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup> and stereolithographic (light-curing)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. Some can include or avoid the use of scaffolds as temporary templates (e.g. microcarriers, polymers), and each presents multiple advantages and limitations in generating the native tissue architecture. For example, some types of printing are more successful in achieving a suitable resolution at the nano-micron scale compared to other types, while some are constrained by the extrusion conditions such as nozzle impedance and small dispensing volumes, which can increase processing time and reduce cell viability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>. There are simultaneous challenges with bioink formulation and optimisation, to match biocompatibility with their performance through the system. Specifically, bioinks, which can be naturally-derived or synthetic hydrogels, must have shear-thinning fluid properties to be suitable for printing, whilst simultaneously being able to cross-link/polymerise following deposition. Recently, we have also seen the application of this fabrication method with decellularized organ matrices, typically used as an alternative to this method, to produce bioinks with more relevant biochemical cues from the original tissue and also a suitable ratio of ECM proteins, something that is a challenge from a formulation perspective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup>. Achieving suitable, tissue-like mechanical properties in the resulting constructs is also the focus of research efforts, as many soft matrices are not able to hold their shape and weight.</p><p id="Par52">The translation of bioprinting for applications in regenerative medicine during space exploration also has several mission-specific challenges. Whilst 3D printing offers the obvious advantages in terms of automation, it is also susceptible to malfunctioning, as with many equipment types. More importantly however, are the considerations regarding stability and integrity of potential implants during printing within a reduced gravity environment, particularly when trying to reproduce complex anatomies. Recent studies have been trying to simulate this limitation by employing extrusion-based printers in an inverted fashion, against Earth’s gravity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par53">A bioprinting facility was specifically implemented on-orbit (2019) for the purpose of printing tissue-like mimics in support of producing eventual organ-like analogues in space - the Techshot Inc. - nScrypt/BioFabrication Facility (BFF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, and most recently, an upgrade to BFF developed with the aim of printing human-like tissue mimics, announced in November 2022<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>. The latter offers a better temperature control in the system, one of the factors important for consistency in bioinks. For a review of additional bioprinters on the ISS see ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>. The results from this recently installed on-orbit bioprinting facility for early tissue-like prototypes are yet to be released, however it is widely believed that manufacturing 3D tissue and organ-like parts in a reduced gravity environment will prevent the collapse of structures and sedimentation normally taking place on Earth. While this may be true for the microgravity environment, the partial gravity levels on the Moon and Mars might be sufficient to create similar technical difficulties. Therefore, further research is needed to confirm this matter.</p><p id="Par54">Additionally, biofabricating hard tissues presents further difficulties, as bone, for example, contains multiple phases (organic, inorganic and cellular, embedded in the mineral component) which are interconnected in a highly organised manner down to the micron and nano scales. Therefore, achieving that organisation between a calcium phosphate cement and a suitable bioink, while also preserving the viability of the mineral-phase cells is a major challenge in generating bioprinted, functional bone replacements.</p><p id="Par55">The difficulties reported with soft tissues stem from the fact that low viscosity bioinks have to be used for production, which requires the final constructs to undergo additional culturing and several levels of conditioning post-printing. Currently, the biofabrication facilities described above benefit from an additional adjacent facility, the Advanced Space Experiment Processor (ADSEP), where additional treatment can take place.</p><p id="Par56">At the same time, when trying to manufacture complex (multi-phase) or large-scale tissues in a challenging gravitational environment, both hard and soft tissues would, however, require some form of support matrix to prevent movement and the failure of structures during the process, particularly at interfaces. This is particularly relevant for the manufacturing of gradients seen in all tissues, such as those found in skin layers or the bone-ligament/tendon. This scaffolding would also address other factors that could be detrimental, such as the extended printing times associated with large or complex tissues, which could lead to structural changes in the print or a decrease in viability.</p><p id="Par57">A solution to these limitations in long term might be printing the required construct suspended within a support matrix, such as a polymeric fluid gel bath (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). These non-Newtonian gels which are increasingly used in tissue engineering, behave as fluids under mechanical stress and as solids in the absence of this force, making them ideal for use in reduced gravity. Therefore, they can greatly aid with traditional biofabrication by acting as a temporary, biocompatible supports and provisionally allowing the movement of the extrusion needle through the matrix at the same time as self-healing around the print. The tissue or organ-like part can subsequently be recovered non-destructively from the bath following polymerisation (e.g. induced chemically). Many of these fluid baths can be generated from reagents such as polysaccharides already widely used in laboratory applications for generating hydrogel scaffolds in tissue engineering, such as agarose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup>, agar (composed of agarose and agaropectin)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup> and alginate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref></sup> which have good biocompatibility and gel forming properties. These alternative formulations produced through shear cooling of hot solutions throughout the sol-gel transition, leads to a ‘fluid-gel’ matrix. These can be used for providing structural support rather than a culture template, to aid with suspending a second hydrogel containing cells, thus supporting it during the cross-linking process whilst being able to self-heal immediately. A potential application of this process in an operational context is described below.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>The production of tissues analogues in reduced gravity using suspended manufacture</title><p id="Par58">Polymeric fluid baths are generated from hydrophilic polysaccharides extracted from the cell walls of marine algal species, dissolved in water at high temperatures and subsequently cooled under shear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref></sup>. Low concentrations (as low as 0.5% w/v) are required to generate these suspending baths for tissue engineering applications and therefore a small quantity of these lightweight powders is required for the gelation process, making it feasible to carry several kilograms of these raw materials across a long-distance mission. Alternatively, in the long-term, these can be produced on-site, since the extraction processes of these polysaccharides from algae are chemically straightforward (involving limited steps and equipment) and well characterised (involving mechanical processing, separation and chemical treatment)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref></sup>. Furthermore, because algae have been heavily considered as a dietary source as they may be essential for meeting nutritional demands in a deep-space mission, algal bioreactors are likely to be a part of future mission cargo, to provide a nutritional biomass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref></sup> but also for other life-support requirements, such as converting carbon dioxide into oxygen, with one such prototype (a photobioreactor) having been already tested on the ISS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref></sup>. Therefore, it would be feasible to incorporate already existing marine photobioreactors within an auxiliary biomaterials processing unit in the habitat to extract key polysaccharides on-site, including agarose (C<sub>24</sub>H<sub>38</sub>O<sub>19</sub>), agar (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>24</sub>O<sub>9</sub>) or alginic acid (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>6</sub>)<sub>n</sub>.

Fluid gel baths can be used for this purpose, to act as a suspension matrix during printing, thus preventing construct failure during the process. These scaffolds can be easily reconstituted from powdered polysaccharides derived from different algal species. These algal masses can be cultivated in already existing photobioreactors on-site and processed in this module for the extraction of alginate, agar or agarose, which can then be reconstituted using basic steps (dissolved in water at high temperatures and cooled under shear). The resulting fluid gel baths would facilitate needle movement during the extrusion process, acting as fluids during the deposition process of biological material whilst self-healing around the print.

As discussed above, sourcing according to seasonal planetary phenomena will be key to this process. While the north polar region is covered with CO<sub>2</sub> ice during winter, the south cap is covered throughout the entire year with CO<sub>2</sub> frost and it is thought that the water ice form is also present within or underneath these deposits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref></sup>. Frozen CO<sub>2</sub> can therefore be extracted for long-term preservation of cell material brought from Earth, at ultra-low temperatures (i.e. approximately −80° Celsius), as well as to maintain any enzymatically-critical biological agents at an equivalent temperature as intended on Earth. The energy input required for storage within a biobank habitat would be minimal, as dry ice can be stored in lightweight containers such as polystyrene boxes and can be refilled when required. Furthermore, these containers can be collapsible, providing a reduction in storage requirements. Due to the volatile nature of dry ice (and the substantial exchange of CO<sub>2</sub> between the atmosphere and the polar caps), throughout the year or alternatively, during the spring/summer seasons, its transition into the gaseous form of CO<sub>2</sub> can be exploited for use with additional culture equipment, such as the cell incubating devices discussed above.

Orthopaedic trauma surgery in particular requires the application of percussive impulses to implants, sustained force to displaced bones or dislocated joints, and torque to screws used to hold implants and bone fragments in place. The reactive forces acting upon the surgeon would lead to their acceleration in the opposite direction (or counter-rotation in the case of torque), a situation analogous to astronauts engaged in mechanical activity during extra-vehicular activity.

The risk of this ionising radiation to those in close proximity to the patient (surgeons, anaesthetists etc) is mitigated by the use of high atomic-weight shielding in flexible gowns and within the X-ray machine, all of which comes with prohibitively high mass that would be costly to get into orbit or beyond. Lightweight design, low atomic-weight materials, and the impracticality of increasing the distance between the source and the occupants in habitat enclosures would exacerbate this problem. Reduction in scatter (collimation), combined with the use of in-situ resources (such as regolith between elements of a habitat) might be key in initial stages. Alternatively, the use of ultrasonographic technology might offer a radiation-free, more flexible solution. This technology has already been considered for diagnosis in trauma scenarios during space missions and has been tested within the LEO environment of the International Space Station, particularly to address the use by crewmembers/non-physicians with minimal sonography training, with the addition of remote guidance.

Manned missions to these distant planetary bodies with challenging geologies and environmental conditions will pose a high risk of tissue damage and medical emergencies. Furthermore, tissue degradation induced by the change in gravitational conditions during the extended transfer journey and on arrival to a reduced gravity planetary environment further complicates the matter and increases the risk of musculo-skeletal damage even during moderate intensity tasks. These clinical contexts will have to be managed autonomously on-site and as such, habitat enclosures allowing both tissue substitute generation and implantation will be key for ensuring astronaut health and therefore a sustainable presence on these planets. In this perspective article, we proposed a modular-type habitat structure that would support such operations, namely tissue substitute development (cellular and acellular), implantation and recovery. These considerations were based on experience with wet lab operational requirements as well as clinical practice.</p><p id="Par77">It is likely that in the short-term, traditional tissue reconstruction methodologies will be used to manage emergencies in deep-space (2030–2035), involving casting and hand mixing of suitable matrices, which are easier to implement in a spaceflight scenario. Surgical reconstruction options will be likely be initially focused around isolating and transferring minor autografts to the injured site as well as acellular, physically-treated scaffolds with native geometry and biochemistry (throughout 2040s). With further development of tissue engineering and 3D biofabrication technologies over the following years, more complex, personalised tissues and ultimately organ-like structures could be generated in an isolated environment (2040s–2050s+). However, the ability to produce constructs which can maintain integrity in a planetary hypogravity setting is essential to this process, hence why support matrices will be required, such as fluid gel baths, from which the constructs can subsequently be recovered. Operating theatre and surgical tool design will also have to be assessed and adapted to the challenging gravitational conditions of these planets. Aspects such as fluid containment kit, restraining equipment to prevent patient falling/drifting during operation, surgical tool adaptation and integration of X-ray/Ultrasonographic kit for assessing outcomes might be critical. Finally, processing of local resources will be key for generating laboratory and medical infrastructure. The Moon and Mars in particular, contain an abundance of resources in multiple forms, which can be extracted or converted into useful products to generate laboratory-specific reagents and tools. Over the next years, it will be essential to generate further predictions on these matters, which will ultimately dictate the design of these space settlements and the technology required to support these.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was conducted during two bioengineering projects funded by the National Centre for the Replacement Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs), through the award of two research grants to A.I (NC/S001859/1 and NC/X000907/1), who is the Principal Investigator of this work.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>A.I. designed the concepts presented, wrote and edited the manuscript and produced the figures.
