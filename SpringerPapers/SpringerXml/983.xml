Biodegradable waste has the potential to become useful to society through a simple volarization technique. The researchers are behind sustainable nanotechnology pathways which are made possible by using biodegradable waste for the preparation of nanomaterials. This review emphasizes the potentialities of biodegradable waste produced as a viable alternative to create a sustainable economy that benefits all humans. Volarization results in the utilization of biowastes as well as provides safer and hazard-free green methods for the synthesis of nanoparticles. Starting from different sources to the application which includes therapeutics, food industry and water treatment. The review hovers over the pros and cons of biowaste-mediated nanoparticles and concludes with possible advances in the application. In the present scenario, the combination of green synthesis and biowaste can bring about a wide variety of applications in nanotechnology once the hurdles of bulk-scale industrial production are resolved. Given these points, the review is focused on the cost-effective synthesis of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Green synthesis</kwd><kwd>Biodegradable wastes</kwd><kwd>Metal and metal oxide nanoparticles</kwd><kwd>Sustainable environment</kwd><kwd>Eco-friendly</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>20</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature Switzerland AG</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>25</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41204_2022_Article_276.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>21</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>21</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>ReviewPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Earth Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Environmental Science and Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Nanotechnology and Microengineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Environment, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Earth and Environmental Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="CopyrightComment" specific-use="RightsRetention"><title>Copyright comment</title><p>Springer Nature or its licensor holds exclusive rights to this article under a publishing agreement with the author(s) or other rightsholder(s);

In developing countries, garbage generation has increased in tandem with population growth, resulting in increased per capita waste generation and economic growth. Waste generated from numerous human activities, both industrial and household can pose health risks and a harmful influence on the environment without a comprehensive and efficient solid waste management program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. When comparing biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste, both have their drawbacks and ill effects which can dreadfully affect society if the waste is not treated properly or disposed of properly. Biodegradable wastes include both plant waste and animal waste. In most Asian developing countries, the urban population could grow by over 50% by 2025 because waste generation rates are directly tied to a country's population and per capita waste generation. FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the 4Râs of waste management which should be implemented to overcome the hazards of waste degradation.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The 4 Râs of waste management which needs implementation in every sources of waste generation</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41204_2022_276_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par3">In this scenario, a study on waste extracts shows that a decrease in waste generation is observed with increasing income. High-income countries possess 28% biodegradable municipal solid waste, upper-middle-income countries possess 54% biodegradable municipal solid waste, and lower-middle-income countries possess 59% biodegradable municipal solid waste [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Many biodegradable wastes are currently disposed of in hazardous ways, such as by burning, unscientific dumping, or discharge into bodies of water. Furthermore, bio-resources like animal dung cakes, crop residue, and firewood are often used as cooking fuel, polluting interior air. Kitchen wastes such as vegetable peels, fruit peels, spent tea leaves and juices can be decomposed by bacteria or other decomposers. When biodegradable trash is abundant in the ecosystem it can contaminate the environment. They produce a lot of microbial flora in the vicinity of wastes. In humans, plants and animals, these bacteria can cause a variety of infectious diseases. These wastes emit a foul odour when burned due to the production of specific gases and can also lead to the emission of greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide. Waste dumps serve as breeding sites for disease carriers and vectors such as mosquitos and rodents which spread a variety of diseases. As evidence of the effects of climate change become more widespread, scientists continue to look for ways to mitigate the havoc produced by harmful manufacturing practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">One way to make use of this biodegradable waste or biomass is to use it as raw material for nanoparticle formation via green synthesis. It is a renewable source which is heterogeneous and can be chemically combined and a suitable option for the generation of desired products since it is easily available, cheap, sustainable and with usual affluence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Nanotechnology has gotten a lot of attention in recent years. Materials with a diameter of 1â100Â nm are classified as nanotechnology. They are used in practically every industry, including electronics, agriculture and the medical field. The use of nanoparticles aids in improving thermal, mechanical and barrier characteristic properties. The fine-tuning of numerous reaction conditions results in nanoparticle with different morphologies which includes spheres, rods, quantum dots and particles which allow for a wide range of applications and perhaps endless technological improvement potential. For the synthesis of nanosized material, classical synthesis methods like the top-down approach were used, which relied on both carcinogenic chemicals and significant energy input. The traditional synthesis method causes pollutants, necessitating the development of environmentally friendly synthesis techniques. As a result, the synthesis of nanoparticles from biodegradable wastes is a means to reduce and reuse the waste that pollutes our ecosystem. Natural biological systems are used to produce nanomaterials in green material synthesis processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Green nanoscale particles such as zerovalent metallic NPs are produced via a redox process involving metabolites. Phenolic acids, terpenoids, alkaloids and flavonoids are among the main secondary metabolites found in biowaste [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Primary metabolites are substances which are produced by all plant groups that play a vital part in their normal development, growth and reproduction, whereas secondary metabolites are compounds produced by only a few plant species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Almost all agro-industrial and foodÂ residues contain phenolic compounds (fruits, vegetables, oilseeds, nuts, cereals and drinks) containing specific functional groups which enhance reduction and stabilization properties. The phenolic compound in fruits and vegetables helps to replace synthetic preservatives as they can scavenge free radicals and prevent oxidation reactions in food and also contains other bioactive components which include carotenoids, vitamins, oils, enzymes, etc. Biomass waste generated from fruit residues contains a variety of flavonoids which can chelate and reduce metal ions into NPs. Thus, they are used for nanoparticle production.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Synthesis of nanoparticles using different biogenic wastes</title><p id="Par6">In this review, we mainly focus on the synthesis of nanoparticles from different sources which include banana peel, coconut coir, eggshell, groundnut shell, mango peel, onion peels, pomegranate peel, sapota peel, rice husks, watermelon rind, orange peel, tamarind shell as mentioned below (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), human hair, algal extract, tea waste, marine waste and slaughterhouse waste.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Commonly used biowastes for the synthesis of nanoparticles <bold>a</bold> banana peel, <bold>b</bold> coconut coir, <bold>c</bold> eggshell, <bold>d</bold> groundnut shell, <bold>e</bold> mango peel, <bold>f</bold> onion peels, <bold>g</bold> pomegranate peel, <bold>h</bold> sapota peel, <bold>i</bold> rice husks, <bold>j</bold> watermelon rind, <bold>k</bold> orange peel and <bold>l</bold> tamarind shell</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41204_2022_276_Fig2_HTML.jpg" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par7">Out of these, orange peel constitutes between 50 and 65% of total fruit weight and is rich in soluble fibres,Â proteins,Â bioflavonoids and insoluble fibres, which have potential applications in the synthesis of NPs. For example, according to Skiba et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], orange peel extract obtained by plasma chemical extraction technique and methylene blue degradation under solar irradiation used to synthesize silver NPs.</p><p id="Par8">Nuts can act as an environmentally benign resource for the synthesis of nanoparticles. The waste nut residue from different parts of nuts such as shell, kernel and extract are rich in various components such as hemicellulose, lignin and cellulose. It can aid in the synthesis of bionanomaterials as a green reducing agent and bio nanocatalyst, which provides a cheaper catalytic system that can be applied in oxidation reactions, hydrogen evolution reactions, hydrolysis, degradation of pollutants, etc. This is of great advantage as the source is of natural origin, environmentally friendly, economical and reduces waste generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">One of the agricultural wastes that have garnered attention recently is eggshells. Every day, a large number of eggshells are generated as biowaste all over the world. Not only does the odour of eggshell attract flies and make it abrasive, but it also causes the loss of numerous useful materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Eggshell waste is mostly generated from households, restaurants and bakeries. Pure calcium carbonate with low porosity is the major component of eggshells which has the potential to be turned into useful products. Nano-calcium oxide can be synthesized from a waste egg shell by the solâgel method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Due to its hierarchical and porous structure, the eggshell membrane is used for the synthesis of magnetic CuFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanomaterials with multifunctional properties such as catalytic and and antibacterial functions that have an application in the industrial water treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Volarization, co-pyrolysis, anaerobic digestion and recycling of waste paper biomass can help in saving landfill space and reduce the requirement for incineration, resulting in value-added products with lower air pollution risks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Cellulose, the worldâs most prevalent biopolymer, is widely recycled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and that waste paper can be used to synthesize cellulose nanocrystals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These synthesized cellulose nanocrystals are used in drug delivery, catalysis, biomedical engineering, material science, etc. Highly porous carbon nanoparticles can be synthesized from a waste paper by isothermal reactions at 1000Â Â°CÂ for 2Â h followed by HClÂ treatment, which results in conversion of the dominant cellulosic component in waste paper into highly porous carbon nanoparticles. These highly porous carbon nanoparticles can be applied in wastewater treatment for the removal of dyes and heavy metals, the studies revealed that the molecule concentration of dye molecule and Pbâ+â2 ion decreased significantly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Human hair is also a biowaste which is a complex tissue containing lipids, water, protein and pigments. The traditional practice is to burn human hair which badly affects the environment. Gold and silver nanoparticles can be synthesized using human hair-derived keratin. They are stabilized using a capping agent such as cysteine amino acid with amine and thiol functional groups which are found abundantly in human hair. Both silver and gold NPs exhibited effectiveÂ antibacterial activity against <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">The algal extract (Microalgae and cyanobacteria) serves as a living cell factory for efficient green synthesis of nanoparticles due to their unique characteristics which include the absence of toxic by-products, minimum energy input, the biomolecules (enzymes and pigments) present act as reducing and capping agent, hyperaccumulation of heavy metals, higher growth rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. For example, silver nanoparticles can be synthesized from aqueous extract of Marine Algae <italic>Sargassum myriocystum</italic> which have potential application in inhibition of <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> mosquito vectors, HeLa cells in anticancer activity, clinical human pathogens. Further studies revealed that it can be used as an effective drug for anticancer and bacterial infections and also shows potential efficiency in photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue dyes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Tea waste constitutes components such as polysaccharides, caffeine and tannic acid which has the potential to stabilize metal and metal oxide nanoparticles as it can act as a reducing and capping agent. Silver nanoparticles can be synthesized using an aqueous extract of tea waste. It has potentialÂ catalytic activity inÂ degrading cationic organic dyes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Gautam et al. reported that iron nanoparticles can be synthesized from tea waste extract. The synthesized iron nanoparticles exhibited a very high zeta potential of ââ45Â mV at pH 10 indicating their high stability in an aqueous medium.</p><p id="Par14">According to the reports, the discards from the fisheries exceed 20 million tons per year which corresponds to 25% (approximately) of processed fish waste and total production including by-catch (non-target species). The fish biowaste contains value-added components such as chitin, collagen, bioactive peptides, pigments and gelatin. Carbon dots and nanocarbons can be prepared from fish biowaste using chitosan as the starting material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Chitosan is a marine waste made of amino polysaccharides that aids in the synthesis of nitrogen-doped carbon nanomaterial with varied applications which include the removal of contaminants from liquid and gas phases, acting as catalysts, sequestrationÂ of carbon dioxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Another study showed the synthesis of nickel nanoparticles capped on the N-doped carbon obtained via pyrolysis from chitosan as a source of carbon and nitrogen. The formation of closely coupled, extremely stable and uniform nickel nanoparticles is aided by nitrogen doping in the carbon nanotube network, which offers an adsorption site. It also offers a large number of reactive sites for nitroarene adsorption, as well as molecular hydrogen diffusion and dissociation thereby, acts as an efficient, recyclable catalyst and chemoselective hydrogenation of nitroarenes to corresponding amines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Only a small fraction of animal food (meat) is consumed by humans. A large percentage of meat is discarded as waste. After processing, approximately 50â54% of each cow, 52% of each sheep or goat, 60â62% of each pig, 68â72% of each chicken, and 78% of each turkey end up as meat consumed by humans, with the restÂ going to waste (Regulations 2003). After evisceration (the removal of the body's interior organs such as the heart, lungs, intestines and kidneys), the difficulty of disposing of them arises. Slaughterhouse trash is mainly biodegradable, but owing to a lack of awareness, it is not properly disposed of and is allowed to fester, producing pollution and becoming a great source of disease-causing bacteria. As a result, the problem is no longer restricted to a single region or country but has grown to enormous proportions all across the world. So, the wastes should be recycled, reused, and redirected towards an efficient and useful product. For example, zinc oxide nanoparticles can be synthesized from goat slaughter waste [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods of nanoparticle synthesis</title><p id="Par16">Conventional technologies used a top-down approach to synthesize nanoparticles. The nanoparticles are synthesized from bulk material as the starting material and then it is broken down into smaller pieces using different physical, chemical and mechanical processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. It includes different techniques such as laser ablation, mechanical milling and sputtering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Alternatively, a bottom-up approach was developed for the biosynthesis of nanoparticles. This method involves the utilization of a biological system to produce metal nanoparticles at ambient pressure and temperature without using harmful chemicals and reagents in which oxidationâreduction is the main reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Here atoms or molecules act as the starting material in the formation of nanoparticles. It includes different methods such as solid-state methods (physical vapour deposition, chemical vapour deposition), gas-phase methods (solâgel methods, hydrothermal method, etc.) and liquid state synthesis methods (spray pyrolysis, laser ablation, etc.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. There are different types of nanomaterials produced from biowaste however we are limiting our study to metal and metal oxide nanoparticles.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Metal and metal oxide nanoparticles</title><p id="Par17">Metallic nanoparticles (MNPs) possess an inorganic metal or metal oxide core that is usually surrounded by a shell made up ofÂ organic or inorganic material or metal oxide. The shape of MNPs is an important component that influences biological response. The shapes include metal rods, spheres, ellipsoids, cylinders, triangular, hexagonal and more. The ability of NPs to traverse biological barriers, the process by which NPs enter cells, cycling duration, and targeting effect are all said to be influenced by NP geometry. For example, when compared to rod-shaped gold NPs of identical size, spherical gold NPs had a higher tendency to be taken up by HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. MNPs can also exhibit a range of behaviours, including agglomeration or aggregation, interactions with natural organic matter (NOM) in water, and particle adsorption onto surfaces. Physicochemical features are partly responsible for these behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The properties of MNPs are also influenced by the effect of solubility. MNPs are designed to function as a source of metal ions in cells, continually releasing metal ions into the cytoplasm. The release of the metal ion isÂ determined by its solubility and rate of dissolution. Although some MNPs have poor solubility, they still cause tremendous toxicity in the physiological medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Out of the metal nanoparticles, most of the studies are concentrated on noble metal nanoparticles.</p><p id="Par18">Metal oxide nanoparticles (MONPs) are usually made by theÂ hydrolysis of metal salts at ambient temperature or temperatures below 100Â Â°C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], because of their small size and high density of corner or edge surface sites, metal oxide nanoparticles can have exceptional physical and chemical properties. Beneficial bioactive substances found in fruits and vegetable waste, such as alkaloids, amino acids, enzymes, phenolics, proteins, polysaccharides, tannins, saponins, vitamins and terpenoids, as well as other compounds, operate as reducing agents in the creation of metal nanoparticles (NPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">It has been reported that metal oxide NPs can be synthesized from the peels of fruits such as banana, <italic>Citrus sinensis</italic>, jackfruit, lemon, mango, Musa <italic>paradisiacal</italic>, pomegranate, tangerine, <italic>Punica granatum</italic>, <italic>Garcinia mangostana</italic>, <italic>Citrus aurantifolia</italic> and <italic>Nephelium lappaceum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Agro waste can be employed in the synthesis of nanoparticles. Metal and metal oxide nanoparticles can be synthesized from weeds in an agricultural field, the weeds act as bioreactors for the synthesis of nanoparticles.

Proper tuning of the reaction conditions and parameters results in small size (&lt;â10Â nm) and different shapes of AgNPs with unique properties instead of spherical shapes. For the preparation of Ag nanoparticles, a variety of methods are available including reduction in solutions, chemical and photochemical processes in reverse micelles, radiation-assisted electrochemical, sonochemical, thermal decomposition and recently via green chemistry routes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. For example, the reducing property of pomegranate peel extract, which contains phenolic compounds, gallic acid and other fatty acids, flavanols, flavones, flavanones, and anthocyanidins, has been used to produce silver nanoparticles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

Likewise, banana peel extract is a natural reducing agent that is also high in polymers such as lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin, which is why it is used to make silver nanoparticles.</p><p id="Par21">According to Skiba et al., AgNPs were synthesized from orange peel water extract by dissolving AgNO<sub>3</sub> in bidistilled water to make solutions with different concentrations. For 0.1Â min, both orange peel extract and silver nitrate solution were mixed with constant stirring. The resulting mixture was then heated to 75Â Â°C. The change in colour of the mixture to brown colour indicates the formation of Ag NPs. The characterization of Ag NPs was done by UVâvisible spectra at the range between 400 and 450Â nm. A similar method is followed in the synthesis of silver nanoparticles from grape pomace extract. Synthesis of silver nanoparticles from sapota pomace extract was done in which, an aqueous solution of silver nitrate (7Â mM) was combined with the extract in a ratio of 1:0.5 (v/v) and vigorously stirred for 20Â min.

Furthermore, AgNPs were re-precipitated using acetone to eliminate clinging organic debris and again it was centrifuged for 30Â min at 20Â Â°C. The nanoparticles were produced and dried in a 60Â Â°C oven before being recovered in powdered form.

According to Mohamed. et.al, banana peel ash was used to make mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN), which were tested for their ability to adsorb methyl orange (MO) and phenol under a variety of conditions, including pH, adsorbent dosage, starting concentration and temperature. As a result, the synthesized MSNs have the potential to be used as a low-cost adsorbent in the treatment of wastewater contaminated with dyes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. According to Araichimani et al., amorphous silica nanoparticles with sizes ranging from 50 to 80Â nm have been synthesized via rapid microwave-assisted combustion from rice husk biowastes. A powder X-ray diffractometer was used to measure the crystalline property of the synthesized nanoparticles and an FTIR spectrometer with a range of 4000â400Â cm<sup>â1</sup> was used to determine the chemical composition of the produced sample. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyser was used to study the morphological features and elemental composition of the synthesizedÂ sample. From sugarcane bagasse, amorphous silica nanoparticles with spherical morphology with an average size of 30Â nm, and a specific surface area of 111Â m<sup>2</sup>/g<sup>â1</sup> have been synthesized using the extraction and precipitation method. The confirmation of the silica nanoparticles in the sample was obtained from the IR spectra which showed the vibration peak of SiâOâSi. The morphology and particle size of synthesized nanoparticle was obtained by scanning electron microscope (SEM). X-ray powder diffraction confirms the structural characteristics of the produced silica nanoparticles (XRD). While the functional group's vibration is obtained by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and a BET surface area analyser was used to estimate the surface area of silica nanoparticles.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Hydroxyapatite nanoparticles</title><p id="Par37">Eggshells are usually discarded since they have no nutritional value and they promote microbial growth if discarded untreated, However, CaO can be used as a source for the commercial synthesis of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles. According to Aal et al., hydroxyapatite nanoparticles were synthesized by chemical precipitation method using chicken eggshell as biowaste and phosphoric acid solution as starting material. Hydroxyapatite nanoparticles can be synthesized from fish scales. The scales of fish (<italic>Lethrinus lentjan</italic>) could be used to make hydroxyapatite bio-precursors at a low cost. Organic (collagen, proteins and lipids) and inorganic (hydroxyapatite) compounds can be found in fish waste. So, these substances present in fish scales are converted to hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (solid form) by a hydrothermal method which is carried out at 280Â Â°C. The physiochemical characteristics of fish scale-derived hydroxyapatite nanoparticles can be characterized by using different techniques such as high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffractometer and thermogravimetric analyser (TGA). Sharifianjazi et.al used the ball milling method for theÂ preparation of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles, after annealing waste pigeon bones at 850Â Â°C, cold-pressing the nanoparticles and re-sintering at 850, 950, 1050 and 1150Â Â°C. The typical particle size of the ball-milled pigeon-derived nano-hydroxyapatite (PHA) was 50â250Â nm.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Nano-cellulose crystals</title><p id="Par38">Lei et al., introduced a new approach for the synthesis of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) from recycled office waste papers. This approach has a lot of significance as every year, a massive volume of office waste paper (OWP) is wasted, polluting the environment. OWP being cellulose-rich biomass was employed for the production of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) by acid hydrolysis with different acid concentrations but without subjecting OWP to alkali and bleaching treatments. CNCs produced with a 65% acid concentration coated on a PET sheet not only had improved water vapour barrier properties but also had the same transparency as PET. CNCs are a potential new material with unique qualities such as nanoscale size, high specific strength and modulus, high surface area, high crystallinity and distinctive optical properties, among others.</p><p id="Par39">Mehanny et al. synthesized CNCs from palm wastes (fronds, leaves and coir) by the chemical extraction method in which amorphous regions of cellulosic structure are attacked by acid leaving cellulose nanocrystals. Further characterization was done by scanning electron microscope (SEM) to determine the morphological structure, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), particle size analyser was used to measure the average diameter, size distribution and the zeta potential of the sample, FTIR spectrometer was used to determine infrared spectroscopy with the range between 4000 and 400Â cm<sup>â1</sup>, and for XRD analysis X-ray diffractometer is used with radiation at 30Â kV and 10Â mA. Zheng et al. synthesized nanocrystals from walnut shells and also highlights a few sustainable and environmentally friendly approaches based on recyclable chemicals that have been emerged as a result of recent technological advancements. Hydrolysis using solid acids (for example, phosphor tungstic acid) or treatment with ionic liquids or deep eutectic solvents are two examples. The most often utilized acid for synthesizing sulfonated cellulose nanocrystals with good water dispersibility is sulfuric acid. The Para crystalline or disordered regions of cellulose are hydrolysed and dissolved in the acid solution during the hydrolysis process; however, the crystalline parts of cellulose are chemically resistant to the acid and stay intact. As a result, the cellulose fibrils are cleaved transversely, resulting in short cellulose nanocrystals with high crystallinity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Application of biosynthesized nanoparticles</title><p id="Par40">Green nanotechnology-based approaches based on biowaste have been accepted as an environmentally friendly and cost-effective approach with a variety of applications as depicted in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Various applications of green synthesized nanoparticles derived from biogenic waste extracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41204_2022_276_Fig3_HTML.png" id="MO3"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>In therapeutics</title><sec id="Sec16"><title>Anticancer activity</title><p id="Par41">Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>].
