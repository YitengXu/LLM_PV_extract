Here, this concept is applied to international shipping, where long-lived assets increase the likelihood for high levels of committed emissions. To date, committed emissions studies have focussed predominantly on the power sector, or on global analyses in which shipping is a small element, with assumptions of asset lifetimes extrapolated from other transport modes. This study analyses new CO<sub>2</sub>, ship age and scrappage datasets covering the 11,000 ships included in the European Union’s new emissions monitoring scheme (EU MRV), to deliver original insights on the speed at which new and existing shipping infrastructure must be decarbonised. These results, using ship-specific assumptions on asset lifetimes, show higher committed emissions for shipping than previous estimates based on asset lifetimes similar to the road transport sector. The estimated baseline committed emissions value is equivalent to 85–212% of the carbon budget for 1.5 °C that is available for these EU MRV ships, with the central case exceeding the available carbon budget. The sector does, however, have significant potential to reduce this committed emissions figure without premature scrappage through a combination of slow speeds, operational and technical efficiency measures, and the timely retrofitting of ships to use zero-carbon fuels. Here, it is shown that if mitigation measures are applied comprehensively through strong and rapid policy implementation in the 2020s, and if zero-carbon ships are deployed rapidly from 2030, it is still possible for the ships in the EU MRV system to stay within 1.5 °C carbon budgets. Alongside this, as there are wide variations between and within ship types, this new analysis sheds light on opportunities for decision-makers to tailor policy interventions to deliver more effective CO<sub>2</sub> mitigation. Delays to appropriately stringent policy implementation would mean additional measures, such as premature scrappage or curbing the growth in shipping tonne-km, become necessary to meet the Paris climate goals.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council

change, aiming to keep the global surface temperature rise well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels, while pursuing efforts to keep below 1.5 °C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">The global climate responds approximately linearly to cumulative carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions, and over the timeframes of relevance to the Paris Agreement goals, the rise in global mean surface temperature is strongly dependent on cumulative emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As such, cumulative CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to 2100 are a better predictor of climate stabilisation than rates of change in emissions, concentration targets and emission levels in a given year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A carbon budget is the quantity of cumulative CO<sub>2</sub> that can be emitted over time to deliver a prescribed probability of staying below a given temperature target. This carbon budget metric has been used in national and global mitigation studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and incorporated as a core concept in IPCC reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Measures to reduce other greenhouse gas emissions such as methane are also required to achieve the Paris Agreement goals. Different gases have different lifetimes and warming effects so the climate’s response to non-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are modelled independently of cumulative CO<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Long-lived fossil-fuel infrastructure assets are prone to “carbon lock-in” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], committing sectors and economies to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions years and often decades into the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The concept of committed emissions from existing infrastructure has been used to examine what proportion of carbon budgets might be taken-up by the future operation of existing high-carbon assets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. At a global level, Tong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]‘s study of committed emissions concludes that “<italic>little or no additional CO</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub><italic>-emitting infrastructure can be commissioned</italic>” and also that early retirement of existing high-carbon infrastructure might be required to meet the limits laid out in the Paris Agreement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Committed emissions and shipping</title><p id="Par15">The shipping sector is vital to the world’s economy – it transports over 80% of the world’s trade by volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, it is also a major contributor of greenhouse gas emissions, with international shipping emitting around 800 MtCO<sub>2</sub> a year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. If the sector were a country, it would be the 6th highest emitter in the world, ranked between Germany and Japan. As such, the shipping sector needs to make substantial cuts in emissions to play its part in meeting the Paris Climate Agreement goals.</p><p id="Par16">In addition to measures implemented in 2013 to improve efficiency through the design of new ships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], the international maritime sector has set climate change targets, of an at least 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 versus 2008 levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Ships have a long-lifespan, the average age of a ship scrapped in 2018 was 28 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and so these targets may be harder to achieve than in sectors with a more rapid turn-over of assets. There is also the potential for committed emissions from existing ships to take up a high percentage of any carbon budget ascribed to the shipping sector. Analysis of committed emissions from existing shipping assets can therefore inform the rate, extent and types of response required from the shipping sector, for both existing and future ships, towards meeting the Paris climate goals.</p><p id="Par17">To date, studies of committed emissions have been in-depth analysis of the power sector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] or high-level global analyses where shipping is one of many sectors considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. To estimate shipping emissions, global-coverage papers have taken assumptions from elsewhere in transportation. Smith et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] assume asset lifetimes for ships to be similar to those for aviation, and Tong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] employ the assumptions used in Davis et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], that shipping and aviation assets would have similar lifetimes as those in the road transport sector at 17–28 years. However, there are three reasons, explored in detail in this paper, why a more in-depth analysis for the shipping sector would significantly augment these global analyses:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par18">Assuming lifetimes similar to the road transport sector under-estimates committed emissions in shipping, as typically ships have an average scrappage age of 28 years, higher than road transport averages.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par19">The size distribution, age distribution and average age at scrappage of existing assets in the shipping sector varies considerably, both between different ship types and by size within type. A more granular analysis better accounts for such differences than use of sector-wide averages. An example of a within-type difference is set out in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> using data for container vessels in the EU MRV system, with many newer ships being over four times larger than those 20 years or older.

The results and discussion sections identify the committed emissions across ship types for existing ships and for new ships, and compare the range of total committed emissions with a range of different carbon budgets for the shipping sector. They assess which measures might be more important in delivering rapid mitigation in each ship type, given the different age and committed emissions profiles of these sub-fleets, and whether such mitigation measures could bring emissions within carbon budgets. The conclusions section sets out implications for the challenges facing shipping in tackling climate change.

However, until recently data has not been freely available to assess ship-level greenhouse gas emissions. Data released in July 2019 from the European Union’s new Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (EU MRV) system for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions allows this granularity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The International Maritime Organisation’s Data Collection System (IMO DCS) commenced in 2019 with global coverage but individual ship data will be kept confidential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">The EU MRV system’s initial reporting period was for 2018, with publicly available ship-level data for fuel consumption, energy efficiency and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for approximately 11,000 ships. Data is updated regularly; this paper is based on data published during September 2019. To date, one published article has assessed this new EU database – analysing energy efficiency data for a subset of the bulk carrier fleet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. We present the first analysis of the CO<sub>2</sub> data across the whole of the EU MRV dataset, and combine this data with other datasets to provide a new analysis of how these CO<sub>2</sub> data vary by ship age across all ship types. This first evaluation of data on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions versus age allows the most detailed estimation to date on committed emissions from a large sub-section of global shipping.</p><p id="Par26">Two other data sets are also used; Clarksons World Fleet Register [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] datasets by ship type for IMO number, size (e.g. deadweight tonnage (DWT)) and age, and Clarksons World Shipyard Monitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] for average scrapping age of each type and size of ship worldwide. The individual ship data from Clarksons is provided on a commercial basis and cannot be disclosed, however aggregate results are presented in this paper. Combined, these datasets give a value for expected years of remaining service-life for each of the 11,000 ships.</p><p id="Par27">The EU MRV regulation covers all ships over 5000 gross tonnes, with some limited exemptions (e.g. warships), with coverage of over 90% of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from ships calling at EU ports, in 15 ship categories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. It requires reporting of the annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from all ships’ journeys that include an EU member state port as destination or departure point, and also emissions at berth in EU ports. It includes emissions from journeys involving non-EU ports: so long as at least one of the destination or departure ports is in the EU. The coverage is therefore not of ships registered in the EU, but ships’ journeys involving an EU port. The ship-owner must also report on fuel types, emissions factors, ship energy efficiency, transport work, total distance travelled and time at sea. The EU’s reporting system uses recorded fuel consumption as the main basis for its calculations.

For each ship its scrappage age is estimated by taking the values of average scrappage age for ships of its type and size, for each year in the last 10 years’ publications of Clarkson’s World Shipyard Monitor, and taking an average value across these 10 years. It is assumed that in future years until scrappage, a ship’s annual emissions are the same as in 2018.

Implementing any or all of these various options would lower the total value for committed emissions.

To explore how these interventions might alter the committed emissions, a model is constructed to allow user inputs to vary the start times, diffusion rate and deployment levels for different classes of improvement for all ships in each ship class. Four inputs are applied sequentially to the baseline:

Whilst LNG is conspicuous for its high life-cycle methane emissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], the potential benefits of other alternative fuels are also highly dependent on the balance of CO<sub>2</sub> upstream and non-CO2 emissions in production, distribution and use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. This paper assumes that LNG is not a sufficiently low carbon solution for shipping. We accept that in practice it will be difficult to achieve genuinely zero carbon fuels, and use the term “zero-carbon fuel” to mean fuels which have close to net-zero whole life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions, for example liquid hydrogen produced by hydrolysis of water using wind power.</p><p id="Par39">Whilst our analysis has focussed on technological and operational measures to cut emissions; a further set of policy options would be measures to reduce the volume of goods and the distances they are transported. It may be the case that in future these options are raised up the political agenda, as decarbonisation imperatives grow with increasing climate impacts, or if technological and operational measures are slow in delivery. The potential impact of stronger decarbonisation policy on shipped trade is discussed in depth by Walsh et al. 2019 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. For this analysis, our starting assumption is that global climate mitigation effects on volumes of shipped trade would be to lower trade growth, rather than lead to absolute reductions, following the Low Energy Demand scenario included in IPCC SR1.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Shipping carbon budgets</title><p id="Par40">The concept of carbon budgets is prominent in IPCC reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], given the near linear relationship between cumulative carbon dioxide emissions and temperature rise. For ships covered by the EU MRV system, we calculate carbon budgets for meeting the Paris Agreement’s goal to “pursue efforts” to keep warming to below 1.5 °C in two stages. First, we set out a range of global carbon budgets to indicate equivalence with this goal, then we ascribe a proportion of that global carbon budget to ships in the EU MRV system.</p><p id="Par41">This paper takes as its starting point the carbon budgets set out in IPCC SR 1.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Work since then is summarised in Rogelj et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] who propose a framework for consolidating the various carbon budget methodologies and uncertainties, and sets out the remaining (2019 onwards) global carbon budget for 33, 50 and 66% probabilities of staying under 1.5 °C warming, at 700, 440 and 280 GtCO<sub>2</sub> respectively. Rogelj et al. also ascribe a variation to these budgets of ± 250 GtCO<sub>2</sub> to account for uncertainty in the success of policies to mitigate non-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions such as methane. The complex outlook for non-CO<sub>2</sub> mitigation is summarised in depth by Roe et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">In applying a budgeting approach to shipping specifically, we acknowledge that there is no established or agreed mechanism for ascribing a share of global carbon budgets to this sector. Typically, the literature on apportionment methodologies in shipping has focused on the issue of dividing effort between nations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], given the complexities of ownership, operation and use, rather than determining a share of emissions for the shipping sector as a whole. Traut et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] propose that the share of a future global carbon budget for international shipping should be “proportionate to the sector’s current share of global emissions”, an approach which has also been articulated by the International Chamber of Shipping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. There are, however, arguments that shipping should receive a larger share, given its vital role in facilitating global trade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], and likewise arguments the sector should receive less, for example given its greater capability to make emissions reductions than sectors such as aviation or agriculture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">We adopt the “proportionate to current share” approach for EU MRV shipping, assuming that the ratio of EU MRV carbon budget to global carbon budget is the same as the ratio of 2018 EU MRV CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to 2018 Global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. We note that taking this approach might overestimate EU MRV budgets, as equity methodologies in the mitigation literature tend to focus on capability and responsibility, and by most metrics the EU has more capability and responsibility than the global average [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Nevertheless, sensitivity tests on 10% higher and lower budgets for both international shipping and EU MRV shipping produced marginal difference in implications for the sector (see results section).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Committed emissions from future ships</title><p id="Par44">Finally, in addition to committed emissions from existing ships, there are also committed emissions from ships to be built in coming years. For example, there are roughly 3000 ships on global orderbooks for delivery over the next 3 years, which will use high-carbon fuels, and be used on average for over two decades. Beyond this, as existing ships are scrapped and replaced, and if the global ship fleet size continues to increase as per historic trends, then these new ships (replacement and additional) will also contribute further emissions, given that it is not likely that a large proportion of new ships will run on zero-carbon fuels until at least 2030 without significant policy changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. This paper briefly discusses the likely relative size of the emissions of existing versus new ships, and implications for climate change policy in the shipping sector.</p><p id="Par45">Fleet growth is highly uncertain. DNV-GL assume that global fleet dead-weight tonnage will increase by 35% on 2016 levels by 2050 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. However, this may not translate into shipping tonne mile growth; for example de Backer and Flaig [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] argue that digitalisation and use of robotics may increase intra-regional trade at the expense of inter-regional trade. Furthermore, growth in different fleet sub-categories will vary. DNV-GL’s maritime outlook forecasts that global growth is strong for most sectors to 2030, but from 2030 oil tanker trade will fall. Falling demand for transportation of other fossil-fuels may also have implications for shipping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. In this paper we analyse 1, 2 and 3% annual growth rates in the total number of ships, applied uniformly across the whole fleet. We also tested this assumption against ship category variations, for example keeping the overall fleet growth rate at 2% per annum but reducing oil tanker growth to 1% reduces overall new ship committed emissions by 4%. We also note the extremely uncertain long-term impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, both on shipping generally and on specific sub-sectors such as cruise. In the short-term there will be major effects, although it is unknown what the long-term impacts will be. For instance, following the 2008 financial down-turn the shipping industry rebounded quickly, with tonne-miles transported 10 years later aligning with prior trends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">Ships are becoming more fuel-efficient every year driven by measures such as the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Analysis of IMO data by Transport and Environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] shows that current new ships are considerably more fuel-efficient than existing ships. The top 10% performing new ships are between 40 and 60% more fuel efficient than comparable ships of the same type and size. In this analysis we assume as an initial baseline that new ships are 40% more energy-efficient than existing ships of the same type and size, with a further annual 3% improvement in EEDI values.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Existing ships’ emissions in 2018</title><p id="Par47">The EU MRV database splits ships into 15 categories.

First, because ships have long lifetimes, the baseline committed emissions from existing ships are large: at 2260 MtCO<sub>2</sub> this is 135% of the carbon budget for a 50% probability of exceeding 1.5 °C. New ships built in the 2020s will also add to this. Second, this committed emissions value could be considerably lower: if measures are introduced to lower ship speeds, improve operational efficiencies and use zero-carbon fuels it is possible for shipping to stay within a 1.5 carbon budget, the date of deployment being important. Third, there are significant differences in the age profile of different ship types, which has implications for decision-makers wanting to implement policies to cut shipping emissions. All three contributions highlight the importance of policies focussed on the existing fleet rather than solely on performance standards for new build such as the IMO’s EEDI.</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>Shipping’s committed emissions</title><p id="Par74">There are three previous papers that have considered shipping’s committed emissions, all of them treating shipping as a sub-set of transportation emissions as part of a global analysis, and all using extrapolations for shipping based on asset lifetimes elsewhere in the transport sector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This paper adds significant value to the existing literature on committed emissions by calculating an in-depth committed emissions value in a large segment of the shipping sector, using for the first time shipping-sector-specific assumptions about asset lifetimes. The 2260 MtCO<sub>2</sub> baseline committed emissions value in this paper is around twice what might be expected if following the Tong et al.

The main cause of this difference is due to the different values used for the lifetimes of existing ships. This study uses an average of 28.3 years, whereas Tong et al. use assumptions for mean lives of motor vehicles, of 16.9–28.0 years. This paper’s value is similar to that derived by Smith et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], who assume that ship lifetimes are similar to those of planes at 26 years. However, our use here of non-uniform age and lifetime profiles of different ship types and sub-types of ship is a further contribution.</p><p id="Par75">The baseline committed emissions value for existing ships of 2260 MtCO<sub>2</sub> is 135% of an EU MRV ships’ carbon budget for a 50% chance of staying below a 1.5 °C global temperature target (85 to 212% for 33 to 66% probability respectively). Global carbon budget values are subject to ongoing research, but the results of this analysis reinforce the finding of Tong et al. that committed emissions from existing high-carbon infrastructure leave very little room for new future high-carbon infrastructure. In addition, replacement and additional ships built in the 2020s will also run predominantly on fossil fuels, adding to committed emissions.</p><p id="Par76">However, our larger committed emissions value could be lowered, if policies or practices are adopted that mean these long-lived assets use less or zero-carbon fuel in future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Lowering committed emissions below carbon budgets</title><p id="Par77">Applying the findings of Bouman et al.’s 2017 review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] of measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in shipping to latest individual ship level emissions data allows us to assess the sector’s compatibility with global climate targets and the balance between CO<sub>2</sub> mitigation measures targeting the existing fleet and new builds.</p><p id="Par78">The results show that even with rapid deployment of zero-carbon fuel in new ships from 2030 and if all the existing ships at that date were retrofitted to use zero-carbon fuels over the following 10 years, then the emissions from this fleet would be 2152 MtCO<sub>2</sub>, which is 129% of a carbon budget with 50% probability of 1.5 °C (See Table <xref rid="Tab9" ref-type="table">9</xref>). If this date were delayed to 2035, committed emissions would total 2767 MtCO<sub>2</sub>, 166% of a 1.5 budget, highlighting the considerable additional emissions due to just a 5 year delay.</p><p id="Par79">Assuming a 2030 zero carbon-fuel date, introducing additional measures such as lower speeds, fuel blending, and operational and technical efficiencies, based on mid-range assumptions from the literature, could lower emissions to 1652 MtCO<sub>2</sub>, just under a 50% 1.5 °C carbon budget.</p><p id="Par80">Two points follow from this. First, it is imperative that zero-carbon fuels and associated infrastructure are developed and deployed at scale such that new ships running on such fuels are rapidly deployed from 2030 at the latest, and that existing ships are retrofitted from that date. Second, this is not sufficient for a 1.5 °C target, and slow-speed and efficiency measures also need to be deployed in the 2020s.</p><p id="Par81">With an assumption of zero-carbon new ships from 2030, the vast majority of the total committed emissions comes from existing ships (80%), rather than ships built between now and 2030. This is because the turnover of the shipping fleet is slow: even with an assumption of annual fleet growth at 2%, older, less fuel-efficient ships dominate the fleet. With 80% of committed emissions coming from existing ships, this means that measures to cut emissions need to focus predominantly on these ships, rather than just measures such as the IMO’s EEDI policy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], which focuses on new ships. A revised IMO Greenhouse Gas strategy should aim to reduce emissions in-line with carbon budgets for the Paris Agreement 1.5 °C goal. This paper suggests that for international shipping, a zero emission date around 2040 would be an appropriate goal, with an interim target of 47% cuts from 2020 emissions by 2030.</p><p id="Par82">The analysis here shows that the individual measure with the greatest potential to deliver these emissions reductions is slower speeds, with major reductions from early implementation (Table <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>). This adds further weight to the argument for adopting measures that incentivise or mandate slower ship speeds, as these could implemented far faster than the majority of the operational measures requiring retrofit in shipyards.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Policy interventions and ship type</title><p id="Par83">Analysis of emissions data by ship type can aid policy-makers by enabling a focus on areas with greatest potential. Container ships have the highest baseline committed emissions, at 29% of the total. The EU MRV data show that even though new container ships are among the most energy efficient vessels (in gCO<sub>2</sub>/t nm), the fact that they are so large, so new and so long-lived means they have a disproportionately large impact on total committed emissions. Paradoxically perhaps, this suggests a mitigation policy focus on the ships that are already some of the most efficient. Slow steaming and operational measures are well suited to bringing committed emissions down in the container ship type, reducing their committed emissions by 27% in this analysis. This is further reinforced by evidence that container ships on average travel at faster speeds than other ship types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] meaning there is potentially great scope to reduce container emissions via this parameter.</p><p id="Par84">Some types of ships are very long-lived, notably cruise, passenger and ro pax vessels. Slow steaming may be harder in these cases, which means that retrofit and operational efficiency measures are likely to bring the largest gains. Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows a large range for average remaining life by ship type: for example refrigerated cargo ships have on average 9 years remaining life, whereas passenger ships have 29 years. All other things being equal, a ship owner will be less willing to invest in retrofitting measures to a ship with less remaining life. This means that for ships and ship types with shorter remaining life, the successful uptake of emissions reduction measures requires action from policy-makers, such as regulating on speed, retro-fitting to improve efficiency, or market-based mechanisms that impact on fuel price.</p><p id="Par85">A further issue is the interplay between EU and non-EU markets. Refrigerated cargo vessels in the EU MRV are old, at 22 years on average, but outside the EU they are on average 9 years older. If retrofitting is not an economic option for old refrigerated cargo vessels, and they are sold on into non-EU markets, then the emissions would merely be transferred into other geographical areas. EU policy makers might therefore consider incentives for early scrappage for very inefficient older ships. The types where it appears that this might be more applicable are refrigerated cargo, container ships and oil tankers. Within ship types opportunities have also been identified. For example, compared to other ship types, container ships’ remaining lifespan is low, but within the container ship type, ships with shorter remaining life are smaller and less efficient. A differential approach might then be appropriate within the container fleet; speed reduction measures being appropriate for all ships, but with an additional emphasis on further operational measures for the larger, newer, more efficient ships, and early retirement for the older, smaller, less efficient ships.</p><p id="Par86">Finally, a stated aim for the EU MRV system is that it helps to bring emissions down [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This initial analysis of the EU MRV suggests that its data is useful in highlighting to EU and global policy-makers which areas and policy interventions might deliver the largest emissions reductions benefits. The EU has also stated that it will take unilateral action on shipping’s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions if there is insufficient progress at IMO level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. In such a situation the EU MRV dataset will be useful for policy makers and analysts in determining priority areas for climate mitigation measures in the shipping sector. It is intended that the EU MRV programme should be integrated with the global IMO Data Collection System (DCS) over time. To aid policy-makers, industry and others in determining effective interventions, we suggest that the IMO should similarly make individual ship data from their forthcoming DCS monitoring programme publicly available, as is the case with EU MRV.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par87">This study provides a new assessment of the scale of the mitigation agenda for the shipping sector, and the imperative for significantly accelerating efforts to target CO<sub>2</sub> policies within the existing global fleet. Building on Tong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], we analyse recently published EU ship CO<sub>2</sub> data, with shipping sector-specific data for ship lifetimes and find committed emissions for this EU dataset to be twice that presented in their study. We find that existing ships are expected to contribute 85 to 212% of the sub-sector’s 1.5 °C-compatible carbon budget. Emissions from replacement and additional ships in the 2020s would add to this, further exhausting carbon budgets.</p><p id="Par88">The ships that were in operation at the time of writing in early 2020 will still make up the majority of the fleet in 2030. To keep within carbon budgets, the shipping sector will need not only to adopt new very low-carbon fuels and new very low-carbon ships from 2030 at the latest, but in addition rapidly deploy measures such as operational efficiency and impose slower speeds <italic>within</italic> the 2020s to mitigate the committed emissions from the existing fleet. Combining these measures could cut the baseline committed cumulative CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from existing ships by up to 65%. Comprehensive adoption of the mid-range assumptions (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) for existing and new ships would be sufficient to stay within Paris compatible carbon budgets.</p><p id="Par89">The shipping sector has a broad suite of options to decarbonise but needs major policy interventions to incentivise change to the existing fleet. By distinguishing between types of ship, this analysis illustrates the huge value of retrofit solutions that help shipping align with Paris goals. Specifically, container ships are shown to be the greatest contributor to committed emissions, and perhaps counter-intuitively, newer ships are the biggest contributors within the container category, despite being more efficient because they tend to be larger in size. Passenger ships have disproportionately high committed emissions, given their small numbers, because they tend to be very long-lived: regulation that improves operational efficiencies should therefore be a priority in this type of ship. Across ship types, slow steaming stands out as the most promising measure that could be applied quickly to deliver large reductions in emissions in line with Paris goals.</p><p id="Par90">The committed emissions from ships are significant, yet a combination of policies on very low-carbon ships from 2030, combined with speed and operational measures from the early 2020s, could keep shipping within a Paris-compatible carbon budget. However, any delay to appropriate policy implementation would mean additional measures, including demand-side or early scrappage interventions, to meet the Paris climate goals. In summary, the time left to deliver on what is dictated by the global Paris Agreement is too short to rely on measures that predominantly focus on improving the efficiency of new ships. New zero-carbon ships are essential, but we conclude that policy makers must target a new suite of mitigation measures at the existing fleet with some urgency.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Thanks to Transport and Environment for the results of their analysis of new ship EEDI data, and to the two anonymous reviewers whose suggestions and challenges have improved the initial draft.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors’ contributions</title><p>SB, JB and AL designed the study.
