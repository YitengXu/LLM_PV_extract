In this work, we evaluate the effects of wavelength-selective cutoffs of visible and near-infrared (biologically active) radiation using transparent photovoltaic (TPV) absorbers on the growth of three diverse, representative, and economically important crops: petunia, basil, and tomato. Despite the differences in TPV harvester absorption spectra, photon transmission of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR; 400–700 nm) is the most dominant predictor of crop yield and quality. This indicates that different wavebands of blue, red, and green are essentially equally important to these plants. When the average photosynthetic daily light integral is &gt; 12 mol m<sup>–2</sup> d<sup>–1</sup>, basil and petunia yield and quality is acceptable for commercial production. However, even modest decreases in TPV transmission of PAR reduces tomato growth and fruit yield. These results identify crop-specific design requirements that exist for TPV harvester transmission and the necessity to maximize transmission of PAR to create the most broadly applicable TPV greenhouse harvesters for diverse crops and geographic locations. We determine that the deployment of 10% power conversion efficiency (<italic>PCE</italic>) plant-optimized TPVs over approximately 10% of total agricultural and pasture land in the U.S. would generate 7 TW, nearly double the entire energy demand of the U.S.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Horticultural Research Institute</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005888</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>AgBioResearch, Michigan State University</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011138</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Portfolio</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>1903</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>19</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2023_Article_28484.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The incorporation of photovoltaics (PV) into agriculture has drawn significant interest recently to address increased food insecurity and energy demand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Agrivoltaics is the utilization of sunlight for both plant production and solar energy harvesting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. These two fields are often seen as competitive rather than cooperative because they can both occupy large areas of land to maximize sunlight utilization. Indeed, most agrivoltaic-based efforts have looked to integrate opaque solar panels (such as Si modules) over and around agricultural spaces so that there is often a strong tradeoff between allowing light to penetrate to the plants or be utilized for solar electricity generation. Despite this, photovoltaics have potential synergistic benefits with plant production. In addition to generating electricity to power greenhouse load (e.g., lights, fans, and other equipment), PV modules can also decrease water consumption by reducing the rate of evaporation from soil and transpiration from plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Both plant responses and PV power generation are key considerations in designing agrivoltaic systems. One way to overcome the severe limitation of opaque agrivoltaics is to design new PVs that can maintain plant yield and quality by minimizing PV impact on transmission of photons with wavelengths between 400 and 700 nm, which is referred to as photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a illustrates the progression and outlook of agrivoltaic approaches, including current approaches shown here, based on increasing transparency, starting with opaque PV modules, and moving towards PAR-transparent PV devices.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Conceptualization of key agrivoltaic principles. (<bold>a</bold>) Ideally, agrivoltaic systems would have high transmission of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR; photons between 400 and 700 nm). The simplest implementation of agrivoltaics is by deploying opaque modules over or adjacent to crops. Higher average photosynthetic transmittance (<italic>APT</italic>) can be achieved by moving to wavelength-selective modules that do not absorb PAR.

(<bold>b</bold>) Having a high PAR transmission is important because plants use photons from this waveband for photosynthesis and as signals for photomorphogenesis. To characterize this window, we have plotted the absorption spectra of chlorophyll (Chl) <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic>, red-absorbing phytochrome (Pr) and far-red-absorbing phytochrome (Pfr), and the averaged quantum yield (mol CO<sub>2</sub> fixed per mol photon absorbed as a function of wavelength; denoted as McCree) of many plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Absorbing visible radiation (VIS) would be energetically advantageous for building-integrated PV (BIPV) panels but could negatively influence greenhouse crop growth and development. (<bold>c</bold>) Thus, in this research we look at plant growth and productivity as a function of cutoffs of VIS and near infra-red wavebands and of overall transmission using neutral-density treatments.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2023_28484_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par3">Plant productivity typically increases with photon flux density of PAR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. This is measured instantaneously as the photosynthetic photon flux density (<italic>PPFD</italic>, with units of µmol m<sup>–2</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>) or, more appropriately for plant growth, integrated on a daily basis as the daily light integral (<italic>DLI</italic>, with units of mol m<sup>–2</sup> d<sup>–1</sup>). PAR is commonly divided into three wavebands: blue (B; 400–500 nm), green (G; 500–600 nm), and red (R; 600–700 nm) light. Each waveband independently and interactively regulates plant growth and development (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b) with additional contributions coming from UV (280–400 nm), near-infrared (NIR) or far-red (FR; 700–750 nm) wavebands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Of these, B and FR light strongly regulate plant morphology and development, altering characteristics such as leaf area, stem length, and flowering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Although there can be benefits to decreasing incoming solar radiation in some cases (e.g., reducing water consumption or soil temperature), adoption of this hybrid field will rely on being broadly applicable by transmitting as much PAR as possible, particularly in temperate climates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In some agrivoltaic approaches, G light has been considered to have less impact on plant growth because of low absorption by chlorophyll and carotenoids, causing it to be a target wavelength for absorption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. However, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, metrics such as relative action and quantum yield show that plants utilize G light quite efficiently in photosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Green light is particularly useful in penetrating deeper into leaves under high-light conditions and reaching leaves that are shaded by others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Thus, spectral manipulation by absorbing specific wavebands within PAR (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c) will alter plant growth and yield, which will vary among species and cultivars of plants. Allowing growers to maintain control of how plants grow and develop while still providing the benefits of agrivoltaics will be essential to enable future widespread adoption.</p><p id="Par4">Recent efforts have been made to introduce and improve visible transparency of PV cells, either broadband or with selectively absorbing materials, to increase application to a greater number of surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. We can evaluate these approaches in the context of agrivoltaics, from spatially segmenting opaque solar cells to wavelength-selective active materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. This is a key distinction because they offer fundamentally different theoretical limits as a function of transparency. The theoretical limit of a spatially segmented cell is 0% at 100% transparency and around 21% for wavelength-selective transparent photovoltaics (TPVs) at 100% transparency. Agrivoltaic implementations based on opaque or visibly absorbing materials will always have a tradeoff between power generation and plant productivity. As a result, agrivoltaic studies have primarily focused on the financial tradeoff of power generation over reduced crop yield<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. While financially the tradeoff is of slight benefit, notable losses in crop yield will limit the implementation of agrivoltaics for locations or seasons with limited or moderate PAR availability. Each study also typically focused on only one type of plant under an exceedingly small area of PVs, limiting the translatability as to how these different agrivoltaic approaches will affect a variety of species.</p><p id="Par5">In this work, we evaluate the effects of TPVs with neutral shading and with wavelength-selective shading on three diverse and highly representative and commercially important species of plants grown in greenhouses: the culinary herb basil (<italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic>), the flowering ornamental petunia (<italic>Petunia</italic> × <italic>hybrida</italic>), and the fruit-bearing tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>). Emphasis is placed around the VIS and NIR edge to better understand where it is appropriate to absorb light for TPV without affecting plant growth and development. We show that overall <italic>DLI</italic> has particularly important ramifications for growth, yield, and morphology across species and that weighted <italic>DLI</italic> further impacts these metrics, indicating wavelength-specific phenomena should be studied further. This work will enable the design of agrivoltaic approaches to ensure greater compatibility with existing agricultural infrastructure across a large range of crop types and in regions with different solar availability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par6">We constructed seven ventilated chambers (each a roof area of ~ 0.96 m<sup>2</sup>) that were each covered with a different experimental TPV glazing material (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>).

Elongation and narrowing of basil stems (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) caused plants to become progressively less upright compared to the ND91 treatment, which could negatively affect basil consumer appeal or ease of production (i.e., harvest and shipping). In addition to yield, leaf morphology is important to basil cultivation.

While yield has a simple mathematical definition, crop quality is subjective and can consider consumer preferences for, and interactions with, an agricultural product. Examples include crop nutrition and flavor and physical qualities that make a crop easier to manage, harvest, ship, or market. Ideally, agrivoltaic systems would have no negative effect on crop yield or quality while creating passive income through electrical generation. An inescapable challenge for designing and using agrivoltaic systems is accounting for the many different crops and growing systems used in plant-based agriculture.

The thermodynamic single-junction Shockley-Queisser (SQ) limit also assumes one hundred percent internal quantum efficiency, parallel resistance is infinite, series resistance is negligible, only photons with energy equal to or greater than the bandgap are absorbed, and each photon corresponds to exactly one electron.<sub>.</sub> For an opaque single-junction PV module, the <italic>PCE</italic> limit is 33.7%, meaning that 33.7% of the total energy from incident solar irradiance can be converted to electricity. The limit is 20.1% for modules that transmit all light between 435 and 670 nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. When expanding the transmission range to 395–715 nm, the resulting theoretical limit is 17.0% (note that the theoretical limits of the absorbers presented in this work can be found in Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S5</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S9</xref>).

The thermodynamic limits we define here for standard TPV modules also translate equivalently to the limits for visibly transparent luminescent solar concentrators (TLSCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. TLSCs are capable of higher <italic>APT</italic> values (~ 90%) because TPV modules are limited by multiple transparent electrodes to an <italic>APT</italic> of ~ 80%; however, TLSCs have lagged behind TPVs in <italic>PCE</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par27">We use these limits to project forward and estimate the total potential energy output for transparent agrivoltaics that maintain maximum transparency and minimal plant impact. In the U. S., the total amount of area under protected surfaces (e.g., glass and plastic greenhouses) is approximately 1.1 10<sup>7</sup> m<sup>2</sup> for fruit, vegetable, and herb production and 7.0 10<sup>7</sup> m<sup>2</sup> for floriculture crop production (for the 17 states surveyed)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Assuming 50% of this covered area is permanent greenhouses, this gives an area of ~ 4.0 10<sup>7</sup> m<sup>2</sup>. Given that the annual average incident solar insolation across the US is 4.5 kWh m<sup>−2</sup> d<sup>−1</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>, we then use benchmark efficiencies up to the calculated limits to show the potential annual energy output (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S7</xref>). Assuming 5%-efficient modules, this translates to 3 TWh annually. While the greenhouse energy output value is modest, it can provide important power generation to cover much of the energy demands of greenhouse operation and produce excess energy in high solar flux regions. This effect could become increasingly important as the use of greenhouses expands to enable growth in regions that are less favorable for plant growth, and indeed could hasten greenhouse adoption. In contrast, the total area of farmland (including pastureland) in the US is 3.6 10<sup>12</sup> m<sup>2</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. Agrivoltaics could further be integrated more widely into fields and farmland, particularly if the tradeoffs between plant productivity and power generation can be minimized with the proposed TPV design approaches. In this case, array support structures that enable operating equipment (e.g., tractors and irrigation systems) to function as necessary would be important. Indeed, such solar installations could be synergistically and simultaneously installed with irrigation systems (and perhaps fertilizer and pesticide solutions too) such that the PV mounting systems double as conduit for subsurface, drip, or spray irrigation. At the theoretical limit, the total output would approach 1.0 10<sup>6</sup> TWh (~ 3500 quadrillion British thermal units, quads), which is more than the entire energy demand of the U.S. across all sectors. We estimate TPV agrivoltaic panels could reasonably cover upwards of 1–10% of farmland area, translating to a minimum of 3.6 10<sup>10</sup> m<sup>2</sup> in this case. The use of 5% efficient TPV modules over 1% of farmland results in 3000 TWh annually, enough energy to account for 75% of the U.S. electricity consumption (~ 4000 TWh), and 10%-efficient TPVs would provide 6000 TWh annually, surpassing the entire electricity consumption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. Scaling up to 10% of farmland and utilizing practically achievable 10%-efficient TPVs, the total power output would be 60,000 TWh (~ 200 quads), which would more than double the 27,000 TWh (~ 93 quads) of total power generated in the U.S. from all sources in 2020 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>.

Unique to agrivoltaic greenhouse systems is the demand for growing many different crops continuously throughout the year. Currently, more comprehensive agrivoltaics research is necessary to understand what materials are most applicable to the broad range of crops grown in greenhouses while considering agricultural practices and geographical locations. The current work offers a novel plant-centric focus where TPV materials are investigated to minimize the impact on plant growth, productivity, and yield.</p><p id="Par29">Despite the often-dramatic differences in PV panel photon distribution, panel transmission of <italic>PAR</italic> was the most significant predictor of crop yield and quality. Basil and petunia yield and quality responses were saturated when the average <italic>DLI</italic> was &gt; 12 mol m<sup>–2</sup> d<sup>–1</sup>, which corresponded to ~ 35–40% shading (~ 60–65% <italic>APT</italic>). This indicates tremendous potential for herbs and floriculture crops in agrivoltaic systems from late spring to early fall when solar irradiance is high. However, the fruiting crop tomato experienced reduced yield with even moderate BIPV shading, and thus <italic>APT</italic> &gt; 65%, is even more strongly desired. Additional studies are necessary to determine a more precise red, far-red, near-infrared cutoff for fruiting crops under a variety of total <italic>DLIs</italic> to provide greater context for more diverse geographical locations. Pushing the absorption edge deeper into the NIR (&gt; 750 nm) increases the transmitted <italic>DLI</italic> and therefore should reduce the impact of TPVs on fruiting crops, resulting in productivity more comparable to the control of single-pane glass. Lastly, this work identifies the need for consistent quantum unit reporting in agrivoltaics to improve study reproducibility and applicability for future agrivoltaic systems, whether building- or field-based. Establishing appropriate <italic>APT</italic>, <italic>DLI</italic>, and wavelength cutoffs for different types of crops is a necessary step towards developing TPVs for a range of truly synergistic agrivoltaic implementations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>The experimental section</title><sec id="Sec16"><title>Preparation of wavelength-selective harvesters (CO550a, CO700, CO770)</title><p id="Par30">2-[2-[2-Chloro-3-[(1,3-dihydro-1,3,3-trimethyl-2H-indol-2-ylidene)ethylidene]-1-cylcohexen-1-yl]-ethenyl]-1,3,3-trimethyl-1H-indolium iodide (IR775-I, Few Chemicals) and 2‐[2‐[2‐chloro‐3‐[2‐(1,3‐dihydro‐3,3‐dimethyl‐1‐ethyl‐2H‐benz[e]indol‐2‐ylidene)ethylidene]‐1‐cylohexen‐1‐yl]‐ethenyl]‐3,3‐dimethyl‐1‐ethyl‐1H‐benz[e]indolium iodide (Cy-I, American Dye Source).
