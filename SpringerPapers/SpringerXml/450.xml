In this study, a new APP system design—wearable APP (WAPP)—that utilizes a knitting technique to assemble flexible co-axial wire electrodes into a large-area plasma fabric is presented. The WAPP device operates in ambient air with a fully enclosed power electrode and grounded outer electrode. The plasma fabric is flexible and lightweight, and it can be scaled up for larger areas, making it attractive for wearable APP applications. Here, we report the various plasma properties of the WAPP device and successful test results showing the decontamination of toxic chemical warfare agents, namely, mustard (HD), soman (GD), and nerve (VX) agents.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>7223</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>18</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2017_Article_BFsrep40746.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>13</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Atmospheric pressure plasmas (APPs) have been actively studied since the 1990s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In contrast to vacuum plasmas, which are used in confined applications, such as semiconductor processes, APPs can be discharged in open spaces (1 atm). The classification of APPs is based on their discharge structures and discharge modes, which include dielectric barrier discharge (DBD), corona jet, glow discharge, arc torch, micro-hollow cathode discharge (MHCD), and inductively coupled plasma (ICP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Plasma with the desired physical and chemical characteristics is generated by adjusting factors such as the input frequency, input voltage, input current, input waveform, and supply gas. Because of its various favorable characteristics, the application of APP to various fields, such as the biomedical, material, and energy/environmental industries, has been considered, and basic research on APPs has been actively conducted worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">However, more than 90% of APP research is related to small DBD or corona-jet-type plasmas that use helium or argon gas with a relatively low discharge voltage.

By contrast, air plasmas do not require special gases and are easy to apply in ambient environments. In APP, the major species affecting chemical/biological materials are typically attributed to radicals, reactive oxygen species (ROS; e.g., OH, O, and O<sub>3</sub>), reactive nitrogen species (RNS; e.g., NO and NOx), charged particles (O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>), and reactive metastables (e.g., O<sub>2</sub>(<sup>1</sup>Δ<sub>g</sub>)). In APP applications for which air is used instead of a discharge gas, DBD-type or torch-type electrodes are frequently utilized. However, because both the space between the electrodes and the plasma treatment sectional area are usually small, new electrode concepts that can provide large-area discharge while increasing the power efficiency are required<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">To overcome limitations in the treatment area, the treatment of a large flat surface area has been investigated by combining a plasma torch array and a roll-to-roll process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.

Because of the slow rate of chemical agent degradation under environmental conditions, the ability to rapidly decontaminate solid surfaces is required for military and civil defense forces to remove the hazards introduced by these agents. Consequently, the efficient decontamination of large and complex three-dimensional (3D) surface areas using the newly developed wearable air-based APP system is demonstrated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Wearable APP (WAPP)</title><p id="Par8"><xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref> presents schematic illustrations of the side and cross-sectional views of the WAPP single-wire electrode structure. The cylindrical inner electrode (i.e., the high-voltage electrode) is encased in a flexible dielectric material (heat-proof silicone). The outer electrode (i.e., the ground mesh electrode) encases the outer circumference of the dielectric material and contains numerous holes to allow the outward emission of the generated plasma. This cylindrical wire is very flexible and has a minimum outer diameter of 1.8 mm. The inner electrode comprises seven thin wires and has a diameter of 0.18 mm, and the thicknesses of the dielectric medium and outer mesh electrode are 0.3 mm and 0.35 mm, respectively. This structure appears to be very similar to that of a coaxial cable. However, the mesh braiding coverage is considerably different. In coaxial cables, increased mesh braiding coverage results in better shielding. By contrast, for plasma generation, a similar external mesh braiding coverage is suitable for an air discharge of 50% to 80%. When pulsed high voltage is applied to the inner electrode, surface DBD is generated in the open area between the inner electrode and outer mesh electrode. Therefore, the mesh braiding coverage must be varied depending on the purpose of the device. In addition, the external mesh electrodes are connected to the ground; thus, the electrode is safe to touch.

Logically, the power must be increased to discharge the plasma over a long, large area. The circuit characteristics are more strongly affected by the length of the wire electrode than by the knitting pattern. However, if the wire length in a given fabric is very long, the input power depends not only on the wire length but also on its geometric structure. Therefore, we plan to further optimize the flexible nanowire geometric structure for low-power air discharge in the future. In this study, we focus on the development of a new method for producing a knitted flexible source using our WAPP wire electrode and its potential applications.</p><p id="Par11"><xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref> illustrates the knitting method used to fabricate large flexible plasma reactors, such as hand-knitted towels (550 mm × 150 mm, C = 6.24 nF, total wire length = 48 m) and gloves (200 mm × 150 mm, C = 2.7 nF, total wire length = 20.4 m) using 2.2-mm wire.

The images were obtained according to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 8000 requirements, and the exposure time was 1.3 s. When the total input power was fixed at 300 W throughout the discharge, the color of the air plasma was bright violet to the naked eye. Because the discharge electrode is safe to touch, we can treat complex 3D surfaces using this wearable electrode system.

Therefore, the thermal effects of the system components do not play a major role in the removal of the agents from the surface. In a previous paper that compared the results of plasma and hot gas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, the plasma exposure results for a VX simulant indicated that removal began at temperatures as low as 50 °C, whereas for hot gas, removal was not observed until 120 °C.

In other words, the vapor pressures of GD, HD, and VX are 13 Pa, 53 Pa, and 0.09 Pa, respectively, at 25 °C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.

The flexible knitted plasmas generate non-thermal plasma by releasing electrons with high kinetic energies in the range of 290 to 580 kJ/mol by creating an electrical discharge between pairs of electrodes and by accelerating the electrons in the electrical field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Therefore, the energy of the electrons is exploited to activate atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen, resulting in the generation of ROS and RNS that should be capable of breaking toxic chemical bonds via oxidation. To generate ozone, the plasma discharge initially breaks down a molecule of dioxygen into atomic oxygen. The significant amount of energy required for this process (approximately 500 kJ/mol) comes from an electrical discharge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Although the input energy is much lower, the emergence of ozone is inevitable because of the working principle (the energy input conforms to a Boltzmann distribution). Given the relatively long life of ozone, its release outside the plasma zone is plausible. Therefore, the ROS in the surface plasma region can effectively remove organic binders via oxidation because of their high potential energies. These highly reactive oxygen atoms can also eliminate chemical agents on the CARC surface. Furthermore, the low gas temperature of the APP treatment protects the CARC surface from thermal damage.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Possible explanation for the detoxification achieved using plasma</title><p id="Par21">One possible explanation for detoxification achieved using plasma is the effective energy transfer between the vibrationally excited O<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> molecules and the chemical agents.

Using this method, a uniform plasma with a large area can be obtained. To the best of our knowledge, this flexible electrode-knitting technique is the first successful method for creating wearable plasma sources and demonstrates the full capacity of the APP system for various applications. In addition, this wearable plasma source can discharge into ambient air without requiring any external gas. The experimental results show that the wearable air plasma can completely decontaminate toxic chemical compounds. Furthermore, this APP process removes chemical agents while preserving the sample surface. Ninety-seven percent or more of the chemical agents (HD, GD, and VX) were removed from the surface after 15 min of exposure to the air plasma (150 W). We anticipate the results of this study will support the development of a flexible electrode with flexible dielectric wires that can be used to make wearable garments for various 3D surface treatment applications, such as 3D wound healing and 3D food and toxic surface decontamination. Therefore, this wearable APP technology has potential applications in the areas of biomedical, chemical, and materials engineering. We are currently attempting to optimize a flexible nanowire fabric structure for low-power air discharge.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Plasma diagnostics and gas sensing</title><p id="Par24">The wire electrode capacitances were directly measured using an inductance, capacitance, and resistance (LCR) meter (Agilent Technologies, HP 4263B, USA).

An IR camera (Optris P160, Germany) was used to measure the electrode and sample temperatures in the range of 0 to 250 °C.

Ozone and NO<sub>x</sub> electrochemical sensors (ATi, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) were also placed inside the chamber to provide real-time readings on the concentrations of ozone and nitrogen oxide compounds. The O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> gases diffuse into the sensor and travel through the back of the porous membrane to the working electrode, where they are oxidized or reduced.
