The marriage of nanotechnology and immunotherapy offers a great opportunity to amplify antitumor immune response in a safe and effective manner. Here, electrochemically active <italic>Shewanella oneidensis</italic> MR-1 can be applied to produce FDA-approved Prussian blue nanoparticles on a large-scale. We present a mitochondria-targeting nanoplatform, MiBaMc, which consists of Prussian blue decorated bacteria membrane fragments having further modifications with chlorin e6 and triphenylphosphine. We find that MiBaMc specifically targets mitochondria and induces amplified photo-damages and immunogenic cell death of tumor cells under light irradiation. The released tumor antigens subsequently promote the maturation of dendritic cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes, eliciting T cell-mediated immune response. In two tumor-bearing mouse models using female mice, MiBaMc triggered phototherapy synergizes with anti-PDL1 blocking antibody for enhanced tumor inhibition. Collectively, the present study demonstrates biological precipitation synthetic strategy of targeted nanoparticles holds great potential for the preparation of microbial membrane-based nanoplatforms to boost antitumor immunity.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Prussian blue has been used as a photothermal agent for cancer therapy.

For instance, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) can be applied to durably eliminate tumors by inhibiting intrinsic down-regulators of immunity, thus boosting the therapeutic efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, clinical data suggest that only a small fraction (10–30%) of patients respond to the ICB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Cancer nanomedicine, in combination with immunotherapy, offers great potential to amplify antitumor immune responses and sensitize tumors to immunotherapy in a safe and effective manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. For instance, photo-based hyperthermia and reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been reported to induce immunogenic cell death for enhanced tumor immunogenicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The natural world provides a host of materials and inspiration for the field of nanomedicine. Recently, biological membrane-involved nanotechnology has been widely used in fabricating nanoplatforms for drug delivery, immune manipulation, and cancer treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Although with promises, there are still some challenges, such as complicated procedures and large-scale manufacturing, in terms of clinical translation.</p><p id="Par4">Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are a class of microporous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The parent Prussian blue (PB) is mixed-valence cyanide of iron in its Fe<sup>II</sup> and Fe<sup>III</sup> oxidation states with a formula of Fe<sup>III</sup><sub>4</sub>[Fe<sup>II</sup>(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sub>3</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O. Since the inception of Diesbach in 1706, PB has been well-studied and widely used as a pigment. In 2003, PB capsule, namely Radiogardase, was approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of radioactive exposure (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/bioterrorism-and-drug-preparedness/fda-approves-first-new-drug-application-treatment-radiation-contamination-due-cesium-or-thallium" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.fda.gov/drugs/bioterrorism-and-drug-preparedness/fda-approves-first-new-drug-application-treatment-radiation-contamination-due-cesium-or-thallium</ext-link>). Recent studies also showed its superior photothermal conversion ability as a promising preclinical photothermal agent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Generally, two chemical strategies are used for PB synthesis. One is a single-precursor strategy using either K<sub>4</sub>[Fe<sup>II</sup>(CN)<sub>6</sub>] or K<sub>3</sub>[Fe<sup>III</sup>(CN)<sub>6</sub>], and the other one is a double-precursor strategy using equivalently mixed [Fe<sup>II</sup>(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>4−</sup>/[Fe<sup>III</sup>(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3−</sup> and Fe<sup>III</sup>/Fe<sup>II</sup> solution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. However, chemical strategies require relatively high reaction temperatures, harsh acidic environments, and additive surfactants to control the growth of PB nanocrystals and usually show low yield efficiency. Moreover, chemical strategies impose certain limitations for large-scale production due to the involved dynamics, thermodynamics, and safety concerns. Thus, it is highly desired to develop facile and eco-friendly strategies for controllable and large-scale synthesis of PB.</p><p id="Par5">Microbe–mineral interactions are fundamental to global biogeochemical processes, including nitrogen and carbon cycles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Geochemical evidence also indicated that Fe<sup>III</sup> might be the first external electron acceptor of global significance in microbial metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In particular, microorganisms with extracellular electron transfer capacity have been explored for biomining, bioremediation, and the production of bioenergy and biofuel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Electrochemically active microorganisms such as <italic>Geobacter metallireducens</italic> GS-15 and <italic>Shewanella oneidensis</italic> MR-1 (<italic>S. oneidensis</italic> MR-1) can oxidize hydrogen or organic matter and transfer electrons to minerals containing Fe<sup>III</sup> or Mn<sup>III</sup> or Mn<sup>IV</sup> in the absence of respiratory terminal electron acceptors such as molecular oxygen. In addition, some microorganisms can induce the precipitation of nanomaterials such as noble metal nanoparticles, magnetite, and uraninite nanoparticles under mild conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Given the inspiration behind the utilization of Fe<sup>III</sup> as an electron acceptor to support globally significant rates of respiration on early Earth, we thus speculated electrochemically active microorganisms could facilitate the biological reduction of Fe<sup>III</sup> into Fe<sup>II</sup>, which subsequently coordinated with [Fe<sup>III</sup>(CN)<sub>6</sub>] linkers to produce Prussian blue.</p><p id="Par6">Here, we show that FDA-approved Prussian blue nanoparticles can be synthesized via a biological precipitation process on a large-scale taking advantage of the unique metabolic reduction capabilities of <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> MR-1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). During the self-respiration process, uniform PB MOFs are generated on the surface of <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> MR-1 bacteria (<italic>S. oneidensis</italic>-MOFs). The as-prepared <italic>S. oneidensis</italic>-MOFs are sonicated to form PB MOFs decorated bacteria membrane fragments (BaM) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). To enhance the photo-induced damage, we construct a mitochondria-targeting therapeutic nanoplatform, namely MiBaMc, consisting of BaM with further surface modifications of ROS-generating chlorin e6 (Ce6) and mitochondria-targeting triphenylphosphine (TPP). After tumoral accumulation and endocytosis of MiBaMc, both hyperthermia, and ROS are generated to induce immunogenic cell death of cancer cells under external light irradiation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Furthermore, MiBaMc shows potent tumor inhibition ability in two tumor-bearing mouse models (immunogenic triple-negative breast cancer and colorectal cancer) when combined with clinically approved anti-PDL1 blocking antibody (aPDL1). Our study demonstrates that MiBaMc is a promising antitumor agent.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Microbial synthesis of MiBaMc combined with aPDL1 antibody for enhanced tumor immunotherapy.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic illustration of the incubation of <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> MR-1 and subsequently one-pot large-scale microbial synthesis of FDA-approved Prussian blue MOFs. <bold>b</bold> Schematic illustration of the biological precipitation of PB MOFs coated <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> MR-1 hybrid (<italic>S. oneidensis</italic>-MOFs) through extracellular electron transfer pathways, in which extracellular electron flux via the MtrCAB pathway in <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> MR-1 can reduce Fe<sup>III</sup> into Fe<sup>II</sup> for the following generation of PB MOFs.

High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images revealed the existence of brighter parts composed of Fe, N, and C elements, which is consistent with the components of Prussian blue (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). High-resolution STEM image revealed an interplanar spacing of 5.13 Å, which is consistent with the calculated lattice distance of Prussian blue (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref> and inset).

Consistent with the DCs maturation results, MiBaMc + PTDT + aPDL1 triggered the highest secretion of cytokines, further demonstrating the most effective ICD induced by BaMc + PTDT + aPDL1. For the MC38 tumor model, a similar tendency of the release of the cytokines could be observed (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">28</xref>). Furthermore, the expression of representative biomarkers of ICD (HMGB1 and CRT) within tumor sections was studied by immunofluorescence staining. Results showed significantly decreased HMGB1 expression within the nuclei and amplified CRT exposure in MiBaMc + PTDT + aPDL1 group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5i-k</xref>). Besides, MiBaMc + PTDT + aPDL1 group showed the highest population of CD4<sup>+</sup> helper T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells within the tumor sections, as verified by the immunofluorescence staining (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5i</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">29</xref>). Afterward, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment was studied. The populations of Tregs (CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup>) for MiBaMc + PTDT + aPDL1 and MiBaMc + PTDT dramatically decreased by 84.3% and 63.4% compared to the control group injected with PBS, respectively (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">30</xref>). Collectively, those results demonstrated that MiBaMc triggered phototherapy combined with aPDL1 could effectively induce antitumor immune responses with both increased frequency of positive immune responders and decreased frequency of negative immune inhibitors, thus inhibiting the growth of the tumor.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Proteomics analysis</title><p id="Par19">A proteomics study was applied to accurately identify and quantify proteins involved during the treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. A total of 6392 proteins were identified. 92 differentially expressed proteins (70 up-regulated and 22 down-regulated) under a threshold with fold changes ≥ 1.5 and <italic>p</italic> values &lt; 0.05 were found in MiBaMc + PTDT + aPDL1 group compared to the control group as depicted in the heatmap (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). Based on the gene ontology (GO) analysis, we found that proteins associated with responses to stimulus, processes related to stimulus, immune system, signaling, cell killing, and antioxidant activity were more up-regulated in MiBaMc + PTDT + aPDL1 group relative to the control group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). In contrast, proteins that related to cell integrity, cell growth, and structural molecular activity were more down-regulated. Those results indicated that MiBaMc induced strengthened tumor damage, which should be attributed to the synergistic effect induced by hyperthermia and ROS. Furthermore, prominent upregulation of proteins associated with antioxidant activity also directly indicated the enhanced oxidative pressure of tumors in the MiBaMc + PTDT + aPDL1 group. The Venn diagram shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref> revealed obvious overlaps between proteins associated with heat shock and cell death, as well as oxidative stress and cell death. Thus, both photothermal-induced hyperthermia and photodynamic-induced oxidative damage triggered by MiBaMc contributed to ICD. This phenomenon was further supported by the ROS staining of tumor sections (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">31</xref>). In addition, significant enhancement in the protein level associated with immune response was observed in the MiBaMc + PTDT + aPDL1 group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>), suggesting the antitumor capacity should be attributed to the systemic immune activation of MiBaMc triggered phototherapy in combination with aPDL1. Moreover, the Venn diagram also indicated prominent overlaps between proteins associated with immune response, inflammatory response, and bacterial infection, indicating that multiple immunological processes were activated and interacted to promote antitumor immunity. Herein, we deduced that while MiBaMc contains only the bacteria membrane, some proteins or membrane components (e.g., lipopolysaccharides, peptidoglycan, and flagellum) still preserved their immunogenicity within the tumor site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. During this process, both hyperthermia and ROS triggered the release of tumor-associated antigens. The membrane component originating from bacteria might inherit some immunomodulatory features, thus enabling boosted systemic immune responses. Moreover, the tendency could also be drawn from the protein–protein interaction network (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">32</xref>).

For instance, biological membrane-based nanotechnology has shown enormous potential in fabricating therapeutic platforms for cancer treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the complicated procedures seriously impede the possibility of large-scale manufacturing. Different from conventional biological membrane-based nanoplatforms, in the present study, we showed that the electrochemically active <italic>Shewanella oneidensis</italic> MR-1 bacteria could be applied to produce FDA-approved PB MOFs on a large-scale taking advantage of its biological precipitation capability during the self-respiration process.</p><p id="Par21">We presented that the resulting MiBaMc, consisting of PB MOF decorated bacteria membrane fragments having further modifications with photosensitive drug chlorin e6 and mitochondrial targeting moiety triphenylphosphine could specifically target mitochondria, thus amplifying the photo damages and finally inducing immunogenic cell death (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). We also showed that, in mouse models with both immunogenic triple-negative breast tumor and colorectal tumor, MiBaMc triggered phototherapy combined with aPDL1 blocking antibody could effectively inhibit tumor growth. The tumor inhibition rates for triple-negative breast tumors and colorectal tumors were calculated to be 95.5% and 89.4%, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b, f</xref>). The released tumor-associated antigens subsequently promote the maturation of dendritic cells in the tumor-draining lymph nodes, thus eliciting T cell-mediated immune response (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Given the increasing interest in cell membrane-based nanomedicine eliciting antitumor immune responses, it is conceivable that in situ biological precipitation of targeted nanoparticles using metabolic reductive bacteria is a promising strategy to enrich cell membrane-based nanoplatforms and cooperate with immune therapeutics. Notably, the major components (PB, Ce6, and aPDL1) within the nanoagent are FDA-approved, thus ensuring high biosafety and translation potential in the clinic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par22">At the same time, we also recognized the complexity of such an approach due to the mismatched absorption spectra of PB and Ce6, which may prolong treatment times. Thus, single laser/light-triggered simultaneous PTT and PDT using a dual-modal agent is preferred. In addition, the delivery of therapeutic light is crucial for successful clinical translation, especially for large and/or deep-seated tumors. In this case, one possible solution is the utilization of multiple interstitial fibers with decreased size and costs. Moreover, targeting the accumulation of therapeutic agents within the tumor tissues and even subcellular organelles, such as mitochondria, lysosomes, and nuclei, is also essential to enhance the photo-triggered cytotoxic activity.</p><p id="Par23">In summary, we have developed a facile and efficient strategy to construct a bacteria membrane-Prussian blue hybrid nanoplatform in large-scale manufacturing. During the self-respiration process, uniform biologically precipitated Prussian blue MOFs were fabricated with <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> MR-1 bacteria as a supporting matrix to produce bacteria–PB hybrids. With fragmentation treatment and further modification with Ce6 and TPP, the resulting MiBaMc significantly localizes within the mitochondria and induces apoptosis of cancer cells via hyperthermia and ROS generation. After tumoral accumulation and endocytosis of MiBaMc, both hyperthermia and ROS are generated to induce the ICD of cancer cells under external light irradiation. When combined with aPDL1, MiBaMc shows potent tumor inhibition toward both immunogenic triple-negative breast cancer and colorectal cancer models. This strategy paves the possible way for the development of multifunctional nanoplatforms using biological precipitation of targeted nanoparticles for cancer treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Materials, cell lines, and animals</title><p id="Par24">Potassium hexacyanoferrate (K<sub>3</sub>[Fe<sup>III</sup>(CN)<sub>6</sub>]), ferric citrate hydrate (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>Fe<sup>III</sup>O<sub>7</sub>), sodium lactate (CH<sub>3</sub>CH(OH)COONa), (3-carboxypropyl)triphenylphosphonium bromide (TPP-COOH), N-Hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC·HCl), and sodium lactate were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Tumors were collected and weighed at the endpoint of the treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>H&amp;E and TUNEL staining</title><p id="Par44">After different treatments, the tumors and main organs of mice were surgically resected and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution, followed by dehydration in gradient ethanol of 95%, 90%, 80%, and 70%. Those paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were further sectioned and stained using hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E). The tumor tissue blocks were conducted with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Hoechst 33342 and FITC-labeled TUNEL assay kits were used to stain nuclei and DNA fragmentation, respectively. In apoptotic cells, FITC-labeled TdT catalyzed the incorporation of deoxynucleotides at the free 3’-hydroxyl ends of fragmented DNA. The stained tumor sections were visualized under a digital pathology system (Nikon, Eclipse C1).</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Blood biochemical analysis</title><p id="Par45">Healthy Balb/c mice were intravenously administrated with MiBaMc.

The draining lymph nodes, tumors, and spleens were collected. Those tissues were homogenized into single-cell suspension through mechanical mash or enzymatic digestion. After that, cells were filtered via 70 μm pore sterile cell strainers (Corning Inc.) and stained with fluorescence-conjugated antibodies. For DCs maturation: FITC-conjugated anti-CD80 (Biolegend, cat no. 104705, dilution of 1:50), PE-conjugated anti-CD86 (Biolegend, cat no. 105007, dilution of 1:200), APC-conjugated anti-CD11c (Biolegend, cat no. 117309, dilution of 1:80), AF700-conjugated anti-CD45 (Biolegend, cat no. 103127, dilution of 1:200), and anti-CD16/32 (Biolegend, cat no. 156603, dilution of 1:200) antibodies were applied. For CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells analysis: PE-conjugated anti-CD4 (Biolegend, cat no. 130310, dilution of 1:80), APC-conjugated anti-CD8a (Biolegend, cat no. 100711, dilution of 1:80), FITC-conjugated anti-CD3 (Biolegend, cat no. 100204, dilution of 1:50), AF700-conjugated anti-CD45 (Biolegend, cat no. 103127, dilution of 1:200), and anti-CD16/32 (Biolegend, cat no. 156603, dilution of 1:200) were used. For CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg analysis: cells were stained with anti-CD3, anti-CD4, and AF647-conjugated anti-Foxp3 (Biolegend, cat no. 126407, dilution of 1:100) antibodies. Compensation was carried out for T-cell analyses. All antibodies were used according to the protocols provided by the manufacturer. The stained cells were measured on a Fortessa X20 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and graphically analyzed using the FlowJo software package (version 10.0.7).</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Cytokine detection</title><p id="Par47">Mouse serum samples from each treated group were collected on day 13 post-inoculation. The serum levels of TNF-α (Biolegend, cat. no. 430901), IFN-γ (Biolegend, cat. no. 4308.4), and IL-6 (Biolegend, cat. no. 431301) were measured with ELISA kits according to the protocols provided by the manufacturer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Immunofluorescence assay</title><p id="Par48">Tumors were harvested from the mice in each group and frozen in the optimal cutting temperature medium. For CD4CD8 staining: tumors were cut via a cryotome, mounted on slides, and stained with AF488-conjugated anti-mouse CD8a antibody and AF647-conjugated anti-mouse CD4 antibody at 4 °C overnight. For HMGB1 and CRT staining, tumor tissues were first stained with rabbit anti-HMGB1 and mouse anti-CRT primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, followed by AF647-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and AF488 conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies for another 2 h. The concentration of these antibodies used in the experiments was 20–40 μg/mL. Hoechst 33342 dye (Thermo-Fisher Scientific) was applied to stain cell nuclei. The slides were recorded using a confocal microscope (Nikon, Digital Eclipse C1 microscope system with NIKON DS-U3 controller). Hoechst 33342 was excited with a 405 nm laser, AF488 was excited with a 488 nm laser, and AF647 was excited with a 633 nm laser. The imaging channels were set at 450–500, 500–550, and 650–680 nm, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Proteomics analysis</title><p id="Par49">4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice were randomly divided into two groups (<italic>n</italic> = 3). For MiBaMc + PTDT + aPDL1 group, the dose and frequency for systematic administration of aPDL1 were 25 μg every day for 3 days through tail vein injection. Later, mice in two groups were intravenously administrated with PBS or PBS containing MiBaMc (equivalent dose based on Ce6: 4.0 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>). At 12 h post-administration, mice were treated with light irradiation. After different treatments, 4T1 tumor-bearing mice in each group (<italic>n</italic> = 3) were euthanized, and the tumor tissues were collected.
