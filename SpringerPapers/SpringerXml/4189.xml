The control loop is composed of four functions: a physical process (such as the generation, transmission, or consumption of electricity), its measurement, decision making, and actuation. This control structure is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">3.1</xref> where a sensor takes measurements of the states and outputs of a physical system. Wireless and wired communications are used to pass this information between the physical layer and other informatic components. This information is used to make decisions either independently in a decentralized fashion or in coordination with the informatic components of other devices. Decisions are sent back down to network-enabled actuators for implementation.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 3.1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The development of IoT within energy infrastructure as networked control loop</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/473131_1_En_3_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par3">In some cases, this control loop acts in near real-time; in other cases, some of the information is used as part of predictive applications that facilitate decisions at a longer timescale.

As such, sensors exist at the periphery of a communication network to relay data and information from the physical grid to a control or decision-making center. Given the tremendous heterogeneity in the number, type, and input of physical eIoT devices, the measurement role of network-enabled sensing technologies increases immensely. Fortunately, there has been significant innovation in sensing technologies to accommodate these needs. Such advancements include miniaturization, wireless data transfer, and decreasing implementation costs. Miniaturization technologies have enabled monitoring of household devices where it was previously infeasible to collect data. Noninvasive wireless technologies have reduced implementation costs by forgoing wired installation. These two factors have made sensors increasingly ubiquitous in electric grid applications.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par20">Although network-enabled sensors vary in design and location within the power system, they have a commonality of function that is fundamental to measurement within the control loop. At a basic level, a sensor is composed of a sensing unit, a processing unit, a transceiver unit, and a power unit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>]. Depending on its function, a sensor component must balance various design aspects such as power consumption, memory allocation, lifespan, and cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>]. These trade-offs lead to a heterogeneity in sensor operations such as data collection intervals, wired or wireless communication, type of power source, and their connection to other devices. Furthermore, and as mentioned in Sect. <ext-link xlink:href="10.1007/978-3-030-10427-6_2#Sec2" ext-link-type="doi">2.2</ext-link>, the need for precise control and accurate net load forecast also drives the deployment of a greater heterogeneity of sensors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>]. Here, the distinction between primary and secondary variables becomes important. Traditional primary variables have often been measured first due to physical and monetary constraints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>]. However, the need to better characterize variable energy, energy storage, and demand-side resources has led to the development of secondary measurement applications as well. These additional measurements improve situational awareness because they show the underlying causes for the supply and demand of electricity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sensing and Actuation of Primary Variables in the Transmission System</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Network-Enabled Sensors: SCADA and PMUs</title><p id="Par21">The development of monitoring and sensing technologies began in the transmission system in response to the Northeast Blackout of 1965 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">158</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">159</xref>]. It was found that as the North American power system became ever-more connected it was necessary to deploy new sensing technology so as to gain greater <italic>situational awareness</italic> of the transmission system as a whole. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3.3</xref>, a tremendous heterogeneity of sensors is deployed in the transmission system where they are used in transmission lines and substations to monitor “traditional” variables directly related to power quality, operations, and system limits. These variables are key to ensuring system stability and reliability and include voltage, current, their phase angles, active power, and reactive power. In the transmission system, line monitoring is achieved through sensors that measure voltage, detect faults, and conduct predictive maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">160</xref>].<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3.3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Sensor technologies in transmission lines and substations (adapted from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>])</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/473131_1_En_3_Fig3_HTML.png" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p id="Par22">Transmission sensors also help to monitor the physical condition of power supply equipment to improve safety, and determine when to deploy a workforce for repairs or outage prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These sensors can be deployed in substations, in overhead lines, or in buried lines used for underground cable systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Sensors in the transmission system can also inform operational databases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] to guide decision making that ensures system reliability. The reader is referred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] for a deeper review of existing technologies.</p><p id="Par23">The need for situational awareness also motivated the development of <italic>sensor networks</italic>. As is discussed in greater depth in Sect. <xref rid="Sec21" ref-type="sec">3.2</xref>, sensor networks are a collection of sensors tied to a modular communication network that bridge the gap between physical devices and decision-making points elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">161</xref>]. These sensing networks are spatially distributed across the electric grid to form an interconnected monitoring and perception layer. The first and most prominent of such sensor networks is the SCADA system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">162</xref>] shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">3.4</xref>. SCADA is deployed in substations and distribution feeders where it is able to sense voltage, frequency, and power flows, and then send these measurements to centralized operations control centers. SCADA systems are also able to send remote signals to change generation levels, switch circuit breakers, and control devices through programmable logic controllers (PLCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">162</xref>]. SCADA systems and other sensor networks are discussed further in Sect. <xref rid="Sec21" ref-type="sec">3.2</xref> where they are part of a larger discussion on communication networks. Further mention of the SCADA system in this section refers collectively to its embedded sensors.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 3.4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>SCADA as a network of remote terminal units (RTUs) connected to a master terminal unit (MTU) via modems and radios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/473131_1_En_3_Fig4_HTML.png" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p id="Par24">Despite the elaborate SCADA-based sensing network in the transmission system, several challenges are yet to be addressed to allow for the effective adoption of eIoT. First, the transmission system is spread out over a wide area, making real-time data collection a challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">163</xref>]. Generally, the transmission system is remote and deploying resources for scheduled maintenance checks is costly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">164</xref>]. Many of the sensors are located on transmission carriers with approximately 60–125 carriers between substations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">160</xref>]. The distance between two carriers ranges from 400 to 800 m [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">160</xref>]. Furthermore, a typical utility with about 25,000 km of high-voltage (≥69 kV) power lines and thousands of transformers, capacitors, and breakers is expected to have 100,000 distinct sensors spread over a 20–80,000 km<sup>2</sup> area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">Traditionally, any outside-the-system threats are from weather (such as storms or overheating), aging, physical destruction, and other environmental elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">160</xref>]. Given the wide geographical range and the numerous sensors involved, manual checks are less efficient compared to receiving signals from automated sensors. Furthermore, the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) advocates that data communication and automation reflect condition-based rather than time-based management of the transmission system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Probabilistic (rather than deterministic) methods for assessing risk in the transmission system can also be used to preemptively solve faults and address sub-optimal conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In all cases, real-time data is needed to better monitor the conditions of the transmission system to ensure safety and reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">Second, the SCADA system, currently in place, cannot observe the dynamic phenomena in transient and small signal stability models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">163</xref>]. SCADA has a relatively low sampling rate of 2–4 s, making dynamic state estimation over a wide area difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">163</xref>]. Instead, SCADA data are often used in static state estimation algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">165</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">168</xref>] for manual decision making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">169</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">170</xref>]. Dynamic state estimation is further complicated by SCADA’s lack of measurements with synchronized time stamps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">163</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">To address these issues, SCADA systems must be equipped with the ability to study temporal trends with finer resolution and synchronization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">169</xref>]. These requirements imply better coordination and compatibility between SCADA terminals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">163</xref>]. Such developments in wide-area measurements are set to enhance corrective actions against system-wide disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">171</xref>]. All in all, the electric grid must be updated with new sensors to enable the better gathering, transfer, and processing of measurement data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">172</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">Sourcing power for sensors can pose a major challenge to their deployment in sensor networks. The main energy intensive components in a typical sensor include microcontrollers, wireless interfaces, integrated circuits, voltage regulators, and memory storage devices. Nevertheless, this challenge can be overcome through the use of batteries or environmental power sourcing techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A key factor in designing sensors for remote applications is ensuring sustainable energy consumption and supply.

Beyond simply speed and quality of service, telecommunication networks and their associated operators offer grid operators and utilities an existing and cost-effective means for networked energy management.

Their deployment naturally inspired the development of multiple mutually coexisting communication networks.

Furthermore, the decentralized control algorithms found in AGC and AVR lack coordination beyond their local scope of control. For these regions, effective control algorithms that provide both scalability and wide-area coordination are necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR479">479</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR480">480</xref>].</p><p id="Par227">Perhaps one of the key research areas in distributed power system control is in solving the optimal power flow (OPF) problem in a distributed manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR481">481</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR494">494</xref>]. Not only is this problem difficult to solve (by virtue of it being non-convex), it also consumes significant computational resources. Being able to solve the problem in a distributed manner allows for faster solutions to the OPF problem, and larger problem sizes. A common technique is usually based on augmented Lagrangian decomposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR493">493</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR495">495</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR496">496</xref>] such as dual decomposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR482">482</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR497">497</xref>], the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR483">483</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR484">484</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR492">492</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR494">494</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR496">496</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR498">498</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR499">499</xref>], alternating direct inexact Newton (ALADIN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR485">485</xref>], analytical target cascading (ATC), and the auxiliary problem principle (APP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR486">486</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR500">500</xref>].

Key MAS features such as modularity, scalability, reconfigurability, and robustness make them especially paramount to the realization of distributed control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR505">505</xref>]. This section seeks to highlight some of the important outcomes of this research.</p><p id="Par230">Perhaps the earliest works on multi-agent systems in power system research occurred at the turn of the century in the context of market deregulation. Then, it was recognized that as power system markets shifted from a single grid operator to multiple competing generation companies that such “genCo’s” would deploy new “game-theoretic” bidding strategies to maximize their profit. Therefore, some of the first works on the applications of multi-agent systems to the power industry were focused on modeling electricity markets in a deregulated power industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR506">506</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR510">510</xref>].</p><p id="Par231">At the time, most algorithms studied the effect of self-interested agents on auction market equilibrium with a particular focus on the unit commitment problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR511">511</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR514">514</xref>]. As such, these MAS frameworks were composed of a few mobile agents, generator agents, and a market facilitator who would oversee the market bidding process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR515">515</xref>]. Game-theoretic strategies were also employed to investigate potential coalitions or cooperative strategies among different competing parties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR516">516</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR517">517</xref>].</p><p id="Par232">Around the same time, various MAS approaches considered optimal cost allocation techniques to manage cross-border exchanges, be it through tie-lines, or cross-jurisdictional transmission lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR518">518</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR520">520</xref>]. These trends reflect the earliest MAS trends that set the stage for later applications in electric microgrids, demand response, and smart grids.</p><p id="Par233">MAS applications later diversified to other aspects of power systems control and operations such as balancing, scheduling, line control and protection, and frequency regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR509">509</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR521">521</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR525">525</xref>]. As more renewable energy resources have gained prominence in grid operation, MAS frameworks, too, have shifted focus to the provision of ancillary services. A significant number of studies have considered system restoration under vulnerable system conditions, and later these approaches have been applied to microgrids with some penetration of variable energy resources. Usually, these MAS applications study only a single layer of either economic or technical control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In some cases, a MAS economic layer was combined with a single physical layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Later on, MAS applications came to incorporate demand response at the microgrid and residential levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR526">526</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR529">529</xref>].</p><p id="Par234">Agent-based and game-theoretic approaches have also been applied for cooperative and competitive demand-side management and microgrid control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR530">530</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR537">537</xref>]. Grid level MAS applications have focused on the provision of ancillary services, and in some cases the parallelization of grid-level communication and control networks such as SCADA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR528">528</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR529">529</xref>].

Continued research is required to design distributed algorithms that use game-theoretic principles and ensure robustness, stability, optimality, and convergence.</p><p id="Par236">Another important application of multi-agent systems in power systems has been the control and energy management of microgrids. There, it was recognized that microgrids are often implemented in remote and potentially harsh environments.

MAS in contrast are fundamentally more resilient in that they can continue to operate in the face of certain types of disruptions. Such a functionality is enabled by a modular decision-making architecture composed of semi-autonomous agents that allows agents to be added and removed without the need to halt the entire system.</p><p id="Par237">A modular architecture is particularly vital as the penetration of variable energy resources (VER) grows because it allows for other energy resources to be easily reconfigured to support microgrid operation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR548">548</xref>].

These control applications include economic dispatch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR556">556</xref>], load restoration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR557">557</xref>], decision making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR558">558</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR559">559</xref>], and scheduling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR560">560</xref>] to name just a few.

Similarly, the integration of renewable energy and active demand response shown in Fig. <ext-link xlink:href="10.1007/978-3-030-10427-6_1#Fig7" ext-link-type="doi">1.7</ext-link> may be viewed as a fundamental change in the architecture of the physical electric power system itself. The role of centralized generation facilities is being eroded by distributed renewable generation. The previous section’s discussion on distributed control algorithms addresses the shift from a more centralized control structure in Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">3.14</xref> to a more distributed one. Together, these three separate discussions show that eIoT is entirely consonant with a decentralized architecture in regulation, operations timescale decision making, and the physical power grid.</p><p id="Par246">These three large-scale architectural changes fundamentally change how power and information are exchanged throughout the electric power system. As has been discussed several times throughout this work, eIoT brings about the need for two-way flows of power and information where one-way flows were once common. The most common examples of these are at the grid periphery where distributed generation can cause power to flow back up the radial distribution system and where network-enabled demand-side resources both send and receive information as part of demand-response schemes. Such two-way flows change the way both cyber and physical entities in the grid interact with each other. Physical energy resources must accommodate the two-way power flows. In the meantime, “cyber” entities such as controllers, enterprise information systems, and organizations as a whole will have two-way informatic interactions with each other. For example, utilities of the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] may become “distribution system operators” that enable retail electricity markets. Consequently, their historical role as a load serving entity in wholesale electricity markets is also likely to change. These changing roles of “cyber” entities on the grid further indicates fundamental changes in the electric grid’s architecture.</p><p id="Par247">It is difficult to determine at this time what a future eIoT-enabled electric power system architecture will look like. It is clear that the grid cannot continue to operate in a centralized hierarchical fashion as it has in the past. On the other hand, a full transition to eIoT-enabled heterarchy and decentralization is improbable as well. Much research work still remains in order to achieve the holistic performance properties that centralized algorithms have already demonstrated and consequently centralized architectures are likely to endure in those conditions. The meshed communication networks (such as Z-Wave and Zigbee mentioned in Sect. <xref rid="Sec33" ref-type="sec">3.2.4</xref>) suggest distributed control architectures. However, their limited range similarly implies centralized nodes that aggregate peripheral devices and present them to the rest of the electric power system. Overall, the underlying trends that support eIoT remain strong and so decentralized and distributed control algorithms will take hold where possible. On a spectrum between total centralized hierarchy and complete decentralized heterarchy, the electric power grid’s overall future architecture falls somewhere in the middle.</p><p id="Par248">In recognition of these electric grid’s evolving architectures, there have been efforts on both sides of the Atlantic to develop open and extensible architectures. Under EU mandate M/490, the Smart Grid Architecture Model (SGAM) was developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">3.15</xref>, it is a structured approach to modeling and designing use cases for power and energy systems. The architecture is organized into a three-dimensional framework consisting of domains, zones, and layers. These allow energy practitioners to structure the use case design in a clear and concise way.<fig id="Fig15"><label>Fig. 3.15</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>EU mandate M/490 Smart Grid Architecture Model (SGAM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/473131_1_En_3_Fig15_HTML.png" id="MO18"/></fig></p><p id="Par249">Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, the Energy Independence Security Act (EISA) of 2007 describes severable favorable qualities of a future smart grid architecture including flexibility, uniformity, and technology neutrality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR576">576</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR577">577</xref>]. To that effect, the GridWise Architecture Council (GWAC) created its interoperability framework created its interoperability framework shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">3.16</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR578">578</xref>]. (This framework has often been nicknamed the “GWAC Stack” for simplicity.) Much like the SGAM, the GWAC Stack recognizes the need for multiple layers of integration in order to ensure interoperability, but does not add the dimensions of domains and zones. At the bottom, three layers ensure the interoperability of technical connectivity. When these layers are abstracted, they can form two informational layers that provide business context and semantic understanding. These layers may be further abstracted to form three organizational layers that address policy, business objectives, and business procedures. Both the SGAM and the GWAC Stack serve as the basis for the future development of an electric power reference architecture that supports standard and interoperable implementations of eIoT.<fig id="Fig16"><label>Fig. 3.16</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The GridWise Architecture Council interoperability framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/473131_1_En_3_Fig16_HTML.png" id="MO19"/></fig></p><p id="Par250">In the meantime, there have been several efforts to develop commercial and quasi-commercial IoT platforms. Specifically, the OpenFog Consortium was launched in 2015 to spearhead the creation of an open architecture essential for creating IoT platforms and applications based on the fog computing ecosystem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR579">579</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR580">580</xref>]. The aim of the OpenFog Architecture is to accelerate the decision-making process of IoT sensors and actuators by bringing essential computation, networking, and storage closer to devices and reducing the latency brought about by all devices communicating directly with the cloud [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR579">579</xref>]. This architecture essentially serves as a middleman between the cloud and IoT devices and, thus, is not a replacement for cloud computing but rather complementary to the cloud [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR581">581</xref>]. The approach of bringing processing, that is, computation, storage, and networking closer to where the data is gathered is called fog computing, hence, the OpenFog Architecture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR580">580</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR581">581</xref>].</p><p id="Par251">The OpenFog Architecture comprises of an OpenFog Fabric, OpenFog Services, devices and applications, and cloud services. The OpenFog Fabric is a computation platform on which services are delivered to all the devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR580">580</xref>]. The OpenFog Services interface between the devices and the platform. The services delivered by this platform include content delivery, video encoding, analytics platform to name just a few [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR580">580</xref>].

Amazon offers the Amazon Web Services (AWS) IoT Core which is a platform through which one can connect various IoT devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR582">582</xref>]. The AWS IoT comprises a device SDK that helps users connect and disconnect devices to the platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR582">582</xref>]. It provides broker-based publish/subscribe messaging through the MQTT, HTPP, or WebSockets Protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR582">582</xref>]. The SDK supports C, Arduino, and JavaScript programming languages in addition to client libraries and a developer’s guide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR582">582</xref>].

Beyond the communication standards mentioned in Sect. <xref rid="Sec21" ref-type="sec">3.2</xref>, several standards initiatives were launched early on at national and international levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR587">587</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR589">589</xref>] including concerted efforts by the IEC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR590">590</xref>], IEEE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR591">591</xref>], and NIST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR577">577</xref>].

The proliferation of sensing technology (described in Sect. <xref rid="Sec1" ref-type="sec">3.1</xref>) means that the <italic>quantity</italic> of information available to describe energy infrastructure will reach unprecedented levels. Beyond the quantity of information, the <italic>type</italic> of data will also diversify.

Because eIoT fundamentally changes the role of information in energy infrastructure, there are two important socio-technical implications: privacy and cybersecurity. Both of these concerns are complex topics in and of themselves and cannot be extensively treated in the context of this work. Rather, this section seeks to provide an entry point from which more interested readers can more deeply investigate these topics.</p><sec id="Sec50"><title>eIoT Privacy</title><p id="Par284">The proliferation of nearly ubiquitous eIoT data, particularly on the consumer side, raises important concern about consumer privacy. Reconsider Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">3.9</xref> on page <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">47</xref> which was mentioned in the context of home energy monitors that are able to infer the usage of individual home appliances based upon their electrical “signatures.” While such information is very useful to a homeowner in the context of changing their own electricity consumption behavior, it can easily be used by other parties to infer a detailed picture of the homeowner’s daily life including eating, sleeping, and leisure habits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR595">595</xref>].</p><p id="Par285">Beyond home energy monitors that point “inwards,” smart meters are able to provide similar information (albeit at a lower sampling rate) directly to electric utilities. Naturally, many privacy concerns have erupted over this consistent flow of real-time data back to the utility because it can be mined with sophisticated data analytics algorithms to gain market power and potentially exploit the end-user. While the single example of smart meter real-time data flows is an important privacy concern, similar concerns can be found all over the eIoT landscape. The introduction of telecommunication and energy service companies as additional eIoT stakeholders further complicates privacy concerns and motivates the need for sensible policies that inform the rights and responsibilities of data generators, owners, transmitters, and users.

Returning back to Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">3.1</xref> on page <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">3.1</xref>, every communication channel described in Sect. <xref rid="Sec21" ref-type="sec">3.2</xref> has the potential to be compromised by an unintended or nefarious party.

In addition to the harm to end-users, the cost to the utility would be twofold.

Similarly, nefarious parties can interject their data “downward” to the physical layer so that devices behave incorrectly. In both cases, the cybersecurity concerns become <italic>cyber-physical</italic> ones. For example, the automatic generation control feedback signal shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">3.6</xref> can be compromised so that the full control loop is no longer stable, consequently, placing the entire power generation facility at risk of failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR245">245</xref>].</p><p id="Par288">These cybersecurity concerns become even more challenging in the context of the discussion in Sect. <xref rid="Sec21" ref-type="sec">3.2</xref>. Not only will eIoT communication networks be owned and operated by grid operators and utilities but they will also pertain to telecommunication companies and private end-users. While telecommunication networks have significant expertise in combating cybersecurity threats, private area networks are significantly more vulnerable. Consequently, significant attention will have to be given to the grid periphery to ensure that end-users are equipped with easy-to-implement cybersecurity solutions.
