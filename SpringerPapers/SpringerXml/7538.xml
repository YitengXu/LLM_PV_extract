id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par5">Energy demand is rapidly growing worldwide due to population explosion and industrial revolution and enhanced dependence and utilization of natural energy resources. Conventional resources of fuels like petroleum oil, coal, and gas are the major contributors of energy. Consequently, greenhouse gas emission has disrupted the natural atmosphere of earth (Robak and Balcerek <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2018</xref>). Increasing energy demand cannot be met by the depleting fossil fuel reserves. A study conducted in 2013 on peak oil suggested that peak oil, the theorized time point at which petroleum extraction reaches its maximum and then starts declining, would occur probably before 2030, and it also indicated significant chances of occurrence before 2020 (Miller and Sorrell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2014</xref>). Urgency to reduce reliance on conventional sources of energy persists, urging utilization of renewable sources of energy for economic benefit. Another major concern is the environmental impact resulting from the consumption of fossil fuels. Therefore, alternate sources like bioethanol and biodiesel are currently trending worldwide.</p><p id="Par6">Currently, major producers of bioethanol are the USA and Brazil. In 2018, USA ranked first in generating 16.1 billion gallons of biofuel, and Brazil was the second largest producer with 8 billion gallon production (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). India stood at seventh position after the European Union, China, Canada, and Thailand with 330 million gallons of bioethanol production in 2018. India stands third in the world for the import of petroleum products. Crude oil import has rapidly increased from 99.40 million ton in 2006 fiscal year to 228.6 MT in 2019 fiscal year (Biofuels Digest, Statista 2019). Among the petroleum products imported, 49% counts for transportation. This could be replaced by bioethanol in the coming years to improve energy utilization scenario nationally.
<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Ethanol production by the USA and Brazil in billion gallon liters</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13213_2020_1590_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par7">Biofuels are defined as those fuels which are derived from organic matter. These can be broadly categorized as primary and secondary biofuels. Primary biofuels are used in their crude form, such as fuel wood. It is used for cooking, generating heat, and electricity. However, transport fuels are considered as secondary biofuels, and these include bioethanol and biodiesel. Biofuels, specifically bioethanol and biodiesel, have become the primary need in today’s society as for transportation; dependency on fossil fuel reserves is tremendously increasing. Globally, utilization of energy resources is crucial for shaping the growth and economy of budding nations. Consequently, due to depletion of fossil fuels and increasing power demands along with environmental pollution, the focus of research has shifted towards renewable and environment friendly fuel resources. Utilizing renewable resources for biofuel production serves striking solutions in reducing the green-house gas emissions, thereby lowering the impact on environment. This also reduces dependency on foreign oils, resolves energy security issues, empowers economies, and improves the sustainability of transportation system globally (Tabah et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">Bioethanol produced from the edible sources is considered as first generation biofuel. However, this raised the issue of food versus fuel. Therefore, as a substitute, focus shifted towards utilization of cellulosic bioethanol. This second generation bioethanol depends on agricultural residues (such as stover, bagasse, deoiled seed residues, stems, straw, and leaves) which serve as sources of lignocellulosic biomass. Lignocellulosic materials are cheap renewable resources, available in large quantities. Lignocellulosic wastes extracted from energy crops and residues constitute the abundant sources of renewable biomass. Energy security concerns seem resolvable through utilization of lignocellulosic biomass, as it resolves food vs fuel debate and is environmental friendly (Millati et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2002</xref>). Extensive research is being carried out for the fractionation of this biomass into its constituents to make the process cost effective and to make sugars, like glucose and xylose, available for 2G bioethanol production (Selim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">2018</xref>). Technology has now advanced from 2G ethanol to 3G and 4G as well. Third generation biofuel is derived from algal biomass; fourth generation biofuels utilize genetically modified algae for enhanced biofuel production (Abdullah et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2019</xref>). However, producing biofuels like bioethanol from lignocellulosic biomass is an entirely different scenario presenting different set of challenges because of its chemical composition and recalcitrance.</p><p id="Par9">There are other approaches to enhance energy recovery from lignocellulosic biomass such as bio-refining, pretreatment, and waste recycling. Primarily, bio-refining is a promising technique to utilize crop residues, reducing the greenhouse gas emission and producing bio-based products. However, biomass cannot be utilized in its native form and requires pretreatment prior to its conversion. There are various procedures for pretreatment of the lignocellulosic biomass, such as biological pretreatment, chemical, and mechanical pretreatments.</p><p id="Par10">Nutrient recycling is another approach to enhance economic and environmental sustainability in bioethanol production. Collection of biomass ash is one way of nutrient recycling in biofuel production (Ai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2019</xref>; Elsayed et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2018</xref>; Elsayed et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">This review focuses on the limitations of the second generation bioethanol production and various possible technologies used for ethanol production. In general, it discusses the genetic engineering as well as random approaches used for ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Lignocellulosic biomass for 2G biofuels</title><p id="Par12">Lignocellulosic biomass comprises cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The LCB (lignocellulosic biomass) derived biofuel, known as 2G biofuel, has several advantages.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Composition of LCB</title><p id="Par13">Components of lignocellulose vary inside the cell walls of LCB (Sarkar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2012</xref>), and the proportion of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin differs with the type of plant and tissue (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). For instance, cellulose content in dried hardwoods is 40–45% by weight with 24–40% hemicellulose and 18–25% lignin. However, these ratios differ for corn stover, which possess these components as 27–48%, 13–17%, and 14–31%, respectively.

Due to massive hydrogen bonding in its structure, its hydrolysis becomes a tedious task. On the contrary, hemicellulose consists of different types of sugars such as xylose, arabinose, and glucose. Majorly, it consists of pentoses which cannot be fermented easily unlike glucose. Lignin, on the other hand, is a phenolic polymer which possesses CO–C ether bonds throughout. This makes its deconstruction a tedious task (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par15">Lignocellulosic biomass appears promising in energy sector, but its efficient utilization and conversion to ethanol is a difficult task due to non-utilization of xylose by the fermenting micro-organisms such as yeast and bacteria (Chu and Lee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2007</xref>). These microorganisms do not possess metabolic machinery for efficient xylose fermentation to produce ethanol. However, for the cost-effective production of ethanol, both sugars need to be fermented.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Xylose metabolism</title><p id="Par16">Xylose metabolism follows two-step oxido-reductive pathway. Xylose is converted to xylitol by the xylose reductase (XR), which is NADPH-dependent (Webb and Lee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">1990</xref>). Xylitol then produces xylulose by the enzyme xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH) which is NAD-dependent. Xylulose is catalyzed by xylulokinase (XKS) to produce xylulose-5-phosphate. Finally, xylulose-5-phosphate, an intermediate for pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), enters PPP and glycolysis eventually, yielding ethanol after anaerobic process of fermentation.</p><p id="Par17">There is an alternative route for the production of xylulose from xylose. This substitutional pathway exists in some bacteria and fungi, wherein xylose isomerase catalyzes the reaction and produces xylulose directly from xylose (Mishra and Singh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">1993</xref>). Xylitol accumulation is thereby inhibited. <italic>Pichia stipitis</italic> has been studied extensively for its xylose metabolizing properties. An illustration of xylose metabolic pathway is presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.
<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Xylose metabolism to produce bioethanol</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13213_2020_1590_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Influence of pentose phosphate pathway enzymes on xylose metabolism</title><p id="Par18">Pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) starts with the xylulose-5-P entry, and further intrinsic metabolic activities occur through this route (Kobayashi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2018</xref>). PPP can be categorized in two phases—oxidative and non-oxidative. Xylose metabolizing enzyme, such as xylose reductase (XR), requires NADPH (reduced nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide phosphate) as a co-factor for its proper functioning and effective conversion of xylose to xylitol. In oxidative pathway, NADPH is produced which replenishes the co-factor requirements of XR (Hector et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2011</xref>). This process plays a vital role in xylose metabolism and thereby ethanol production.</p><p id="Par19">Non-oxidative pathway involves four enzymes. Genes for these are as follows:

For this, native pentose metabolizing yeasts like <italic>Pachysolen tannophilus</italic>, <italic>Scheffersomyces shehatae</italic>, and <italic>Scheffersomyces stipitis and Kluyveromyces sp</italic>. have been studied. All these strains can ferment xylose to ethanol but at lower rates as compared to glucose fermentation rates (Jeffries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1985</xref>). This accounts for their low ethanol tolerance (Maleszka and Schneider, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">1982a</xref>) and xylitol accumulation. Besides, xylose utilization can occur only after its transport into the cell, so transporters play a significant role in xylose metabolism.</p><p id="Par27">Since <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is the preferred microbe for bioethanol production from LCB, transporters have been extensively studied for this yeast for conferring effective xylose consumption. It lacks dedicated transporters for xylose uptake. However, it possesses 18 transporters for hexose sugars, classified as Hxt1-Hxt17 and one galactose permease (Gal2), Snf3p, and Rgt2p which transport hexoses inside the cell (Anjos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2013</xref>). Nevertheless, only seven transporters are involved in glucose transport, Hxt1–Hxt7 and Gal2.

The latter mechanism requires metabolic energy, and sugar uptake is carried out against a concentration gradient. This mechanism can further be classified depending upon the type of metabolic energy preference, like direct energization, chemo-osmotic, or group translocation. On the contrary, facilitated diffusion mechanism possesses no such energy requirements. But both the systems require carrier proteins to transport sugars across the cell membranes and hence become specific to the substrate type/sugars.</p><p id="Par33">As these are substrate specific, the transport systems are competitively inhibited by their analogs or other sugars. Other than these, the chemo-osmotic proton symport-based transport systems, a type of active transport mechanism, also exist, but they are pH-dependent and work only under desired pH conditions (McMillan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">1993</xref>). For xylose uptake, there are two import systems: low-affinity, high capacity facilitated diffusion mechanism for transportation of both sugars (glucose and xylose); and proton symport system specifically for xylose uptake (high affinity) (Lucas and Van Uden <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">1986</xref>; Kilian and Van Uden <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">1988</xref>; Does and Bisson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1989</xref>).

Although there are homologs of xylose metabolizing genes in this yeast, but the functional metabolic pathway does not exist. Examples of such genes are GRE3, YPR1, SOR1, YJR096W (xylose reductase), YDL246C (xylitol dehydrogenase), YLR070C, and YKS1 (xylulokinase).

Later, with the emphasis on xylose transport, it was revealed that xylose is imported with the aid of hexose transporters, and therefore, its uptake rate is slower (Van Vleet and Jeffries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">2009</xref>).

Glucose repression refers to the inability of the yeast cells to utilize xylose, when glucose is present in the same medium. Once glucose is completely utilized, then xylose uptake starts. This has also been revealed recently that xylose is not sensed extracellularly by this yeast as a fermentative substrate. Presence of xylose initiates the same response in yeast as the low concentrations of glucose which is non-fermentative.

However, there are several other factors, genes, enzymes, and pathways associated with xylose metabolism which complicate its fermentation. As a result, such strategies require configuration to construct an improved strain. Later, ratios of the above mentioned genes were optimized for higher ethanol productivities (Eliasson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2001</xref>; Matsushika and Sawayama <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2008</xref>).

It was also observed that when <italic>TKL1</italic> from <italic>Pichia</italic> was overexpressed in <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> along with <italic>XYL1</italic> and <italic>XYL2</italic>, the recombinant strain showed faster growth rate than the strain expressing <italic>XYL1</italic> and <italic>XYL2</italic> alone (Walfridsson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">1995</xref>). Nonetheless, the growth rate of the transformant was lower than that of the parent strain due to the plasmid burden carrying three genes (<italic>XYL1</italic>, <italic>XYL2</italic>, and <italic>TAL1</italic>) (Bao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1997</xref>; Meinander et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">1999</xref>).</p><p id="Par69">To determine the ability of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> to assimilate and metabolize xylose, xylose reductases were expressed in this yeast system. This led to the xylose assimilation under oxygenic conditions along with the production of xylitol when there was no other sugar substrate in the medium (Kötter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">1990</xref>; Amore et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1991</xref>). On the contrary, overexpression of XYL2 leads to the accumulation of xylulose, suggesting XKS activity inhibits the xylose assimilation and utilization (Jin and Jeffries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2003</xref>).</p><p id="Par70">As discussed earlier, first successful recombinant strain of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> was constructed by Ho et al. The recombinant strain was efficient in xylose and mixed sugar fermentation. Ho et al. used XR and XDH from <italic>P. stipitis</italic>. Whereas when endogenous XKS gene was overexpressed, it was unable to grow on xylulose (Rodriguez-Peña et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">1998</xref>). Although when all the endogenous genes were overexpressed, ethanol fermentation was efficiently carried out (Toivari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2001</xref>). This infers that regulated expression of XKS is mandatory for efficient ethanol production. Several such efforts have been carried out since then for creating a modified and improved strain (Karhumaa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2007a</xref>; Ni et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2007</xref>; Matsushika and Sawayama <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2008</xref>; Matsushika et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2009</xref>; Van Vleet and Jeffries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">2009</xref>).</p><p id="Par71">Recent advances in genetic engineering tools such as the advent of CRISPR-Cas (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat) technology has been a milestone for strain development (Cong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2013</xref>). CRISPR-associated nucleases, Cas 9, have been used to create sequence specific double strand breaks in vitro. This technique has been used for reverse engineering in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> to confer xylose fermentation (Bao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2014</xref>; Jansen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2017</xref>). Genetic changes occurring in the strains improved through evolutionary engineering have been studied, and the same genes are targeted in the host organisms to produce single nucleotide mutations through CRISPR-Cas9 molecules.</p><p id="Par72">As discussed earlier, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> does not possess xylose specific transporters; it cannot properly consume xylose present in the lignocellulosic biomass. It exports xylose through glucose specific transporters. Therefore, there is tremendous scope of improvement in ethanol production through heterologous expression of xylose specific transporters in this yeast. A lot of research has diverted towards transporter engineering.</p><p id="Par73">Heterologous transfer of transporter genes has also facilitated xylose metabolism during co-fermentation processes. For instance, cryptic hexose transporter (chimeric Hxt11/2 transporter), engineered into a <italic>D</italic>-xylose transporter, resulted in the co-fermentation of mixed sugars (Shin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">2017</xref>). As stated in the earlier section, HXT transporters are responsible for glucose uptake in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. The two mechanisms of sugar transport have been discussed, facilitated diffusion, and proton symport mechanism. Former mechanism is more promising as it does not require much energy for sugar uptake. A transporter from <italic>C. intermedia</italic> following the xylose/glucose proton symport mechanism was transported into <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. This enhanced xylose consumption, but the Km was 10 folds lower than for glucose (Leandro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2006</xref>). Other two transporters, <italic>GSX1</italic> and <italic>GXF1</italic>, enhance glucose uptake ten times higher than glucose. When <italic>gxf1</italic> was engineered in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, there was not much effect on the growth rate of this yeast at higher xylose concentrations. However, at lower concentrations of xylose, it promoted the growth of the yeast strain (Runquist et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2009</xref>).</p><p id="Par74">Later, researchers found out that <italic>P. stipitis</italic> being a native pentose fermenting yeast possesses high-affinity xylose transporters and low uptake system for glucose/xylose shared uptake (Hahn-Hägerdal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2001</xref>). Moreover, it was found out that <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> exploits high-affinity xylose transporters for xylose uptake rather than innate low-affinity transporter specific for glucose uptake. Hence, under glucose limiting conditions, both the sugars are utilized together (Meinander and Hagerdal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">1997</xref>). Since <italic>Sut1-3</italic> are the main glucose transporters in <italic>P. stipitis</italic>, expressions in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> lead to increment in the utilization of both sugars (Katahira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2008</xref>). Sut1 and Sut3 have higher affinity for xylose than the corresponding glucose transporters of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p><p id="Par75">Later, it was also found out that apart from yeast and bacteria, filamentous fungi, <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> and <italic>Trichoderma reesei</italic>, also possess xylose transporters. <italic>xtrD</italic>, a xylose transporter from <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, was introduced into <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, and it was observed that this strain could grow on a wide range of sugars such as xylose, galactose, glucose, and mannose, with highest affinity towards xylose (Colabardini and Ries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par76">Advantage of this strategy is the targeted approach and thus its precision and accuracy. It does not pose any undesirable adverse effects on the strains. Genetic engineering is precise in targeting a particular gene of interest involved in the metabolism. However, this approach relies on the limited database of metabolic pathways leaving few targets for improvements.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Evolutionary engineering</title><p id="Par77">Evolutionary engineering includes all the experimental methods for strain improvement which involve random mutagenesis rather than targeted approach, eventually followed by selection of cells with desired traits (Sauer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">2001</xref>). This strategy includes several cycles of random mutations and sequential selection, which create genetic mutations involving the desired ones (Sauer and Schlattner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">2004</xref>) and can be very effective in strain improvement (Overkamp et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2002</xref>; Sonderegger and Sauer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">2003</xref>; Shi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">2014</xref>). Furthermore, this approach has also enhanced the stress tolerance levels of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (Martín et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2007</xref>). Major advantage of this technique is no prior information of the genome is required, and random mutations are produced containing the desired ones.</p><p id="Par78">In a study by Kim et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2013b</xref>, xylose toxicity was removed through evolutionary engineering of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Xylose toxicity was evident after the strain was grown on xylose concentrations above 10 g L<sup>−1</sup>. Third subculture of the strain showed significant improvement in the growth rate and ethanol production. Attfield and Bell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2006</xref>) adapted native strain of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> to grow solely on xylose as the sole carbon source with &lt; 6 h doubling time. Similarly, evolutionary engineering can also be used to investigate stress resistance properties of yeast. Koppram et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2012</xref>) demonstrated inhibitor tolerance in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> TMB3400. After 97 generations, maximum specific growth rate was enhanced to 0.33 h<sup>−1</sup>. Improved strains displayed better tolerance to inhibitors upon growth in spruce hydrolysates. In another study, evolutionary engineering was employed to increase resistance to hydroxymethyl furfural and furfural by serially transferring the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cultures to medium containing increasing concentrations of these inhibitors (Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2005</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Evolutionary genetic approach</title><p id="Par79">This approach is engaged for recombinant strains to enhance their ethanol productivities and make them stress tolerant. Recombinant strain is subjected to varying stresses, to which it may adapt with time. Adapted best strain is then screened out through selection techniques. As an example, a diploid recombinant strain was mutagenized, and the strain growing on xylose was selected (Demeke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2013</xref>). Further, their genomes were shuffled, and selection was done on D-xylose pre-treated spruce hydrolysate. Best cultures were selected and subjected to evolutionary adaptations. Strain at the last stage of xylose fermentation was considered as the most superior yeast for xylose fermentation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Mutagenesis</title><p id="Par80">Mutagenesis is either site directed or random, where site directed mutagenesis is a targeted approach, whereas random mutations are not locus specific. Targeted mutations could be used to alter the specificities of cofactors (Watanabe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">2005</xref>, Watanabe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">2007</xref>; Matsushika and Sawayama <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2008</xref>; Matsushika et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2008</xref>) while random mutations could be easily introduced through approaches like adaptation and protoplast fusion. Moreover, UV-induced mutations and EMS (ethyl methane sulfonate) induced mutations also create such random mutations. Additionally, recombinant strains can also be mutagenized to increase ethanol titers in comparison to the parent strains (Tantirungkij et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">1994</xref>; Sonderegger and Sauer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">2003</xref>).

As mentioned in the “<xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">Influence of pentose phosphate pathway enzymes on xylose metabolism</xref>” section, there are four major enzymes involved in PPP. Heterologous overexpression of their genes in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has augmented xylose fermentation process (Jin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2005</xref>). Bio-prospecting such genes linked to xylose metabolism indirectly could further enhance the efficacy of the process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Protoplast fusion and genome shuffling</title><p id="Par83">Another significant improvement strategy is protoplast fusion. It involves genome shuffling between micro-organisms. This is generally carried out for such strains which do not possess any genetic information (Heluane et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1993</xref>). It works on the basis of creation of random mutations through genome transfer. To add to its advantages, larger segments of DNA can also be transferred unlike classical genetic engineering approaches which rely on vectors for gene transfer. It also generates a number of fusants which possess desired metabolic traits. For fusion of two strains, a fusogenic reagent is required to bring them in close proximity with each other. It can done via PEG (polyethylene glycol) or though electroporation as well. Fusion can be applied to develop a strain with mixed sugar fermentation potential by shuffling genomes of hexose and xylose fermenting yeasts (Heluane et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1993</xref>; Lin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2005</xref>; Pasha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2007</xref>). Also, xylose fermenting strains can be obtained as a result of DNA transfer (Lin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2005</xref>).</p><p id="Par84">A fusant strain constructed by Pasha et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2007</xref>), F11, showed 0.459 g L<sup>−1</sup> ethanol yield with 90% fermentation efficiency. In a separate study (Krishnamoorthy et al. 2010), fused <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>K. marxianus</italic> and the resultant fusants produced more ethanol than the parent strain (12.5% from 18.09 g L<sup>−1</sup> of biomass). Earlier in 1996, Sakanaka et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">1996</xref>) also fused <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>K. marxianus</italic>. Among the 40 fusants obtained fusant F1 showed better traits than its parental strains in terms of its growth at high temperature and fermentation abilities.</p><p id="Par85">Genome shuffling, on the other hand, is improvised version of protoplast fusion. It involves several rounds of genetic material transfer leading to an improved strain by the end of process with higher xylose utilization and ethanol yields (Bajwa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2010</xref>).</p><p id="Par86">A fusant developed by this technique (Zhang and Geng <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">2012</xref>), ScF2, could utilize up to 250 g L<sup>−1</sup> of xylose and produced ethanol as well. When compared with <italic>P. stipitis</italic>, this fusant was found to be more tolerant towards xylose and showed high ethanol titers. Another fusant CP11 was produced by intergeneric fusion of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Candida shehatae</italic> (Pasha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2007</xref>). It was thermostable at 42 °C and could ferment wood hydrolysates with ethanol yield of 0.459 ± 0.012 g g<sup>−1</sup> and 90% fermentation efficiency. Ability to ferment wood hydrolysates signifies its industrial relevance to ferment lignocellulosic biomass. In another experiment, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> HAU1, an industrial strain possessing all the desired traits for fermentation but lacking killer properties, was fused with the killer strain of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. The resultant strain retained killer properties of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and could sustain toxic conditions of fermentation on molasses and nutrient recycling (Bajaj and Sharma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Adaptation</title><p id="Par87">Exposing strains to various stresses for a long time results in a stress tolerant strain. This is called adaptation of the strain. It is advantageous to follow this strategy when the genes responsible for a stress are unknown. Such as, in case of inhibitor tolerance, the genetics behind this is unclear. Therefore, adaptation under stress conditions is studied, and the tolerant strains are monitored for genetic changes potentially led to adaptability to stress. It involves repeated passaging of the cultures to increasing concentration of inhibitors in lignocellulosic hydrolysates. Selection is done on the basis of growth and fermentation traits. Generally, this is applied to recombinant strains (Harner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par88">However, there are reports of strain improvement in native strains as well. Through adaptation of strains on hydrolysates, cost requirements are reduced as detoxification is not required. Most of the adaptive techniques are employed to generate inhibitor tolerant strains (Zhu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">2009</xref>; Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2004</xref>). Another significant application is growth of native strains on xylose to enhance biomass yields (Attfield and Bell, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2006</xref>).

Other native pentose fermenting strains have been studied in detail, and their genes have been transferred to <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> for improvement in xylose fermentation. These involve engineering efforts that have been partially successful in enhancing ethanol yields. But there are constraints associated with these efforts like xylitol accumulation, low xylose fermentation rate, and low ethanol tolerance. Metabolic engineering strategies provide a solution to these limitations. These involve direct or indirect approaches to target single or multiple genes of the metabolic pathways. Among all the metabolic engineering strategies, genetic engineering being the most accurate and appropriate technique results in desired metabolic product within limited time. Besides, for screening the desired clones, simpler methods are also suitable, whereas for other techniques high throughput screening methods are required. But alone this approach cannot generate an improved strain; hence, a combinatorial strategy is required, wherein combination of genetic engineering along with other approaches like adaptation/evolutionary engineering is involved. Furthermore, some uncovered hidden traits of xylose metabolism still need to be revealed to improve the efficacy of co-fermentation processes. This could be done by involving random metabolic approaches as there are several metabolic pathways connected with xylose metabolism, and targeting each pathway is a tedious task. On the other hand, random approaches can alter the flow of the pathways which can later be studied to understand the genetics involved in the improvement strategies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><sec><p>Authors are also grateful to the Director, ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi, for giving us this platform to conduct research activities.
