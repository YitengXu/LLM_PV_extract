In order to bring PSC technology from laboratory to market, material stability, device flexibility, and scalability are important issues to address for vast production. Nevertheless, PSCs are still primarily prepared by solution methods which limit film scalability, while high-temperature processing of metal oxide electron transport layer (ETL) makes PSCs costly and incompatible with flexible substrates. Here, we demonstrate rarely-reported room-temperature radio frequency (RF) sputtered SnO<sub>2</sub> as a promising ETL with suitable band structure, high transmittance, and excellent stability to replace its solution-processed counterpart. Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 12.82% and 5.88% have been achieved on rigid glass substrate and flexible PEN substrate respectively. The former device retained 93% of its initial PCE after 192-hour exposure in dry air while the latter device maintained over 90% of its initial PCE after 100 consecutive bending cycles. The result is a solid stepping stone toward future PSC all-vapor-deposition fabrication which is being widely used in the PV industry now.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as a promising and emerging photovoltaic (PV) technology have quickly caught enormous attention in both academic research and PV industry over the past few years. As one of the most intensively researched types of solar cells, PSCs have been rapidly developed with unprecedented success, leading to a significant improvement on power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.8% to certified 22.7% within a decade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Besides high device performance, low fabrication cost as well as tunable composition and bandgap give this group of semiconductors gigantic potential and intriguing optoelectronic properties for next-generation solar cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Crystal growth optimization, interfacial engineering, compositional optimization, and device architecture design have been further explored to enhance PCE and stability of devices and eventually make them competitive with conventional silicon and other leading thin film solar cell technologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Typically, a PSC consists of an electron transport layer (ETL), a perovskite film and a hole transport layer (HTL), in addition to top and bottom electrical contacts. Particularly, inorganic metal-oxide films, such as TiO<sub>2</sub> and ZnO, have been widely reported as effective ETLs for high-performance PSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, they both have major drawbacks. TiO<sub>2</sub> as the most commonly used ETL has low electron mobility and requires sintering at high temperature up to 500 °C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. High temperature processing not only increases the cost of device fabrication, but also restricts the compatibility with flexible substrates. In addition, TiO<sub>2</sub> provokes perovskite degradation under exposure of UV illumination which is problematic during the prolonged device operation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. On the other hand, the hygroscopic nature of ZnO easily causes perovskite decomposition in moisture environment. Moreover, ZnO has poor thermal stability so it can easily react with perovskite during annealing and thermal treatment at elevated temperature, which eventually stimulates undesired perovskite degradation or even decomposition. Like perovskite, TiO<sub>2</sub> and ZnO are mostly prepared by solution methods, which sacrifice film uniformity and limit large-scale device production. On the other hand, SnO<sub>2</sub> is regarded as an alternative to replace TiO<sub>2</sub> and ZnO as an effective ETL to achieve low-cost PSCs with improved stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. SnO<sub>2</sub> has a wider bandgap and its electron mobility is two orders of magnitude higher than that of TiO<sub>2</sub>, making it a more suitable candidate for use in high performance devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Compare to TiO<sub>2</sub> and ZnO, SnO<sub>2</sub> is less hygroscopic in nature, has better thermal and UV stability, and possesses lower photocatalytic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. These properties prevent perovskite degradation and benefit PSC long-term stability. Despite that high-performance PSCs based on SnO<sub>2</sub> have been achieved, almost all reported SnO<sub>2</sub> films were prepared by spin-coating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, atomic layer deposition (ALD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, plasma-enhanced ALD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, sol-gel process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, chemical bath deposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, hydrothermal process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, and electrodeposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. In fact, many of these methods involve high-temperature processing and annealing ranging from 100 °C up to 550 °C, which again increases fabrication complexity and cost and makes it incompatible with flexible substrates. In order to make PSC technology cost-effective in the future, a fabrication technique allowing vast production is absolutely necessary.</p><p id="Par4">Considering the high reliability, maturity, and capability for large-scale production of sputtering technique in both industries and laboratories, SnO<sub>2</sub> prepared by magnetron sputtering for PSC application is however rarely reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. And previously studied sputtered SnO<sub>2</sub> film was calibrated based on deposition time instead of thickness, which is a more accurate and reliable approach in principle since deposition time depends on a number of deposition parameters and equipment infrastructure. Moreover, previous study lacked investigation on device stability as well as thorough thin film characterization on their SnO<sub>2</sub> and the corresponding glovebox-processed spin-coated perovskite absorber, particularly morphology and crystallinity analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and photoluminescence (PL). Therefore, it was hard to convince the effectiveness and compatibility of sputtered SnO<sub>2</sub> with perovskite solar cells. On the other hand, perovskite films are typically prepared by solution methods inside a glovebox filled with inert gas. Similarly, those solution methods limit film scalability while the use of glovebox increases production cost and complexity. Researchers have therefore put a great amount of effort to fabricate perovskite films and devices in ambient condition without sacrificing film quality, device performance, as well as stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Here, we demonstrate room-temperature RF sputtered SnO<sub>2</sub> film as an effective and robust ETL and meanwhile take one step forward to implement it together with vapor-deposited perovskite absorber for air-stable and efficient PSCs on both rigid and flexible substrates. By this application, we are now only one step away from sputtered SnO<sub>2</sub> based all-vacuum-deposited perovskite solar cells which will eventually enable industrialization. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report of using sputtered SnO<sub>2</sub> for flexible PSCs application. Both SnO<sub>2</sub> thickness and deposition conditions including working pressure and gas environment were systematically investigated. Device stability and hysteresis were also carefully studied.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p id="Par6">In this work, we demonstrated <italic>n-i-p</italic> planar structure of PSCs with optimized room-temperature-processed SnO<sub>2</sub> as ETL prepared by RF magnetron sputtering and vacuum-deposited perovskite film. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> shows the schematic of device structure of our PSCs: ITO-PEN/SnO<sub>2</sub>/MAPbI<sub>3</sub>/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b,c</xref> display SEM images of complete device based on rigid FTO glass substrate and flexible ITO-PEN substrate respectively. The morphology and surface roughness of bare FTO (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>), 40 nm SnO<sub>2</sub>-coated FTO (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a,b</xref>), and solution-processed SnO<sub>2</sub> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c,d</xref>) were studied by SEM and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Supplementary AFM reveals the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness and mean roughness of bare FTO glass were 7.736 nm and 6.096 nm respectively. In contrast, 40 nm SnO<sub>2</sub>-coated FTO had a RMS roughness and mean roughness of 5.488 nm and 4.358 nm respectively, while solution-processed SnO<sub>2</sub> had higher RMS roughness and mean roughness of 6.439 nm and 5.000 nm. It is reflected that sputtered SnO<sub>2</sub> film was uniformly deposited on FTO surface and SnO<sub>2</sub> grains were small enough to fill in the gaps between FTO grains, leading to a lower surface roughness than solution-processed SnO<sub>2</sub>, which is beneficial for the growth of vapor-deposited perovskite. To illustrate how surface roughness matters, perovskite was vapor-deposited on a 10 nm SnO<sub>2</sub>-coated FTO with RMS roughness and mean roughness of 7.199 nm and 5.708 nm respectively, measured by AFM (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>). It was clear that perovskite grain sizes on the 10 nm SnO<sub>2</sub>-coated FTO were significantly reduced (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3a</xref>). Moreover, cross-sectional SEM shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3b</xref> reveals that the perovskite grains and shape became more irregular on 10 nm SnO<sub>2</sub>-coated FTO, while single-crystal-thick perovskite grains with larger grain sizes and regular shapes were crystallized on 40 nm SnO<sub>2</sub>-coated FTO (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3c,d</xref>). In addition, small perovskite grains tended to crystallize in the perovskite-SnO<sub>2</sub> interface on 10 nm SnO<sub>2</sub>-coated FTO, which could adversely affect the efficiency of carrier transport. Since materials were slowly deposited onto substrate down to a few angstroms per second, a rougher surface would hinder the ion migration and volumetric expansion as perovskite crystallization took place. In contrast, this problem becomes less significant when perovskite is prepared by solution methods because they allow ions within the precursors to easily spread all over the substrates without overcoming significant energy barriers. Therefore, this problem was not commonly discussed in depth before. In contrast, although perovskite grown on solution-processed SnO<sub>2</sub> film (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref>) demonstrated comparable grain size with those grown on sputtered SnO<sub>2</sub>, the former perovskite films exhibit layered structure on most of the grains. This could be attributed to the higher roughness of solution-processed SnO<sub>2</sub> film, leading to inconsistent rate and degree of perovskite crystallization and ultimately high surface roughness. These could increase the probability of carrier recombination between perovskite absorber and the HTL.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Device architecture and thin film characterization.

The sputtered SnO<sub>2</sub> film showed a secondary cutoff edge of 5.01 eV (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S5b</xref>), indicating a work function W<sub>S</sub> of 5.01 eV. Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S5c</xref> shows the valence band maximum (VBM) of the sputtered SnO<sub>2</sub> film is located at 3.07 eV, below E<sub>F</sub>. The bandgap of the sputtered SnO<sub>2</sub> film acquired from the Tauc plot (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>) was 3.72 eV, which is wider than that of ZnO and TiO<sub>2</sub>. A wider bandgap implies better hole blocking ability and can avoid absorption of high-energy photons which leads to small current loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Based on the above values, it can be calculated using the semiconductor band structure (E<sub>C</sub> = W<sub>S</sub> + VBM − E<sub>g</sub>) that the E<sub>C</sub> of the sputtered SnO<sub>2</sub> film was 4.36 eV, which is deeper than that of TiO<sub>2</sub> and ZnO, both are 4.2 eV. The deeper conduction band of SnO<sub>2</sub> compared to TiO<sub>2</sub> and ZnO could enhance electron transfer from perovskite to the ETL. On the other hand, calculation showed E<sub>V</sub> of the sputtered SnO<sub>2</sub> film was 8.08 eV, which is much deeper than that of TiO<sub>2</sub> and ZnO, 7.4 eV and 7.6 eV respectively. The deeper valence band of SnO<sub>2</sub> can enhance hole blocking ability from perovskite to the ETL.

All XRD peaks for SnO<sub>2</sub> were indexable to the tetragonal SnO<sub>2</sub> structure, indicating the formation of pure SnO<sub>2</sub> crystals. In addition, sputtered SnO<sub>2</sub> film on FTO glass showed good transparency with transmittance close to 90% in the visible region (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>), while solution-processed SnO<sub>2</sub> had lower transmittance of about 80%. It is noteworthy the room-temperature sputtered SnO<sub>2</sub> here demonstrated even higher transmittance than other high-temperature-processed spin-coated SnO<sub>2</sub> films<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. To obtain high-quality SnO<sub>2</sub> films, impact of thickness, sputtering working pressure, and the flow rates of O<sub>2</sub> and Ar during sputtering were systematically studied.</p><p id="Par9">Since the thickness of ETL can critically affect cell performance, SnO<sub>2</sub> film was first sputtered under the same sputtering power of 60 W on FTO glass substrates kept at room temperature with four different thicknesses, 20 nm, 40 nm, 60 nm, and 80 nm, which took 8 min, 15 min, 23 min, and 30 min for sputtering, respectively. It can be inferred that the deposition rate was approximately 0.43 Å s<sup>−1</sup>. After sputtering, SnO<sub>2</sub>-coated FTO substrates were transferred to the evaporator for perovskite fabrication via a two-step vapor deposition as described in the Method section. The as-deposited perovskite samples were annealed in ambient air condition with over 65% humidity. It has been reported that certain level moisture is helpful for perovskite crystallization but excessive moisture could be detrimental to perovskite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. To overcome the humidity problem, perovskite samples were annealed for a short period of time at elevated temperature to accelerate the perovskite crystallization process and meanwhile minimize perovskite film degradation in ambient condition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. As-deposited perovskite samples were annealed at 130 °C for 10 min instead of the conventional 100 °C for an hour. It turned out that this method is also workable for vapor-deposited perovskite films, not only for solution-processed perovskite films. The UV-vis absorption spectra shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> of the vapor-deposited perovskite shows good absorption in the visible region. It also revealed that perovskite grown on sputtered SnO<sub>2</sub> exhibited higher absorption than that grown on solution-processed SnO<sub>2</sub>, which was attributed to its lower transmittance than sputtered SnO<sub>2</sub>. The absorption onset corresponded to an optical bandgap of 1.57 eV, estimated from the Tauc plot (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S6</xref>). The estimation matches well with the perovskite PL peak at 788 nm and the steady PL showed a more significant quench when depositing the perovskite film on sputtered SnO<sub>2</sub> compared to solution-processed SnO<sub>2</sub> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). It supports that sputtered SnO<sub>2</sub> possessed more efficient electron transport ability. XRD of perovskite (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>) presented the expected perovskite pattern, with intense signals at 14.1°, 28.4°, and 31.9° corresponding to the (100), (200), and (310) directions, respectively. It showed an extra peak of PbI<sub>2</sub> at 12.7° for perovskite that underwent 30 min prolonged annealing in humid air condition. Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S7</xref> shows the SEM of perovskite annealed for 30 min. The perovskite decomposing into PbI<sub>2</sub> hindered its crystallization by grain boundary expansion and grain cracking. As a consequence, the intensity of each perovskite peak was clearly reduced as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>. It confirms the effectiveness of short-time annealing processing at elevated temperature in ambient condition.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Properties of vapor-deposited perovskite film.

We fabricated PSCs based on 40 nm SnO<sub>2</sub> sputtered under the same power of 60 W but three different working pressures, 0.25 Pa, 0.5 Pa, and 1.0 Pa. The <italic>J-V</italic> characteristics of respective devices are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>. The device performance, particularly the V<sub>OC</sub>, decreased as working pressure increased. It is seen that devices with SnO<sub>2</sub> sputtered at 0.25 Pa yielded the best performance, with a PCE of 12.18%, a V<sub>OC</sub> of 0.948 V, a J<sub>SC</sub> of 22.34 mAcm<sup>−2</sup>, and an FF of 57.5%, so 0.25 Pa was taken as the optimum working pressure. An optimum working pressure is important so that the mean free path of gas molecules (O<sub>2</sub> and Ar) is comparable to the distance between the target and substrates. A high working pressure will reduce the mean free path of molecules. In other words, there will be so much scattering that electrons will not have enough time to gather enough energy between collisions to ionize the atoms on the target. As a result, it causes a less uniform film deposition over the substrates. The reduced V<sub>OC</sub> is attributed to uneven deposition due to too high working pressure. Sputtering under working pressure below 0.25 Pa was attempted, however, the plasma became unsustainable and unstable around 0.2 Pa due to too low gas molecule concentration. In order to yield a self-sustaining plasma, each electron has to generate enough secondary emission. Therefore, 0.25 Pa was concluded to be the optimum working pressure for SnO<sub>2</sub> sputtering without compromising film quality and device performance.</p><p id="Par12">The impact of flow rate of O<sub>2</sub> and Ar during SnO<sub>2</sub> sputtering on device performance was also studied. The flow rate of Ar was kept constant at 50 sccm while the flow rate of O<sub>2</sub> was varied from 1 sccm, 5 sccm, to 10 sccm (defined as FR1:50, FR5:50, and FR10:50 respectively). Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref> shows the <italic>J-V</italic> characteristics of PSCs with 40 nm SnO<sub>2</sub> sputtered under the same working pressure of 0.25 Pa but different flow rates of O<sub>2</sub> and Ar. The FR5:50 (O<sub>2</sub>:Ar) PSC showed a PCE of 12.82% with V<sub>OC</sub> of 0.965 V, J<sub>SC</sub> of 22.91 mAcm<sup>−2</sup>, and FF of 58.0%. Its performance was slightly better that of the FR10:50 PSC. However, the FR1:50 PSC yielded the poorest performance: a PCE of 8.66% with V<sub>OC</sub> of 0.938 V, J<sub>SC</sub> of 19.97 mAcm<sup>−2</sup>, and FF of 46.2%. A possible reason is that too low oxygen flow rate (or partial pressure) does not favor stoichiometric SnO<sub>2</sub> sputtering. The fewer O<sub>2</sub> amount was not sufficient to compensate and combine with the tin ions sputtered out of the target to form high-quality SnO<sub>2</sub> film and hence worsened the hole blocking ability.

Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S9a</xref> shows the evolution of their PCEs throughout the monitored period. The performance loss can be attributed to the degradation of the perovskite film within an unencapsulated device in 65% humidity. The highly hygroscopic and deliquescent properties of Li-TFSI used as dopant in Spiro-OMeTAD can also be regarded as a contribution to perovskite degradation due to penetration of water molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. In addition, the perovskite film could deteriorate rapidly in the presence of TBP as a polar solvent. Therefore, TBP may be a good solvent for perovskite, which means it can corrode the perovskite layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. It is worth mentioning that the perovskite films, HTL films, and all devices were annealed, prepared, unencapsulated, and characterized in ambient condition with humidity greater than 65%. It convinces the viability of air processability of perovskite films, HTL films, and device characterization without the use of a glove box. To further illustrate this assertion, 40 sputtered SnO<sub>2</sub> based PSCs in one single batch using the optimized SnO<sub>2</sub> parameters and 40 solution-processed SnO<sub>2</sub> based PSCs in one batch were fabricated by the same procedures. Statistics as shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S9b</xref> convince the reproducibility and consistency of device performance. Both batches of devices demonstrated normal distribution of PCEs. It can be concluded that sputtered SnO<sub>2</sub> based devices showed higher average PCE and sputtered SnO<sub>2</sub> is therefore more effective and beneficial to enhance PSC device performance and stability.</p><p id="Par15">Flexibility is a desirable feature of thin film solar cells for a variety of applications, such as portable power sources, building-integrated photovoltaics, clothing and textiles, power-generating fabrics, and electronics with light-weight curved surface. One of the main advantages in the use of sputtered SnO<sub>2</sub> is that no sintering or annealing step is required thus flexible plastic substrates can be used. The other major fabrication steps (vapor deposition of perovskite, spin-coating of Spiro-OMeTAD, and thermal evaporation of Au) are also carried out in room temperature condition, which means this fabrication process as a whole is compatible with flexible substrates. To date, majority of the reported flexible PSCs employ spin-coated TiO<sub>2</sub>, ZnO, or PCBM as ETL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, while very few of them used solution-processed SnO<sub>2</sub> as ETL. To illustrate the compatibility of sputtered SnO<sub>2</sub> with flexible substrates for perovskite photovoltaic, in our work rigid FTO glass substrate was therefore replaced by flexible substrate, namely indium-doped-tin-oxide-coated polyethylene naphthalate (ITO-PEN) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>).

Therefore, the device exhibits a small hysteresis. The discrepancies between J<sub>SC</sub>’s appeared in the studied devices measured under reverse and forward scannings might be the result of slow response of photocurrent and higher defect density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>.

In comparison with the champion device based on rigid FTO glass substrate, the flexible devices yielded a substantial loss in J<sub>SC</sub> but a significant improvement in FF. The loss of J<sub>SC</sub> could be accounted to the lower transmittance through ITO-PEN substrates compared to FTO glass substrates and the threefold increase in device area from 3.14 mm<sup>2</sup> to 10 mm<sup>2</sup>. On the other hand, the improvement in FF could be caused by the smoother ITO electrode surface, allowing flatter coverage of SnO<sub>2</sub> film and eventually more compact interface between SnO<sub>2</sub> film and perovskite for even more effective electron extraction and reduced series resistance.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Photograph and device performance of a perovskite solar cell prepared on a flexible PEN substrate.

The clean substrates were transferred to a vacuum chamber and evacuated to a pressure of 4 × 10<sup>−4</sup> Pa for SnO<sub>2</sub> sputtering. The substrates were mounted on a rotating platform, 10 cm above the SnO<sub>2</sub> target (China Rare Metal Co. Ltd.). The sputtering atmosphere was consisted of O<sub>2</sub> and Ar.

The device area on FTO glass and ITO-PEN were 0.0314 cm<sup>2</sup> and 0.1 cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Device measurements</title><p id="Par20">The AM1.5G solar spectrum was simulated by an Abet Class AAB Sun 2000 simulator with an intensity of 100 mWcm<sup>−2</sup> calibrated with a KG5-filtered Si reference cell. The current-voltage (I–V) data were measured using a 2400 series sourcemeter (Keithley, USA). I–V sweeps (forward and reverse) were performed between −1.2 and +1.2 V, with a step size of 0.02 V and a delay time of 100 ms at each point.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Material characterization</title><p id="Par21">Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (JEOL JSM-7100F) and X-ray diffraction method (Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer, USA) utilizing Cu K α radiation were used to study the thickness, morphology, roughness of the films, and phase characterization. The optical absorption and steady-state photoluminescence spectra were recorded on a Lambda 20 spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, USA) and InVia (Renishaw) micro raman/photoluminescence system, respectively. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (Axis Ultra DLD) was used to determine the valence band maximum of SnO<sub>2</sub> films. Scanning probe microscopy (NanoScope III) (Digital Instruments) was used to characterize the surface roughness of films.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 51672231), Shen Zhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission (Project No. JCYJ20170818114107730) and Hong Kong Research Grant Council (General Research Fund Project No. 16237816).
