Perovskites have many properties which make them attractive materials for solar cell applications, including efficient light absorption, tuneable band gap, long charge-carrier lifetimes and high defect tolerance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However it is the relative ease by which perovskite films can be deposited from solution that has generated the greatest interest, as this potentially allows high volume manufacture of photovoltaic modules at low cost and low temperature. This could allow a dramatic reduction in the energy payback time of a commercial module to less than half a year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In order for this to become a reality, it is necessary to demonstrate that perovskite solar cells can be fabricated using industrially compatible coating techniques.</p><p id="Par3">Currently most perovskite device optimisation is performed using spin coating; a simple and reliable technique capable of producing highly uniform thin films. However spin coating is usually only suitable for coating small substrates on the order of square centimetres, rather than square meters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Spin coating is also a wasteful coating process, as the majority of the ink to be coated is thrown from the substrate during deposition. Consequently, increased research effort is being focused towards scalable deposition techniques such as blade-coating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, slot-die coating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, inkjet printing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, and spray-coating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">In this paper, we report on the deposition of perovskite PV devices via ultrasonic spray-coating and their partial scale-up. Spray-coating is an attractive technique for high volume manufacturing, as it allows large areas to be coated at high-speed with only minimal loss of coating ink. In contrast to regular aperture based spray-coaters, ultrasonic spray-coaters utilise piezoelectric transducers to shear the solution to be deposited into a mist of micron sized droplets characterised by a smaller average size than those produced by a conventional air-brush device<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. This, in principle, allows the deposition of more uniform coatings. The first spray-coated perovskite solar cells fabricated via ultrasonic spray-coating deposited a perovskite from a 3:1 mixture of methylammonium iodide and lead chloride and achieved an average PCE of 7.8%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Here, a simple single-pass deposition technique was used in which the spray-head moved across the substrate creating a “wet film”, which – after thermal annealing – formed a CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3−x</sub>Cl<sub>x</sub> perovskite capable of reaching a peak efficiency of 11% when integrated into a device<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Following this, a series of approaches have been explored to improve film uniformity and device performance. These include the use of two-step deposition protocols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, continuous soaking of the substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, anti-solvent bath treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, the use of multiple spray-passes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, low vacuum treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, megasonic spray-coating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, and hot-air treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Indeed, many groups can now reliably produce spray-coated PSCs with an average PCE in the mid-teens with the best devices reaching a reverse scan PCE of 18.5% and a stabilised PCE of 17.3%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Furthermore spray deposition has been utilised to probe compositional space in mixed cation systems by controlling the flow of two inks delivered to the spray head prior to atomisation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The interested reader is directed to a recent review that charts the development of spray-coated perovskite PV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">It is important to emphasize that the majority of papers on spray-coated PSCs rely on spin-coating to deposit the electron and hole transport layers that are used to extract charges from the active perovskite layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Ideally however, spray-coating should be used to deposit all solution processable layers within a PSC as this would replicate a practical manufacture process. In previous work, we demonstrated a fully spray-cast perovskite device based on an ‘inverted’ (<italic>p-i-n</italic>) architecture where the PEDOT:PSS, CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3−x</sub>Cl<sub>x</sub> perovskite and PCBM were deposited by spray-coating, with devices reported having an average PCE of 7.1%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. By switching to an <italic>n-i-p</italic> architecture and sequentially spray-coating compact TiO<sub>2</sub>, mesoporous TiO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3−x</sub>Cl<sub>x</sub> perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD, we have also been able to create PV devices yielding an average PCE of 9.2%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Recently perovskite solar cells having a PCE of 20% have been demonstrated in which all solution processed layers (namely SnO<sub>2</sub>, perovskite, and spiro-OMeTAD) were deposited via air-blading<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. This arguably represents the state-of-the-art for scalable perovskite deposition methods. In this article we perform a similar study, building upon our previous work to spray-coat all solution processable layers within a device, and incorporate a low vacuum treatment step to crystallise a “triple-cation” perovskite layer. We then scale up our fabrication process to larger area substrates to fabricate efficient PSCs. We believe that this represents an important proof-of-concept that could be transferable to an industrial manufacturing environment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Device fabrication</title><p id="Par7">We have used a Prism Ultra-coat 300 system (Ultrasonic Systems Inc.) ultrasonic spray-coater operated in low humidity air to deposit the nanoparticle tin oxide (np-SnO<sub>2</sub>) and spiro-OMeTAD layers. The perovskite layer was instead deposited using a Sonotek Exactacoat equipped with an “Impact” spray-head that was located inside a nitrogen-filled glovebox. Here, the inert environment was critical to allow us to control the drying and crystallisation dynamics of the perovskite, removing the effect of oxygen and moisture. Both spray-coaters were equipped with a motorised gantry that allowed the spray-head to be scanned across a substrate in a controlled manner. All spray-coating described here is based on a simple “single pass” deposition process in which the spray-head was moved over the substrate in a straight line at a range of coating velocities (80 to 180 mm s<sup>−1</sup>) depending on the particular layer being coated. This allowed a roll-to-roll industrial coating process to be simulated, in which a sheet is continuously fed through a coating system. We have found that by controlling head height, the relative velocity of the head as it passes across the surface and the fluid flow rate, we can control the thickness of the resultant layer. We have found that it is also necessary to maintain the substrate at an elevated temperature during deposition to control both surface wetting and the subsequent drying of the “wet film”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(a)</xref> shows images of small and large-area spray-coated devices.

After deposition, the films were annealed for 30 minutes at 150 °C before being subject to a 15 minute UV ozone treatment. Films were then transferred to a nitrogen glovebox for deposition of the perovskite layer using a spray-coating process that involves an exposure to a vacuum (so-called vacuum-flash assisted solution processing (VASP))<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Here the perovskite precursor was based on a stoichiometric mixture having the composition Cs<sub>0.05</sub>FA<sub>0.81</sub>MA<sub>0.14</sub>PbI<sub>2.55</sub>Br<sub>0.45</sub>, dissolved in a 4:1 mixture of DMF:DMSO. After the substrate was coated with the precursor ink, it was loaded into a sealed box that was then rapidly evacuated to a coarse vacuum (80 Pa) for 1 minute. This ensures high film quality by controlling nucleation of the perovskite phase. After this treatment, the substrate was removed from the vacuum and annealed at 120 °C for 20 minutes to fully crystallise the perovskite layer. Spiro-OMeTAD was either spin-coated onto the substrate in a glovebox environment or spray-coated in air using a process similar to one we reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Here the spray-cast ink had a lower concentration and was dissolved in a 1:1 mixture of chloroform and chlorobenzene to enhance surface wetting and accelerate film drying. Finally, thermal evaporation was used to deposit and pattern the gold top contact through a shadow mask.

In Device A the np-SnO<sub>2</sub> and spiro-OMeTAD layers were spin-coated while the (VASP treated) perovskite layer was spray-cast, with devices having a peak PCE of 19.4% with an average PCE of 17.6 ± 1.3%. To the best of our knowledge this is the highest reported peak efficiency for a PSC containing a spray-coated perovskite layer. Importantly we have optimised our previous deposition protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and find that the vacuum exposure time can be shortened from 5 minutes to 1 minute whilst yielding improved PV performance (see Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>).</p><p id="Par12">We find that if the np-SnO<sub>2</sub> layer is spray-cast (Device B) there is a slight reduction in average PCE to 14.7 ± 4.4% that we attribute to a low-level of defects introduced into the film during spray-deposition. We suspect that such defects occur as the np-SnO<sub>2</sub> layer is very thin, and thus if its surface becomes contaminated by any dust or debris, it can cause dewetting of the perovskite layer, creating voids that act to reduce device performance (see Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>). The magnitude of this effect varies from sample to sample and can cause a large drop in both V<sub>OC</sub> and FF (see Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>). We classify devices having less than 1% PCE as “failed devices” with the number of such devices reported in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Note, the performance metrics of these devices have been omitted from our statistical analysis. If the deposition is performed in a cleaner environment then we anticipate no loss in performance when spraying this layer. For a more in depth analysis of spray-coated np-SnO<sub>2</sub> films we direct the reader to other recent work in which we develop this process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par13">On spray-coating the spiro-OMeTAD (Device C) we find that there is only minimal loss in device performance, with devices having an average PCE of 17.0 ± 2.9%. Here, we have carefully controlled the thickness of the spray-cast spiro-OMeTAD (≈200 nm) by adjusting the concentration of spray-solution so that it matches that of the spin-cast layer. Indeed, we have found that if the spiro-OMeTAD layer thickness is greater than this optimum value, it results in reduced performance (see Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref>) and increased hysteresis. As a result of this optimisation, when all three layers were spray-coated (Device D) we were able to produce PSCs with an average PCE of 16.6 ± 2.4% and a peak efficiency of 19.4%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Surface profilometry and laser-beam-induced current mapping</title><p id="Par14">We have performed profilometry and laser-beam-induced current mapping (LBIC) on a series of typical devices fabricated by spin and spray-coating. Here, a Dektak surface profilometer was used to record a topographical image of the device surface. The same device was then scanned by a 25 µm laser spot whilst recording the photocurrent, allowing the photovoltaic response of device to be mapped. The results of these measurements are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Topographical (panels a,c,e,g) and laser-beam-induced current mapping (panels b,d,f,h) images of spray-coated perovskite solar cells.

However we do occasionally observe localised areas of reduced photocurrent. For example, Device A contained three regions of reduced photocurrent having a diameter of around 100 µm (so-called “cold spots”) that seem to be correlated with morphological defects in the topographical map. We have observed such defects before<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> and suspect that they result from aggregates in the perovskite layer. Indeed, we also observe similar defects in the topographical images recorded from the other devices, indicating that it is likely that they are present in the perovskite film. Interestingly however, some topographical asperities do not appear to lead to a reduction in the photocurrent, with some current cold-spots being apparently uncorrelated with obvious morphological defects. The origins behind such effects are still not well understood.</p><p id="Par16">On spray-coating the spiro-OMeTAD layer, we observe a small increase in the density of regions associated with lower average photocurrent. These seem to correlate to thickness fluctuations of the order of tens of nanometres, and occur over lateral length-scales of hundreds of microns in both Devices C and D. We speculate that these are likely correlated with fluctuations in the thickness of the spiro-OMeTAD layer caused as a result of a non-uniform drying process. Indeed, it appears that thicker parts of the spiro-OMeTAD layer result in a localised increase in series resistance and cause a small drop in photocurrent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Large-area devices</title><p id="Par17">We have used our spray-coating process to perform a limited scale up of device area. Here, four large-area substrates were coated that comprised a total of 48 device pixels, with each device having an active area of 15.4 mm<sup>2</sup>. The “champion” fully spray-coated large-area device had a reverse scan PCE of 16.3% relative to 19.4% recorded on small-area substrates (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(a)</xref>). Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(b)</xref> shows the stabilised efficiency from the champion cells having a PCE of 18.7% and 16.3% for small and large-area cells respectively. A PCE histogram of these devices is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(c)</xref> where the small-area cells have an average PCE of 16.6 ± 2.4% while the large-area cells have an average PCE of 10.3 ± 4.0%. The other average performance metrics for such large-area devices are shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> along with those of the champion device. Here it is clear the average performance of the 45 functioning large-area devices is reduced by seven devices that had an efficiency below 5% due to the presence of defects within their active area. In addition we note that the VASP treated large-area perovskite films are slightly rougher than those deposited on small-area substrates likely accounting for the reduction in PCE we observe. We anticipate that further optimisation of the VASP process can mitigate this effect.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Current-voltage characteristics for “champion” fully spray-cast perovskite solar cells with an active area of 2.5 mm<sup>2</sup> (small-area) and 15.4 mm<sup>2</sup> (large-area).

However by parallel connecting 7 of the highest performing devices on one particular substrate, we were able to create a device having an effective area of 1.08 cm<sup>2</sup> (see Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S6</xref>) having a reverse scan PCE of 12.7%. This efficiency is significantly greater than that reported in our previous study in which we fabricated a fully spray-cast device having an active area of 1.008 cm<sup>2</sup> and PCE of 6.6%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. These results suggest a promising degree of uniformity across the entire coating area (approximately 18.8 cm<sup>2</sup>) although future work will involve further development of the deposition conditions to minimise the defect density. Here the use of other techniques such as <italic>in-situ</italic> Raman and local absorption spectroscopy could be utilised to further understand the composition of such defects. We believe that improved control of defect density should allow the fabrication of fully spray-cast mini-modules having a PCE of ~16%.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par19">We have developed a process to fabricate perovskite solar cells in which all three solution processable layers were deposited via spray-coating. Using this process, we have been able to fabricate the most efficient spray-coated PSCs reported to date with a reverse scan PCE of 19.4% on small-area substrates. Furthermore, the spray-method developed allowed us to coat a relatively large area substrate (25 mm × 75 mm) at speed, with twelve 15.4 mm<sup>2</sup> devices produced per substrate. These devices had a champion PCE of 16.3% and an average PCE of 10.3 ± 4.0%. By simultaneously connecting seven of these devices in parallel, we created a device having a PCE of 12.7% with an active-area of 1.08 cm<sup>2</sup>. We have characterised the quality of spray-cast devices using a combination of surface profilometry and laser-beam-induced current mapping, and find that device performance is reduced by the presence of aggregates and voids within the perovskite, as well as possible thickness fluctuations in the spiro-OMeTAD layer. In order to further improve device reproducibility and performance, it will be necessary to determine the precise origin of these morphological defects in the various device layers and develop strategies to reduce their areal density. Nevertheless, this work demonstrates a fast, scalable process by which efficient perovskite solar cells can be fabricated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Device fabrication</title><p id="Par20">FAI (Ossila), MABr (Dyesol), PbBr<sub>2</sub> (TCI), PbI<sub>2</sub> (TCI) and CsI (Sigma) were weighed out into a vial to form a triple cation perovskite with composition Cs<sub>0.05</sub>FA<sub>0.81</sub>MA<sub>0.14</sub>PbI<sub>2.55</sub>Br<sub>0.45</sub>.
