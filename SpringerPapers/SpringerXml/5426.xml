The goals of international energy security and sustainable development necessitate the role of renewable energy, of which biomass energy is an essential choice for realizing the strategic energy diversification. Microbial conversion of flue-gas-derived CO<sub>2</sub> for producing biodiesel and biogas has been considered a significant technology in many industries, such as energy conservation, environmental protection, new energy development, and low-carbon circular economy. The <italic>Outline of the National Program for Long- and Medium-Term Scientific and Technological Development</italic> and the <italic>13th Five-Year Plan For Renewable Energy Development</italic> clearly point out that it is necessary to vigorously develop new energy, such as biomass energy and hydrogen energy, to achieve the targets in which 2 million tons of biodiesel and 44 billion cubic meters of biogas should be produced by 2020. Prestigious peer-review journals such as <italic>Nature</italic> and <italic>Cell</italic> have pointed out that microbial energy is one of the hottest research frontiers. However, there are still three basic problems in energy/mass transfer and conversion in the process of microbial conversion of flue-gas-derived CO<sub>2</sub> to biodiesel and biogas fuels, the first is the mass transfer of CO<sub>2</sub> across cell membrane, the research of Prof. Ned Wingreen showed that the growth rate and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation efficiency of microalgae under air conditions were seriously limited by CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], Khoo et al. found that the contradictory relationship between high resistance of cell membrane micropores and high flux of flue-gas-derived CO<sub>2</sub> limited mass transfer rate of CO<sub>2</sub> molecules across cell membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The second is the intracellular enzyme activity of microalgae. Prof. Martin jonikas has proved that the low biological catalytic activity of enzymes in cells with high concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> leads to the difficulty of directional carbon/hydrogen conversion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], how to improve the activity of key enzymes is still a key problem in the process of microalgae carbon sequestration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The third is problem of competitive intracellular reaction pathways. Many researchers have found that nitrogen starvation was able to promote the synthesis and accumulation of oil in microalgae cells, but reduce the photosynthetic activity of microalgae cells. There is a conflict between CO<sub>2</sub> fixation and lipid accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The competition between multiple intracellular reaction pathways and high energy barriers of target products hinder the desirable cascade energy transfer. Prof. Heinz kopetz proposed that the catalytic reaction of direct conversion of carbon dioxide to lipids is the key to the production of lipids by microalgae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, key scientific issues of microbial energy conversion lie in the understanding on directional carbon conversion and desirable cascade energy transfer. Facing to those key problems, multiple researcheres haveconducted a long-term research on the topic of microbial conversion of flue-gas-derived CO<sub>2</sub> for producing biodiesel and biogas, which established a theoretical foundation of microbial energy conversion and broke the bottlenecks of strengthening energy/mass transfer in microbial cells. Through those studies, they have revealed the mass transfer mechanism of vortex flow across cell membrane micropores, proposed a strategy that directionally regulated enzyme activity, and established the chain reaction pathways coupled with step changes. Therefore, a series of innovative results through long-term research have been obtained as follows:</p><p id="Par235">1. Mass transfer mechanism of vortex flow across cell membrane micropores has been revealed. It was comprehensively discussed that the scientific problem of limited mass transfer at the microporous interface of cell membrane from the perspective of photon conversion during photosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The mechanism explained the behaviors of hydrodynamic mass transfer in terms of vortex enhanced intracellular photon transformation, and further solved the problem of low CO<sub>2</sub> transport rate across the micropore-interface of cell membrane.</p><p id="Par236">2. A strategy that directionally regulates enzyme activity has been proposed. A scientific issue of improving biocatalytic activity from the electron transfer perspective has been issued and the approach coupling gradient flue-gas-derived CO<sub>2</sub> domestication with mutagenesis of enzymes to enhance electron transfer was proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Besides, they also developed an approach to regulate active sites of CO<sub>2</sub> fixation enzymes, thus significantly improving the key enzyme activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par237">3. A chain reaction pathways coupled with step changes has been established. It was identified that high energy barrier was the obstacle of cascade energy transfer, and chemical chain reaction model combining the functions of CO<sub>2</sub> fixation enzymes and lipid synthesis enzymes wasestablished [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The energy barrier step pathways of C1→C6→C18 chain elongation was revealed, thus developing principles of cascade energy transfer to solve trade-off relationship between CO<sub>2</sub>-biofixation and lipid-synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Research progress on strengthening energy and mass transfer in microbial conversion of flue-gas-derived CO<sub>2</sub> to biodiesel and biogas fuels</title><p id="Par20">As shown in Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> main problems in microalgal research limited the CO<sub>2</sub> conversion to biogas and biofuels, including the mass transfer rate limitation, low biocatalytic activity of intracellular energy for directional carbon conversion and high energy barriers of target products. Therefore, we planned to make a breakthrough in 3 aspects including CO<sub>2</sub> transport, directional carbon conversion and lipid/gas products.

Wingreen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] proved that the growth rate and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation efficiency of microalgae under air conditions are seriously limited by CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion rate. Due to the complex process: (1) the low concentration (400 ppm) of CO<sub>2</sub> molecules (2.4 Å) must first be dissolved in water as the inorganic carbon form of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> (3.1 Å); (2) then HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> combined with transport proteins go across cell membrane into cell; (3) finally CO<sub>2</sub> will be released with the catalysis of carbonic anhydrase. This theory has been widely accepted by researchers in this area, but only limited advances have been achieved in terms of improving the overall reaction rate of microalgal CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. In recent years, many researchers began to explore the scientific problem of limited mass transfer at the microporous interface of cell membrane from the perspective of photon conversion in photosynthetic process. Hu et al. found that making full use of microalgae flash effect, making algal cells periodically exposed to light/dark conditions was able to effectively promote microalgae growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Due to the different types of reactors, microalgae varieties and breeding environment, there is no unified understanding of the optimal flash frequency of microalgae photosynthetic reactor, but they all agree that the flash effect can effectively improve the growth rate of microalgae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Some scholars have studied the effect of flash frequency on the growth of microalgae at the millisecond level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], however, most of these studies were carried out in the laboratory by changing the artificial light frequency or periodically shielding some reactors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In the natural state, realizing the millisecond flash cycle need strong mixing flow, which will greatly increase the breeding system in energy consumption. A case study on comparison of life cycle analyses of microalgal biomass production has been reported by Prof. Jorquera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The authors have reported the net energy ratio (NER) for both the processes for microalgae production, e.g. tubular and flat bed reactors as well as raceway ponds. The NER of a system has been defined as the ratio of the total energy produced (energy content of the oil and residual biomass) over the energy content of photobioreactor construction and material plus the energy required for all plant operations: NER = NetEnergyRatio = ΣEnergyproduced(lipidorbiomass)∑Energyrequirements. The results indicate that the use of horizontal tubular photobioreactors (PBRs) is not economically feasible due to negative NER values. The NER values for flat bed PBRs and raceway ponds are found to be positive. The research of Dasan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] shows that at present, the dehydration and oil extraction of microalgae biomass require high energy input, accounting for nearly 21% - 30% and 39% - 57% of the total energy demand respectively. The research of Morweiser et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] shows that in terms of energy efficiency, the best reactor (such as different ‘water bed’ designs) has now entered the range of 50% auxiliary energy demand related to the collected solar energy (or 2 w/m<sup>2</sup> and 0.04 m<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>) by reducing the auxiliary energy to 50 w/m<sup>3</sup>.</p><p id="Par22">Therefore, more advanced photobioreactors and low-cost downstream processing technologies were sought to achieve a more feasible microalgae biofuels production system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Based on continuous illumination conditions, the photosynthetic reactor with second flash cycles through turbulence to enhance the turbulent flow of culture medium is more suitable for industrial scale aquaculture. Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] developed a spiral static mixer, which accelerated the mixing and light dark cycle of the column photoreactor, thereby increasing the biomass yield by 37.26%. Chen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] introduced six half moon blade static mixers into the column photoreactor and found that the mixer improved the turbulent kinetic energy and light dark cycle frequency. Zhao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] proposed a multi-scale bubble combined inlet method to strengthen the multiphase mixing and mass transfer process of Chlorella by using millimeter bubbles with strong turbulence characteristics. With large contact area and long residence time, microbubbles can significantly improve the gas retention rate, light utilization efficiency and growth rate of small particle microalgae in microalgae photosynthetic reactor. Ye et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] used the nozzle to generate vortex to enhance the photochemical efficiency of microalgae photosynthetic column reactor. However, due to the small vortex radius and mainly concentrated at the bottom of the reactor, most areas in the upper part of the reactor are little affected by the vortex.</p><p id="Par23">The photobioreactor designed by Prof. Cheng of Zhejiang University based on the theory of hydrodynamics produced alternating clockwise and counterclockwise vortex flow fields, strengthened the flash effect of rapid flow of algae cells in light and dark areas (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), increased the gas-liquid two-phase mass transfer coefficient by 25%, and increased the biomass yield by 32.6% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Aiming at the new problems about flow and mass transfer with microbial photosynthesis, they revealed the phenomenon that vortex strengthens the photosynthesis process of microalgal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Prof. Dubinsky evaluated that “the novel system” proposed in this research “sequentially generate clockwise and anticlockwise liquid vortexes”, “increased the mass transfer coefficient”, and “enhanced flashing-light effect” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Professor Simon Judd evaluated this finding and believed that ‘HD removal rate was achievable’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Professor Cheng Jun’s team of Zhejiang University proposed to use a ground-breaking mechanism of “ flashing light effect of vortex flow”, which advanced the conventional understanding on transmembrane transport of CO<sub>2</sub> molecules with HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> as the intermediate, so as to reveal the hydrodynamic mass transfer mechanism of vortex, thereby enhancing intracellular photon conversion efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].

Although high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration from flue gas improves diffusion and transfer of CO<sub>2</sub> molecules across cell membrane of microalgae, the biological catalytic activity of key CO<sub>2</sub> fixation enzymes in original microalgal cells is severely suppressed under such a high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration condition. Thus, how to efficiently improve the activity of key CO<sub>2</sub> fixation enzymes in microalgal cells is an international research hotspot. Martin Jonikas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] proved in that traditional biological enzymes have low catalytic activity in the process of microbial energy conversion, resulting in difficulties in directional carbon/hydrogen conversion. Therefore, how to improve the activity of key enzymes from the perspective of quality/energy transfer of basic reactions in multiple cells is still a bottleneck in the process of microbial biomass hydrogen production. Xu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] established a model to help understand the changes of cell fluid flux, volume and media molar concentration caused by osmotic pressure. Assuming that cells were submerged in the CPAs, the water flux across the cell membrane (Jw) was given as.

Huang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] found that when a higher concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> was continuously injected into the aqueous solution for microalgae growth, the dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the solution increased significantly. Transcriptome sequencing showed that carbonic anhydrase was almost not expressed at this time, indicating that CO<sub>2</sub> directly penetrated into microalgae cells by osmotic pressure to participate in Calvin cycle reaction. This process reduces the active transport of HCO3<sup>−</sup>, saves more energy and improves the efficiency of photosynthesis. The results showed that the cultivation of microalgae with high concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> was able to promote the growth, carbon sequestration rate and biomass yield of microalgae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">Hussain et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] found that the two microalgae plants growth was slow under high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (20% CO<sub>2</sub>). However, in step wise CO<sub>2</sub> feeding, the growth of microalgae improved considerably and up to 0.9 and 0.97 (g/L) biomasses were recorded, respectively. According to the professor Ghosh’s research results, <italic>Scenedesmus</italic> sp. could effectively exploit high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (15%) for longer duration under high concentration of glucose supplementation (9 g/L) producing a biomass of 635.24 +/− 39.9 μg /mL with a high total fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) content of 71.29 +/− 4.2 μg /mg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Yun et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] during the growth of <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic>, the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the gas gradually increased from 5% to 30% with the culture time (about every 43 h, the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration increased by 5% or 10%), and the maximum CO<sub>2</sub> fixation rate was 0.936 g / (L•D). Fulke et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] in India screened a strain of <italic>Chlorella</italic> sp. from carbonate rich areas. After domestication with low carbon source and high temperature culture, the obtained <italic>Chlorella</italic> sp. can withstand 15% CO<sub>2</sub> environment. Although some articles believe that overexpression of C4 gene in C3 plants cannot significantly improve the photosynthetic capacity of plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The research of Liu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] proposed that carbon fixation is carried out through the combination of C3 and C4 pathways and carbonic anhydrase, and the enhancement of C4 pathway by high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration may provide a variety of carbon fixation pathways for C3 microalgae and finally improve its CO<sub>2</sub> fixation capacity. Anjos et al. found that CO<sub>2</sub> with volume fraction of 6% is most suitable for microalgae growth, but the volume fraction of CO<sub>2</sub> in power plant flue gas is about 12% ~ 15%. Through nuclear mutation, screening and domestication, cultivate algae species resistant to high volume fraction CO<sub>2</sub> and apply it directly to industrial aquaculture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Nuclear mutagenesis induces recombination and improvement of key genes relating to CO<sub>2</sub> fixation enzymes and lipid synthesis enzymes in microalgae cells, thus significantly enhancing the activities of CO<sub>2</sub> fixation enzymes (e.g., photosynthetic pigment enzymes, ATP synthase, etc) and lipid synthesis enzymes (e.g., acetyl-CoA carboxylase and glycerol transferase) (as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Vigeolas et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] mutated <italic>Chlorella sorokiniana</italic> by ultraviolet radiation, screened 2000 single plants after mutation by Nile red fluorescence method, and successfully selected 4 Chlorella mutants with increased oil content.

The research results of Prof. Cheng’s research group showed that the photosynthetic pigment enzymes and ATP synthase of the nuclear mutagenized strain increased by 6.8 times and 8.0 times, respectively, as compared to the conventional microalgal strains for CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, thus simultaneously increasing the growth, CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, and lipid accumulation rates of microalgal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A 15-fold activity up-regulation of key CO<sub>2</sub> fixation enzyme after gradient flue-gas-derived CO<sub>2</sub> domestication was recorded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This approach significantly improved the key enzyme activity and selectively enabled the promotion of elementary reactions of CO<sub>2</sub> fixation towards efficient C3 pathway rather than inefficient C4 pathway, thus addressing the issue of low catalytic activity of conventional biological enzymes. Ren et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] evaluated these studies and considered that a major breakthrough had been made in the transformation of microalgae strains to produce carbon dioxide and lipids by nuclear mutagenesis.

Because the energy density of lipids is twice as much as those of proteins and carbohydrates, the high energy barrier of direct conversion from CO<sub>2</sub> to lipid causes low reaction rate. The research of Heinz Kopetz showd that the catalytic reactions of direct conversion from CO<sub>2</sub> to lipids was key to lipid production in microalgae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, there is a conflict between microalgal CO<sub>2</sub> fixation and lipid accumulation. Most microalgal species start to accumulate significant amounts of lipid under stress or unfavorable growth conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Seo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] found that the lack of nitrogen salt in the solution would promote the synthesis and accumulation of oil in microalgae cells. However, nitrogen starvation significantly reduced the photosynthetic activities of algal cells and thus the overall productivity of algal biomass. Also, at the industrial level, nitrogen removal is time-consuming and costly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Therefore, researchers seeking a versatile alternative method for practical induction of lipid accumulation remain active in the field of microalgal biotechnology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Srivastava and Goud [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] investigated the effects of various salt stresses (NaCl, KCl, MgCl<sub>2</sub> and CaCl<sub>2</sub>) on lipid accumulation in both <italic>Chlorella.</italic> sorokiniana CG12 and Desmodesmus GS12 strains, and obtained significant enhancements of lipid contents, up to 40–45% (w/w) under optimal CaCl<sub>2</sub> conditions.

They observed a slight increase of <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> under TiO<sub>2</sub>/UV-A conditions, though a high dosage of TiO<sub>2</sub> (0.1 g/L) and 2-day incubation were required. Praveenkumar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] reported a new pressure-based stress method for induction of neutral lipid (e.g. TAG) of <italic>Chlorella</italic> spp. by 2 h treatment under mild pressurization conditions (10–15 bar). Compared with the untreated control, this method produced a 55% improvement.</p><p id="Par28">CO<sub>2</sub> is the only carbon source for photosynthetic autotrophic microalgae. When CO<sub>2</sub> concentration increases, the content of fatty acids in microalgae will increase, and the content of polyunsaturated fatty acids in eukaryotic algae cells will decrease. This is because the increase of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration will cause the excess of carbon source, which will cause the relative lack of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients, thus affecting the synthesis of enzymes related to extension reaction and desaturation reaction. Cheng et al. found that the content of oil in a single cell increases when nitrogen and phosphorus are deficient, and the decrease of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrient content in the solution would affect the synthesis of enzymes related to prolongation reaction and desaturation reaction, and finally reduce the content of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the oil components of microalgae cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].
