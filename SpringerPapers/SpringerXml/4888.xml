In this paper, an improved algorithm is called LINFO is proposed for modifying search ability of the original weIghted meaN oF vectOrs (INFO) algorithm as well as avoiding its weaknesses like trapping in a local optima. The improved algorithm's efficiency is confirmed by comparing its results with those obtained by the original INFO and other optimization techniques using different standard benchmark test functions. Moreover, this improved algorithm and the original version are applied for solving the EM problem with the aim of optimizing the operation cost of the MGs in the presence DRPs. They are used to solve day-ahead EM problem for optimal operation of renewable energy resources, the optimal generation from a conventional diesel engines (DEs); taking into account the participation of customers in DRP for minimizing MG operating cost, which includes the cost of DEs fuel and the power transactions cost with the main grid. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed LINFO, simulation results are compared with the results of well-known and newly developed optimization techniques.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Microgrid</kwd><kwd>Optimization</kwd><kwd>Energy management</kwd><kwd>Demand response</kwd><kwd>LINFO</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Egypt Japan University (E-JUST)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>30</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/521_2023_Article_8813.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Computer Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Artificial Intelligence</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Probability and Statistics in Computer Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Computational Science and Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Image Processing and Computer Vision</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Computational Biology/Bioinformatics</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Computer Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Motivation</title><p id="Par2">Increasing concern about global warming and depletion of fossil fuel sources have emphasized the importance of electricity generation from Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and the integration of Energy storage system with their high efficiency and stable operation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. So the integration of these RESs as sub-systems production or Distributed Generation (DG), which is known as Microgrids (MGs), into the main grid is essential for solving energy-related issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The advantages of incorporating RESs into the MG include lower operating costs, higher profitability for investors, reduced level of greenhouse gas emissions, and cheaper power obtained from the grid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">The MG has three distinct advantages: (1) Technical advantages, such as enhancing energy efficiency and increasing power system resilience; (2) Economic benefits, such as reducing fuel and interruption costs; and (3) Environmental benefits, such as reduced greenhouse gas emissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">EM in MG is considered as operation and planning stage, which is considered a cost-driven scheduling for MG sources, to supply load demand with maintaining some constraints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Moreover, with the advancements in smart grid technology, there has been a rise in the load demand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], thereby necessitating the implementation of an energy management system to ensure a balance between load and energy supply [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. As a result, there has been a significant research focus on MG Energy Management to achieve optimal operation of MGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Although peak hours are just a few hours per day, significant investment in generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure is necessary to supply peak demand. As a consequence, the cost of power supply increases. So, Demand Side Management programs (DSMP) are integrated into EM systems in MGs, which can enhance the load curve by allowing the interpolation of the customers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">These DSMP schemes can be categorized into two main groups energy efficiency and Demand Response Programs, with further sub-categories, incentive-based DR (IB-DR) and price-based DR(PB-DR), as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Categorization of demand side management techniques</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/521_2023_8813_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Related work</title><p id="Par7">In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a co-optimization technique for MG planning was developed to identify the appropriate sizing of DG sources while optimizing yearly fuel costs. To maximize solar-based MGs' techno-economic and environmental advantages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] presents a MG model that aims for maximum reliability. In Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], the authors suggested an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) technique for solving the EM and determining optimal scheduling for energy sources in the MG in order to lower the overall generation cost. Optimal scheduling for generation sources to get economic benefits of MG comprised of RESs and Energy storage system (ESS) is proposed using PSO in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and improved PSO in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] the optimal operation of MG based on Water Cycle Algorithm (wCA) is solved to minimizing the operating cost. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] a Mixed Integer Distributed Ant Colony Optimization is developed to solve the MG economic dispatch problem for cost minimization. According to the aforementioned works, the main research considered passive customers' participation in solving EM in MG. Implementing solutions to alleviate the network's demand side may help further optimize the Microgrid's EM problem.</p><p id="Par8">In literature, different types of DRPs have been discussed in order to optimize the MG operation. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] Used a hybrid augmented weighted ε-constraint technique and lexicographic optimization to solve optimal power flow in MG considering DR in a combined heat and power (CHP) system. Annual operating cost is minimized in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] while maximizing customer satisfaction. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], different types of DRP have been introduced and compared for Multi-Microgrid using linear programming with Mixed integer mathematical models. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], optimal scheduling for the MG with RES considering its stochastic nature and conventional generators has been presented. In addition, an IB-DR program has been used to minimize energy cost and ensure customers' benefits using the technique of weighted sum and the fuzzy satisfying method. An IB-DR for deterministic EM was proposed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] using Honey Badger Optimizer, and Probabilistic EM using Artificial Hummingbird Algorithm in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] A PB-DR is formulated in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] to minimize the cost of power losses in MG and in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] using PSO to maximize the customers’ profit. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] a multi-objective EM problem is solved based on Genetic algorithm (GA) using PB-DR to minimize the net present cost. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] a formulation for an IB-DR to minimize the generation cost and maximize the MG operator is proposed. While Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] solve the economic dispatch problem based on IB-DR using Genetic algorithm Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] a hybrid technique for EM is implemented based on Pelican Optimization Algorithm to solve the optimal operation and to reduce the demand during the peak periods. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] an IB-DR has been used for bi-level programing; in the upper-level based on unit commitment the marginal prices is achieved, and the cost is minimized in the lower-level. A multi-objective DR problem using α-constrained dominated differential evolution algorithm for reducing the customers’ bill and enhance the energy efficiency is proposed with integration of DR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">According to the above-mentioned researches, many optimization approaches have effectively handled the engineering problems, particularly those involving EM. The findings of these studies demonstrated the importance and potential for developing new and improved optimization approaches for solving specific EM problems; also According to the No-Free-Lunch (NFL) theorem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] there are either no metaheuristic optimization algorithms capable of solving all optimization problems. These two reasons motivate us to propose a new optimization technique, called Leader-based mutation-selection INFO (LINFO) based on the weIghted meaN oF vectOrs (INFO) algorithm to prevent the possibility to be trapped into local minima.

been proposed in order to solve the EM problems in MGs with DRP. The superiority of LINFO over the standard INFO algorithm, as well as other optimization techniques (e.g., BOA, TSA, and GWO) in terms of convergence curve, average fitness history, and search history is demonstrated using different bench functions. Also, a statistical analysis of the proposed LINFO technique and four optimization algorithms are compared for three unimodal, multimodal, and composite benchmarks, which demonstrate that LINFO has achieved the optimal solution for most of test functions. The proposed LINFO is used to operate the MG with minimum DEs generation cost and minimum cost of power transaction. Different optimization approaches were used to solve the energy management problem in MG over a period of 24 h in order to get optimal operation of MG sources. A comparison among the convergence characteristics of proposed LINFO algorithm and the original INFO algorithm prove the adequacy of the proposed LINFO in solving the EM problem with fast convergence. LINFO results are compared with well-known and new developed optimization techniques as PSO, JAYA, HBA, and INFO; the results demonstrated the robustness of the proposed algorithm to solve the EM problem in MG. to test system were simulated; in test system 101 KWh reduction in energy consumption, and 2677 MWh in the second test system. The results of two test systems for the EM problem under consideration have been described.</p><p id="Par72">In addition, the proposed LINFO algorithm can be used to solve an probabilistic EM problem. Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] proposed a cloud based infrastructure for handling the data of smart buildings in Nano- Microgrid. The dependent on the main grid is reduced in the peak hours. The proposed LINFO algorithm with the demand response, which is an ancillary service in the smart grid, can be employed to solve the EM in the cloud based nano-grid.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The icons used through this paper was developed by Freepik, AmethystDesign, Arkinasi, and Smashicons from <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.flaticon.com" ext-link-type="uri">www.flaticon.com</ext-link>.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>NA contributed to conceptualization, methodology, software; SK contributed to conceptualization, methodology, software; MHH contributed to conceptualization, software, writing—original draft preparation; SMA contributed to visualization, software, writing—original draft preparation.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Open access funding provided by The Science, Technology &amp; Innovation Funding Authority (STDF) in cooperation with The Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB).
