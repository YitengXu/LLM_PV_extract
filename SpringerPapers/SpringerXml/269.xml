Here, a plant-inspired adhesive hydrogel has been developed based on Ag-Lignin nanoparticles (NPs)triggered dynamic redox catechol chemistry. Ag-Lignin NPs construct the dynamic catechol redox system, which creates long-lasting reductive-oxidative environment inner hydrogel networks. This redox system, generating catechol groups continuously, endows the hydrogel with long-term and repeatable adhesiveness. Furthermore, Ag-Lignin NPs generate free radicals and trigger self-gelation of the hydrogel under ambient environment. This hydrogel presents high toughness for the existence of covalent and non-covalent interaction in the hydrogel networks. The hydrogel also possesses good cell affinity and high antibacterial activity due to the catechol groups and bactericidal ability of Ag-Lignin NPs. This study proposes a strategy to design tough and adhesive hydrogels based on dynamic plant catechol chemistry.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Biomimetic catechol-based adhesives have attracted significant interest but can lose adhesion due to excessive oxidation.

However, the poor mechanical properties of hydrogels have limited their application in biomedical engineering. Various approaches have been used to prepare hydrogels with excellent mechanical properties, such as nanocomposite hydrogels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, topological hydrogels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, and double-network hydrogels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. However, many tough hydrogels possess poor cell or tissue adhesion, which preclude the integration of the hydrogel with human tissues. Recently, adhesive hydrogels have been designed based on different mechanism. For example, an adhesive hydrogel consisting of an adhesive surface and an energy dissipative matrix has been prepared<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Another adhesive hydrogel tackified by a nucleobase exhibits good adhesive properties because the nucleobase forms adhesive interactions with various materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Sundew-inspired adhesive hydrogels have been developed because the hydrogel has a well-patterned scaffold structure similar to the structure of sundew mucilage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Recently, catechol chemistry has shed light on a method for preparing a hydrogel with good adhesiveness and super toughness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Mussel-inspired adhesive hydrogels with polydopamine (PDA) are typical examples of catechol-chemistry-based adhesive hydrogels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In these hydrogels, the catechol functional groups of PDA form covalent bonds/noncovalent bonds with different materials, and therefore these hydrogels exhibit good adhesion to various surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, pure PDA-functionalized hydrogels generally have poor mechanical properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and these adhesive hydrogels are not reusable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. This is because some of the catechol groups in the adhesive hydrogel are converted to quinone groups through oxidation. The catechol groups can form physical or chemical bonds with different surfaces and the quinone groups promote cohesion in the hydrogel. However, overoxidation of catechol groups cause loss of adhesiveness of the hydrogel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Actually, mussel retains its long-term adhesion because a reductive protein is continuously secreted in mussel footprints to maintain a dynamic balance between the quinone and catechol groups, which allows the retention of long-term adhesion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The adhesion properties of mussels inspired us to consider that controlling the oxidation degree of catechol groups is vital to maintaining the adhesive features of PDA-containing hydrogels. In our recent study, we controlled the oxidation process of the catechol groups and maintained the quantity of catechol groups in the hydrogel to obtain tough hydrogels with excellent repeatable and durable adhesiveness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Many plants have inherent adhesiveness because extracellular matrix of plants contain adhesive molecules, although plant-based adhesives are brittle and vulnerable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Lignin is the second-most abundant biopolymer originating from plants and has been widely used in biomedical engineering owing to its biocompatibility and environmental friendliness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Lignin possesses multiple functional groups such as reductive phenolic hydroxyls and methoxy groups, which can serve as reducing and stabilizing agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Lignin has been used as a phenolic resin adhesive because of the reactive functional groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. It should be noted that the lignin-based adhesiveness in most previous reports are short-term and non-repeatable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. The phenolic hydroxyls or methoxy groups on the lignin can be converted to redox-active quinone/hydroquinone, and consequently to semiquinone radicals by a comproportionation reaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. The phenol or methoxy groups in lignin can reduce silver ions (Ag<sup>+</sup>) to metallic silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, and these functional groups were oxidized to the corresponding quinone/hydroquinone in this process. Furthermore, the Ag NPs can form photogenerated electrons because of surface plasmon resonance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. In the presence of the photogenerated electron, the quinone/hydroquinone groups in lignin were converted into catechol groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. The previous studies inspired us to propose a long-lasting adhesive hydrogel based on plant catechol chemistry.</p><p id="Par6">Inspired by plants, a catechol-chemistry-based hydrogel with long-term adhesiveness, high toughness, and antibacterial ability is developed. The hydrogel is gelled from an aqueous precursor solution containing Ag-Lignin NPs, pectin, and acrylic acid (AA) under an ambient environment. Pectin and polyacrylic acid (PAA) forms an interpenetrating network with multi-crosslinking of covalent bonds and noncovalent bonds, which endows the hydrogel with excellent mechanical properties. The hydrogel displays long-term and repeatable adhesiveness because the Ag-Lignin NPs continuously generate the catechol groups in the inner hydrogel network. The hydrogel is spontaneously polymerized under room temperature conditions because Ag-Lignin NPs interact with ammonium persulfate (APS) to produce a large amount of free radicals and initiate the polymerization of the hydrogel. Consequently, ultraviolet (UV) or thermal treatment, which is harmful to cells/tissues, is avoided. Because of the convenient direct gelation, this plant catechol-chemistry-based adhesive and tough hydrogel is suitable for surgical operation or other biomedical applications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design rationale of the hydrogel</title><p id="Par7">The Ag-Lignin NPs-PAA-pectin hydrogel was prepared in two steps, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. First, Ag-Lignin NPs core-shell nanostructures were synthesized through a redox reaction between lignin and the [Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup> complex (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). During this process, the methoxyl and catechol groups of lignin are oxidized into quinone groups, as proved by cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Notes</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>). Second, AA monomers and pectin were mixed with the Ag-Lignin NPs suspension to form the Ag-Lignin NPs-PAA/pectin nanocomposite hydrogel owing to the Ag-Lignin NPs-triggered free-radical polymerization under an ambient environment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The Ag-Lignin NPs have the ability to realize the quinone-catechol reversible reaction, which endows the hydrogel with adhesiveness (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Design strategy for the plant-inspired catechol-chemistry-based self-adhesive, tough, and antibacterial NPs-P-PAA hydrogel. <bold>a</bold> Generation of radicals by the redox reaction between Ag-Lignin NPs and ammonium persulfate (APS), triggering the gelation of the hydrogel under an ambient environment. <bold>b</bold> Quinone-catechol reversible reaction maintains dynamic balance. <bold>c</bold> Scheme of molecular structure of plant-inspired adhesive and tough hydrogel. <bold>d</bold> Electron spin-resonance spectroscopy (ESR) spectra for quinone radical detection. <bold>e</bold> Transmission electron microscope (TEM) micrograph shows the core-shell structure of Ag-Lignin NPs; the inset is Ag element mapping. <bold>f</bold> High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) micrograph shows the structure of Ag-Lignin NPs; the inset is high-resolution lattice. <bold>g</bold> Scanning electron microscope (SEM) micrograph shows the microfibril structures in the hydrogel; the inset presents typical microfibrils.

Pectin is a heteropolysaccharide, and is the main component in the primary cell walls of plants. Pectin contains -OH and -COOH groups, which act as active sites for hydrogen bonds or ionic bonds. These pectin functional groups provide selective and strong bonding with certain substances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Moreover, pectin improved the biocompatibility and also interpenetrated into the PAA network to make the hydrogel tougher and more flexible (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Lignin formed Ag-Lignin NPs to create a redox environment inside the hydrogel network, which was the key factor for the preparation of such a multifunctional hydrogel. First, Ag-Lignin NPs can construct the dynamic catechol redox system inner hydrogel network, which mimics the long-lasting reductive/oxidative environment in mussel footprint and continuously generates catechol groups, and therefore endows the hydrogel with repeatable and long-lasting adhesion ability. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, the quinone-catechol reversible reaction of Ag-Lignin NPs maintains a dynamic balance inside the aqueous hydrogel network with the assistance of free electrons from surface plasmon resonance of Ag NPs (Supplementary Notes <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref> and Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>) and the H<sup>+</sup> from ionization of PAA, which continuously replenishes the catechol and quinone groups in the hydrogel. Second, Ag-Lignin NPs generate free radicals that trigger self-gelation of the hydrogel. Therefore, the hydrogel was able to cure under an ambient environment. As shown in Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>, under an alkaline environment, the functional groups, such as -OCH<sub>3</sub> or -OH on lignin, are oxidized by silver ions to quinone/semiquinone free radicals. After the addition of APS, large amounts of free radicals are continuously generated to initiate steady free-radical polymerization (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Therefore, UV irradiation or thermal initiation with toxic auxiliary agents, such as tetramethylethylenediamine, was avoided during hydrogel gelation. Finally, the functional groups of Ag-Lignin NPs form noncovalent interaction with the PAA and pectin, and therefore the NPs work as nano-reinforcement to improve the mechanical properties of the hydrogel (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">To further investigate the mechanism of the free radical generated by Ag-Lignin NPs, electron spin-resonance spectroscopy (ESR) was used to characterize free radicals in various solutions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>, Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). The ESR spectrum of the Ag-Lignin NPs with APS contained a signal with a <italic>g</italic> value of 2.0034, which was attributed to quinone/semiquinone radicals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. The ESR spectrum of the pure lignin/APS solution exhibited the same peak with a lower intensity, which indicated that the quantity of the quinone/semiquinone radicals was much smaller (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). These results demonstrated that pure lignin or APS solution can generate free radicals, but the quantity of free radicals in the solution is not enough to trigger free-radical polymerization. Thus, only the Ag-Lignin NPs-APS solution can generate enough radicals to trigger the self-polymerization of the hydrogel under an ambient environment, whereas lignin or APS alone did not (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>). Furthermore, Ag-Lignin NPs-APS solution can initiate the polymerization of other free-radical monomers, such as AA, acrylamide, and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>).</p><p id="Par10">Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) micrographs revealed that the Ag-Lignin NPs formed clusters with core-shell structures (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e, f</xref> and Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). The DLS analysis showed that the average size of the Ag-Lignin NPs was 125∼145 nm (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). After incorporation in the hydrogel, the Ag-Lignin NPs were well dispersed in the network (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>). The distribution of the Ag-Lignin NPs in the hydrogel was also revealed by element mapping of Ag, and the results indicated that Ag was distributed uniformly inside the hydrogel (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">17</xref>). With the presence of catechol groups of Ag-Lignin NPs, the freeze-dried hydrogel exhibited an interwoven microfibril structure. The microfibrils were a distinctive feature that only present in the NPs-P-PAA hydrogel, but not in pure PAA and P-PAA hydrogels (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">16a, b</xref>). The microfibrils were formed by the interactions between polymer chains and NPs because catechol groups of Ag-Lignin NPs can form intermolecular interactions with the polymer chains and generate nanostructured morphologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Dynamic reductive/oxidative reaction in the NPs-P-PAA hydrogel</title><p id="Par11">The redox environment inner the NPs-P-PAA hydrogel was investigated by XPS analysis and CV experiments (Supplementary Notes <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14</xref>). XPS analysis was used to investigate changes in the content of catechol group during the redox reaction. The XPS results indicated that lignin had high contents of C-O and C-OH groups at 285.9 eV and a low content of C = O at 288.6 eV. For the Ag-Lignin NPs, the C 1<italic>s</italic> spectrum showed that the contents of C-O and C-OH groups sharply decreased and the content of C = O groups greatly increased (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>). These changes were evidence of oxidation and the associated reaction between lignin and [Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>. In the NPs-P-PAA hydrogel, both C-O(C-OH) and C = O appeared, which indicated that C-O or C-OH (catechol) groups were present in the NPs-P-PAA hydrogel (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>). CV experiments were conducted to investigate the redox reaction in the NPs-P-PAA hydrogel system. The curves of CV scanning presented a prominent redox peak at 0.10∼0.20 V (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13a</xref>), which corresponded to catechol oxidation and quinone reduction that occurred at the same potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.

In short, both the results of XPS analysis and CV experiments prove that redox exchange occurs in the hydrogel. Furthermore, the antioxidative abilities of the hydrogels were tested by measuring their capacities to scavenge α, α-diphenyl-β-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radicals, and the results indicate that both the NPs and NPs-P-PAA hydrogels have high reduction abilities (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>, and Supplementary Notes <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">15</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Mechanical properties</title><p id="Par12">The NPs-P-PAA hydrogel was resilient, stretchable, and tough. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, the hydrogel was stretched to 26 times its initial length. The load–unload tensile stress–strain curves proved it as well (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). It also withstood a high compression to complete deformation and did not break; after the compressive load was removed, the hydrogel recovered automatically and rapidly to its initial shape (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). The load–unload compression stress–strain curves indicated that the NPs-P-PAA hydrogel have good recoverability (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> and Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">19</xref>). Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref> shows the typical tensile stress–strain curves of the hydrogels under tensile tests. The maximum tensile strain increased with the content of NPs and reached a maximum value of 2660% at the 0.03 NPs, much higher than that of the P-PAA hydrogel (860%), and in sharp contrast to that of the PAA hydrogel (380%). The strength and ductility product of various hydrogels was also measured and the 0.03 NPs-P-PAA hydrogel exhibited the highest value (300 MPa%) shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>. The fracture energy showed a similar trend, as demonstrated by the single edge notched tests (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>). A maximum fracture energy of 5500 J m<sup>−2</sup> was achieved at 0.03 NPs, which was much larger than that of human skin (∼2000 J m<sup>−2</sup>). The high toughness and good resilience of the hydrogel was attributed to two factors. First, pectin interpenetrated the PAA networks and strengthened the hydrogel. Second, the Ag-Lignin NPs, PAA, and pectin had noncovalent interactions between each other, which dissipated energy under large deformation and improved the mechanical properties of the hydrogel. Third, the Ag-Lignin NPs have many hydrophilic functional groups, and therefore can be well dispersed in the hydrogel. Thus, the mechanical properties of the hydrogel were improved because of the nano-reinforcement effects of the NPs. As a control, pure lignin was incorporated in the L-P-PAA hydrogel, and the tensile strength of the L-P-PAA hydrogel was lower than those of the PAA, P-PAA, and 0.03 NPs-P-PAA hydrogels. This is because lignin has many hydrophobic methoxy groups and therefore cannot be uniformly distributed in the hydrogel, demonstrating that bare lignin cannot improve the mechanical properties of the hydrogel (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">18</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Mechanical properties of the hydrogels. <bold>a</bold> The 0.03 NPs-P-PAA hydrogel was elongated to 26 times its initial length and recovered in 2 min. <bold>b</bold> Tensile loading–unloading curves of 0.03 NPs-P-PAA hydrogel. <bold>c</bold> The 0.03 NPs-P-PAA hydrogel was compressed and recovered in 2 min. <bold>d</bold> Compressive loading–unloading curves of 0.03 NPs-P-PAA hydrogel. <bold>e</bold> Typical tensile stress–strain curves of the hydrogel. <bold>f</bold> Strength and ductility product of various hydrogels. <bold>g</bold> Fracture energy of the hydrogels.

The adhesive hydrogels also had high adhesiveness to biological tissue, including heart, lung, kidney, spleen, liver, bone, and muscle, which is crucial for biomedical applications (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). The hydrogel exhibited excellent adhesive performance on the skin surface of the author’s body and was peeled off without any residue and anaphylactic reaction (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>).

First, the carboxyl groups of PAA can interact with various surfaces through electrostatic interactions. Second, Ag-Lignin NPs generate catechol and quinone groups during the redox reaction, which endows the hydrogel with adhesiveness. Quinone groups form physical crosslinking with the pectin and PAA, which can dramatically enhance the cohesion of the hydrogel. Catechol groups possess strong adhesion to various substrates, which interact with different substrates through covalent and noncovalent bonding (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). Covalent bonding was formed at some specific substrates containing amine or thiol groups through Schiff base or Michael addition reactions; noncovalent bonding, such as hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, and metal coordination or chelating, could also exist between hydrogels and solid surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Two types of hydrogels were tested to investigate the synergistic effects of the carboxyl groups of PAA and catechol groups of the Ag-Lignin NPs on the adhesiveness of the hydrogel.

Compared with the commonly used adhesives, this hydrogel had the following advantages. First, the gelation of the hydrogel was triggered by radically enriched Ag-Lignin NPs without the need for UV and thermal treatment. Therefore, the hydrogel was biocompatible and not harmful to skin tissue. Second, the hydrogels displayed durable adhesiveness and maintained their adhesiveness for a long time. Third, the plant-inspired Ag-Lignin NPs hydrogel exhibited good cell affinity and tissue adhesiveness. Finally, the hydrogel has the ability of anti-infection, which is particularly suitable for skin wound repair.
