Incorporation of 1.67 mol% of 2D phenylethylammonium lead iodide into the precursor solution enables the formation of phase-pure formamidinium perovskite with an order of magnitude enhanced photoluminescence lifetime.

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Tremendous attention has been focused on hybrid perovskites (PVSK) since the first development of the solid-state PVSK solar cell in 2012<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Rapid progress in power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been achieved via compositional and process engineering. As of 2017, the state-of-the-art PVSK solar cell achieved a certified PCE of 22.7%, which is on par with well-established silicon solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Typical PVSK absorbers employ 3D ABX<sub>3</sub> structures, where a monovalent ‘A-site’ cation in the cubo-octahedral site bonds with the BX<sub>6</sub> octahedra. Compositional engineering has been considered an important approach to enhance the stability and performance of PVSK solar cells. Important milestones have been achieved through compositional engineering. For example, incorporation of the formamidinium (FA) cation into the ‘A-site’ has enabled the formation of a cubic FAPbI<sub>3</sub> phase with a lower bandgap (<italic>E</italic><sub>g</sub>) of 1.48 eV, higher absorption coefficient and longer carrier diffusion lengths than methylammonium (MA)-based tetragonal MAPbI<sub>3</sub> (<italic>E</italic><sub>g</sub> = 1.57 eV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, FAPbI<sub>3</sub> has poor ambient stability because its non-PVSK hexagonal phase is thermodynamically more favorable than the cubic phase at room temperature. Partial substitution of FA and I with MA and/or Br has enabled fabrication of phase-pure FAPbI<sub>3</sub> with improved performance and stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Recently, incorporation of smaller inorganic ‘A’ cations, such as Cs and Rb, has further improved the stability and PCE of the PVSK solar cells with the lowest open-circuit voltage (<italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub>) deficit of 0.39 V<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. As a result, typical high efficiency devices nowadays incorporate PVSK with FA, MA, Cs, Rb, and Br having relatively larger <italic>E</italic><sub>g</sub> than 1.60 eV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. However, such compositional engineering has enhanced the <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> and stability at the expense of short-circuit current density (<italic>J</italic><sub>SC</sub>) due to increased <italic>E</italic><sub>g</sub>. Utilization of pure FAPbI<sub>3</sub> is desired in regards to its lower <italic>E</italic><sub>g</sub>, which is close to the optimum value for a single junction solar cell suggested by the detailed balance limit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. However, no efficient method has been developed so far to fabricate a high quality phase-pure FAPbI<sub>3</sub> film and device.</p><p id="Par5">Recently, the manipulation of surface energy has been proposed as a means to stabilize metastable PVSK phases such as CsPbI<sub>3</sub> and FAPbI<sub>3</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Swarnkar et al. reported ambient stable α-CsPbI<sub>3</sub> in the form of a colloidal quantum dot, in which the contribution of surface energy significantly increases due to the high surface-to-volume ratio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Very recently, Fu et al. reported that the cubic FAPbI<sub>3</sub> phase can be stabilized by functionalizing the surface with large-sized organic molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. They demonstrated that the functionalized surface contributes to lower formation energy to stabilize the cubic FAPbI<sub>3</sub> phase at room temperature. However, the steady-state PCE was as low as 14.5%. Several attempts have been made to utilize such approach, where impressive improvements in performance and stability have been demonstrated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. However, their performance and stability are still relatively poor comparing with those of MAPbI<sub>3</sub> or mixed-cation-halide PVSK solar cells.</p><p id="Par6">Here we report a method to fabricate high-quality stable FAPbI<sub>3</sub> PVSK films using 2D PVSK. Incorporation of 2D phenylethylammonium lead iodide (PEA<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub>) PVSK into precursor solution enables the formation of phase-pure FAPbI<sub>3</sub> films with a tenfold enhancement in photoluminescence (PL) lifetime. The 2D PVSK is spontaneously formed at the grain boundaries of FAPbI<sub>3</sub> to protects the FAPbI<sub>3</sub> from moisture and assists in charge separation/collection. Thanks to the superior optoelectronic quality, we were able to fabricate a PVSK solar cell with a stabilized efficiency of 20.64% (certified stabilized efficiency of 19.77%). Notably, the PVSK solar cell shows a peak <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> of 1.130 V, corresponding to a loss-in-potential of 0.35 V considering the <italic>E</italic><sub>g</sub> of 1.48 eV versus 0.39 V for mixed-cation-halide perovskite solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the device demonstrates significantly enhanced ambient and operational stability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Effects of 2D perovskite on phase purity of FAPbI<sub>3</sub></title><p id="Par7">FAPbI<sub>3</sub> films were prepared by the modified adduct method, in which N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) was used as a Lewis base<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. To the PVSK precursor solution, 2D PVSK (PEA<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub>) precursors with different molar ratios ranging from 1.25 to 10 mol% were added. The steady-state PL spectra of the films were measured and are shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>. As seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>, we observed no obvious changes in PL peak position until the amount of 2D PVSK reached 10 mol%. With 10 mol% PVSK, the PL peak was blue-shifted by 6 nm. The blueshift of the PL peak might be due to formation of a quasi-3D PVSK, where charge carriers are confined by large potential barrier originated from the 2D PVSK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Based on this observation, we presume the added 2D PVSK does not result in the formation of the quasi-3D PVSK if it remains below a certain threshold. This threshold was found to be lower than 10 mol%, where this quantity was then optimized based on photovoltaic performance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). A planar heterojunction architecture consisting of Indium doped SnO<sub>2</sub> (ITO) glass/compact-SnO<sub>2</sub>/PVSK/spiro-MeOTAD/Ag or Au was utilized for construction of PVSK solar cells in this study (cross-sectional scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images of the device are shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). The addition of 1.67 mol% 2D PVSK was found to be optimal for the photovoltaic performance (ca. 11% improvement in PCE). Notably, addition of 10 mol% 2D PVSK significantly degraded the PCE to lower than 1%, which might result from formation of quasi-3D PVSK as the large potential barrier originating from 2D PVSK could hinder the charge transport.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Crystallographic and absorption properties. <bold>a</bold> Peak position for steady-state photolumimescence (PL) spectrum and normalized power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices for FAPbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite with different amount of added 2D PEA<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> perovskite.

As can be seen, the bare FAPbI<sub>3</sub> film contains hexagonal non-PVSK phase (δ-phase) while the PVSK film prepared with 1.67 mol% PEA<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> shows pure PVSK phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Even smaller amount of 2D PVSK (1.25 mol% PEA<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub>) effectively suppresses the formation of δ-phase (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). Furthermore, the overall signal intensity and full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) were enhanced with the addition of the 2D PVSK, indicating improved crystallinity. We speculate that the added large phenylethylammonium molecules from 2D PVSK precursors interact with FAPbI<sub>3</sub> crystals to facilitate formation of the cubic PVSK phase during crystallization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Such a speculation is correlated with the observation in the XRD measurements in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>, in which the signal intensity and FWHM of XRD peaks are systematically enhanced with increased amounts of the added 2D PVSK (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). The enhancement of preferred orientation along the (001) plane with increased 2D PVSK also indicates the added precursors of the 2D PVSK functionalize the specific crystal facet to change the surface energy during the crystal growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. A closer inspection on the normalized X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the PVSK films with different amounts of added 2D PVSK (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>) was taken to find any correlations between the added 2D PVSK and crystal structure of FAPbI<sub>3</sub>. Interestingly, a systematic change in peak position was observed with different amounts of 2D PVSK for which the XRD peaks were slightly shifted toward higher angles with the addition of relatively smaller amounts of 2D PVSK (1.25, 1.67, 2.50, and 5.0 mol%). This indicates that the lattice constant of FAPbI<sub>3</sub> is reduced, likely due to compressive strain associated with the added 2D PVSK. We speculate that the reduction in lattice constant can be also related to the enhanced phase purity of cubic FAPbI<sub>3</sub> as it will have equivalent effects with incorporation of smaller ‘A’ site cations on the tolerance factor and thus enthalpy of formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Lower angle peaks at around 12° appear upon addition of 10 mol% 2D PVSK corresponding to the formation of quasi-3D PVSK (inset of Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4f</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.

The absorption onset is complemented by almost identical normalized PL spectra, which indicates that the E<sub>g</sub> was maintained. The enhanced absorption as seen when the 2D PVSK was added is probably due to an enhanced phase purity of the FAPbI<sub>3</sub>, with partial contribution from an enhanced light scattering owing to the improved crystallinity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The absorption spectra with different amounts of 2D PVSK are demonstrated in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>. While all the PVSK films with 2D PVSK showed enhanced absorption compared to bare FAPbI<sub>3</sub> films, a slight blueshift of the absorption onset with decreases in absorption over the whole-wavelength region was identified with the addition of 10 mol% of 2D PVSK, which is correlated with the blueshift of the steady-state PL spectrum that can be associated with the formation of quasi-3D PVSK.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Photoluminescence properties and photovoltaic performance</title><p id="Par9">Steady-state and time-resolved PL profiles were investigated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>. The steady-state PL intensity was largely enhanced more than five times from 4.3 ×10<sup>5</sup> to 2.3 × 10<sup>6</sup> with addition of 1.67 mol% PEA<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> into FAPbI<sub>3</sub> film (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). The large enhancement of PL intensity was attributed to a significantly elongated PL lifetime as seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>. The time resolved PL profiles were fitted to exponential decay, in which bi- and tri-exponential decay models were used for the bare and 2D PVSK incorporated PVSK films, respectively (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). The relatively fast decay component (<italic>τ</italic><sub>1</sub> around 3 ns) was assigned to charge carrier trapping induced by trap states formed due to the structural disorder such as vacancy or interstitial defects while much slower components (<italic>τ</italic><sub>2</sub>, <italic>τ</italic><sub>3</sub>) were assigned to free carrier radiative recombination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. With addition of 1.67 mol% 2D PVSK, proportion of the fast decay component (<italic>τ</italic><sub>1</sub>) was decreased (from 51.8% to 46.5%) while <italic>τ</italic><sub>2</sub> significantly elongated from 78.5 ns to 148.7 ns, which indicates reduced defect density and enhanced charge carrier lifetime. We attributed such improvements to enhanced phase purity and crystallinity of FAPbI<sub>3</sub> as observed from XRD measurements (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), which decreases the structural disorders at grain interiors and/or boundaries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Moreover, a new decay component (<italic>τ</italic><sub>3</sub>) with a significantly long lifetime (&gt;1 μs) appeared after addition of the 2D PVSK, which is likely related to the added 2D PVSK. As a result, the average PL lifetime was enhanced by almost one order of magnitude from 39.4 to 376.9 ns with addition of 2D PVSK. During the optimization of the device, incorporation of 2 mol% Cs was found to further enhance the performance and reproducibility of the devices without a noticeable change in <italic>E</italic><sub>g</sub> (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref>, see Supplementary Notes <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref> for additional discussion on the optimization process and impacts of 2 mol% Cs).

Consequently, the steady-state PL intensity and average PL lifetime was further enhanced, rationalizing the improved PCE with 2 mol% Cs (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). It is worth noting that the PL lifetime was significantly reduced with 10 mol% of 2D PVSK due to formation of quasi-3D PVSK (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Photoluminescence properties and photovoltaic performance. <bold>a</bold> Steady-state and <bold>b</bold> time resolved PL spectra of the perovskite films incorporating bare FAPbI<sub>3</sub>, FAPbI<sub>3</sub> with 2D perovskite and FA<sub>0.98</sub>Cs<sub>0.02</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> with 2D perovskite.

A stabilized PCE of 20.64% was achieved with the target device while that of control device was 15.80% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>).

The relatively large discrepancy from the control FAPbI<sub>3</sub> device is probably due to a more pronounced hysteresis, as seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>, which also results in a large discrepancy between the stabilized PCE and the PCE measured from the <italic>J</italic>–<italic>V</italic> scan. The performance of control device was highly reproducible. With optimized process parameters, the average PCE of 20.05 ± 0.45% was demonstrated over 74 devices (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">15</xref>). We obtained the peak <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> of 1.130 V with the target device (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">16</xref>) corresponding to a loss-in-potential of 0.35 V considering a <italic>E</italic><sub>g</sub> of 1.48 eV, which is the lowest <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> deficit reported to date for PVSK solar cells.

The phase transformation is even accelerated under high-relative humidity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. To evaluate the effects of 2D PVSK incorporation on phase stability, we investigated changes in absorbance of the film under relative humidity (RH) of 80 ± 5%. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> shows photos of the PVSK film stored for different time. Bare FAPbI<sub>3</sub> film was almost completely bleached within 24 h whereas no obvious change in color was observed from the films containing 2D PVSK both with and without Cs. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> demonstrates the absorbance (at 600 nm) of the FAPbI<sub>3</sub> films with and without 2D PVSK as a function of exposure time (individual absorption spectra can be found in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">20</xref>). The absorbance of the bare FAPbI<sub>3</sub> rapidly degraded during 24 h, while FAPbI<sub>3</sub> films with 2D PVSK did not show noticeable degradation within 24 h. With addition of 2 mol% Cs, the film also remained stable after 24 h. The color change of the bare FAPbI<sub>3</sub> film under high RH is due to its transformation to the δ-phase as can be seen in XRD spectra in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">21a</xref> whereas no detectable change in color for the films with 2D PVSK is correlated with their neat XRD spectra without the δ-phase (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">21b</xref>, c). The enhanced phase stability under high RH implies that the possible ingression pathway of moisture in the PVSK film is passivated.

However, the enhanced moisture stability throughout the whole-film implies that the 2D PVSK probably exist along the grain boundaries. To confirm our assumption, transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images of the FAPbI<sub>3</sub> film with 2D PVSK was analyzed in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c–e</xref>. The inset of Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> shows a chunk of the polycrystalline film scratched off from the substrate.

Since the 2D PEA<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> PVSK with aromatic rings and longer alkyl chains is expected to be more resistant to moisture, it protects the defective grain boundaries of 3D PVSK, resulting in significantly enhanced moisture stability of the film. Regardless of the improved stability, however, one can expect degraded electronic properties of the film due to the poor charge carrier mobility of the 2D PVSK. We investigated the band structure of FA<sub>0.98</sub>Cs<sub>0.02</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> (with 1.67 mol% of 2D PVSK) and PEA<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> PVSK, which is illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>.

Thus, analogous advantages of 2D PVSK at grain boundaries can be expected. Conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) was performed in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c–f</xref> to see spatially resolved electrical properties of the films. Under ambient light conditions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c, d</xref>), current flow in the PVSK film with 2D PVSK was higher at/near the grain boundaries while relatively uniform current flow was observed in the bare FAPbI<sub>3</sub> film. With light illumination (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e, f</xref>), the current flow was further enhanced at/near the grain boundaries with 2D PVSK whereas current flow in bare FAPbI<sub>3</sub> film was uniformly increased, which indicates charge separation and collection of photo-generated electrons is facilitated more so at grain boundaries with 2D PVSK.

With bare FAPbI<sub>3</sub> PVSK, exponential enhancement in conductivity was clearly identified at around 130 K (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>), which is attributed to contribution of ions. The <italic>E</italic><sub>a</sub> for bare FAPbI<sub>3</sub> film was calculated to be 0.16 eV, indicating significant contribution of activated ions at room temperature, which might cause degradation of the material and device under operational condition with built-in electric field. The pronounced current–voltage hysteresis behavior was observed even at very low temperature (180 K, Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). In case of the PVSK film with 2D PVSK, the film did not show noticeable enhancement in conductivity with increased temperature; although, the overall conductivity was relativity lower than the bare FAPbI<sub>3</sub> film (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). Even with moderate light illumination, it does not show the indicative of activated ions. As a result, the current–voltage curve did not show any hysteresis behavior (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>). As the grain boundaries of 3D perovskite were reported to be a major pathway for the migration of ions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, passivating the grain boundaries by incorporation of the ion-migration-immune 2D PVSK likely suppressed overall ion migration in the target device<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. In addition, the improved phase purity of the film might also partially contribute to the suppressed ion migration because the secondary phase can generate defect sites that can act as an additional pathway for ion migration.

The large phenylethylammonium molecules from 2D PVSK precursors interact with FAPbI<sub>3</sub> crystals to facilitate formation of the cubic PVSK phase during crystallization, which subsequently functionalize the grain boundaries after completion of the crystallization. The resulting phase-pure PVSK film has an identical <italic>E</italic><sub>g</sub> (1.48 eV) to that of pure FAPbI<sub>3</sub> with an order of magnitude enhanced PL lifetime. Average PCE of 20.05 ± 0.45% over 74 devices and the highest stabilized PCE of 20.64% (certified stabilized PCE of 19.77%) was achieved. Regardless of its low <italic>E</italic><sub>g</sub>, the PVSK solar cell showed the peak <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> of 1.130 V, corresponding to the lowest loss-in-potential of 0.35 V among all the reported PVSK solar cells. Owed to the functionalized grain boundaries by the 2D PVSK, the phase stability of the film under high RH significantly improved and migration of ions (or charged defects) was suppressed, resulting in significantly improved ambient and operational stability of the device. We believe our approach to utilize spontaneously formed grain boundary 2D PVSK will provide important insights for the research community to design PVSK materials to achieve record PCEs accompanied by high stability and longevity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Synthesis of phenylethylammonium iodide</title><p id="Par16">In a typical synthesis, 4.8 g of phenethylamine (39.6 mmol, Aldrich, &gt;99%) was dissolved in 15 mL of ethanol and placed in iced bath.

A 640 nm monochromatic laser was used as an excitation fluorescence source. Time resolved PL decay profiles were obtained using a Picoharp 300 with time-correlated single-photon counting capabilities. The films were excited by a 640 nm pulse laser with a repetition frequency of 100 kHz provided by a picosecond laser diode head (PLD 800B, PicoQuant).

Conductive atomic force microscopic (AFM) measurement was performed by Bruker Dimension Icon Scanning Probe Microscope equipped with TUNA application module. The TUNA module provides ultra-high tunneling current sensitivity (&lt;1 pA) with high-lateral resolution. Antomony doped Si tip (0.01–0.025 Ohm-cm) coated with 20 nm Pt-Ir was used as a probe. To avoid the electrically driven degradation during the measurement, low bias voltage (100 mV) was applied. The measurement was carried out under either room right or low intensity light illumination provided by AFM setup. The temperature-dependent conductivity measurement was carried out using a commercial probe station (Lakeshore, TTP4) in which temperature of the device was controlled by thermoelectric plate and flow of liquid nitrogen.

All the devices were measured without pre-conditioning such as light-soaking and applied bias voltage. Steady-state power conversion efficiency was calculated by measuring stabilized photocurrent density under constant bias voltage. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using specially designed system (Enli tech) under AC mode (frequency = 133 Hz) without bias light. For electroluminescence measurement, a Keithley 2400 source meter and silicon photodiode (Hamamatsu S1133-14, Japan) were used to measure Current–voltage–luminance characteristics of PVSK solar cells.
