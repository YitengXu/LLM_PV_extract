It is challenging, however, to realize a single material that is simultaneously endowed with both NIR emitting and sonodynamic activities. Herein, we report the design of a class of NIR-emitting sonosensitizers from a NIR phosphorescent carbon dot (CD) material with a narrow bandgap (1.62 eV) and long-lived excited triplet states (11.4 μs), two of which can enhance SDT as thermodynamically and dynamically favorable factors under low-intensity ultrasound irradiation, respectively. The NIR-phosphorescent CDs are identified as bipolar quantum dots containing both p- and n-type surface functionalization regions that can drive spatial separation of e<sup>−</sup>–h<sup>+</sup> pairs and fast transfer to reaction sites. Importantly, the cancer-specific targeting and high-level intratumor enrichment of the theranostic CDs are achieved by cancer cell membrane encapsulation for precision SDT with complete eradication of solid tumors by single injection and single irradiation. These results will open up a promising approach to engineer phosphorescent materials with long-lived triplet excited states for sonodynamic precision tumor therapy.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Combining sonodynamic properties and NIR fluorescence into a single material is desired for deep tissue applications.

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Sonodynamic therapy (SDT), which utilizes low-intensity ultrasound (US) and crucial sonosensitizers to generate highly cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) for inducing tumor cell apoptosis, has recently been highlighted as a promising non-invasive therapeutic modality, because of remarkable therapeutic advantages in extending tissue-penetration deepness and reducing side effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. A variety of sonosensitizers have been developed from organic compounds and metal-based inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) for enhanced SDT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Albeit encouraging progress in the emerging SDT filed, low-yield ROS generation from sonosensitizers presents a major limitation in clinical transformation. It is thus of critical importance to manipulate thermodynamic and dynamical factors that promote the high-yield ROS generation of semiconductor sonosensitizers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. A narrow bandgap of a sonosensitizer is a beneficial thermodynamic factor because minimal energy is required to drive the generation of electron−hole (e<sup>−</sup>–h<sup>+</sup>) pairs in low-intensity US settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The extended excited-state lifetime of a sonosensitizer is a favorable dynamical factor because long-lived charge carriers can participate in catalytic reactions with high probability before e<sup>−</sup>–h<sup>+</sup> pair recombination. Based on these considerations, it is a rationale for fabrication of a high-efficacy sonosensitizer that should be endowed with a narrow bandgap and an extended carrier lifetime for effective excitation, separation, and catalytic reactions of charge carriers. Nevertheless, canonical semiconductor sonosensitizers are based on titanium dioxide with a wide bandgap (&gt;3 eV) and a short carrier lifetime (50 ns)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">With the advent of precision medicine, increasing interest focuses on the development of theranostic nanomedicines for precision cancer therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Towards this objective, theranostic sonosensitizers with combined sonodynamic and imaging modes are required for imaging guided SDT to determine the optimal SDT window<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Generally, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent dyes are employed to label sonosensitizers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. However, dye labeling is limited by insufficient photostability, systemic toxicity, and increased fabrication costs. Moreover, typical NIR-fluorescent dyes such as Cy5.5 and indocyanine green (ICG) exhibit no or poor SDT performance owing to rapid e<sup>−</sup>–h<sup>+</sup> recombination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Alternatively, NIR-fluorescent semiconductor quantum dots could be stable fluorescence probes, but their time-resolved PL spectra also exhibit high e<sup>−</sup>–h<sup>+</sup> pair recombination rates with a typical carrier lifetime in the range of a few ns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, leading to deactivation of intrinsic sonocatalytic activity. Currently, phosphorescent materials with afterglow emission at room temperature from long-lived excited triplet states have received increasing interest for applications in optoelectronic devices, data security, and time-resolved bioimaging with minimal background interference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Notably, electrons in excited triplet states are highly reactive with O<sub>2</sub> molecules, a typical triplet-state quencher, to generate highly cytotoxic <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. As a consequence, phosphorescent materials, in particular, NIR-phosphorescent materials, could be specially designed as enhanced sonosensitizers owing to their ultralong carrier lifetimes and narrow bandgaps. To date, typical NIR-phosphorescent materials have been prepared from transition-metal (Re, Ru, Os, Ir, Pt, Pd, and Au) complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, which present limimiations to clinical applications owing to high metal toxicity as well as high costs. In such a scenario, the synthesis of NIR-phosphorescent materials from metal-free materials with excellent biocompatibility and low costs would be a groundbreaking tactic for the exploration of their phosphorescence imaging and SDT performance.</p><p id="Par5">Herein, we report the ‘phosphorescent sonosensitizer’ concept as a class of theranostic platforms for NIR imaging guided sonodynamic therapy using multifunctional carbon dots (CDs) with an ingenious p–n junction and a greatly narrow bandgap for enhanced charge separation dynamics and NIR excitation/emission as the paragon (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). These distinct electronic structures endowed CDs with carrier excitation at low energy, charge separation at high efficiency, and great potential for many modern technologies, including LEDs, solar cells, photocatalytic agents, bioimaging, SDT, and PDT. We have developed a one-step synthetic strategy (microwave synthesis) for controlled synthesis of CDs with the conductivity types of CDs (p–, n–, and p–n junction) facilely engineered by sulfonic acceptors and/or N donators. Compared with previously reported preparation of p–n junction CDs involving complex post-treatments and long-time consumption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, our one-step and high-efficiency method is suitable for low-cost production. Interestingly, we found that the p–n junction CDs (p–n-CDs) possessed bright long-lived (11.4 μs) phosphorescence rather than widely reported short-lived (ns) fluorescence from CDs or graphene quantum dots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Although they were dispersed in aqueous solutions or physiological media, they exhibited afterglow emission at room temperature without the need for stabilizing agents such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) or other matrices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Moreover, they can emit NIR phosphorescence at 760 nm with phosphorescent efficiency as high as 17.6% as a result of the synergistic effects of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating modifications on the electronic structure. We also found that the p–n junction CDs exhibited enhanced <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> generation efficiency under US irradiation through three enhancement mechanisms: (1) highly effective inhibition of the e<sup>−</sup>–h<sup>+</sup> pair recombination through the p–n junction, (2) long-lived triplet-state mediated <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> generation, (3) GSH depletion using overexpressed GSH as a hole sacrificial agent. Finally, we constructed a CD-based theranostic platform (p–n-CD@CCM) for NIR imaging guided sonodynamic therapy using cancer cell membrane (CCM) as the targeting agent and delivery system to overcome the in vivo limitations by free-standing CDs, such as rapid renal clearance owing to the ultrafine size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Given the NIR imaging capability, excellent biocompatibility, enhanced US-mediated <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> generation efficiency of p–n-CDs as well as the CCM targeting capability, we showed complete eradication of solid tumors by single injection and single irradiation. Our results will open up a promising approach to engineer phosphorescent materials with NIR emission and long-lived triplet excited states for wide-range applications apart from sonodynamic precision tumor therapy.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Design and mechanism of p–n-CD@CCM for sonodynamic precision cancer therapy.</title><p>Schematic illustration of cancer cell membrane encapsulated NIR-phosphorescent CDs with long-lived triplet excited states (T<sub>1</sub>) for tumor-specific NIR imaging and precision sonodynamic therapy.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2022_33474_Fig1_HTML.png"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Synthesis of CDs with different acceptor/donator modifications</title><p id="Par6">We developed a one-step microwave strategy for controlled synthesis of NIR-phosphorescent p–n-CDs finely decorated with sulfonic (SO<sub>3</sub>ˉ) acceptors and pyrrolic/graphitic N donators from the precursors of ICG and branched polyethylenimine (BPEI) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>).

The statistic size distribution from Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c–e</xref>) showed three kinds of ultrafine CDs have similar average sizes (2.7 ± 0.6 nm for p–n-CDs, 2.2 ± 0.4 nm for p-CDs, 2.3 ± 0.6 nm for n-CDs). Meanwhile, the high crystallinity of these CDs was observed in their high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f–h</xref>), revealing a 0.21 nm crystal spacing corresponded to the (100) plane of graphite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>.

The graphitic structure of the three kinds of CDs was confirmed by the Raman spectra (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>), revealing that the D/G intensity ratio of 0.995, 0.930, and 0.974 for p–n-CDs, p-CDs, and n-CDs, respectively. Their surface modifications were analyzed by X-ray spectroscopy (XPS). The full-range XPS spectrum of p–n-CDs showed a high atomic content of N (9.8 at.%), S (8.1 at.%), and O (25.6 at.%) with S/O ratio approximating to that of SO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> groups (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2i</xref>). The high-resolution C 1<italic>s</italic> XPS spectrum showed peaks at 284.3, 286.0, 291.8 eV, attributable to the C–C, C–N, and C–S bonds, respectively (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). The high-resolution N 1<italic>s</italic> spectrum consists of a strong single peak at 399.0 eV and a weak peak at 400.9 eV, which were ascribed to pyrrolic and graphitic N, respectively. The high-resolution S 2<italic>p</italic> spectrum exhibited two characteristic SO<sub>3</sub>ˉ bands at 168.6 and 169.9 eV. From the XPS analysis, p–n-CDs is characterized by modification with SO<sub>3</sub>ˉ acceptors (8.1 at.%), pyrrolic N (7.3 at.%), and graphitic N (2.5 at.%) donators. For p-CDs, the XPS analysis showed their surface modification by rich SO<sub>3</sub>ˉ acceptors (10.4 at.%) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2j</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). For n-CDs, their surface modification was dominated by pyrrolic and graphitic N donators (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2k</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). The surface modification of the three types of CDs was further demonstrated by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>). The stretching vibration bands of –SO<sub>3</sub>, C–N, C = C, and C–S can be found in the FT-IR spectrum of p–n-CDs, suggesting the presence of SO<sub>3</sub>ˉ and N-containing heterocycles. Because of negative charge from SO<sub>3</sub>ˉ and positive charge from pyrrolic N, p-CDs, n-CDs and p–n-CDs showed Zeta potential of −25.3 ± 3.2 mV, +15.6 ± 2.1 mV, and −10.9 ± 1.6 mV, respectively (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>).

Based on the (α<italic>E</italic>)<sup>2</sup>−<italic>E</italic> plot, the bandgap of p–n-CDs was determined to be 1.62 eV. In contrast, the absorption spectra of p-CDs and n-CDs were confined in the UV-vis region with an absorption shoulder around 450 nm, and their bandgap was determined as 2.25 and 2.26 eV, respectively. According to electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements on CD electrodes (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>), the conduction band minimum (CBM) of p-CDs, n-CDs and p–n-CDs, was determined to be located at −1.50, −1.36, and −0.77 eV (vs Ag/AgCl), respectively.

As demonstrated in energy-band diagrams of these CDs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>), the energy-band characteristics of CDs, including CBM, VBM, and the CBM-VBM gap are also dependent on their surface modification. Compared with p-CDs and n-CDs, p–n-CDs have a remarkable reduction in the CBM–VBM gap and much lower CBM position, which can be ascribed to the synergistic effects from simultaneous SO<sub>3</sub> and pyrrolic N/graphitic N modification on the shift of the electronic bands.</p><p id="Par9">To understand the synergistic effects of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating modification on CD electronic structures, we established three kinds of <italic>sp</italic><sup>2</sup> hybrid carbon molecules as simple CD models (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>) and evaluated their electronic and optical properties using time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT).

Furthermore, the simultaneous modification with SO<sub>3</sub>, pyrrolic N, and graphitic N in CD-3 results in the smallest HOMO-LUMO gap (1.92 eV) and the most extended absorption and fluorescence emission.

The time-resolved PL spectra of the p-CDs and n-CDs exhibited fast PL decay with an average lifetime of 3.74 ns and 4.82 ns, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e, f</xref>), revealing the CDs’ common fluorescence nature with short lifetime. Interestingly, the time-resolved PL spectrum of the p–n-CDs excited at 700 nm and detected at 760-nm emission can be fitted by bi-exponential decay function with an average carrier lifetime of 11.4 μs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>), three orders of magnitude longer than that of the p-CDs and n-CDs. The extended carrier lifetime is an indicator of long-lived triplet excited states, from which electron transition to the ground state occurs by phosphorescence at room temperature. To further confirm the phosphorescence nature of p–n-CDs, PVA was used as a matrix to stabilize triplet excited states. The p–n-CD@PVA films exhibited phosphorescent emission at 778 nm and carrier lifetime as long as 185 ms (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h, i</xref>). Generally, the co-existence of transient and long-lived components was commonly observed in phosphorescent materials, such as phosphorescent CDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. To our surprise, there were no transient components (ns-scale lifetime) from the time-resolved PL spectra of the p–n-CD solution and the p–n-CD@PVA film apart from the long-lived components (1.6 and 19.2 μs for the p–n-CD solution; 15.7, 87.6, 637.2 ms for the p–n-CD film). These results suggest that the e<sup>−</sup>–h<sup>+</sup> pair recombination from singlet excited states to the ground state could be inhibited by the p–n junction between different functional regions within single CDs.</p><p id="Par12">Inspired by the narrow bandgap, long carrier lifetime, and p–n junction configuration of NIR-phosphorescent p–n-CDs, we investigated their sonodynamic properties under low-intensity US irradiation (50 kHz, 3.0 W/cm<sup>2</sup>) using 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF) as the <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> probe. With increasing irradiation time from 0 to 5 min, the characteristic absorption peaks of DPBF rapidly disappeared (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4j</xref>), indicating that US-excited p–n-CDs as a sonosensitizer reacted with O<sub>2</sub> to produce <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> as highly cytotoxic ROS for SDT. In contrast, p-CDs and n-CDs with short carrier lifetime and wide bandgap showed no sonodynamic effect (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>). For comparison with ICG with a narrow bandgap but with a short carrier lifetime (0.46 ns) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref>), p–n-CDs showed notably enhanced US triggered <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> generation. The <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> generation efficiency was thus determined to be 0.220 min<sup>−1</sup> for p–n-CDs, 2.2 and 3.2 times that of ICG and TiO<sub>2</sub>, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4k</xref>). No significant decrease of DPBF absorption peaks can be observed in the DPBF + US, p–n-CDs + US (no DPBF), and ICG + US (no DPBF) groups (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>), suggesting the US-activated <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> generation behavior of p–n-CDs. To present direct evidence for the enhanced ROS generation capability for the p–n-CD sonosensitizer, electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra were measured using 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (TEMP) as the trapping agent of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>. Compared with ICG and TiO<sub>2</sub> sonosensitizers, p–n-CDs exhibited the strongest ESR signals characteristic of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4l</xref>). For non-SDT-active p-CDs and n-CDs, no <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> ESR signals were observed. These results suggest that the narrow bandgap and long carrier lifetime are two key factors for activating and enhancing SDT. Apart from the enhanced sonodynamic performance of p–n-CDs, the long-lived triplet excited states could endow p–n-CD with excellent photodynamic properties. As depicted in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14</xref>, the characteristic absorption peak of the <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> probe DPBF at 412 nm decreased significantly under 660 nm laser irradiation in the presence of p–n-CDs, confirming the high photodynamic activity of p–n-CDs owing to the presence of long-lived triplet excited states. Because of the catalytic activity of long-lived triplet excited states, we proposed a triplet-state mediated <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> generation mechanism (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4p</xref>), distinct from that of extensively reported inorganic sonosensitizers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>.

Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4m</xref> revealed that the characteristic absorption peak of GSH significantly decreased with the extended US time, indicating that GSH could be acted as a hole-scavenger in the SDT process. The sonodynamic effect of p–n-CDs in the presence of GSH was then measured to confirm the enhanced <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> generation.

It was found that no obvious cytotoxicity was induced by p–n-CDs or p–n-CD@CCM even at 200 μg/mL, suggesting a good biosafety for SDT application (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5g, h</xref>). To reveal the in vitro SDT performance of p–n-CD@143B against target 143B cells, we performed the MTT assay under US irradiation (50 kHz, 3.0 W/cm<sup>2</sup>) for 5 min. Substantial concentration-dependent cell toxicity was induced by p–n-CD@CCM even at lower concentrations under US irradiation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5i</xref>). To demonstrate the enhanced SDT performance of p–n-CD@CCM, relative cell viability of 143B cells against the control for 48 h incubation was compared for different treatment groups, including US, p–n-CD@CCM, ICG + US, p–n-CD + US, and p–n-CD@CCM + US under the same concentration (200 μg/mL) and US irradiation conditions. Both p–n-CD + US and p–n-CD@CCM + US groups exhibited the highest SDT effect with little discrepancy at the cellular levels (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5j</xref>). It should be pointed out that ICG has the same functions for NIR imaging and SDT as p–n-CDs, but it only exhibited a lower SDT effect, because of its much shorter carrier life than that of p–n-CDs.</p><p id="Par18">We further investigated the SDT effect of p–n-CD@CCM using the calcein-AM and PI co-staining assay.

For free p–n-CDs, there was no substantial accumulation at 143B or Hela tumor sites because of rapid renal filtration of p–n-CDs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">23a</xref>).

Six groups of 143B tumor-bearing mice were randomly divided as followed: Group 1: Control, Group 2: US, Group 3: p–n-CD@CCM, Group 4: ICG + US, Group 5: p–n-CD + US, Group 6: p–n-CD@CCM + US. According to the in vivo NIR imaging result, single US irradiation (50 kHz, 3.0 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, 5 min) was performed at 24 h after single i.v. injection of p–n-CD@CCM (2.0 mg/kg) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). The time-dependent change of treated 143B tumors in volume and weight exhibited consistent SDT effects (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e, f</xref>). That is, no tumor growth inhibition effects were observed in the US, ICG + US, and p–n-CD@CCM groups; a limited tumor inhibition was induced by p–n-CD + US; a complete tumor eradication was realized by p–n-CD@CCM + US during 16 days (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">27</xref>). Importantly, the mice percent survival was greatly improved by p–n-CD@CCM + US, with no death observed in the 60-day treatment/observation duration (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6g</xref>). The excellent SDT therapeutic effects of p–n-CD@CCM were also demonstrated by the ROS staining of tumor tissues. The p–n-CD@CCM + US group possessed the highest ROS levels in tumor tissues (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6i</xref>). Haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining was then carried out to analyze the SDT efficacy of p–n-CD@CCM, which exhibited the most severe damage of tumors (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6j</xref>). To investigate whether tumor cells in tissue were apoptosis on day 4 or 5, the tumor sections in each groups were collected on the fourth day post-treatment and subjected to terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">28</xref> revealed that the tumor in p–n-CD@CCM + US group showed severe apoptosis and necrosis. Together, these in vivo SDT effects further revealed that it is of importance to design a high-efficacy sonosensitizer with tumor-specific targeting capability, as confirmed by the model p–n-CD@CCM sonosensitizer.</p><p id="Par21">Considering that US wave possessed high tissue-penetration depth, the in vivo deep-tissue SDT was then performed to evaluate the potential therapeutic effect of p–n-CD@CCM. We established two 143B tumors on the left and right sides of mice and the US treatments were performed from left to right (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">29a</xref>). The left and right tumors rapidly grew in the control group (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">29b</xref>). Significantly, the tumor growth on both sides was completely inhibited for mice treatment with p–n-CD@CCM plus US irradiation from left to right. These results clearly demonstrated that the US treatments could penetrate through the body of mice and the high-efficiency p–n-CD@CCM sonosensitizers could be applicable for deep-tissue SDT.</p><p id="Par22">The pharmacokinetic examination of p–n-CD and p–n-CD@CCM sonosensitizers after systemic injection were then investigated. The plasma concentration-time profiles of p–n-CD and p–n-CD@CCM samples showed a typical double-compartment pharmacokinetic behavior (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">30</xref>). For free p–n-CDs without CCM coating, the elimination half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) was only 0.8 ± 0.1 h, revealing rapid renal clearance owing to the ultrafine size (2.2 ± 0.4 nm), like previous reports on CDs. In contrast, after CCM coating, the half-life was elongated to 11.6 ± 0.9 h, 14.5 times of that of free p–n-CDs, indicating that the typical renal clearing process of CDs was inhibited by CCM coating. The longer circulation time allowed p–n-CD@CCM to enrich in tumors at high levels. The in vivo biodistribution and excretion pathway of p–n-CD@CCM were explored for examination of its in vivo metabolic process. Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">31a</xref> revealed that p–n-CD@CCM primarily accumulated in liver at 24 h post-injection due to the capture of the reticuloendothelial system. Importantly, no obvious p–n-CD signals were observed in these organs after 14 days, suggesting the nearly complete clearance of p–n-CD@CCM. To study the excretion pathway, the p–n-CD concentrations in the urine and feces were also measured. Much higher levels of p–n-CD were observed in the feces, demonstrating that p–n-CD@CCM was eliminated from the mice majorly by liver excretion (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">31b</xref>).</p><p id="Par23">Finally, we investigated the potential long-term toxicity of p–n-CD@CCM through the histopathological measurement, biochemical blood analysis, and blood routine examination. During the treatment period, negligible fluctuation of the mice weight can be observed in each group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6h</xref>). For histopathological measurement, no obvious damages in major organs were detected after different treatments (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">32</xref>), indicating the insignificant adverse effects of p–n-CD@CCM. Furthermore, all the blood biochemical and blood routine indexes in each groups were located in the normal range (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">33</xref>), suggesting the good biocompatibility of p–n-CD@CCM.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par24">Recently, CDs have been engineered as promising fluorescent materials owing to their numerous merits such as high optical stability, excellent solubility, low toxicity, and easy preparation. Generally, single-component CDs do not exhibit observable phosphorescence due to their unstable triplet states. To extend their phosphorescent applications in data encryption and anti-counterfeiting, great effort has been made in the construction of CD-based hybrid phosphorescent systems, in which various organic or inorganic matrices, including KAl(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·<italic>x</italic>H<sub>2</sub>O<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, SiO<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, zeolites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, layered double hydroxides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, poly(vinyl alcohol)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, polyurethane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>, and cyanuric acid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, were employed to suppress the intermolecular vibration for triplet stabilization. However, CD-based hybrid phosphorescent systems are limited by the solid-state-only applications as well as time-consuming and high-cost fabrication involving the use of additional matrices in the solid composites. To date, matrix-free phosphorescent CDs have not been fabricated for phosphorescent applications in aqueous solutions or physiological media because several issues are difficult to address by self-stabilization of triplet states. First, a challenge is to substantially reduce the energy gap (Δ<italic>E</italic><sub>ST</sub>) of CDs between the lowest singlet (S1) to the lowest triplet (T1) for enhancing their favorable intersystem crossing. Second, highly efficient fluorescent emission in CD solutions shows overwhelming advantages over phosphorescent emission, leading to low population probability in the triplet states despite effective ISC. Unfortunately, the electron–hole recombination from S1 to the ground state could not be inhibited to quench the fluorescence emission for enhanced RTP. Third, the excited triplet states at a low-level population are strongly quenched by dissolved molecular oxygen (triplet-state <sup>3</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) to form singlet-state <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, further impeding the aqueous applications of RTP materials. Herein, we reported that matrix-free p–n-CDs in solution states can be rationally constructed as a solution-applicable RTP material by p–n junction engineering. The formation of the p–n junction within single p–n-CDs can effectively inhibit the e<sup>−</sup>–h<sup>+</sup> pair recombination from excited singlet states to the ground state and thus enhance the RTP emission as evidenced by the time-resolved PL spectra of the p–n-CD solution and the p–n-CD@PVA film, where no transient fluorescent components were observed apart from the long-lived components. In addition, rapid charge transfers from the n-type dopant (pyrrolic N) to the p-type dopant (SO<sub>3</sub>ˉ) in the bipolar configuration could stabilize the triplet states with a long lifetime of 11.4 μs in aqueous solutions. In contrast, for p-CDs with SO<sub>3</sub>ˉ functionalization only or n-CDs with pyrrolic/graphitic N functionalization only, effective charge transfer could not be established, leading to fluorescent emission with a ns-scale lifetime in aqueous solutions. Furthermore, TD-DFT calculations showed that the simultaneous modification with SO<sub>3</sub>, pyrrolic N, and graphitic N in the CD-3 model can reduce Δ<italic>E</italic><sub>ST</sub> to a smaller value (0.55 eV), which is favorable for effective ISC to populate triplet excitons and consequently emitting phosphorescence. In contrast, for SO<sub>3</sub>-modified CD-1 has Δ<italic>E</italic><sub>ST</sub> as high as 1.08 eV, suggesting ineffective ISC at room temperature. These results clearly revealed that phosphorescent p–n-CDs exhibited a distinct triplet stabilization mechanism by creating the p–n junction rather than the hydrogen-bonded network in CD-based hybrid phosphorescent systems. Compared with the complex preparation processes of CD-based hybrid phosphorescent systems, the construction of highly phosphorescent p–n junction CDs is simple, one-step, and rapid by one-pot microwave irradiation.</p><p id="Par25">It is noted that current afterglow CDs in the hybrid systems are mainly limited to visible RTP emissions from blue, green to yellow. Recently, high-efficiency red RTP emissions at 620 nm have been also achieved by embedding CDs in Mn-containing open-frame-work matrices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>, but RTP emissions extended to the NIR region remain unexplored to date for NIR applications such as NIR imaging and emitters. Generally, the NIR emissions of quantum dots require a narrow bandgap; it is challenging for CDs to simultaneously reduce the bandgap and stabilize triplet states. Here, we found that phosphorescent p–n-CDs have a narrow bandgap of 1.62 eV and thus emit NIR phosphorescence at 760 nm as a result of the synergistic effects of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating modifications on the p–n-CD electronic structure. The rational p–n junction modification in NIR-phosphorescent p–n-CDs creates the narrow bandgap and stabilize triplet states. Importantly, the p–n-CDs exhibit a phosphorescent efficiency as high as 17.6% in aqueous solutions and high NIR emission brightness comparable to that of the clinically used ICG. These RTP properties render p–n-CDs as a superior long-lived NIR imaging platform for biomedical applications with minimal background interference.</p><p id="Par26">Long-lived triplet states of organic photosensitizers are tremendously important for photodynamic therapy (PDT) owing to a high yield of singlet oxygen generation upon photo-excitation. Based on similar mechanisms to organic photosensitizers, organic sonosensitizers with long-lived triplet states are also favorable for SDT under US irradiation. Interestingly, phosphorescent p–n-CDs have long-lived triplet states in aqueous solutions, enabling effective singlet oxygen generation for SDT like organic photosensitizers. Unlike organic sonosensitizers with low photostability, p–n-CDs have excellent photostability owing to the graphitic structure. Moreover, p–n-CDs possess a narrow bandgap for enhanced sonoexcitation.</p><p id="Par27">In conclusion, we have developed a one-step microwave strategy for controlled synthesis of NIR-phosphorescent p–n-CDs finely decorated with sulfonic acceptors and pyrrolic/graphitic N donators. The p–n-CDs are endowed with a narrow bandgap of 1.62 eV and a long carrier lifetime of 11.4 μs, two of which can enhance SDT as thermodynamically and dynamically favorable factors under low-intensity ultrasound irradiation, respectively. Additionally, p–n-CDs can emit NIR emission with PL maximum at 760 nm and maximum excitation at 700 nm with absolute PL quantum yield of 17.6% and improved stability against photo-bleaching. They exhibit enhanced <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> generation efficiency owing to (1) inhibition of the e<sup>−</sup>–h<sup>+</sup> pair recombination owing to the p–n junction, (2) long-lived triplet-state mediated <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> generation, (3) GSH depletion using overexpressed GSH as a hole sacrificial agent. We have also prepared two kinds of p–n-CD loaded CCM vehicles with homotypic recognition capability as the cancer-specific NIR probe and sonosensitizer for precision bioimaging and SDT with excellent tumor eradication capability. Our results will open up a promising approach to engineer phosphorescent materials with NIR emission and long-lived triplet excited states for wide range applications apart from sonodynamic precision tumor therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par28">ICG and BPEI (Mn ~ 1800 Da) were purchased from J&amp;K Scientific Co., Ltd.
