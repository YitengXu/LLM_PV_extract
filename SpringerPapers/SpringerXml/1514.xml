Entropy generation and COP are selected as the objective functions and their variations are studied by varying the generator temperature for various condensing temperatures. For this purpose, the enthalpy and the entropy data of the super-heated steam, saturated steam and the saturated water are formulated in the mathematical equations. Also to provide the required steam of generator, prime mover in the form of internal combustion engine is applied and its partial load conditions are analyzed. A residential tower is considered as the case study for selecting the proper prime mover capacity. The number of prime movers is estimated based on the required heating power of the generator steam for each partial load. It is seen, the entropy generation would be decreased rapidly by increasing the generator temperature and after a while, the entropy generation would be approximately constant. The optimum entropy generation for each condensing temperature and the generator temperature may be decreased by increasing the evaporator temperature. It is deduced that COP is increased rapidly by increasing the generator temperature but in the following, the COP will be constant. The maximum amount of COP is decreased by increasing the condensing temperature. Also the COP is increased by increasing evaporator temperature for a certain generator and condensing temperatures.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Single effect

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par39">CCHP systems are known as the facilities in which produces cooling, heating and power simultaneously through recovering waste heat of prime movers such as internal combustion engines, gas turbines etc. CCHP systems also attract attentions due to environmentally friendly compared to the other conventional systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Also absorption chillers may be applied as cooling system since they are CFC free [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These chillers need low energy that may be provided by the solar energy or waste heat which is extracted from the prime movers. Avanessian et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] evaluated a single effect absorption chiller from the energy, exergy and the economical point of view. Roman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] investigated on the selection of type of the prime mover and absorption chiller in CCHP systems. They studied the energy consumption, economical and emission parameters. They concluded that emission saving for carbon would be about 9% and the primary energy consumption saving can be reached till 8%. Fong and Lee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] studied a high rise office building in Hong Kong and used internal combustion engine beside absorption chiller to provide cooling and heating demand of the building. They compared energy consumption of their proposed system with the conventional system in which uses electrical power. Their study showed that the energy consumption reduction would be about 10.9%. Karimi and Sayyadi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] studied a Stirling engine beside an absorption chiller. They evaluated primary energy saving, Co2 emission reduction and the annual total cost. They found that in extremely hot and humid weather, Stirling-CCHP system is not recommended. Ünal et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] proposed a linear optimization model to minimize maintenance cost. The optimization procedure was held by comparing four different kinds of prime movers for three different load conditions of an industrial facility. They showed that, tri-generation is more cost effective than the separate production. Chahartaghi and Alizadeh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] studied a CCHP system in which its prime mover was PEM fuel cell. The objective functions were energy, exergy and fuel energy saving. Their proposed model was compared to the conventional energy supply systems and the fuel energy saving ratio was calculated to about 45%. Eisavi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] used solar energy beside Rankine cycle and absorption chiller as CCHP system. They evaluated the energy and the exergy of the system. Ebrahimi and Keshavarz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] studied CCHP system for various climate conditions of Iran. They selected absorption chiller as cooling system and evaluated the size of prime mover for each climate condition. Mohammadi and Ameri [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] studied a prime mover beside absorption chiller. They evaluated ambient conditions effects on the proposed system performance. Al-Sulaiman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] used parabolic solar collector, Rankine cycle and the absorption chiller as a CCHP system. They studied the effect of pump inlet temperature and the inlet pressure of the turbine on the performance of the proposed system. Maindment and Tozer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] used CCHP system for a supermarket that the prime mover was gas turbine and cooling system was absorption chiller. They compared gas turbine and internal combustion engine. They showed that CCHP energy consumption is lower than the energy usage of the conventional systems. Samanta and Basu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] analyzed a single effect absorption chiller with heat exchanger in refrigerant side. They found that absorber has dominant role in any increase in entropy generation. Myat et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] analyzed performance of an absorption chiller using an entropy generation analysis. They found that overall entropy generation is 41% for the generator, 10% for the condenser, 30% for the evaporator and about 19% for the absorber. Ren et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] analyzed an absorption chiller using the Matlab software for thermodynamic analysis. They found COP could be improved by increasing the temperature of hot water or chilled water properly.</p><p id="Par40">In the current study a single effect absorption chiller is applied and the assumptions are considered in which chiller operates properly. The first and the second laws of thermodynamic are evaluated for each part of chiller. COP and the entropy generation are selected as objective functions and they are studied to find their optimum situation by considering permissible concentration range of weak and strong solutions. To evaluate enthalpy and entropy of water, in the saturated and superheated stats, its thermodynamic data is formulated by applying genetic algorithm and by minimizing the error between calculated and thermodynamic data. The COP variations and the entropy generation variations is studied by varying generator temperature in various evaporator temperatures. To meet heating demand of generator, prime mover in the form of internal combustion engine is applied. Since this prime mover does not operate in the full load situation, then its partial load operation is modeled to evaluate the waste heating and the extracted power for each partial load and the proper number of prime movers will be calculated in the various partial loads.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Mathematical model</title><p id="Par41">In this study, a single effect absorption chiller is considered which is shown in the Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par100">In this study an analysis has been done for a single effect absorption chiller to find its optimum situation. A thermodynamic model has been developed from the first and the second laws of thermodynamics point of views to maximize the COP and minimize the entropy generation by considering permissible solution concentration range (between 0.5 to 0.65). The model is validated by the available data from the heat transfer rate point of view.</p><p id="Par101">It has been found that entropy generation would be decreased by increasing the generator temperature whereas the COP is increased. The variations in the lower generator temperature are high while these variations are ignorable at higher generator temperatures. Also the minimum entropy generation may be decreased by increasing the evaporator temperature in each condensing and generator temperature but these variations are very low. To study the chiller entropy generation, it is recommended to consider only generator and condenser temperatures.</p><p id="Par102">To provide required energy of generator, prime mover in the form of internal combustion engine is applied. A mathematical model is proposed to predict the performance of prime mover in partial load. In each evaporator and condensing temperature, the required prime movers are increased by decreasing the partial load. In each evaporator temperature and partial load, the required engines are increased or constant by increasing the condensing temperature.</p><p id="Par103">The important limitation of the suggested system is its size which is essential to be compacted. Also for the future work, it is suggested to study the minimum entropy generation of the prime mover and the related parameters should be evaluated.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="ethics-statement"><title>Compliance with ethical standards</title><sec id="FPar1" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p id="Par104">On behalf of all authors, the corresponding author states that there is no conflict of interest.</p></sec></sec><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Al-Sulaiman</surname><given-names>FA</given-names></name><name><surname>Hamdullahpur</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Dincer</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Trigeneration: a comprehensive review based on prime movers</article-title><source>Int J Energy Resour</source><year>2011</year><volume>35</volume><issue>3</issue><fpage>233</fpage><lpage>258</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1002/er.1687</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Moussawi</surname><given-names>HA</given-names></name><name><surname>Fardoun</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Louahlia-Gualous</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Review of tri-generation technologies: design evaluation, optimization, decision-making, and selection approach</article-title><source>Energy Convers Manag</source><year>2016</year><volume>120</volume><fpage>157</fpage><lpage>196</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.enconman.2016.04.085</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>3.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chua</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Toh</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Malek</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Srinivasan</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">General thermodynamic frame work for understanding the behaviour of absorption chillers</article-title><source>Int J Refrig</source><year>2000</year><volume>23</volume><issue>7</issue><fpage>491</fpage><lpage>507</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0140-7007(99)00077-8</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><label>4.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Avanessian</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Ameri</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Energy, exergy and economic analysis of single and double effect LiBr–H<sub>2</sub>O absorption chillers</article-title><source>Energy Build</source><year>2014</year><volume>73</volume><fpage>26</fpage><lpage>36</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.enbuild.2014.01.013</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR5"><label>5.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Roman</surname><given-names>KK</given-names></name><name><surname>Alvey</surname><given-names>JB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Selection of prime mover for combined cooling, heating and power systems based on energy savings, life cycle analysis and environmental consideration</article-title><source>Energy Build</source><year>2016</year><volume>110</volume><fpage>170</fpage><lpage>181</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.enbuild.2015.10.047</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR6"><label>6.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Fong KF, Lee CK (2014) Performance analysis of internal combustion engine primed trigeneration systems for use in high-rise office buildings in Hong Kong.
