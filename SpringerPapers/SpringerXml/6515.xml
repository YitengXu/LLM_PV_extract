The yield of photosynthesis is highly sensitive to the intensity and spectral components of light received by the photosynthetic organisms. Therefore, photon engineering has the potential to increase photosynthesis. Spectral conversion materials have been proposed for solar spectral management and widely investigated for photosynthesis by modifying the quality of light reaching the organisms since the 1990s. Such spectral conversion materials manage the photon spectrum of light by a photoconversion process, and a primary challenge faced by these materials is increasing their efficiencies. This review focuses on emerging spectral conversion materials for augmenting the photosynthesis of plants and microalgae, with a special emphasis on their fundamental design and potential applications in both greenhouse settings and microalgae cultivation systems. Finally, a discussion about the future perspectives in this field is made to overcome the remaining challenges.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Spectral management</kwd><kwd>Photoconversion</kwd><kwd>Photosynthesis</kwd><kwd>Greenhouse</kwd><kwd>Microalgae</kwd><kwd>Photobioreactor</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Korea Nano Technology Research Society, co-published with Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>36</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>16</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/40580_2022_Article_327.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>ReviewPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Materials Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Nanotechnology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Nanoscale Science and Technology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Nanotechnology and Microengineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Chemistry and Materials Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par11">Natural photosynthesis is essential to all life on Earth. Through photosynthesis, organisms such as plants, microalgae, and cyanobacteria convert solar energy into chemical energy (biomass) efficiently using water and CO<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Photosynthesis fixes more than 120 billion tons of carbon annually through terrestrial plants alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and the CO<sub>2</sub> fixation efficiency for microalgae is about 10–50 times higher than terrestrial plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Photosynthetic organisms have evolved highly efficient light-harvesting systems with a quantum efficiency of more than 90% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Nevertheless, the overall photosynthetic efficiency (conversion of light energy to chemical energy during photosynthesis) is extremely low. The theoretical maximum efficiency of photosynthesis has been estimated to be approximately 12%, but in practice, experimental observations are typically well below this value, around 1% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The main reason for such a difference includes such as selective utilization of light by the light-harvesting pigments, excitation energy transfer, respiratory metabolism for maintenance and growth, light-saturated photosynthesis, and so on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Recent advances in the field of genetic engineering could help to improve photosynthetic efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. For instance, Long et al<italic>.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] showed an improvement of photosynthetic efficiency and crop productivity by about 15% in Nicotiana (tobacco) through genetic manipulation of photoprotection. More recently, Farinola and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] reported an enhancement in photosynthesis of diatom by in vivo incorporation of an organic dye which acts as an antenna and enhances the light absorption of the diatom. Genetic engineering, however, is still limited to species and much effort is still needed to understand the stability and reliability of genetically modified organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Photon management, on the other hand, provides an alternative method of augmenting photosynthesis through spectral matching between the incident light reaching the organisms and the absorption of their light-harvesting pigments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Among many photon management strategies, the use of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) has shown their specific advantages including customization of the emitted light spectrum and high degrees of spatial and temporal control such as light intensity, light period, and so forth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In addition, LEDs enable the selection of specific wavelengths in the lighting spectrum matching the absorption of light-harvesting machinery of photosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Because of these benefits, LEDs play a variety of roles in horticultural lighting, including use in controlled environment research, lighting for tissue culture, and supplemental and photoperiod lighting for greenhouses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Nevertheless, LEDs are accompanied by huge electricity energy consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Instead, solar energy is a form of green energy. However, sunlight with broad spectral distribution makes it inefficiently utilized for the photosynthesis of organisms that have relatively narrow light absorption capability. To improve light utilization efficiency, spectral conversion materials emerge and have been demonstrated as a viable way for spectral photon management through a photoluminescent process. Such materials have found extensive applications ranging from light-harvesting, and solid-state lighting to medical therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Spectral conversion materials have shown their great potential in the area of natural photosynthesis where they convert the less photosynthetically active light into the most photosynthetically active light reaching the photosynthetic organisms for augmenting their sunlight utilization efficiency and productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">There have been some published papers reviewing the latest optical engineering advances to manage light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. These reviews, however, mainly summarize different ways for photon management and pay special attention to the natural photosynthesis of microalgae. Distinct from these published reviews, we here focus on photon management with spectral conversion materials and systematically investigate their recent progress from the point of view of fundamental design and, more importantly, case studies of natural photosynthesis in both plants and microalgae. This review mainly consists of four sections: (1) an overview of spectral conversion materials in terms of their working principle and the Figure-of-Merit, (2) a comprehensive literature review of the case studies examining the effects of spectral conversion materials on plant growth in greenhouse settings, (3) a literature review of recent progress on using spectral conversion materials to augment biomass production of microalgae, and (4) a summary of the perspectives and challenges related to the use of spectral conversion materials for natural photosynthesis, attaining higher efficiencies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Selective light utilization for photosynthesis</title><p id="Par14">Photosynthesis uses sunlight as the sole energy source. Solar radiation that reaches Earth's surface ranges from ultraviolet to infrared. However, solar radiation between 400 to 700 nm, in general, is considered photosynthetically active (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The radiation within this wavelength band is also known as the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), representing approximately 28% and 43% of the solar photons and the total sunlight energy reaching the earth, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. PAR is photosynthetically-active because it encompasses the range of wavelengths absorbed by the primary pigments involved in photosynthesis—chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b. These light-harvesting pigments have a spectrally selective absorbance that is high in red (600–700 nm) and blue (400–500 nm) wavebands while low in green (500–600 nm) wavebands (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). That is why most photosynthetic organisms appear green. Besides, carotenoids are also ubiquitous and essential pigments in photosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. They have an absorption spectrum mainly between 400 nm and 500 nm and transfer the absorbed energy to the chlorophylls, thus expanding the wavelength range of light driving photosynthesis. Although light responses of the photosynthetic organisms differ based on lighting environment, season, genotype, cultivation practices, and many others, almost all photosynthetic organisms require the same narrow wavelength bands in the blue and red-light region for photosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Therefore, irradiation of matching the wavelength band for the light-harvesting pigments can maximize the photosynthetic rate.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Solar spectral irradiance and absorption spectra of chlorophylls a and b and carotenoids, reproduced with permissions from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], respectively</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40580_2022_327_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Working principle and Figure-of-Merit of spectral conversion materials</title><p id="Par15">Spectrum conversion through photoluminescence has widely been used for augmenting the photosynthesis of organisms by improving the quality of light reaching the organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Numerous converters including inorganic phosphors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], quantum dots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and organic fluorophores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] have shown promising feasibility for spectral conversion of light.

Differently, DC converts one high-energy photon into two lower-energy ones, while DS converts one high-energy photon into another photon with lower energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. For this reason, the DC differs from the DS in regard to their quantum efficiency. In the DS process, quantum efficiency will undoubtedly be less than unity (100%), whereas DC has unity or more than unity due to the slight thermal loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Despite the difference in the spectral conversion mechanism, some researchers use the DC term for DS property materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Simply, luminescent materials in DS and DC strategy can be categorized into two parts: lanthanides and non-lanthanides. Lanthanides-based luminescent materials rely on luminescent properties of the lanthanide ions which exhibit sharp lines and high efficiency. For instance, Wegh et al<italic>.</italic> demonstrated a downconversion in Eu<sup>3+</sup>-doped LiGdF<sub>4</sub> with a quantum efficiency close to 200% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. In non-lanthanides, a variety of materials are available, mainly including organic dyes, inorganic quantum dots (QDs), and inorganic phosphors. Organic dyes show large absorption coefficients and relatively large photoluminescence quantum yield (QY). For instance, as reported in the literature, Lumogen Red 305 perylene organic dye from BASF shows a QY of 95% in PMMA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] while 99.6% in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. However, organic dyes generally experience a strong re-absorption loss due to the considerable overlapping between their absorption and emission bands, and usually show poor photostability under solar irradiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. QDs have comparatively wide absorption bands and large emission intensity. In addition, QDs show excellent photochemical stability compared to organic dyes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Even though these advantages, re-absorption loss is still a critical issue in their practical use. Thanks to recent research progress on nanomaterial synthesis, some QDs with nearly zero re-absorption have been synthesized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. In contrast, inorganic phosphors show advantages over organic dyes and QDs because of their satisfactory QY, excellent photostability, little re-absorption, and moderate cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Inorganic phosphors have small absorption coefficients which can be compensated by increasing the concentration of the materials or the thickness of the luminescent layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Unlike down-shifting and downconversion, upconversion (UC) is an anti-Stokes process that converts low-energy photons, typically in the range of infrared range, into high-energy visible or ultraviolet photons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Since at least two photons must be absorbed in order to create one emitted photon of higher energy than the individual absorbed ones, the internal upconversion quantum efficiency is limited to ≤ 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Despite this, photon upconversion is still of interest for applications ranging from luminescence bioimaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], and photodynamic therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] to solar energy conversion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Among  versatile upconversion materials, the lanthanide-doped upconverters are one of the ideal candidates for controllable and efficient upconversion. Lanthanide-based upconverters generally consist of an inorganic host (mainly heavy halides) and lanthanide dopant ions (e.g. Ho<sup>3+</sup>, Er<sup>3+</sup>, and Tm<sup>3+</sup>) that are dispersed as the guest in the lattice of the host matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. One representative example is NaYF<sub>4</sub>:Yb<sup>3+</sup>, Er<sup>3+</sup> based conversion nanocrystals (UCNCs) in which NaYF<sub>4</sub> serves as a host lattice and Yb<sup>3+</sup> and Er<sup>3+</sup> act as a NIR sensitizer and a visible photon emitter, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. The abundant and discrete energy levels of lanthanide ions enable multiple emission bands in a broad spectral range from ultraviolet to visible and short-wavelength near-infrared light. Despite the prominent performance such as tunable emission and excellent stability, the lanthanide-based UCNCs still face severe challenges including low quantum efficiency and relatively small absorption cross-section [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Another main approach used to achieve upconversion luminescence emission is the so-called triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC). A typical TTA-UC system is an ensemble of annihilator chromophores (typically polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) doped with triplet sensitizer (e.g., metalloporphyrin) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Upon excitation, the sensitizer transfers its triplet energy to the annihilator, followed by the annihilation of two sensitized annihilator triplets, which eventually leads to anti-Stokes delayed fluorescence at higher energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Compared to the lanthanide-based UC, TTA-UC operates orders of magnitude more efficiently under low-intensity excitation such as white-light illumination and solar radiation due to the broad absorption bands of the organic sensitizer molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. To date, fundamental theories relevant to each luminescent process are well-established, and there are several in-depth reviews summarizing the key requirements and properties of the most commonly used luminophores for each spectral conversion mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">For a representative spectral conversion material, it consists of a high optical quality plastic or glass doped or coated by organic or inorganic converters that selectively absorb direct and diffused sunlight and re-emits at different wavelengths (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). The portion of the emitted light that is trapped inside the materials is determined by the refractive index of the materials. According to Snell`s law, all photons approaching an interface between a material and air at an angle higher than the critical angle will be reflected (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, rays 3 and 4).

Ideally, spectral conversion materials in practical applications should have distinctive characteristics including (1) a high absorption coefficient that enables them to capture enough photons from the incoming light; (2) a high internal quantum efficiency; (3) a minimized attenuation of the internally re-emitted light as they travel out of the materials; (4) a high fraction of the internally re-emitted light extracted in the desired direction towards the organisms; and (5) cost-effective and photostable.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Spectral conversion materials in agriculture</title><p id="Par22">Photosynthetic organisms selectively use sunlight for photosynthesis and their growth. Converting light with little or no photosynthetic potential to light with higher photosynthetic potential can produce a spectrum that potentially increases the production of photosynthetic organisms. In this perspective, the spectral conversion materials have been widely explored and their potential for photosynthesis and biomass production in photosynthetic organisms including microalgae and plants is further examined. In the PAR region, green light has been considered the least photosynthetically active compared to the blue and red light, with red light being the most efficient for photosynthesis. According to literature, red light is considered ~ 30% more efficient than blue light concerning the photosynthetic action spectrum that shows the relative photosynthetic quantum efficiency per wavelength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Spectral conversion of green to red light paves an indirect way for the use of green light, which accounts for 35% of the PAR. It should be noted that green light could indirectly promote photosynthesis due to its higher penetration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. The other important photoconversion process involves the conversion from the non-PAR to PAR, which leads to an increase in the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and thus potentially augments photosynthesis. Some representative examples include the downconversion of UV radiation to blue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>] or red [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>] radiation, and the upconversion of far-red radiation to red [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>] or blue radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. UV radiation usually produces photochemical damage to the cell, reduces photosynthesis, and lowers biomass accumulation of plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. Conversion of UV radiation to PAR could therefore avoid the damage and provide more photosynthetically active radiation, even though in the solar spectrum only less than 2% of the energy falls on UV radiation. Far-red, however, plays an important role in regulating the morphology of the plants during growth, especially when the far red interacts with the red light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. The ratio of far-red to red light significantly influences the growth of the plants. In the following sections, we will highlight some practices of such spectral conversion materials for augmenting photosynthesis and biomass production of plants in farming systems.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Spectral conversion greenhouse claddings</title><p id="Par23">Using spectral conversion materials as the greenhouse claddings have been proposed since the 1990s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. Such spectral conversion materials mainly alter the quality of light that enters the greenhouse interior space for plant growth through a photoconversion process (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Due to its potential for augmenting biomass productivity of crops in the greenhouse, this technology is still receiving notable attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. For example, Bergren et al. demonstrated the benefits of quantum dots (QDs)-based luminescent film technology to improve spectral quality for plant growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The film consists of CuInS<sub>2</sub> (CIS)/ZnS QDs with peak emissions centered at 660 nm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). CIS/ZnS QDs exhibit a large Stokes shift, allowing for absorption in the UV and blue while emitting in the red, which minimizes re-absorption and downconverts the spectrum to more photosynthetically efficient one. For this benefit, the CIS/ZnS QDs-based agriculture films enable passive modification of the incident light (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). Replicated growth experiments demonstrated that dry mass, fresh mass, and total leaf area were increased on average by 9%, 11%, and 13%, respectively, under the CIS/ZnS QDs-doped film with peak emissions centered at 660 nm (R-QD) compared to the control film without QDs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). Son et al<italic>.</italic> reported a green-to-red spectrum conversion film for the growth and fruit quality of strawberries (<italic>Fragaria</italic> × <italic>ananassa</italic> Duch. cv. Seolhyang) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. The spectral conversion polyethylene film led to higher photosynthetic activity over a long time, while it did not change the photosynthetic chlorophyll content or leaf optical properties. Strawberry fruit qualities of such as fruit weight, sweetness, sweet/acid ratio, and firmness were promoted under the spectral conversion film. To date, numerous spectral conversion materials have been explored and investigated for plant growth, depending on the luminescent properties of materials and the plant species, such as Eu<sup>3+</sup>-modified cellulose acetate film [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>], CdZnSe QDs-based fluoropolymer film [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>], Sr<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>5</sub>N<sub>8</sub>:Eu<sub>2</sub>t-based cellulose film [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>], upconversion nanoparticles-based polymer film [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>], organic dye-containing polyethylene/ polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) film [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>], and so forth.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic illustration of spectral conversion materials in a greenhouse setting for enhancing plant growth. <bold>b</bold> Percent absorption and normalized PL emission for CuInS<sub>2</sub> (CIS)/ZnS quantum dots (QDs)-doped film with peak emissions centered at 660 nm (R-QD). <bold>c</bold> Measured spectra beneath the R-QD film and the control film without QDs. <bold>d</bold> Experimental results of measured edible dry mass, edible fresh mass, and total leaf area for three replicate red romaine lettuce experiments under control film, CuInS<sub>2</sub> (CIS)/ZnS QDs-doped film with peak emissions centered at 600 nm (O-QD) and R-QD film. b-d are replotted with permission from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. <bold>e</bold> Greenhouse covered with the commercially available red LLEAF films for the growth of leafy greens.

One example is the so-called LLEAF 620 film (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e) that is fabricated by an Australian company LLEAF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. The film is made by incorporating organic fluorescent dye into polycarbonate and these films can be easily retrofitted to existing greenhouse structures by screwing, clamping, or hanging (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e). The experimental observations show an increase in the yield of 3 varieties of lettuce. The other commercially available product in the market is an orange film (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>f) made by a company called Ubigro in the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. The film contains nontoxic luminescent quantum dots and can convert UV and blue light into red light. Trial experiments conducted in North America and Europe show increased yields on crops like tomatoes, cucumbers, cannabis, and some leafy greens. It should be noted that these cladding materials usually have flat designs in the form of films. According to the above discussion in the section entitled “Working principle and Figure-of-Merit of spectral conversion materials” and Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, a major problem is that only a small portion of the spectrally generated emitted light in the light escape cone can escape from the film [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. In other words, a major part of the spectrally generated emitted light is still confined due to total internal reflection and eventually is wasted.</p><p id="Par25">The key to addressing the confinement of the spectrally generated emitted light is to reduce or even eliminate the total internal reflection and increase the light extraction efficiency. Recently proposed microphotonic structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>] can effectively extract such internally emitted light and, more importantly, re-direct them into the direction facing the plants for their photosynthesis. The microphotonic structures consist of the well-designed micro-domes which are closely packed on a square lattice on the top surface of the LF305-doped poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) film (inset in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). The strong light extraction effect due to the photon recycling process can be readily recognized visually by the brightness of the central region (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a) compared to that of the surrounding areas in which no structures are fabricated. The developed LF305-doped PMMA film with microphotonic structures can be easily used as the greenhouse covering materials for improving plant growth (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). Quantitative analysis shows that the microphotonic film has a high light extraction efficiency of up to ~ 89% and, more importantly, 73% of the externally extracted light is redirected in the direction facing the plants. As a result, the external quantum efficiency of the LF305-doped PMMA film with microphotonic structures increases to around 44%, compared to that of the control film of 18% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). The authors experimentally demonstrated in the research greenhouse that, though less daily light integral (DLI) under the microphotonic film (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d), the biomass production of lettuce is increased by more than 20% without losing the quality (Figs. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e-h). In addition, nano- or micro-sized scattering particles such as TiO<sub>2</sub> and ZnO embedded in fluorescent matrices also show potential to improve light extraction efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. Embedding scatterers to a greenhouse covering material yields a higher growth performance of crops. However, the light extraction enhancement by these scattering particles is still unknown.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold> Photograph of a green-to-red spectral conversion film with micro-structures on the top surface under green light illumination.

In theory, recycling the otherwise wasted light escaping from the backside will increase the emission from the front side facing the plants and double the efficiency. In this view, Erturk et al<italic>.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>] proposed a fluorescent reflector that comprises optical glass embedded with fluorescent pigments and a Lambertian back reflector (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). The Lambertian back reflector randomizes the direction of the reflected light. Randomizing the direction of light allows much of the reflected light to be internally reflected. Light reaching the front surface at an angle smaller than the critical angle escapes to the air for plant growth. In this specific case, sunlight is collected by a parabolic through the collector and is transmitted into vertical shelves by splitters and optical fibers. The optical fibers direct the sunlight to the fluorescent coatings where the blue-green light is converted to red light. The back reflector recycles the internally generated emitted red photons and enhances the fluorescent emission on the front surface. Attributed to the unique design, spectral conversion from 300–520 nm to 600–650 nm results in a spectral reflectance greater than unity between 600 and 650 nm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b), enabling more photosynthetically active light for crop growth. Simulation results show an overall crop growth increases up to 31% using the fluorescent reflectors (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c). The increasing efficiency, however, is dramatically dependent on both light distribution and effective reflectance. Experimental observations show an increase in crop mass of lettuce by about 35% depending on latitude. It should be noted that the Lambertian back reflector in the fluorescent coating might increase the possibility of re-absorption by the fluorescent pigments due to the increased pathlength of the light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>], thus decreasing the overall efficiency of the fluorescent coatings.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold> Layout of a vertical farm with a spectral conversion reflector which consists of an optical glass embedded with fluorescent pigments to convert blue-green light to red. <bold>b</bold> Spectral heat flux and reflectance of the coating. <bold>c</bold> Estimated overall yearly lettuce crop growth per greenhouse unit for different shelves number and latitudes, with and without the fluorescent reflector (based on simulations).

In the form of long optical fibers, the internally confined light will transport along the fibers and partly escape from their ends (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c shows multiple prototype fiber-coupled luminescent concentrators consisting of four collectors with five 4 ft-long fibers per collector. The collectors with relatively large surface areas convert the blue portion of the impinging solar spectrum into the orange-red light and the re-emitted light can be then coupled into fiber optics and guided to their ends. In this way, the internally emitted light is transformed from the top canopy to the low canopy. It is worth noting that at low canopy levels under low light conditions, 1% more PPFD results in 0.5–1% crop yield improvement even though the yield improvement also depends on the type of plant, season, temperature, and other growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>]. In a commercial greenhouse (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>d), these fiber-coupled luminescent concentrators above the plants can direct the re-emitted light to the lower canopy, especially for the crops with tall vines, for instance, tomatoes. Due to the increased light intensity at the low canopy levels, the fiber-coupled luminescent concentrators lead to a 7% improvement in the weight yield of beefsteak tomatoes in the hydroponic greenhouse compared to the control (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>e). However, such fiber-coupled luminescent concentrators still have a limited efficiency for light delivery. Even though at noon and a clear sunny day, the low canopy only receives around 10% of the PPFD as the upper canopy. The very low efficiency could be improved by reducing surface loss of the internally generated photons from the light escape cone and enhancing the emission at the ends of the optical fibers. Surface loss is key in the luminescent solar concentrators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>] and in the last decades, numerous efforts have been made to minimize the surface loss by aligning the luminophores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>] and using selective mirrors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>]. Emission enhancement, on the other hand, can be improved by increasing the light extraction efficiency of the optical fibers. Various strategies have been developed to date to increase light extraction efficiency such as surface roughness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>], graded refractive index materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>], corrugated structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>], nano- or micro-structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>], and so on.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic illustration of a fiber-coupled broadband light source.

The LSCs with solar cells attached to the greenhouse roof spectrally convert the incident sunlight for plant growth and in the meantime collect the otherwise wasted light for electricity generation. The majority of the LSCs designs place solar cells on the edges of waveguides to maximize light gain. Besides, the bottom-mounted designs have been also systematically investigated in the past years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>]. By orienting the solar cells to face the sunlight, they collect both direct light and concentrated light (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a). In addition, for LSCs with significant distances between edges, bottom-mounted cells show benefits in minimizing the average distance traveled by concentrated light in the waveguide. Corrado et al<italic>.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>] constructed the LSCs panels in the greenhouse which have 13.9% of the back surface covered by the bottom-mounted 20% PV cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b and c). The use of the LSCs panels exhibits a 9–37% increase in power production compared to the reference, depending on cell alignment and positioning. Initial plant trial results have shown neutral to positive effects on microalgae growth underneath the bottom-mounted LSCs panels in the greenhouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>]. A follow-up study concluded that these greenhouse LSCs panels had no negative impacts on tomato and cucumber production and that some varieties of crops have slightly higher values of fruit number and mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Similar LSCs panels that offer wavelength-selective power production have since entered the marketplace, and there appears to be a growing market for the wavelength selective photovoltaic panels that can generate electricity and growth crops simultaneously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>]. Numerous questions, however, remain about the impacts of the light environment underneath such LSCs panels on plant growth. Characterizing the potential impacts of these panels on growth across the huge diversity of crop species should be a high priority for future research.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic illustration of a wavelength selective photovoltaic panel with bottom-mounted solar cells. <bold>b</bold> Greenhouse constructed with wavelength selective photovoltaic panels (red colors) at the University of California Santa Cruz Arboretum. <bold>c</bold> Photograph of the greenhouse roof with narrow photovoltaic strips (black lines in red panels) for electricity generation.

Light is the most significant factor governing the entire process of microalgal cultivation in a growth medium (water supplemented with nutrients). The strategies for microalgal cultivations reach from open ponds to photobioreactors and have attracted much attention in the past decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>]. Photon management through spectral conversion materials improves the quality of light reaching the microalgae, thus altering their photosynthesis and biomass production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>]. Considering the difference in microalgal cultivations between open ponds and photobioreactors, the design of spectral conversion materials varies in practice.</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Spectral conversion materials for microalgae cultivation in photobioreactors</title><p id="Par30">Compared to open ponds, photobioreactors could significantly minimize the likelihood of contamination by other microorganisms or alien microalgae species and have an improved light utilization efficiency of microalgae due to their geometric designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">129</xref>]. When a spectral conversion material is integrated with the photobioreactor, two designs are frequently employed, that is, the front-light design and the back-light design. For example, Prufert-Bebout et al<italic>.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>] proposed implementation with acrylic panels containing a fluorescent dye, Lumogen Red 305, into growth chambers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>a). Such a roofing architecture shows a front-light design where incoming light is partly converted by the spectral conversion materials and then both the non-converted and converted light travel in the air before entering the photobioreactor for microalgae growth. The fluorescent panels mainly absorb green light and emit slightly red light because of light trapping (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>b). Following experimental tests on different strains of microalgae, no significant impact on algal growth was observed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>c). Recently, Kim and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">130</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">131</xref>] reported the other typical front-light design by directly coating the spectral conversion materials into the photobioreactor. It is schematically depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>d. The thin films coated on the culture flasks show notable conversion of the spectrum (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>e). In this case, the front-light design with spectral conversion coatings increased the total lipid production of Chlorella sp. by more than 60% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>f). While some observations show improvement in microalgal growth, photons from the spectral conversion materials in the front-light design have no preferential emission direction, and thus a large fraction of photons does not enter the photobioreactor for algae growth, especially for the roofing design. In addition, the spectral conversion materials must be highly transparent for light that are not to be converted.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold> Photograph of microalgae in photobioreactors that were placed in water baths underneath spectral conversion panels and a clear panel. <bold>b</bold> Transmission spectra (350–800 nm) for the three LSC panels and the control panel relative to the solar spectrum recorded outside on a clear day. <bold>c</bold> Growth rates are represented by bar graphs for <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> and <italic>C. vulgaris</italic> algae.

Incoming light passes through the photobioreactor and only the unabsorbed light participates in the spectral conversion process. In this design, a reflector is usually used to recycle all transmitted and converted light back towards the algae cultures in the photobioreactor. An example of this approach is schematically shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>a, where a photoluminescent phosphor was coated on a mirror back-plat.

Compared to closed photobioreactors, the main advantage of open ponds includes easy construction and operation. The major constraint, however, is poor light utilization by microalgae in open ponds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">135</xref>]. Considering the operational depth greater than 20 cm for large-scale microalgae cultivations and light can only penetrate the top few centimeters of the culture, only 15–20% of the microalgal cultures receive sufficient light for photosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">136</xref>]. As a result, photolimitation remains one of the main bottlenecks for microalgal cultivation, resulting in rather low biomass productivity. Hence, light delivering systems have been proposed as a potential method to increase the availability of light to microalgal cells in open ponds. For example, Moheimani et al<italic>.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">137</xref>] developed a red luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) for microalgae cultivations in outdoor raceway ponds, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>. These red LSCs convert the majority of high energy photons of the solar spectrum to red photons but are largely transparent to infra-red. More importantly, the red LSCs deliver the fluorescently generated light into the depth of microalgal cultures in raceway ponds. Outdoor experiments demonstrated an increase in biomass productivity and phycocyanin productivity of <italic>Arthrospira platensis</italic> respectively by 26% and 44%. The reliability of using the developed light delivering system for increasing biomass productivity in open ponds is further examined by the same group with an emphasis on various algae species and growth environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>]. Biomass productivity of <italic>Scenedesmus sp.</italic> significantly increased by 18.5% and protein, lipid, and carbohydrate productivity of Scenedesmus sp. were also improved by 35%, 20%, and 16% when red LSCs used.

The LSD takes advantage of luminescent materials, collects the impinging light, spectrally converts it into more photosynthetically effective light, and then delivers the converted light through the depth of the pond for algae. The diffuser can be made of transparent polymer material, particularly polyethylene which simply floats due to its low density (&lt; 1 g/cm<sup>3</sup>). A thin luminescent layer is also coated on the diffuser for spectral conversion (Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>a). The generated luminescent emissions can be efficiently guided into algae cultures through LSDs mainly because of the lower refractive index mismatching between the LSD/algae culture (1.5:1.3) interface than that between the LSD/air (1.5:1.0). In addition, the luminescent emitted photons could be partly recycled due to the existence of the reflecting cone at the bottom of the LSD. For practical applications in open ponds, the LSDs can be installed either in the form of standalone devices (Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>b) uniformly distributed in the ponds or a linear funnel along the length of the pond (Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>c). The diffuser collects the impinging light, spectrally converts it into a more useful wavelength, and then delivers the converted light through the depth of the pond for algae. While the absence of experimental demonstration, the calculated data show that the growth rate of algae can be increased by 57% at 1 sun, 50.2% at 0.6 sun, and 35.2% and 0.3 sun intensities by using the luminescent solar diffuser. However, the biggest potential disadvantage of using these spectral conversion materials when they are immersed in microalga cultures is the biofouling of the LSDs.

In this review, we systematically discuss the spectral conversion materials from photoluminescent converters and fundamental photonics designs to their reported applications. Even though some successful applications in promoting photosynthesis of both plants and microalgae, there remain a number of challenges in the field. These challenges include the development of high-quality luminescent converters, the breakthrough in photonic designs to improve the overall efficiency of the spectral conversion materials, and the application potential of such materials in the real world.
