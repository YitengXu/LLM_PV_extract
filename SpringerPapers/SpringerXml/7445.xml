This scenario creates an increase in local fuel prices and limits potentials in the establishment of new industrial zones. The current gap between the demand and production of electricity in Pakistan is approximately 5000–8000 MW with a constant increase of 6–8 % per annum. Hence, more sustainable and renewable energy sources are required to overcome the existing problem. Pakistan is endowed with potential renewable energy resources such as wind, solar, hydro, and biomass. These resources have the capacity to be major contributors to future energy production matrix, climate change reduction efforts, and the sustainable energy development of the country. This article reviews the availability of alternative energy resources in Pakistan and associated potentials for full-scale development of sustainable energy systems. It also discusses exploitation strategies to increase the distribution of indigenous energy resources.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Energy crisis</kwd><kwd>Sustainability</kwd><kwd>Renewables</kwd><kwd>Biomass</kwd><kwd>Pakistan</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/13705_2016_Article_82.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>ReviewPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Renewable and Green Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Sustainable Development</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy Policy, Economics and Management</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy Policy, Economics and Management</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Review</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Background</title><p id="Par2">Pakistan is one of the most populated countries in the southern Asia region, contributing approximately 2.56 % of the total global population. The country is expected to serve as an international trade and energy corridor in the near future due to its strategic location [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Hence, among other social, economic, and political factors, Pakistan needs to ensure its energy supplies meet the direct and indirect demands of the country not only for maintaining economic growth but also for supporting regional and global economic initiatives. The vast deficit between demand and supply of electricity recorded in 2009–2010 was 26.82 %. This figure has increased up to 50 % during the summer of 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A routine problem is that electricity supply cannot be maintained during peak hours, resulting in frequent power shutdown (load shedding) of 13–14 h in urban areas, and 16–19 h in rural areas. As a result, many entrepreneurs and industrialists have invested and moved their businesses to neighboring countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Hence, short- and long-term measures are required to solve the existing energy problems. The present state of Pakistan’s energy resources is summarized (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). It can be seen that indigenous energy sources mainly consist of oil (38 %), hydro (32 %), natural gas (27 %), and coal (3 %) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Distribution of indigenous energy sources available in Pakistan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13705_2016_82_Fig1_HTML.gif" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par3">Sustainable supply of energy to meet the current and future domestic and industrial demands in Pakistan will rely on full-scale generation from the different energy sources in order to make significant contributions to the supply chain. Current energy generation has a huge financial burden on the country’s economy due to the importation of oil to support existing mix, and the situation is heightened by the rapid declination of domestic gas assets. According to the Board of Investment Pakistan, the installed power capacity is 22,797 MW. However, current generation stands between 12,000 and 13,000 MW per day, against peak a demand of 17,000 to 21,000 MW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].

Various efforts have been made by different governmental organizations and international bodies such as Asian Development Bank (ADB) and World Bank to stabilize the energy situation. They share similar objectives to enhance fossil fuel production for electricity generation. Unfortunately, governmental efforts to address concerns relating to energy security, climate change, and sustainable development have been minimal. Whilst little effort is put into increasing domestic fossil fuel (gas, coal, and oil) based electricity, the search for alternative fuel sources which are more sustainable and renewable should be a major national priority. Renewable energy in Pakistan was reported to be &lt;1 % in 2010. However, Pakistani government has targeted to achieve 5 % of renewable energy by 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

These are wind, solar, hydro, and biomass. These resources have a significant potential to provide solutions to the long-lasting energy crisis in Pakistan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Hence, a steady development of these resources is a crucial step to overcome the existing energy challenges in an environmental friendly manner. Among the different renewable energy sources, solar energy has received the most research attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Sheikh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], for instance, evaluated the potential of solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation capacity with 14 % efficient PV panels over area of 100 km<sup>2</sup>, which is 0.01 % of total land area of the country. From the results, it was concluded that covering 100 km<sup>2</sup> area of land with PV panels can produce energy equivalent to 30 million tons of oil equivalent (MTOE) in Pakistan. Gondal and Sahir [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], considered 0.45 % of urban regions for PV installations to estimate the total energy generation capacity based on solar PV system. A survey conducted by Hasnain and Gibbs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] showed that the interior part of the county consists of mainly agricultural land, which is appropriate for the development of biomass feedstock, whereas northern and southern corridors have a significant potential for hydro, wind, and solar. This finding is useful as it might possibly improve the diverse energy supply market and decrease the dependency on imported fuels and environmental pollution.

The Pakistani government has set up a recognized body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], to coordinate efforts in this area. This organization plays an important role in narrowing the gap between demand and supply of electricity by promoting the utilization of renewable energy. Pakistan’s Meteorological Department (PMD) has collaborated with the National Renewable Energy Laboratories (NREL), USA, to conduct a wind speed survey of 46 different locations in Sindh and Baluchistan provinces with height ranging from 10–30 m. The data from the feasibility studies were analyzed by Alternative Energy Development Board Pakistan (AEDB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and it was found that a vast area of 9750 km<sup>2</sup> with a high wind speed was discovered and zoned as “Gharo-Corridor” as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>.

Biogas productivity and quality is greatly influenced by the waste type, waste composition, and operational parameters such as temperature, feeding rate, retention time, particle size, water/solid ratio, and C/N ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. A temperature range between 30 and 40 °C is found to be optimal for high biogas production rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Feedstock available and batch loading are also important parameters for efficient biogas plant operation and help to maximize biogas yield. However, over or under loading of feedstock and water affects the overall efficiency of the process. It has been observed that carbon is consumed 25 times faster than nitrogen during anaerobic fermentation by microorganisms.

This massive destruction resulted long-lasting impacts not only on social human life and economy but it has also resulted in destruction of natural environment posing land erosion, killing of wildlife and other natural resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">The feasibility study of the KB dam showed the construction of a 260-ft high rock-fill dam that would be able to store approximately 7,400,891,131.92 m<sup>3</sup> of water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. The dam consists of two spillways for effective distribution of flood water for instant and appropriate water disposal. During probable floods, these spillways are able to discharge more than 2 million cusecs of water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. The mean annual river flow at KB is high, approximately 111,013,366,978.8 m<sup>3</sup> due to the additional nullahs and other tributaries that join the Indus River between KB dam and Diamer Bhasha dam. So, the approximate volume of flood to be managed at KB dam is around 2,200,000 cusecs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. Therefore, the development of KB dam is important to the government for flood management which capable in preventing future flood risks and combat energy crisis. To realize the full benefits of hydropower generation systems in Pakistan, crucial policy reforms are obligatory to develop hydropower by enhancing sustainable generation capacity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par28">Energy is crucial to the socio-economic development of all countries. A steady transformation is being observed throughout world from primary energy supplies based on conventional sources to renewable resources. Pakistan continues to formulate efforts towards renewable energy endeavors. However, with the current gap between the demand and production of power in Pakistan, which is approximately 5000–8000 MW with a constant increase of 8–10 % per annum, and the heavy dependence on limited fossil fuel resources, renewable alternatives which are able to commercially support conventional energy options must soon be in full-scale operation. Wind, solar, hydro, and biomass are the resources that are abundantly present in Pakistan. In Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, the energy generation capacities of these resources stand at 120,000 MW for wind, 2,900,000 MW for solar, 5500 MW for biomass, and 42,000 MW for hydropower [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This creates a significant potential to overcome existing fuel needs in the country. This potential capacity is fairly distributed among the different provinces. Sindh is endowed with wind potential in the South, Baluchistan is rich with solar potential in the West, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is rich with hydro in the northeast area. Therefore, existing potential of renewables can be explored in four distant regions for power generation, water/space heating, engine fuel, and stand-alone power systems (SAPS). Though different efforts have been made to address the roadblocks which renewable energy technologies (RETs) face, the development has not been completely viable due to social, technological, economical, and informational hindrances. These concerns are the prime deterrents in the development of renewables. The country’s future energy should come from a balanced mixture of all these resources to steadily decrease its reliance on imported oil. The importance should be given to more rapid and targeted advancement of hydropower as large potential exists in country and most of feasibility studies have been concluded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. The supply of electricity from wind to grid has already started in 2014. However, it is still a challenge due to some impediments such as absence of infrastructure (e.g., large cranes, road network) and inadequate grid integration ability. Therefore, it is necessary to address these challenges by prioritizing the provision of these facilities. The economical and user friendly solar cookers, solar water heaters, and solar dryers should be progressed, as instantaneous integration approach can have insightful influence on the overall energy demand in Pakistan. The frequent public demonstrations and official campaigns must be carried out to educate the general public regarding environmental and commercial benefits of green energy, which will boost up the acceptability of those facilities. Besides, the specific feasibility studies should be conducted for the installation of large-scale gird connected to solar thermal power stations. The renewable energy syllabus must be introduced from the primary to the university levels in the institutions to develop consensus in support of accepting renewables as energy sources in Pakistan. The graduate students should be sent to foreign institutions to acquire more knowledge on emerging renewable energy technologies. Policies for buying small scale renewable energy systems using a payable loan scheme for public should be framed. Security, law, and order situations in country must be addressed at priority basis to encourage the attention of the local and foreign investors to invest in renewable energy. The power demand of Pakistan is projected to increase up to 11,000 MW by the year 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Therefore, a more holistic approach by addressing all above mentioned issues are important to fully utilize the renewable energy potential to achieve a sustainable energy future of the country. A determined political will is the key to energy independence.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Summary of all renewable energy resources and their current
