The OER catalytic activity as well as electrolysis energy efficiency surpasses any previously reported OER electrocatalyst in alkaline medium and energy efficiency of an electrolyzer using state-of-the-art Pt and RuO<sub>2</sub> as the HER and OER catalyst, respectively. Through detailed electrochemical and structural characterization, we have shown that the enhanced catalytic activity is attributed to directional growth of the electrodeposited film that exposes a Ni-rich lattice plane as the terminating plane, as well as increased covalency of the selenide lattice which decreases the Ni(II) to Ni(III) oxidation potential. Thereby, the high efficiency along with extended stability makes NiSe<sub>2</sub> as the most efficient water electrolyzer known to-date.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2017_Article_2285.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Water splitting reactions producing readily useable clean fuel H<sub>2</sub>, has been the focus of major research activities in alternative energy since they are benign in terms of impact on the environment and human health. The oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER, respectively), an intricate part in water oxidation/reduction, respectively, also plays a crucial role in other alternative energy devices including fuel cells, metal-oxygen batteries and solar water splitting devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Among these the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring at the anode is a major hurdle since it is a kinetically sluggish process that involves 4 electron transfer associated with the formation of dioxygen molecule from water, and requires a large anodic potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Therefore, this OER half reaction is regarded as the most limiting step for water splitting, and electrocatalysts/photocatalysts are typically used to reduce the applied potentials for O<sub>2</sub> evolution. The most commonly used high-efficiency catalysts are the precious metal oxides (IrO<sub>x</sub>, RuO<sub>x</sub>) which exhibit some of the lowest overpotential for practical current densities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In addition significant advances have been recently made in identifying OER electrocatalysts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> based on transition metal compounds including alloys (often containing significant amounts of Ni, Co or Fe)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, oxide/hydroxide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, phosphide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, spinels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and perovskite oxides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Among these, Ni-based oxides, oxyhydroxides, and hydroxides, along with Ni-Fe based oxyhydroxides have shown the most potent catalytic efficiencies with performance closer to that of precious metal oxides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Very recently transition metal chalcogenides has been receiving increasing interest as OER and HER catalysts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Compared to the oxides, the chalcogenides are expected to have more covalency, smaller bandgaps, and better band alignment with water redox levels for efficient charge transfer, thus promoting better catalytic efficiency. In particular Ni- and Co-based chalcogenides have shown great promise for water electrolysis in alkaline medium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Indeed we have identified a nickel selenide, Ni<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>2</sub> which shows a very low onset potential and overpotential at 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> for oxygen evolution in alkaline medium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Other groups have also reported chalcogenides such as NiS<sub>x</sub> as a bifunctional HER and OER active catalysts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The bifunctional electrocatalysts that can be applied both at the cathode and anode and produce hydrogen and oxygen, respectively, are highly appealing technologically for water electrolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">In this article we report the highly efficient OER and HER catalytic activity of electrodeposited pure NiSe<sub>2</sub> films and emphasize the importance of film orientation and growth conditions on the catalytic activity. The OER catalytic activity in these films with the onset potential for O<sub>2</sub> evolution at 1.36 V (<italic>vs</italic> RHE) and overpotential at 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> at 140 mV in alkaline medium, was observed to be superior to any other OER electrocatalysts reported till date including state-of-the-art precious metal oxides, transition metal oxides, and other nickel chalcogenides. There has been another report of the OER catalytic activity of NiSe<sub>2</sub> (coated with native oxide layer) <italic>albeit</italic> with much higher overpotential at 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> (~290 mV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. This difference can be attributed to several factors including the surface chemistry, phase purity and the preferential growth direction which influences exposure of the catalytic sites to the electrolyte as discussed below. The later proposition has been conclusively proven in this manuscript whereby, we have grown randomly oriented NiSe<sub>2</sub> grains through hydrothermal methods and have shown their catalytic activity for OER to be less efficient than the electrodeposited oriented films, thereby providing a very valuable insight for the OER electrocatalysts. The onset potential for H<sub>2</sub> evolution was also very low as compared to other non-Pt based HER electrocatalyst. The NiSe<sub>2</sub> bifunctional electrocatalyst reported here could effectively split water at 1.43 V and achieve an electrolysis energy efficiency of 83% producing current density as high as 100 mA cm<sup>−2</sup>, which is the highest that has been obtained so far for a bifunctional water electrolyzer. Electrodeposition being a facile, direct method to grow large area binder-free catalytic films, and the experimental proof that films with preferred orientation will show enhanced catalytic activity indeed highlights the novelty of this report.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Structural and Morphological Characterization</title><p id="Par4">As mentioned above and described in the experimental section in Supporting Information, NiSe<sub>2</sub> electrocatalysts were grown by two methods – electrodeposition on Au-coated glass and by hydrothermal techniques. The powder X-ray diffraction patterns (PXRD) of as-synthesized NiSe<sub>2</sub> films electrodeposited on Au-coated glass substrates as well as NiSe<sub>2</sub> powder synthesized hydrothermally showed peaks that matched well with standard NiSe<sub>2</sub> (PDF # 00-041-1495) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The electrodeposited film also showed peaks characteristic of Au arising from the underlying substrate. The peaks were considerably broader indicating that the films were composed of nanostructured grains.

Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> lists the typical catalyst loading and average thickness of the electrodeposited film. The morphology of the as-synthesized films was investigated through detailed SEM and TEM studies (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a and b</xref>) which showed that they were indeed composed of nanostructured grains. The TEM and HRTEM images, Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b and c</xref>, respectively, suggests that the film contained mainly nanocrystallites where individual grains were single crystalline showing lattice fringes corresponding to 〈211〉 planes of NiSe<sub>2</sub>. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) collected from these nanocrystallites showed diffraction spots corresponding to 〈200〉 and 〈023〉 lattice planes of NiSe<sub>2</sub> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). The NiSe<sub>2</sub> granules were free of any amorphous or heterogeneous coating on the surface as apparent from the TEM images, also confirming the purity of these nanograins. The composition of the electrodeposited films were confirmed through EDS (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>) which confirmed the presence of Ni and Se in the film with an approximate ratio of 1:2 and validated the composition as NiSe<sub>2</sub>.

The actual catalytically active region of the material was estimated from the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) measurement (see Supplementary Information, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>) and provided in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.</p><p id="Par8">The activity of the catalyst for OER was determined from LSVs and CVs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a and b</xref>) by measuring the onset potential and overpotential at 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> (<italic>vs</italic> RHE). All the potentials have been reported after iR compensation. Current density with bare Au-glass electrode and RuO<sub>x</sub> coated electrodes were also measured for comparison. As expected bare Au-coated glass slide showed very minimal catalytic activity for OER, while RuO<sub>2</sub> coated slide showed an onset potential of 1.43 V (vs. RHE) and overpotential of 320 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup>, which matches perfectly with the reported values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. It was observed that NiSe<sub>2</sub> on Au-coated glass electrode exhibits a very low onset potential of about 1.36 V, reaching current density 100 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> at overpotential of about 200 mV. It must be mentioned here that these value of onset and overpotentials were very reproducible and different batches of NiSe<sub>2</sub> films on Au-glass showed similar values. The CV for NiSe<sub>2</sub> showed a large pre-oxidation peak before the increase of current density due to oxygen evolution. For Ni-based OER electrocatalysts, the pre-oxidation peak typically attributed to the Ni<sup>2+</sup> to Ni<sup>3+</sup> oxidation has been observed previously. The intensity of the pre-oxidation peak was considerably large, possibly due to exposure of large number of catalytically active sites and high surface roughness that may lead to a high ECSA of the catalyst. Typically, activities of the OER electrocatalysts are benchmarked by comparing the overpotential at current densities of 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> (per geometric surface area), which is considered to be equivalent to 10% solar water-splitting device under 1 sun illumination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In the present case, however, the onset of OER activity as well as the overpotential at 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> was heavily masked by the large pre-oxidation peak and the overpotential at 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> was obtained from the cyclic voltammogram (CV) by analyzing the current density of the reverse scan which corresponds to the OER current only (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Accordingly, it was observed that a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> was obtained at an overpotential of 140 mV. This value is much better than the RuO<sub>2</sub> (320 mV overpotential required to get 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> current density) and is the lowest value reported till date amongst all the known OER electrocatalysts as well as amongst the recently reported chalcogenides (see Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that pure NiSe<sub>2</sub> has been reported as an active electrocatalyst for OER with such a low onset potential as well as overpotential at 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup>. To understand the role of catalyst growth conditions, we have also measured the catalytic activity of NiSe<sub>2</sub> grown through hydrothermal methods. For this purpose, the NiSe<sub>2</sub> powder was mixed with Nafion and drop-casted on carbon fiber paper (CFP) and used as an anode in the OER set-up (see Supporting Information for details). The CV plot showed that NiSe<sub>2</sub> powder on CFP was still catalytically active for O<sub>2</sub> evolution with a low onset potential (1.38 V) and overpotential at 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> (220 mV) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>) indicating that this is indeed an intrinsic property of this material. Noticeably, the catalytic activity of hydrothermally grown pure NiSe<sub>2</sub> powder was better than previous reports of NiSe<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, possibly due to the nanostructured morphology of the NiSe<sub>2</sub> grains as has been frequently obtained with hydrothermal synthesis. Recently we have also shown that nanostructuring increases catalytic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. However the catalytic activity was inferior to the electrodeposited NiSe<sub>2</sub> film, thereby, emphasizing the fact that growth conditions indeed play a vital role in determining the catalytic activity of these electrocatalysts (<italic>vide infra</italic>). A small value of Tafel slope of 48.7 mV dec<sup>−1</sup> for NiSe<sub>2</sub> compared to RuO<sub>2</sub> (121.2 mV dec<sup>−1</sup>) confirmed that the catalytic process was very facile.

To address this issue, we have intentionally electrodeposited Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> films following a reported procedure on Au-coated glass. The electrocatalytic activity of the Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> was measured in the same way as described above. It was observed that the onset potential for O<sub>2</sub> evolution as well as overpotential at 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> was much higher at 1.49 V vs RHE and 330 mV, respectively (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>).

This decrease could be attributed to large amounts of oxygen being produced at the disk electrode that cannot be efficiently collected by the Pt ring electrode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par11">Stability of the catalysts under conditions of continuous O<sub>2</sub> evolution (in 1.0 M KOH) was investigated using constant potential electrolysis (chronoamperometry) for 24 h where the potential was held at a constant value of (1.37 V <italic>vs</italic> RHE) to deliver 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> per geometric area (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). As can be seen from the chronoamperometry data, there was no degradation of the current density with time indicating extended catalyst stability. It should be noted here that the constant potential of 1.37 V was chosen based on the reverse scan of the CV plot which provided a better estimate of the potential needed for achieving a 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). A separate set of stability studies was conducted by holding the potential constant in several stages of the OER reaction (from onset to rapid O<sub>2</sub> evolution stage) and the current density was measured at each of these steps for extended period. As can be seen from Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>, the current density at 1.28 V was almost 0, which can be expected from the LSV curve since it falls below the onset potential. As the potential step was increased to 1.34 and 1.37 V, the current density showed a steady step-wise increase to ~10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> where it stayed stable for the duration of the potential step. As the potential step was increased further to 1.39 V and 1.41 V respectively, the current density showed a much steeper increase indicating that OER was indeed the major process in these potential ranges. The current density at 1.41 V was noisy possibly due to evolution of large amounts of O<sub>2</sub> which led to accumulation of bubbles near the electrode surface and had to be dislodged with mechanical agitation, thereby producing a noisy data. The composition of the film after chronoamperometry and extended periods of continuous O<sub>2</sub> evolution was analyzed through PXRD (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>) and XPS (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>) studies which revealed that the films were still predominantly NiSe<sub>2</sub> even after 24 h of continuous O<sub>2</sub> evolution. However, a small intensity peak was also observed in the pxrd pattern that corresponds to Ni<sub>0.85</sub> Se, indicating that there might be some Se loss from the films during extended period of O<sub>2</sub> evolution leading to formation of a selenium deficient phase. The formation of selenium deficiency on the surface after OER activity was also evidenced further by EDS (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>) as the ratio of Ni to Se increased slightly with progress of reaction.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Stability study of catalyst under continuous O<sub>2</sub> evolution at a constant potential to achieve 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> for 24 h, (<bold>b</bold>) LSVs of catalyst in N<sub>2</sub> saturated 1.0 M KOH before and after chronoamperometry for 24 h, (<bold>c</bold>) Stability of catalyst at different potential by using potential step method.

However, in NiSe<sub>2</sub>, the Ni<sup>2+</sup>/Ni<sup>+3</sup> oxidation potential shows a shift towards lower value as compared to that observed in the Ni-based oxides or oxide-hydroxides as seen from the LSVs. We have probed this point further by collecting cyclic voltammograms (CVs) with electrodes coated with pure NiSe<sub>2</sub> and Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> in 1.0 M KOH with a three electrode set-up. It should be noted here that to check the oxidation peak, the CVs were measured on electrodes prepared with less NiSe<sub>2</sub> deposition time (5 min), such that the Ni<sup>2+</sup> → Ni<sup>3+</sup> oxidation peak was not masked by the stronger OER peak. It was observed that the Ni<sup>2+</sup> to Ni<sup>3+</sup> oxidation indeed occurs at much lower potential (1.345 V vs. RHE) compared to that in Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> (1.395 V vs. RHE), indicating that the catalytically active species (Ni<sup>3+</sup>) is generated at a lower potential in the NiSe<sub>2</sub> electrode (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Such kind of downward shift of the oxidation peak potential can be expected by considering the effect of surrounding ligands on the oxidation potential of the central metal atom. In fact, the electronegativity values of Ni (1.91) and Se (2.55) are very close to each other indicating that as the ligands change from oxo-based to seleno-based, the covalent nature of the metal-chalcogen bond increases. The observation of a lower Ni<sup>2+</sup> to Ni<sup>3+</sup> oxidation potential in seleno-based coordination environment is also supported by our recent studies with a seleno-based molecular Ni coordination complex containing tetrahedral NiSe<sub>4</sub> core, similar to that found in most Ni-selenides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Single crystals of this complex showed that Ni<sup>2+</sup> to Ni<sup>3+</sup> oxidation occurred at 1.34 V (<italic>vs</italic> Ag|AgCl) in 1.0 M KOH, confirming that the low Ni<sup>2+</sup> → Ni<sup>3+</sup> oxidation potential observed in NiSe<sub>2</sub> is indeed due to the selenide coordination. The increasing covalency in the selenides compared to oxides is also supported from Fajan’s rule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. This increase in covalency leads to several important consequences including a decreased bandgap of the selenides as compared to that of oxides (3.5 eV) and an upward shift of the valence band edge. These changes in the orbital energy levels will directly influence their alignment with respect to the water oxidation and reduction levels, which in turn will affect the charge transfer between the catalyst and water. For the water splitting catalysts, one of the most influential factors in light of the electronic band structure is that water oxidation-reduction levels are bracketed within the valence and conduction band edges of the catalyst. In these electrocatalytic systems charge transfer occurs at the semiconductor (catalyst)-electrolyte interface which will be influenced by the relative energy levels of the semiconductor and aqueous electrolyte, and an efficient charge transfer will occur when these two levels are closer in energy, thereby facilitating the catalysis mechanism as proposed above.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>CVs measured at NiSe<sub>2</sub> and Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> catalysts in N<sub>2</sub> saturated 1.0 M KOH at 10 mV s<sup>−1</sup>.

Most of these nickel selenides are reported to be narrow bandgap semiconductors or semimetals. Previous electronic band structure calculations reported zero bandgap for NiSe<sub>2</sub> as obtained using GGA, exact exchange hybrid functional, and GW approximation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Another factor that might enhance the catalytic activity is easy access to the active site, which in turn can be influenced by growth direction of the film. Hence, the preferential growth direction of the film was analyzed by studying the texture of the film from PXRD data. Specifically, to perform this kind of texturing study, a symmetric diffraction was utilized, where incident and detector angles were always equal. Under these conditions, diffraction from planes that are oriented parallel to the sample surface was only observed. This is the same general method used for powder samples. However, for a powder, all expected reflections are observed as the powder itself consists of randomly oriented grains. On the other hand, if texturing is present in the sample, it implies that there is a preferential growth direction, and the plane normal to that growth direction will predominate in the diffraction pattern. In this case, the pattern obtained was consistent with (311)-textured NiSe<sub>2</sub> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) which crystallizes with a primitive cubic structure, penroseite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Substantial (311) texture was evident by the enhanced intensity of the (311) reflection at 2θ~50.5° when compared to the intensity of the (210) reflection at 2θ~33.5° while the underlying Au substrate showed a 〈111〉 orientation as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>. In a randomly oriented film, based on the theoretical PXRD generated from the atomic coordinates, one would expect the (311) reflection to be roughly one-third the intensity of the (210) as has been observed in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Our results suggested that (311) planes are preferentially oriented parallel to the growth direction of the film. In other words, the average terminating planes of the film were the 〈311〉 lattice planes of NiSe<sub>2</sub>. Similar texturing studies on the hydrothermally grown NiSe<sub>2</sub> did not show any preferred orientation. The Au surface with a preferred orientation along the 〈111〉 direction may play a substantial role in determining the growth direction of the film. Similar results has been recently reported by Switzer <italic>et al</italic>. by growing preferentially oriented Cu<sub>2</sub>O grains on Au-coated silicon substrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref> shows the (311) plane of the NiSe<sub>2</sub> lattice and interestingly it can be seen that this crystallographic plane is Ni-rich, and can be considered as predominantly Ni-terminated plane. Since, Ni is the catalytically active center for OER, the anion deficient terminating lattice plane will facilitate the attachment of the hydroxyl anions to the metal center leading to a low onset potential and low Tafel slope. The Ni-rich terminating lattice plane may also reduce Se loss with prolonged OER catalytic activity thereby reinforcing catalyst’s stability. In fact, recently, another group has reported OER electrocatalytic activities of NiSe<sub>2</sub> in alkaline medium <italic>albeit</italic> with much higher overpotential (250 mV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. They have also shown through <italic>in situ</italic> Raman measurements that the catalytic activity proceeds with the immobilization of OH<sup>−</sup> on the surface. However, they have also mentioned that their as-prepared catalyst had a surface coating of oxide-hydroxide. That may be the reason the overpotential showed a higher value than the pure NiSe<sub>2</sub> reported in this study. As we have shown above, the generation of the catalytically active center (Ni<sup>3+</sup>) is much more facile in the chalcogenide lattice than the oxide matrix. The higher conductivity of the inner NiSe<sub>2</sub> lattice will aid in faster electron transfer leading to higher current densities even at low potentials. Hence, the enhanced intrinsic OER catalytic activity in NiSe<sub>2</sub> can be explained from the increased covalency in the lattice which affects the electronic band structure of NiSe<sub>2</sub>, band positioning, zero band gap of the material, while the highly efficient catalytic activity of the electrodeposited film can be explained from the preferential growth during electrodeposition. It should be also noted that the catalyst loading in this report was very comparable and in fact lower than that reported for other OER electrocatalysts (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). Nevertheless, to rule out any effect of catalyst loading on the OER activity, we have compared the catalytic activity between the electrodeposited 〈311〉 -textured NiSe<sub>2</sub> film and hydrothermally synthesized NiSe<sub>2</sub> powder containing identical loading. As can be seen from the CV plot (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>), there was no change of overpotential with variation in catalyst loading, however, the current density increased with increased loading. More importantly, the overpotential for the textured NiSe<sub>2</sub> film showed the same difference with that obtained for the NiSe<sub>2</sub> powder, indicating that this difference in activity is intrinsic.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Pxrd pattern of the (311) textured NiSe<sub>2</sub> film.

Previous report of HER activity with NiSe<sub>2</sub> corroborates very well with our report signifying the accuracy of the results. Chronoamperometric studies for continuous H<sub>2</sub> evolution for 6 h showed that the catalyst was also stable for HER activities in 1.0 M KOH for extended time (inset of Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>). To confirm that the composition of the evolved gas was indeed H<sub>2</sub> we designed an electrochemical experiment where the evolved gas was oxidized at Pt electrode. Specifically, a series of HER experiments were carried out in 1.0 M KOH, where H<sub>2</sub> was generated for different time intervals (0.5, 1 and 3 h) at NiSe<sub>2</sub>/Au. After periods of continuous gas evolution for certain periods of time, the evolved gas was oxidized at Pt electrode. As has been shown previously, Pt can electrochemically oxidize H<sub>2</sub> at 0.0 V<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Hence monitoring the H<sub>2</sub> oxidation potential and oxidation current could confirm the composition of the gas was indeed H<sub>2</sub>. Initially the electrolyte was purged with N<sub>2</sub> and as expected the current density for H<sub>2</sub> oxidation at Pt electrode was very close to 0. After the HER reaction was done for 0.5, 1 and 3 h, the oxidation current density increased indicating the increasing concentration of dissolved H<sub>2</sub> in the electrolyte (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). This was further confirmed by measuring the oxidation current after purging the electrolyte with N<sub>2</sub> after 3 h of HER to get rid of any dissolved gas. As expected, the oxidation current reduced back to the initial value after purging with N<sub>2</sub>. This simple experiment proved conclusively that H<sub>2</sub> was indeed produced at the NiSe<sub>2</sub> electrode. The composition of the evolved gas was further confirmed as H<sub>2</sub> following the well-established catalytic hydrogenation of <italic>para</italic>-nitrophenol (PNP) to <italic>para</italic>-aminophenol (PAP). The hydrogenation reaction was performed as described in supporting information, and the progress of reaction was monitored through UV-Vis spectroscopy since PNP and PAP shows distinctly different λ<sub>max</sub> values (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>). When the electrolyte was maintained at conditions for HER, it was clearly observed that the absorbance peak due to PNP showed a gradual decrease accompanied by an increase of the PAP absorbance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b</xref>) indicating conversion of PNP to PAP. After 5 h, the conversion of PNP to PAP was complete and the solution turned nearly colorless. Two separate control experiments involved passing H<sub>2</sub> through the reaction mixture in the absence of applied voltage and maintaining a blank electrode (Au-glass) under the HER conditions mentioned above. In both of these control experiments, absorbance of PNP did not show any detectable change even after 5 h. This indicates that not only H<sub>2</sub> is being produced by NiSe<sub>2</sub>, but it is actually forming catalytically active hydrogen capable of performing liquid phase hydrogenation under ambient conditions.

Through electrochemical measurements and structural characterization, we have proven that this enhancement in primarily due to lowering of the oxidation potential of Ni<sup>2+</sup> to Ni<sup>3+</sup> that in turn is a consequence of changing the oxide lattice to the more covalent selenide lattice, as well as the preferential growth direction of the film which exposes a Ni-rich surface as the terminating lattice plane.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>M.N. wrote the manuscript text with some contributions from A.T.S. and J.M. A.T.S. did most of the experiments. J.M. interpreted the data. S.U. performed the hydrothermal reaction and provided data for Figures 1, 3a and b. W.P.L. designed and collected data for Figure 8b. E.B. designed the texturing pxrd experiment and analyzed data presented in Figure 6a. Figures were prepared by A.T.S. (Figures 1, 2a, 3a,b, 4a,b,c,d, 5, 7a and 9), J.M. (Figures 2c, d,e,f,g, 3c, 4e, 7b and 8), W.P.L. (Figure 6, Figure 8b). J.E.M. helped with understanding the band structure calculations and its dependence on directionality.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement"><sec id="FPar1" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Competing Interests</title><p id="Par20">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec></sec><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Bare</surname><given-names>SR</given-names></name><name><surname>Mallouk</surname><given-names>TE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Development of supported bifunctional electrocatalysts for unitized regenerative fuel cells</article-title><source>J.
