FDTD simulations of semi-infinite thick c-Si having 2D IPAs on its surface whose pitches over 400 nm shows more than 30% improvement of light absorption at λ = 850 nm and the maximum enhancement of 43% with the 540 nm pitch at the wavelength is confirmed. A prototype BI-CIS sample with pixel size of 1.2 μm square containing 400 nm pitch IPAs shows 80% sensitivity enhancement at λ = 850 nm compared to the reference sample with flat surface. This is due to diffraction with the IPA and total reflection at the pixel boundary. The NIR images taken by the demo camera equip with a C-mount lens show 75% sensitivity enhancement in the λ = 700–1200 nm wavelength range with negligible spatial resolution degradation. Light trapping CIS pixel technology promises to improve NIR sensitivity and appears to be applicable to many different image sensor applications including security camera, personal authentication, and range finding Time-of-Flight camera with IR illuminations.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2017_Article_4200.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">In the past decade, c-Si based CISs have rapidly replaced CCD image sensors in most commercial camera applications, due to their superiority in power consumption and higher flexibility readout. Now, most smart-phones and personal mobile computers use one or more camera modules with CIS, and CIS dominates the image sensor market. CIS technology has drastically improved its image quality along with shrinking pixel size, increasing sensor resolution, and adding smart analog readout circuit and sophisticated signal processing. The evolution of CIS architecture has also included improvements such as back-illuminated (BI) technology and imager + logic stack technologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The trend of shrinking pixel size continue and now a commercially available pixels have been shrunk to 1.0 μm square<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. To maintain high sensitivity with such small pixels, BI-CIS technology has been widely utilized, because it is free from design restriction of tightly packed metal wires for signal readout. This make it possible to maintain a high fill-factor compared to the front side illuminated CISs (FI-CISs). De-facto standard color CISs use RGB on-chip color filter on each pixel in Bayer pattern, which consists of a 2 × 2 color unit cell with two green filters in the diagonal positions and blue and red in the off-diagonal positions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. BI-CISs have a photo-absorption layer with typical Si thickness of 3 μm. This thickness is optimized to absorb visible light with acceptable lateral color-crosstalk among adjacent pixels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. On the other hand, demand of non-visible, especially near-infrared (NIR) sensitive image sensors for security, personal authentication, and range finding applications has been growing. To make cutting-edge BI-CISs applicable for NIR use, it is important to enhance NIR sensitivity. The most straightforward approach to improve NIR sensitivity is simply to make the photo absorption layer thicker. But this degrades the visible image quality due to the lateral crosstalk especially for small pixel sizes. In addition, chip cost is increased because fabrication of thick substrate BI-CISs requires huge capital investments in manufacturing equipment typified by high energy ion implanters.</p><p id="Par3">It is well known that black silicon, which has random needle-shaped surface, has very low reflectivity and high absorption efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. These structures have been applied to c-Si solar cells and image sensors to improve photo-electro conversion efficiencies and sensor sensitivities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However, the needle-shaped surface has issues when applied to consumer image sensors, which have small pixel sizes. The random surface structure is typically a few 100 nm in size. This means that each pixel contains random but limited number of structures, and hence, it results in large deviation of pixel characteristics such as PRNU (photo response non-uniformity), which is not good for high quality, uniform 2D imaging capabilities.</p><p id="Par4">Another surface structure has been reported with carefully designed uneven and periodic surface for thin-film c-Si solar cell. The c-Si solar cell was designed with the (100) surface containing wavelength size-scale inverted pyramid array (IPA) structures, composed of (111) facet on (100). It was reported that the amount of absorption was enhanced and its figure of merit (FOM) approached to 4<italic>n</italic><sup>2</sup>

If the typical size of the uneven structure on c-Si surface is much smaller than the wavelength of interest, the effective refractive index between c-Si and the upper medium has an intermediate value, which is well-known as a moth-eye anti-reflection coating or refractive index gradient structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, in case that the size is comparable to the wavelength of interest, it is expected to have strong diffraction as well as anti-reflection effect within the c-Si, extending the optical path length within c-Si. This will result in considerable absorption enhancement, which is directly proportional to sensor sensitivity and quantum efficiency (QE). In this paper, we propose the novel pixel architecture of BI-CISs with IPA structure on c-Si surface plus deep trench isolations (DTI) between pixels to enhance NIR sensor sensitivity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design concept of BI-CIS pixels</title><p id="Par5">We report on the NIR sensitivity enhancement of BI-CIS with the IPA structures on c-Si surface. Additionally, lateral crosstalk is suppressed with the use of low refractive index DTI between pixels. CIS has a densely packed 2D pixel array with pixel size less than few μm square to enable high spatial resolution images with small camera module size for cost-competitive products. However, an uneven surface with IPAs will diffract the incident light and degrade the spatial resolution due to the strong diffraction within the substrate. To compensate this feature but maintain the effectiveness of absorption enhancement, we employed DTI between pixels. DTI minimizes lateral photon crosstalk by confining the incident light within the pixel. This is accomplished by the use of low refractive index DTI fill, which enables total reflection between c-Si photo-detector and SiO<sub>2</sub>. We illustrate the schematic of BI-CIS pixels which have the IPA surface and DTI in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>. Each pixel has an on-chip micro lens (OCL) to maximize fill-factor and sensor sensitivity as well as on-chip color filters (OCCFs) to selectively collect RGB color intensity information. A brief working principle for sensitivity enhancement is described in the Methods section (1).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) A schematic image of the prototype BI-CIS pixels with the inverted pyramid array structures (IPA) and deep trench isolation (DTI).

Here, c-Si is assumed to have semi-infinite thickness in the Z-direction, so that there is no reflection or diffraction from the bottom boundary of c-Si, and hence, it is possible to extract pure contribution of the diffractive surface only. We assumed SiO<sub>2</sub> buffer layer on the c-Si layer. Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> shows the simulation results. The horizontal axis is the wavelength of incident light and the vertical axis is the pitch of the IPA structure. The color corresponds to the amount of absorption at each wavelength. The graph shows absorption enhancement as the pitch increases. The enhancement has plateaus over a pitch size of around 500 nm. The simulated absorption of 3 μm thick c-Si at 850 nm is calculated to be 12.5% with flat surface versus up to 16.5% with the IPA surface pitch of 400 nm (a 31% improvement). Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> is the normalized absorption enhancement, FOM, defined as IPA surface absorption divided by the flat surface absorption at each wavelength. It is clearly seen that fine features exist in the graph. The most prominent one is that the white-dashed line has a local maximum at each wavelength. It has slight wavelength dependency and suggests that a 400 nm pitch is good for enhancement at λ = 700 nm sensitivity while the 600 nm pitch is good for λ = 950 nm. At λ = 850 nm, the best pitch is estimated to 540 nm and it has 18.1% absorption, corresponding to a FOM of 43%. Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> shows the vertical cuts of Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> at λ = 700 nm, 850 nm and 1000 nm, respectively. Here, these wavelengths correspond to the effective wavelengths in the medium, λ<sub>n_SiO2</sub> = 483 nm, 586 nm and 690 nm, respectively. They are slightly larger than the optimal pitch of 440 nm, 540 nm and 640 nm at each wavelength, suggesting that the optimal IPA pitch and local absorption enhancement is related to Wood’s anomaly. It is also worthwhile to note that the aspect ratio of the IPA structure is fixed to 0.708 (=1/tan (54.7°) because of the facet angle between c-Si (111) and (100).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Amount of light absorption of semi-infinite c-Si substrate with IPA by FDTD simulation.

We assumed a 1.2 μm square pixel with 3 μm thick c-Si photo-detector and on-chip color filter and micro lens. The simulation conditions are written in Methods section (2). Here, Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> is a schematic of a typical BI-CIS pixel for the reference (hereinafter Sample A), and Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> is with 400 nm pitch IPA on c-Si surface (Sample B). Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> is the same as B, but with 2 μm deep DTI (Sample C), so that each pixel of Sample B and C contains 3 × 3 IPA.

The simulation results of Sample A are plotted in dashed lines on the both figures. Here the peak Si absorption of green pixel of Sample A is set to be 1.0 for normalization. Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> is the comparison of Samples A and B, showing Sample B has lower peak absorption of 0.80 as well as big spectral crosstalk due to the diffractive IPA surface. Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref> is that of Samples A and C, showing comparable peak absorption, but with spectral crosstalk suppressed with larger absorption enhancement from λ = 700 nm to 800 nm. Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref> is the FOM which is the ratio of the RGB integrated sensitivities of Samples B or C structure divided by the Sample A. This FOM shows a large sensitivity enhancement over 700 nm. The averaged FOM from λ = 700 nm to 800 nm is 1.63 for Sample B and 1.78 for Sample C, respectively. It is also important to point out that amount of absorption of blue pixel around λ = 400–450 nm is improved, suggesting the IPA structure is good not only for NIR sensitivity enhancement with light trapping but also good broadband anti-reflection coating.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) A schematics of the reference sample which has flat Si surface with AR coating (Sample A).

The sensor has 3 μm thick c-Si photo-detectors as well as on-chip micro lenses and RGB color filters for each 2 × 2 pixel unit in Bayer pattern as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>.

Although there are strong ripples in each color due to Fabry-Perot interference of the bulk Si, it is clearly seen that the FOM becomes larger as the wavelength increases, and the FOM is about 1.6 at 800 nm, 1.8 at 850 nm and 1.9 at 900 nm, respectively. The trend is clearly seen especially for red pixels, because the filter is almost transparent over 700 nm, while blue and green filters gradually become transparent over 700 nm.

In practical use, it is important to confirm how deep and thick a DTI is required to minimize the lateral crosstalk and spatial resolution degradation especially in RGB color imaging. Therefore FDTD simulation was performed by changing the DTI size parameter with Sample C structure. Figure <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a–d</xref> show the dependency of color crosstalk on DTI depth for each RGB pixel. Because the c-Si photodetector thickness is set to 3 μm, we performed the simulation by sweeping DTI depth from 0 nm to 3000 nm from the top-side of the pixel surface. It is assumed that the DTI width of 200 nm is enough thick to prevent near-field tunneling effect. Figure <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8d</xref> is the summary of simulation. Here we introduce the color crosstalk indices of the intensity ratio of 440 nm vs 600 nm for blue pixels, that of 540 nm vs 660 nm for green pixels and that of 540 nm vs 600 nm for red pixels. Although the red pixel index (540/600) is saturated over 2200 nm, the green pixel index (540/660) is a maximum at 3000 nm depth and the blue index (440 nm/600 nm) rapidly increases over 2500 nm.These features suggest that a fully penetrated DTI is necessary to minimize the lateral crosstalk. Even a small space around the bottom boundary increases color crosstalk. Furthermore, the transmitted portion from backside of c-Si photo-detector might be diffracted by the metal wires or contact poly-Si gate structures and increase the color crosstalk.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>–<bold>c</bold>) These panels show the simulated spectral sensitivities of RGB pixels of sample C changing DTI depth from 0 nm (without DTI) to 3000 nm (DTI penetrate the substrate) in steps of 400 nm.

Here we assume the DTI depth is the same as the c-Si photodetector for simplicity. We performed the simulation by sweeping DTI width from 0 nm to 250 nm. Figure <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8h</xref> is the summary of the simulation. Here we use same crosstalk indices, the intensity ratio of 440 nm vs 600 nm for blue pixel, 540 nm vs 660 nm for green pixel and 540 nm vs 600 nm for red pixel. All RGB index are saturated over 150 nm suggesting that a DTI width over 150 nm is needed to minimize lateral color crosstalk within the c-Si. In our prototype samples, the DTI width is estimated to be 250 nm and the depth is about 2 μm suggesting well suppressed color crosstalk as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>. Still color crosstalk to adjacent pixel seems to be larger than the reference samples or penetrated DTIs judging from the simulation of Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. Although it is possible to compensate the color crosstalk to reduce color noise with signal processing, it is better to reduce the color crosstalk as small as possible to improve the visible image qualities. We would like to emphasize that it is highly required to improve pixel isolation capability to confine the light more effectively within the pixel cubic. It is also important that this structure does not degrade dark current and noise characteristics due to the uneven surface. Because geometric surface area of c-Si (111) IPA has the facet angle of 54.7° to (100), it makes the surface area increase as factor of 1.73 (=1/cos(54.7°)) compared to flat surface. However, each Si atom of c-Si (111) surface has single-dangling-bond whereas that of (100) has double-dangling-bonds, so that both the factors cancel with each other and the total number of the dangling-bond is reduced to 86.5% compared of the flat surface case. This suggests it is expected to have small degradation or might be a little bit better of dark current characteristics, if it is processed with the proper and careful surface passivation to minimize surface recombination.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par14">A novel BI-CIS with IPA on c-Si surface for light trapping pixel technology is proposed and the prototyping results are demonstrated.

Because of the high refractive index of c-Si and low refractive index of surround medium such as SiO<sub>2</sub>, it is possible to effectively confine the light within the pixel cube. Firstly, incident light is refracted with the c-Si surface (111) which has facet angle of 54.7° by following Snell’s law. Then the refracted light is reflected at the side-wall and bottom of c-Si. Because of large gap of refractive index of c-Si and SiO<sub>2</sub>, it is easy to fulfill the total reflection condition, and results in large optical-path elongation compared to the case of flat surface.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>FDTD simulations</title><p id="Par16">FDTD simulations were performed using the commercial FDTD software, Lumerical Solutions 8.5.1 with a periodic boundary condition in the XY plane and a PML condition in Z-direction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.

For this prototyping, we fabricated IPA composed of Si (111) using lithography and anisotropic wet etching process. At first, the PR coating and mask patterning were performed. Next 5-M potassium hydroxide (KOH) with 1-M IPA solution was used as an isotropic etchant to create c-Si (111) inverted pyramid under a carefully controlled temperature condition as KOH etching rate is sensitive to the temperature. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c,d</xref> show a cross-sectional SEM image and top-view of the inverted pyramid array with a periodicity of 400 nm and 0 nm spacing after the wet etching. The surface is passivated with a thin p + layer to minimize surface recombination and noise generation. This thin layer is also serving as anti-reflection coating. After the fabrication of the IPA structure, passivation is deposited and planarized over the pyramid array. Other processes are the same as the reference BI-CMOS process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Spectroscopic measurements</title><p id="Par18">Spectral sensitivity measurements were performed with a calibrated halogen lamp with grating. The light power was set to be 5 μW/cm<sup>2</sup> and finely collimated light was radiated onto the BI-CIS sample without optics. Although commercially available BI-CMOS image sensor chips often have some offset between the on-chip micro lenses and photo-detectors to adjust the chief-lay angle (CRA) of the camera module optics, our samples have no offset between on-chip micro lenses and photo-detectors. The image data was taken from 700 nm to 1000 nm in step of 10 nm resolution and the data was averaged for each color pixels separately by using center 1/3 part of the imager. The sensor exposure time and gain setting were 16.7 mS and 0 dB, respectively. The output data has 12 bit digit including black level offset of 200. We applied the factor of 130 μV/LSB to convert the digit to voltage to the data after subtracting the black level. The results data have spectral bandwidth of 10 nm and the absolute power error is calibrated to be less than 0.5%.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We gratefully acknowledge to Yoshikazu Nitta, Shigeyuki Baba, Hirokazu Mamezaki, Junichi Kanai and Masahide Hirama for useful discussions and to supporting of the project.
