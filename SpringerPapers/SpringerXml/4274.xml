In this work, we report on vibration energy harvesting scheme based on the charging phenomenon occurring naturally between two bodies with different work functions. Such work function energy harvester (WFEH) is similar to electrostatic energy harvester with the fundamental distinction that neither external power supplies nor electrets are needed. A theoretical model and description of different operation modes of WFEHs are presented. The WFEH concept is tested with macroscopic experiments, which agree well with the model. The feasibility of miniaturizing WFEHs is shown by simulating a realistic MEMS device. The WFEH can be operated as a charge pump that pushes charge and energy into an energy storage element. We show that such an operation mode is highly desirable for applications and that it can be realised with either a charge shuttle or with switches. The WFEH is shown to give equal or better output power in comparison to traditional electrostatic harvesters. Our findings indicate that WFEH has great potential in energy harvesting applications.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>4026</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2014</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>10</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>28</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep06799.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>22</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep06799" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep06799</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>There is an on-going quest of efficient miniaturised energy harvesting devices that can harvest energy from their environment and supply sufficient power for autonomous operation of small electronic devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Energy harvesting is an especially attractive powering solution in applications where battery replacement or recharging is difficult or where continuous operation without maintenance is otherwise desirable. Such applications include, e.g., wireless sensor networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and biomedical implants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Energy harvesting schemes include, e.g., harvesting from ambient light, temperature gradients and mechanical vibrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Due to abundant availability of mechanical vibrations in many relevant environments, vibration energy harvesters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> have gained large popularity. They convert mechanical vibrations into electricity using, e.g, electromagnetic induction, piezoelectricity and electrostatics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Furthermore, magnetostrictive materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, magnetic shape memory alloys<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and triboelectrification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> have also been proposed for vibration energy harvesting.</p><p>This work is linked to electrostatic energy harvesters that are based on electrically charged capacitors, the capacitance of which is varied by mechanical motion. The mechanical energy is converted into electric energy of the capacitor, i.e., external force is performing work to increase the distance between charge on individual plates and thereby increasing the total potential energy of the charges. The fabrication of the electrostatic energy harvesters is straightforward as their structures are similar to other existing micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). The drawback of the electrostatic energy harvesters is the need of electret materials, which pose challenges in the fabrication and lifetime, or an external power supply<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Due to these challenges piezoelectric energy harvesters, that can be easily fabricated also in microscale, have gained vast popularity in energy-harvester research activities over the electrostatic harvesters. However, in addition to electrets and external batteries, there exists an alternative solution to introduce the initial charge to electrostatic harvester. This solution is given by a fundamental property of all materials: the work function. When two different materials with different work functions are brought in proximity to each other and connected galvanically, charging occurs naturally without any external source (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a and b</xref>). This charging effect is based on the desire to reach global thermodynamic equilibrium, where the chemical potentials of the materials are equal. We refer the energy harvester utilizing the material work functions as the work function energy harvester (WFEH).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(a, b) Electron energy levels of electrode materials 1 and 2 of the work-function energy harvester (a) before making contact and (b) in the thermodynamical equilibrium after making contact.

Furthermore, the use of either a charge shuttle or external switches to drive local electric energy storage for pulsed power supply is also described. We also show that the WFEH has equal or higher power output than a comparable electrostatic energy harvester. The similarity to the standard electrostatic energy harvesters allows similar device geometries and fabrication processes to be used and WFEHs can be fabricated with CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) compatible materials. In fact, n and p-type silicon (or other semiconductors) can be used as the different bodies of WFEH, indicating that the pn combo can also be used in vibration energy harvesters in addition to solar energy harvesters.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Theory and ideal operating cycle</title><p>When two materials with different work functions are electrically connected, the Fermi levels are equalized by transport of electrons from the material with lower work function to the material with higher work function (see <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a and b</xref>).

Since <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="disp-formula">equation (1)</xref> depends also on the time derivative of the product of C and u, highly nonlinear behaviour is expected.

The output power depends strongly on how the electric charge is extracted from the WFEH. We consider two operation schemes: voltage and charge constrained modes. The charge-constrained mode is shown to generate much higher output power than the voltage-constrained mode. Therefore, the output power of the charge-constrained mode represents the theoretical maximum output power of the WFEH. The motion of the work-function energy harvester is assumed to be periodic with a period of Δ<italic>t</italic>. During the cycle of operation the total capacitance of the WFEH is varied from the minimum value C<sub>min</sub> to the maximum value C<sub>max</sub>.</p><p>In the voltage constrained mode any excess electric charge is immediately extracted using, for example, a low impedance load circuit. The voltage constrained mode yields the average output power as <disp-formula id="Equ3"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep06799_Equ3_HTML.jpg"/></disp-formula>In the charge constrained mode the WFEH capacitor is charged or discharged only when the stored electric energy reaches a maximum or minimum, respectively. These extremes are reached when the WFEH capacitance is at maximum and minimum. The charging and discharging can be controlled with an electrical switch, for example. The ideal operating cycle of a WFEH operating in the charge constrained mode consist of 5 phases depicted in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>. By combining all the phases of the cycle the average output power of a WFEH operating in the charge constrained mode can be written as <disp-formula id="Equ4"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep06799_Equ4_HTML.jpg"/></disp-formula>Unlike in the charge-constrained mode, the ideal voltage-constrained mode does not lose power because of the parasitic capacitor. The ideal voltage-constrained mode could also be realized more easily, but comparison of <xref rid="Equ3" ref-type="disp-formula">equations (3)</xref> and (4) shows that the power output of the charge-constrained mode is at least two times the power output of the voltage-constrained mode. At large values of C<sub>max</sub>/C<sub>min</sub> ratio the charge-constrained mode generates substantially more power than the voltage-constrained mode with limiting value <inline-formula id="IEq2"><inline-graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep06799_IEq2_HTML.jpg"/></inline-formula>.</p><p>The average powers of ideal work-function energy harvesters operated in the charge constrained mode are plotted in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e–f</xref> as functions of C<sub>max</sub>/C<sub>min</sub> ratio, frequency f = 1/Δt and the built-in voltage V<sub>bi</sub>. High output power can only be reached if C<sub>max</sub> is much larger than C<sub>min</sub>. In this case the power generated in phase 5 is negligible compared to the phase 3 (see <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). As <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e–f</xref> and <xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="disp-formula">equation (4)</xref> show, P<sub>idealQ</sub> is directly proportional to the operating frequency and the square of V<sub>bi</sub>. Therefore, material pairs with high built-in voltages are desired, but otherwise any materials with sufficient conductivity are suitable and in addition to metals also semiconductors can be utilised. For example, for metal pair Pt and Mg we have V<sub>bi</sub> between 1.46 V and 2.27 V and for Pt and Al between 0.86 V and 1.87 V<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Here the spread in V<sub>bi</sub> arises from the typical spread in the work function values of metals found in the literature. If the material pair is formed from the same semiconductor but of different type (p and n), then the built-in voltage is roughly equal to the energy gap of the semiconductor. For example, a built-in voltage of 1.1 V could be obtained with silicon and values above 3 V could be reached with wide band-gap semiconductors such as SiC and GaN. Availability of n and p-type diamond allows built-in-voltages of over 5 V to be reached.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Experimental verification with prototype of work-function energy harvester</title><p>In order to verify the model and to demonstrate the work function energy-harvesting concept we built a macroscopic variable capacitance prototype with 63 mm × 64 mm aluminium and copper capacitor plates (see <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a and b</xref> and Methods).

For a specific temporal dependence of the capacitance there are optimal values for RC<sub>max</sub>/Δt and C<sub>max</sub>/C<sub>min</sub>. A WFEH with a resistor as the load generates less output power than both the charge-constrained and voltage-constrained operating cycles. This is caused by non-optimal charging and discharging of the WFEH capacitor. For maximum power the WFEH capacitor should be fully charged when the capacitance is at the maximum and fully discharged when the capacitance is at the minimum. At low frequencies the WFEH capacitor is discharged too early because of the slow variation of the WFEH capacitance. At high frequencies, in turn, the WFEH operates too quickly to be adequately charged when the WFEH capacitance is at its maximum. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> illustrates well this behaviour. The determining factor is the ratio of the electrical time constant, RC<sub>max</sub> and the period of the mechanical motion, Δt. Between these two extremes, when ratio RC<sub>max</sub>/Δt is near 0.2, the optimal operation is reached.</p><p>The ideal charge-constrained cycle defines the maximum output power of the work-function energy harvesters. This ideal cycle requires use of variable load in the harvesting circuit. Variable load can be realized using, for example, electrical switches. Such switching circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> have already been utilized in electrostatic energy harvesters, the operation of which is similar to the WFEHs. The switching ensures that the WFEH capacitor is fully charged and discharged during the operation cycle similarly as in the ideal cycle. In the simplest case the WFEH can be charged by shorting the capacitor electrodes. This can be done using a mechanical switch in parallel with the load resistor. The timing of the switching is critical as the switch should only be closed when the capacitance is at its maximum, otherwise the output power can even be much lower than the power obtained without switching. Despite this difficulty, we managed to demonstrate over 2-fold increase in power output of our experimental setup using the switching operation (see the details in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Section 2.2 of Supplementary information</xref>).</p><p>The power increase due to the use of a variable load in work-function energy harvesters estimated with our numerical model is shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>. The normalized power decreases with decreasing frequency because the off-state resistance (100 GΩ) is not high enough to avoid leakage current. The simulations with variable loads yield much higher power than the simulations with fixed load: With the minimum plate distance of 170 µm the simulated variable load WFEH produces 58% of the ideal power at maximum, whereas the simulated fixed load WFEH produces only 13% of the ideal power at maximum.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Estimation of performance of MEMS device</title><p>The performance of a MEMS-based WFEH device can be estimated by using MEMS-scale parameter values of electrostatic energy harvesters.

With this kind of excitation and a charging voltage of 9 V the electrostatic harvester gives an output power of 1.2 µW<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. The dependence of the output power of the simulated WFEH device on the frequency of the vibration is shown in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>. Note that by setting the built-in voltage of the WFEH and the external power supply of electrostatic harvester equal we find that the WFEH gives equal or higher power output (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Section 5 of Supplementary information</xref>). The output power of the WFEH increases with increasing value of the built-in voltage V<sub>bi</sub>. The device produces the highest power when the vibration frequency matches with the mechanical resonance frequency of the device. Comparison of the data from the devices with constant and variable loads shows that the output power increases when switching is used. For example, at the built-in voltage of 1 V the increase in output power is over one order of magnitude. The power maxima vs. frequency in the variable load case are wider than in the fixed load case. In other words, the harvesting efficiency in the variable load case is less sensitive to matching the mechanical resonance frequency to the vibration frequency, which underlines the importance of electrostatic force (<xref rid="Equ7" ref-type="disp-formula">equation 8</xref> in Methods section) in the dynamics.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Simulated output power of MEMS work-function energy harvesters with a load varying between 100 Ω and 50 GΩ and a constant 200 kΩ load as (a) functions of the vibration frequency at three values of V<sub>bi</sub> and (b) function of the built-in voltage V<sub>bi</sub> at vibration frequency of 1868 Hz.</p><p>The parameters of the simulated device were taken from an existing electrostatic energy harvester<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.

This is likely a consequence of electrostatic spring softening, which shifts the resonance off the exciting vibration frequency.

It pushes the excess charge to an external circuit. This can be exploited in an elegant manner to charge a storage capacitor C<sub>sto</sub>, which, in turn, can supply power to an electric load. Such a work-function charge pump can be constructed from a shuttle moving between the fixed electrodes as sketched in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>. During the operation of this device (see <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>) the shuttle first makes electric contact with the lower electrode, thus charging the shuttle. Next, the shuttle moves up and the electric energy in the system increases as the capacitance between the shuttle and the lower electrode decreases.

These effects are caused by the dependence of the charging power on the voltage u<sub>sto</sub>, which is shown in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>. In the beginning most of the energy is lost due to the low value of u<sub>sto</sub>. The charging power increases as u<sub>sto</sub> increases. After P<sub>sto</sub> reaches a maximum, it begins to decrease due to the fact that the stored charge corresponding to the high value of u<sub>sto</sub> prevents flow of charge from the WFEH to the storage capacitor. For the same reason, the charging power decreases when the value of C<sub>min</sub> approaches the value of C<sub>sto</sub>. In practical applications C<sub>sto</sub> is much larger than C<sub>min</sub>.

Therefore, the device geometries and various broadband vibration energy harvesting techniques utilized in electrostatic energy harvesters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> can also be used in WFEHs. The key advantage of the work function energy harvester over the electrostatic energy harvester is the fact that the work function energy harvester does not need external power source or electret materials in the operation. In this sense the WFEH becomes closer to piezoelectric harvesters that also rely on fundamental properties of solid materials. Another unique feature of WFEH is that it can be operated in the charge shuttle mode, which is impossible to realise with electrostatic harvesters. The charge shuttle mode can provide extremely large maximum capacitance and, therefore, high output power. The physical contact between the surfaces, however, often results in stiction problems and reduced lifetime, but recently reported SiC-based nanoelectromechanical switches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> have been shown to operate reliably over 10<sup>7</sup> switching cycles.</p><p>WFEHs can generate more power than the electrostatic harvesters in many operating conditions (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Section 5 of Supplementary information</xref>). A simple comparison can be performed by assuming that the initial charging voltage V<sub>in</sub> of the electrostatic harvester is equal to the built-in voltage V<sub>bi</sub> of the WFEH. A more detailed comparison would need the details of the specific applications of the devices. In principle, high values of V<sub>in</sub> can be used in the electrostatic harvester, since the charging voltage is limited only by the pull-in voltage and the breakdown voltage of the variable capacitor of the device. In reality, the charging voltage is limited by the available power supply, which is a battery with the nominal voltage 1–4 V in many applications. This voltage range can also be realized with the built-in voltages of many known material pairs.</p><p>In general, energy harvesters can be operated in two modes: continuously and in pulsed mode. In the pulsed mode the WFEH needs to supply energy to, for example, sensing and communicating circuit which measures and transmits signals for further processing at time intervals. The use of a work-function charge pump of either <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref> or c in both of these operating modes can be designed using the results shown in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d and e</xref>. The charging power can be maximized by selecting large storage capacitors, so that C<sub>sto</sub>/C<sub>min</sub> ≥ 100. Work-function charge-pump devices need an initialization time where they gather electric energy in the storage capacitor while increasing its charging power as the voltage across the storage capacitor increases. The number of operating cycles N<sub>mpp</sub> needed to reach the maximum charging power is proportional to C<sub>sto</sub>/C<sub>min</sub>. In the pulsed mode the time interval between the pulses can be optimized so that the electric energy in the storage capacitor is not completely consumed, causing the charging power to collapse. On the other hand, unlike in the case of electrostatic harvesters using external battery all energy of the storage capacitor can be consumed during every cycle if needed. Finally, we note that a supercapacitor can provide an attractive solution to achieve high capacitance energy storage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> that can be integrated with WFEH.</p><p>In conclusion, we have experimentally tested the work-function energy harvester concept. The operation of the test device was in a good agreement with our theoretical model. Based on the theory two ideal modes of operation were devised. The charge-constrained mode was shown to produce much higher output power than the voltage-constrained mode. The results show that for maximum output power the electrical time constant of the work-function energy harvester should be optimized in respect to the operating period of the device. Use of switches or a charge shuttle in mimicking the ideal cycle was shown to increase the output power of the WFEH remarkably. We have also presented two work-function charge pump designs for charging of storage capacitors for powering of, e.g., autonomous sensors. The feasibility of miniaturizing work function energy harvesters was shown by simulating a realistic MEMS device. Finally, the comparison of work function and electrostatic energy harvesters showed that work function energy harvesters can generate more power than the electrostatic harvesters in many operating conditions, but without the need of external power source or electret materials. This was also confirmed with the MEMS simulations. The results presented in this article point out that the work function energy harvesters have vast potential to be used in many applications. For maximum power output material pairs with maximal difference in their work functions need still to be sought and MEMS versions of the work function energy harvester need to be realized. The principle, however, does not require realization in microscale, but miniaturization is needed in many applications and achieving high capacitances is easier with microfabrication techniques. The optimal design of these MEMS devices can be achieved by utilizing the models presented in this article.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Experiments with WFEH prototype</title><p>The WFEH prototype is a parallel plate capacitor with the plates moving along an axis perpendicular to both plates (i.e. varying distance between the plates).

The numerical model of the WFEH connected to a circuit with resistor load (<xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="disp-formula">equation (2)</xref>) was solved using MathWorks® Simulink®. The model was fitted to the experimental data using the MATLAB® function fminsearch. The minimum distance between the plates d<sub>0</sub> and the parasitic capacitance C<sub>par</sub> were used as the fitting parameters. Temporal offset and a small offset in voltage (&lt;1 mV) was allowed in the fitting. After initial set of experiments the value of C<sub>par</sub> was fixed to 0.1 pF.</p><p>In the numerical calculations with variable load the load was in the on-state (10 Ω) when C – C<sub>min</sub> was higher than 99% and lower than 0.2% of the absolute capacitance change C<sub>max</sub> – C<sub>min</sub>. The load was in the off-state (100 GΩ) between these capacitance values. The state was switched smoothly to avoid numerical instabilities.</p><p>The MEMS work-function energy harvester with capacitive comb electrodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> was simulated using a Simulink® model consisting of the coupled <xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="disp-formula">equations (2)</xref>, (5), (7), (8) and <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>gap</italic></sub> = <italic>u</italic> − <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>bi</italic></sub>. The capacitance of the MEMS device was calculated with <xref rid="Equ5" ref-type="disp-formula">equation (5)</xref>, where d(t) = x(t) + x<sub>0</sub> and x<sub>0</sub> is the rest position of the system. The spatial gradient of C<sub>gap</sub> needed in the calculation of the electrostatic force was calculated with ∇<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>gap</italic></sub> = − ε<sub>0</sub><italic>A</italic>/<italic>d</italic>(<italic>t</italic>). The following parameter values were used in the MEMS simulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>: proof mass m = 1.76·10<sup>-5</sup> kg, spring constant k = 2425 N/m, electrode area A = 9·10<sup>-5</sup> m<sup>2</sup> and air gap at rest x<sub>0</sub> = 26 µm. An intrinsic damping coefficient <italic>b</italic> of the simulated device was calculated using the formula for the quality factor <inline-formula id="IEq10"><inline-graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep06799_IEq10_HTML.jpg"/></inline-formula> and a value of 1 pF was assumed for the parasitic capacitance.</p><p>The case of the variable load was simulated by adding an electric switch into our Simulink® model. Switching of the load resistance between 50 GΩ (off-state) to 100 Ω (on-state) was controlled by the time derivative of the capacitance. For better stability the time derivative was used to control the switch instead of the capacitance itself. Charging of the work capacitor took place when dC/dt &lt; 0.01·max(dC/dt) and discharging when dC/dt &gt; –0.002·max(dC/dt).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Fruitful discussions with Ingmar Stuns, Arto Rantala, Andrey Shchepetov and James R.
