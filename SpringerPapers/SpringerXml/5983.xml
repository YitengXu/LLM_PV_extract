Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels resulting from various anthropogenic sources may directly affect the surroundings around pathogens and plants. It is hypothesized that plants may respond differently to pathogens in the environment containing an elevated concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>. To test the hypothesis an experiment was conducted to examine the effects of intermittent exposures of elevated levels of CO<sub>2</sub><italic>viz</italic>., 400, 500 and 600 ppm (5 hr/day on alternate days) on the development of <italic>Sphaerotheca fuliginea</italic> causing powdery mildew disease on five cucurbits species using open-top chambers. The elevated levels of CO<sub>2</sub> acted as a growth promoter and significantly enhanced the plant growth of all five cucurbit species. Inoculation with the fungus incited specific mildew symptoms on the leaves and decreased the plant growth and biomass production of the cucurbits tested except bitter gourd. The intermittent exposures with elevated levels of CO<sub>2</sub> aggravated the disease development. As a result, severe mildew developed on all five cucurbits, including bitter gourd, which expressed tolerance to the pathogen. Fungus colonization in terms of the number of conidia/cm<sup>2</sup> leaf surface was significantly greater on the plants exposed to 500 or 600 ppm CO<sub>2</sub>. The stomata and trichome density and stomatal pore width were increased in the leaves of CO<sub>2</sub> exposed plants. The CO<sub>2</sub> exposures also accelerated the photosynthesis rate, but transpiration, stomatal conductance, salicylic acid and total phenols were decreased; fungus inoculation caused the effects just reverse of CO<sub>2</sub>. Interaction between <italic>S. fuliginea</italic> and CO<sub>2</sub> was found synergistic at 500 ppm, whereas with rest of the concentrations it was near to additive.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology (DST)</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001409</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">SR/SO/PS/0027/2009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Khan</surname><given-names>Mujeebur Rahman</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2020_Article_61790.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Air is an important vital resource for the sustenance as well as the development of living organisms.

These chambers were dynamic in state, without having a stagnation of air in any part of the chamber. The average rate of air flow inside the chamber at different heights was 0.2–0.5 m/s, and the total replacement of the air inside the chamber took place once in 1.0–1.5 min.

The wall in the lower half of the chambers was two-layered, and the inner wall was perforated to introduce CO<sub>2</sub> air mixture into the chamber. The CO<sub>2</sub> gas was introduced into the exposure chambers through the blowing assembly from a gas cylinder filled with 95–98% CO<sub>2</sub> + 2–5% N<sub>2</sub> (Sigma Gases, New Delhi; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

The data (10 replicates) were subjected to a two-factor analysis of variance. The CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations (4 treatments <italic>i.e</italic>., 375, 400, 500 and 600 ppm) was considered as factor-one and inoculation with the powdery mildew fungus as factor-two (2 treatments).

Cucurbit plants are one of the most susceptible hosts to <italic>S. fuliginea</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and formation of powdery mildew colonies on leaves, in particular, is a characteristic symptom of infection by this fungus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. The number and size of the mildew colonies later increased and eventually coalesced covering most of the leaf surface. The severity of disease, however, varied greatly among the five cucurbit species.

Development of the mildew colonies on the leaf surface would have reduced the incidence of light to the mesophyll cells evidenced by a significant reduction in the leaf chlorophyll and carotenoids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Reduction in the photosynthetic pigments is directly correlated with photosynthetic efficiency of the leaf surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. As a result, the photosynthesis rate decreased significantly in all five infected cucurbit species. Further, the photosynthesis rate is inversely proportional to the transpiration rate and stomatal conductance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Moreover, the fungus colonization would have caused partial plugging of stomata cavity or pore by hyphae and/or spores of the fungus. As a result, transpiration rates were invariably decreased in the fungus infected plants. Formation of mildew cover over the leaf surface would have apparently hampered the incidence of light to stomata. Salicylic acid and phenolic are the biochemicals that trigger host defence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, and their synthesis is accelerated in response to any biotic or abiotic stress.

Plants utilize CO<sub>2</sub> gas in the process of photosynthesis. The elevated levels of CO<sub>2</sub> would have created and maintained a higher concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the chloroplast leading to a decrease in the photorespiration. Photorespiration is a process of wasteful release of CO<sub>2</sub> that takes place due to the increase of O<sub>2</sub> concentration in the chloroplast that causes conversion of carboxylate enzyme into oxygenase in C<sub>3</sub> plants. Elevated levels of CO<sub>2</sub> such as 500–600 ppm have been reported to substantially check photorespiration in C<sub>3</sub> plants by reducing O<sub>2</sub> concentration and increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the mesophyll cells. Since cucurbits are typical C<sub>3</sub> plants, 500–600 ppm induced 8–14% increase in photosynthesis in the five cucurbit species tested. The 800 ± 20 ppm CO<sub>2</sub> exposures are reported to increase photosynthesis rate by 16.9%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> and ~700 ppm by 15–25%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.
