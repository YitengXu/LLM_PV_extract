In this work, ESAVD was used to deposit Cu<sub>2</sub>ZnSn(S<sub>1−x</sub>Se<sub>x</sub>)<sub>4</sub> (CZTSSe) absorber. Different alkali metals like Na, Li and Rb were incorporated in CZTSSe compounds to further improve the photovoltaic performances of related devices. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, no experimental study has been carried out to test the effect of Li and Rb incorporation in CZTSSe solar cells. X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and glow discharge spectroscopy have been used to characterize the phase purity, morphology and composition of as-deposited CZTSSe thin films. Photovoltaic properties of the resulting devices were determined by completing the solar cells as follows: Mo/CZTSSe/CdS/i-ZnO/Al:ZnO/Ni/Al. The results showed that Li, Na and Rb incorporation can increase power conversion efficiency of CZTS devices up to 5.5%. The introduction of a thiourea treatment, has improved the quality of the absorber<sup>|</sup>buffer interface, pushed the device efficiency up to 6.3% which is at the moment the best reported result for ESAVD deposited CZTSSe solar cells.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>21028</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>26</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep22109.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>20</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Due to the extremely low raw material costs, earth abundant, sustainability and non-toxicity, kesterite Cu<sub>2</sub>ZnSn(S<sub>1−x</sub>Se<sub>x</sub>)<sub>4</sub> (CZTSSe) compounds can play a major role in future photovoltaic technologies. This key aspect related to their optical properties–bandgap range from 1.0 eV (Cu<sub>2</sub>ZnSnSe<sub>4</sub>) to 1.5 eV (Cu<sub>2</sub>ZnSnS<sub>4</sub>) and absorption coefficient higher than 10<sup>4 </sup>cm<sup>−1</sup> –makes possible to foresee a photovoltaic thin film technology scalable at TW/year. Thus many groups have been focused on elaborating such materials in the past few years, using selenization of vacuum deposited precursors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, co-evaporation of the different elements followed by annealing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, or a hydrazine-based solution processing leading to a record conversion efficiency of 12.7%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Indeed the latter record presents an inconvenience: hydrazine is a relatively toxic and dangerous solvent, which during the years has limited the mass production of solar cells by this method. In order to overcome this problem scientific community has focused on other non-vacuum deposition techniques. Guo <italic>et al.</italic> have reported the synthesis of stoichiometric Cu<sub>2</sub>ZnSnS<sub>4</sub> (CZTS) nanocrystals and showed that the efficiency of derived solar cells can reach as high as 7.2%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Nanocrystals deposition method normally involves complex chemical synthesis and purification process, which is also rather challenging to be scaled up at industrial level. Hillhouse’s group have developed a new solution that yields stable inks composed of molecular complexes in a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/thiourea solution achieving 11% efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In all of the reported high efficiency non-vacuum deposited kesterite solar cells, multilayer spin coating was chosen to deposit the absorber to achieve the desired thickness. Spin coating is a widely used technique for lab use, but it is not suitable for scale up in industry due to its high material consumption, long processing times and the restriction to small-area.</p><p>Electrostatic Spray-Assisted Vapor Deposition (ESAVD) is a non-vacuum process in which a mixture of chemical precursors is atomized to form aerosol. The aerosol is charged and directed towards a heated substrate where it would undergo decomposition and chemical reaction to deposit a stable solid film onto the substrate. ESAVD is a scalable process at industrial level and it can be operated in open air. It is also very easy to be adapted to large area deposition using multiple spray atomizers with the deposition uniformity as high as 90%. ESAVD has demonstrated to be suitable for non-vacuum deposition of Cu(In,Ga)Se<sub>2</sub> (CIGS) and CZTSSe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> as long as other chalcogenides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The setup of ESAVD technique to deposit CZTSSe compounds for this work is already described in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>.</p><p>The beneficial effect for photovoltaic properties coming from the incorporation of alkali metals like sodium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> in chalcogenide-based thin film solar cells has already been widely demonstrated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. It mainly improves device performance through the increase of FF, Voc and hole density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Although the exact role of Na on the structural and electronic properties of the absorber material is not clearly understood, defect passivation at the grain boundaries is nowadays the most considered explanation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In the case of CZTSSe, it has been demonstrated that Na can mainly improve open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill-factor (FF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. To the best of our knowledge, other alkali materials like Li and Rb have never been incorporated in CZTSSe absorbers, therefore, that their possible implications in the absorber quality are unknown. This paper reports in details the characterization methods and experimental results of the CZTSSe layer incorporated with different alkali-content. Results are discussed and evaluated thereafter.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials &amp; Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Substrate preparation</title><p>A 550 nm Mo coated-soda lime glass (R<sub>□ </sub>= 0.60 Ω/□), deoxidized for 10 s in a 10% NH3 solution, was used as the standard substrate. 10 nm of i-ZnO was deposited onto the Mo substrate by magnetron sputtering deposition (HHV 500 Auto vacuum coater, 1.0 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, 10<sup>−3 </sup>mbar, 6.0 sccm Ar and 1.7 sccm O<sub>2</sub>, room temperature, 3 mins), using 99.99% i-ZnO Kurt Lesker purity targets.

The molarity of each element-chloride has been varied in the range 0.1−0.4 M with a step of 0.1 M. The as-deposited CZTS, before selenization annealing, has been soaked in the prepared alkali solution for a time range of 20, 40 and 60 minutes.

As a direct consequence, the possibility of formation of a carbon-rich fine grained layer between the active layer and the Mo substrate is reduced thus decreasing the level of impurities known to be detrimental for minority carriers in photovoltaic devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Starting from this result, the selenization process of as-deposited CZTS has been split in two steps. The first step annealing was performed on a simple hot plate in a N2 glovebox with the following temperature profile: a 2 min ramp from room temperature to 300 °C followed by a 15 min dwell at 300 °C and finally a natural cooling down. After this first annealing step, the samples were placed in a graphite box covered with a lid and containing 60 mg of Se and 120 mg of SnS for selenization. The thermal profile of the second step annealing is designed to follow: a ramp of 30 °C/min to 320 °C, a 2 min dwell at 320 °C, a second ramp of 12 °C/min to 550 °C followed by a 25 min dwell at 550 °C and a natural cooling. The 60 mg Se mass in the graphite box was tailored to reach our current optimum chalcogens ratio ([S]/[S+Se]) content in the material. The presence of the 120 mg SnS pellet is useful to diminish the possible tin-related losses, which could take place during the selenization annealing process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Device fabrication</title><p>After selenization, the heterojunction was completed with approximately 50 nm of CdS layer deposited on top of CZTSSe absorber using chemical bath deposition (CBD) method.

Al:ZnO is deposited by RF-sputtering (HHV 500 Auto vacuum coater, 1.1 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, 10<sup>−3 </sup>mbar, 6 sccm Ar, room temperature, 90 mins), using 99.99% purity targets.

Na incorporation was optimized in ESAVD-deposited kesterites in this work. To do that, four CZTS precursor layers dipped in aqueous sodium solutions with different concentrations (in molar concentration): 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 M for 20 minutes have been employed in full PV devices. A statistical study has been performed on more than 36 solar cells for each sample. The J–V characteristics derived from the best performing photovoltaic devices are depicted in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. It is demonstrated that a sodium concentration of 0.2 M was required to achieve the best power conversion efficiency of 5.5% with Voc of 355 mV, Jsc of 33.5 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> and a FF of 47.8%.

A solar cell with no alkali ion treatment was used as a reference sample, although a small amount of alkali elements from the soda-lime glass substrate might have been migrated into the absorber during selenization. The quantum efficiency in the visible range is promising (~50%) for the three cells; the blue response is reduced in the case of CZTSSe-Na probably due to front surface recombination. The three curves have higher EQE in the near-infrared range (750 nm–1200 nm) as compared to standard CZTSSe solar cells with no alkali content. This could be mainly due to the result of a better current collection due to higher diffusion length of minority carriers generated deep in the absorber (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). The extracted optical bandgap is around 1.08 ± 0.02 eV for CZTSSe-Li and CZTSSe-Rb, whereas a bandgap of 1.12 ± 0.02 eV is extracted for CZTSSe with Na-content (inset in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>External quantum efficiency measurements on best performing CZTSSe solar cells with different alkali ions incorporation (<bold>a</bold>).

An average alloy composition of around x = 0.14 ([S]/[S+Se]) for sample A and B also indicated that Se replaced S in the absorber during the annealing, whereas an alloy x = 0.07 for sample B indicated that almost no S was left in the absorber, therefore, a pure CZTSe layer might have left behind after selenization (the results are summarized in <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).

Since Raman scattering is a surface sensitive technique, the shift of the CZTSSe peaks, as a function of the chalcogens ratio, is only meaningful for approximately the first 100 nm of the layer (penetration depth in CZTSSe with green excitation). However, these results were consistent with the overall anion compositions obtained from EDX, EQE and XRD measurements.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Raman spectra of selenized CZTSSe absorber for sample A, B and C.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep22109_Fig7_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>The Raman spectra from the three samples also showed additional CZTSSe peaks in the frequency region (220–260 cm<sup>−1</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.

As the cationic composition ([Cu]/[Zn+Sn] and [Zn]/[Sn]) resulted almost equivalent for the three samples from EDX analysis, it is expected that changes in Raman peak positions was caused mainly by the anion composition variation ([S]/[Se+S]). The latter assumption is proved by the variation of the A1 CZTSe and CZTS peaks in <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>. Furthermore, full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of peaks was the same for the most intense CZTSSe peak (196–205 cm<sup>−1</sup>) of samples A, B and C.

As showed by XRD and Raman, the authors speculate that alkali elements improved the quality of the absorber by: (i) depleting it from the appearance of harmful secondary phases; (ii) increasing the crystallite size thus reducing carrier recombination near the boundaries; (iii) the absence of significant chemical disorder effects. The increase of the quality of the absorber was also testified by the increase of the collection efficiency of the minority carriers as demonstrated by EQE in the near-infrared range. Moreover, GDS analysis has shown that Li, Rb and Na have no apparent influence on the the uniformity composition of the compound when compared to a reference CZTSSe with no alkali incorporation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>For the first time the effects of incorporation of different doping elements (Li, Rb and Na) on the properties of CZTSSe-based solar cells deposited by ESAVD have been studied. These doping materials were incorporated in the CZTSSe compounds by exposing the CZTS precursor samples in a solution containing these elements prior to selenization annealing. The molarity of the solution and the exposure time have been varied to establish the optimum conditions: 0.2 M for 20 minutes. A statistical study of the PV performances of the derived solar cells has been performed and the results show that the incorporation of Li, Rb and Na are beneficial for PV performances since they can improve the quality of the absorber by increasing grain size and prevent the formation of armful secondary phases. The reported efficiency for the best performing solar cells is 4.8%, 5.7% and 5.5%, respectively for Li-, Rb- and Na-incorporated CZTSSe. Further gain in PCE is reached by performing an HCl+ thiourea treatment after the selenization process and before CdS deposition. This step led the overall efficiency to 6.0% for Li, 6.2% for Na and 6.35% for Rb, which is currently the best reported result for ESAVD-deposited CZTSSe solar cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Altamura, G. <italic>et al.</italic> Influence of alkali metals (Na, Li, Rb) on the performance of electrostatic spray-assisted vapor deposited Cu<sub>2</sub>ZnSn(S,Se)<sub>4</sub> solar cells. <italic>Sci.
