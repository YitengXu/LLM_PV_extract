Herein, we electrooxidize the most abundant natural amino biopolymer chitin to acetate with over 90% yield in hybrid electrolysis. The overall energy consumption of electrolysis can be reduced by 15% due to the thermodynamically and kinetically more favorable chitin oxidation over water oxidation. In obvious contrast to small organics as the anodic reactant, the abundance of chitin endows the new oxidation reaction excellent scalability. A solar-driven electroreforming of chitin and chitin-containing shrimp shell waste is coupled to safe green hydrogen production thanks to the liquid anodic product and suppression of oxygen evolution. Our work thus demonstrates a scalable and safe process for resource upcycling and green hydrogen production for a sustainable energy future.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">The scale-up of the coupling of water electroreduction (HER) with organic electrooxidation remains challenging.

There are many challenges to integrate intermittent and unpredictable renewable energies to existing electric grids without causing interruption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Extensive research has thus been devoted to energy storage devices such as battery systems, which could electrify the end-user sectors such as light-duty transport industry and residential buildings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. However, most of heavy-duty transportation including aircrafts and ships, and energy-intensive industries are difficult to be powered by electricity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In addition, large-scale implementation of energy storage using batteries could be hampered by the low earth abundance of key materials including lithium and cobalt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. To this end, the storage of renewable energy in chemical energy carries is attractive to complement the electrical storage devices. Hydrogen fuel has been considered as one of the most promising chemical energy carriers due to its high energy density, free of greenhouse gas and pollutants emission, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Therefore, to store renewable energy in hydrogen-hydrogen chemical bonds in hydrogen molecules could hold the key to a truly sustainable energy future. Indeed, worldwide efforts have been devoted towards energy storage in hydrogen fuel such as power to gas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, power to X<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, and H<sub>2</sub>@Scale initiatives (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/h2scale" ext-link-type="uri">www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/h2scale</ext-link>), where hydrogen is generated by water electrolysis driven by renewable energies.</p><p id="Par4">Water electrolysis is an industrial process for renewable and scalable green hydrogen generation. Among the three main water electrolysis technologies, namely alkaline water electrolysis (AWE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, proton-exchange-membrane water electrolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, and solid-oxide water electrolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, AWE offers the most cost-effective and scalable method for renewable hydrogen generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Indeed, AWE contributes 2–3 million metric tons of hydrogen annually, i.e., about 4% global hydrogen production per year. The major obstacle for wider implementation of current water electrolysis technology is its much higher price (&gt;$10 kg<sup>−1</sup>) than the dominant methane reforming technology (about $2 kg<sup>−1</sup>) (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/h2a_delivery.html" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/h2a_delivery.html</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. This could be mitigated by decreasing the electricity price that represents about 50% of the cost of AWE hydrogen production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Thus, intensive effort has been devoted to the development of efficient catalysts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> or smart device architectures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> to lower electricity consumption. However, up to 90% of the electricity is consumed by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) that couples to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. This thermodynamic constrain suggests significant reduction of electricity consumption is not possible in HER-OER couple.</p><p id="Par5">Naturally, one may think of driving AWE using renewable energies such as solar or wind (could produce electricity at a price &lt; $0.03 kWh<sup>−1</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the intermittent and uncontrollable solar or wind energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> is not compatible with AWE due to partial load issue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, where serious gas crossover occurs when only partial electrolysis capacity (10–40% typically for AWE) is utilized. A gas mixture of hydrogen and oxygen is explosive at the working condition of electrolyzers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. As a result, AWE system has to be shut down to remove leaked H<sub>2</sub> when its concentration reaches 2% in the oxygen compartment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In order to completely avoid this partial load issue, separating HER from OER in time and space by a recyclable redox mediator has been investigated, including silicotungstic acid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, nickel hydroxide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, (ferrocenylmethyl)trimethylammonium chloride<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, and anthraquinone-2,7-disulfonic acid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Alternatively, one could replace OER with other reactions (e.g., organic oxidation reactions) that are thermodynamically more favorable, and produce liquid products on anode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. These strategies could successfully remove partial load issues and thus allow water electrolysis to couple to renewable energies directly. However, the scalability of hydrogen production is limited because none of these reactants (recyclable redox or organic oxidation reactions) could be as abundant as water, the reactant of HER and OER. In order to address this scalability mismatch issue, it is necessary to couple HER to an anodic reaction that oxidizes abundant reactants. As the most abundant natural amino biopolymer, chitin is ubiquitously found in insect skeleton, fungi, and crustacean shells with an annual production of 100 billion tons in nature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. A knowledge gap for raw biomass electroreforming arises from the rigid polymeric structure of raw biomass. Albeit chitin has comparatively low solubility in water, recent progress shows that optimized mechanochemical amorphization can greatly circumvent this barrier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">In this study, we couple HER to the electrooxidation of the chitin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> for cogeneration of hydrogen and acetate, which could be further upgraded to a more valuable single-cell protein. We find chitin oxidation reaction (COR) is more favorable than OER thermodynamically and kinetically in the AWE setup. We have achieved a nearly complete chitin conversion to acetic acid (HAc)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Such HER-COR couple offers a few apparent advantages. First, the hybrid electrolysis has excellent scalability with abundant reactants on both cathode (water) and anode (chitin), and higher efficiency can be obtained due to the more favorable reaction of COR compared to OER in traditional AWE. Second, the new redox couple completely removes the partial load issue since the by-product generated on the anode is dissolved in a liquid electrolyte, making AWE compatible with intermittent renewable energy. This feature allows membrane-free operation, making a single-compartment electrolyzer possible. Third, a much more valuable product (organic acids that can be further upgraded to protein) is produced on the anode, which can partially recover the operational cost. Since the product on the anode is almost pure acetate, no complicated separation, and extraction processes are required<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Lastly, COR offers significant environmental benefits since chitin is a major composition of solid waste<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.

A membrane can be used to allow transport of OH<sup>−</sup> ions between the cathode and anode while preventing oxidation products from reaching the cathode. A reaction pathway that produces main product of interest here is illustrated in the box (left). Depolymerization of chitin produces its monomer N-acetylglucosamine (NAG), which could be oxidized to produce HAc and glucosamine by deacetylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. The opening of the pyranose ring in glucosamine will produce more HAc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Since the products on the anode are soluble in the electrolyte, there is negligible gaseous product produced if COR dominates the anodic reactions. Moreover, the main product HAc is stable in the redox potential window (−0.4 to 1.7 V vs. RHE), and thus will neither be further oxidized on the anode nor be reduced on the cathode. As such, a membrane-free reactor can be employed for hybrid electrolysis. In addition, the hybrid electrolysis system can directly couple to renewable energy sources since the partial load issue is removed, as will be detailed later.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Hybrid electrolysis for raw biomass reforming and hydrogen evolution.</title><p>Abundant biopolymer chitin exists in exoskeleton of insects and crustaceans.

During activation, the <italic>hp</italic>-Ni/NF electrode was used as the working electrode, and a Pt wire acted as the counter electrode. An Ag/AgCl (sat.

To fabricate the cathode, the surface of <italic>hp</italic>-Ni/NF electrode was converted to Ni<sub>2</sub>P/NF in a chemical vapor deposition system (see Methods and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref> for details).</p><p id="Par9">Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> depicts the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the as-prepared <italic>hp</italic>-Ni/NF sample, which shows a clear 3D hierarchically porous features. The starting NF support was coated with a porous electrodeposited Ni film decorated with porous microspheres (100–200 μm in diameter). The NF skeleton has many pores with sizes ranging from micrometers to millimeters, and the porous microspheres also have numerous pores with sizes ranging from a few to tens of micrometers. The enlarged view of the green square area in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> is displayed in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, which shows that the electrodeposited Ni film is composed of loosely packed Ni nanoparticles separated by nanoscale pores. As a result, the <italic>hp</italic>-Ni/NF electrode has a well-defined hierarchically porous structure with pores size ranging from nanometers to millimeters (see Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref> for more details). Such an electrode structure greatly facilitates mass transport and gas diffusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, as well as exposes as many active sites as possible, which is responsible for the large current density observed. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern [the middle blue curve (as-synthesized <italic>hp</italic>-Ni) in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>] shows that the <italic>hp</italic>-Ni/NF electrode contains crystalline cubic Ni (JCPDS card No. 04-0850), and this monolithic structure can endow the <italic>hp</italic>-Ni/NF electrode with high stability and excellent electrical conductivity. Such cubic Ni phase remained after the COR test [the upper red curve (post-reaction <italic>hp</italic>-Ni) in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>]. The SEM images of the anode after the four-hour COR test (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d, e</xref>) show that the integrity of the electrode structure was well retained, except for some tiny particles coating on the electrode surface, which could be the undissolved chitin crystals. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) spectra (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>) show that the oxygen element increases in concentration relative to that of the Ni element, owing to the anode activation and COR process. The elemental mappings (insets of Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>) further confirm that only nickel oxide/oxyhydroxide is present on the post-COR anode surface. Compared to that of the as-synthesized <italic>hp</italic>-Ni/NF, the peak at 852.4 eV on Ni <italic>2p</italic><sub>3/2</sub> X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum that is ascribed to metallic Ni almost disappeared after COR (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>, see Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref> for the full range spectra). This indicates the completed oxidation of the electrode surface, which is consistent with the increased peak at 856.2 eV. The much stronger peak on O <italic>1s</italic> XPS spectrum of post-COR anode further confirms that the COR process caused deeper oxidation of Ni surface (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref>).

In the absence of chitin, the anode shows good OER activity in basic media with onset potential of 1.55 V vs. RHE. Significant OER current appears after Ni oxidation peak (Ni<sup>2+</sup>→Ni<sup>3+</sup>) at around 1.40 V vs. RHE, indicating Ni<sup>3+</sup> is the active center for water oxidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. In the presence of chitin, the anodic current emerges earlier and increases faster than the pure OER current. Specifically, the current density is Δ<italic>j</italic> ~ 600 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> (or 2.5 times) higher at 1.7 V vs. RHE, and the potential is Δ<italic>V</italic>~ 80 mV lower at 0.4 A cm<sup>−2</sup>, than those of the pure OER curves, suggesting COR is kinetically more favorable than OER (see labels in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). It is noted that, at high overpotential, non-negligible OER could occur concurrently with COR, thus the observed current density comes from both OER and COR (OER + COR). COR and OER are believed to share the same active sites because the generated oxygen decreased when chitin was added, as demonstrated in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>. The EIS spectra at open-circuit voltage (OCV) show that the series resistances <italic>R</italic><sub>s</sub> (left intersection point with <italic>x</italic>-axis) for both OER + COR (red circles) and pure OER (black squares) curves are similar (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref> and the inset of Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). In contrast, the charge-transfer resistance <italic>R</italic><sub>ct</sub> (diameter of the semicircle) of the OER + COR curve is 2.4 times lower than that of the pure OER curve (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). This comparison suggests that the much higher current density observed in CV scan (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>) is caused by a much faster kinetics/reaction rate of COR than that of OER. Similar to OER, the COR current increases after the Ni oxidation peak, suggesting that high-valent Ni species are responsible for chitin oxidation. The differences between the current densities of OER + COR and OER at the same potential are summarized in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>. One can see that the COR current (i.e., the difference between red and black bar) is larger than pure OER current in the full range of the potential applied, and selective chitin oxidation (negligible OER) is possible with a potential lower than 1.55 V vs. RHE. The generated oxygen was analyzed by gas chromatography with a thermal conductivity detector (GC-TCD), as displayed in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>. It is confirmed that the generated oxygen is much less than the theoretical value (i.e., O<sub>2</sub>: H<sub>2</sub> = 1:2). Faradaic efficiency of O<sub>2</sub> at 1.6 V vs. RHE is about 30% (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>), consistent with the current density ratio measured in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> (labeled as *). The Chronoamperometry curve in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> shows that the total current (OER + COR) decreases with the reaction duration. 33.3 mg L<sup>−1</sup> of the initial chitin can be mostly converted in 3.5 h at a potential of 1.7 V vs. RHE. The stability and reusability of the anode for chitin oxidation were also evaluated by repeating oxidation of fresh chitin samples using the same anode. As shown in the inset of Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>, the activity of the anode for chitin oxidation can be well-preserved in three consecutive runs, which can also be corroborated by similar EIS cures (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>). To significantly increase the chitin solubility in KOH electrolyte, we also conducted a mechanochemical pretreatment process (see Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref> and Methods for details). Oxidation of 3.5 g L<sup>−1</sup> milled chitin (M-COR curve in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>) shows much higher current density with an overpotential reduction of 170 mV owing to the increased solubility (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14</xref>), as well as the thermodynamic and kinetic favorability (see Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">15</xref>), due to the greatly reduced molecular weight that will be detailed later. In order to see the potential of COR in energy saving, we tested the monomer of chitin, NAG, which can dissolve well in the electrolyte. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>, the NAG oxidation reaction (NOR) current with 2.2 g L<sup>−1</sup> of NAG as reactant leaps at around 1.24 V vs. RHE, which is much lower than the onset potential of OER around 1.49 V vs. RHE. As a result, highly selective NAG oxidation (without OER) occurs in the potential window ranging from 1.24 to 1.49 V vs. RHE. Such a low onset potential of NOR indicates that Ni<sup>2+</sup> is able to oxidize NAG. The 250 mV reduction in OER overpotential corresponds to 15% energy saving in electrolysis. It is worth noting there is negligible oxygen detected by GC-TCD up to 1.45 V vs. RHE (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">16</xref>). Furthermore, a previously reported precipitation method was adopted to extract potassium acetate product (see Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">17</xref> and Methods for details). An optical image of the powder of potassium acetate hydrate (CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>K·xH<sub>2</sub>O) product is inserted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>, with the detailed characterizations shown in Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">20</xref>. It is noted that the energy ΔG needed for pyranose-ring opening and glycosidic bond breaking is much lower than that of water splitting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. This is consistent with the observed much lower onset potential of NOR than that of OER. However, the thermodynamic advantage of COR over OER is much smaller due to the high degree of polymerization of NAG in chitin, resulting in the extra energy barrier arising from depolymerization.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>COR product identification and quantification</title><p id="Par12">The oxidation products on anode were first identified by GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method after liquid–liquid extraction (LLE) and solid-phase extraction (SPE) using acetyl acetate (EAc) and dichloromethane (DCM) as the solvent and SPE cartridge as the solid-phase column, respectively (see Methods for details). In order to test all possible COR products/ intermediates, we collected the products at various stages of reaction before the reactant was fully converted. LLE extraction using EAc solvent (red spectrum in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>) shows volatile fatty acid (VFA) products, which contains dominantly HAc with minor formic acid, in obvious contrast to flat background spectrum (solvent only). SPE extraction result (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>) shows N-containing chemicals, where NMP appears to be the dominant one. Various other intermediate products were also found by other extraction methods, as shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">21</xref>. To quantify the yield of HAc, GC with flame-ionization detector (GC-FID) measurement was performed, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>. The spectrum of COR product after completely converting 133.3 mg L<sup>−1</sup> of chitin, along with that of the control sample consists of 0.1 mM of standard VFAs, indicates a HAc concentration of 0.5 mM. In order to find out the solubility of chitin in our electrolyte, total carbon content (TOC) was measured and then plotted against added carbon (by weighing chitin reactant), as depicted in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>. One can see that our freeze-thaw method (see Methods) is able to achieve chitin solubility of &gt;= 8.3 mg L<sup>−1</sup> in 1.0 M KOH solution. HAc yield from COR was then calculated by the ratio of carbon in HAc product to that in the chitin reactant. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">22</xref>, the completely dissolved chitin could be effectively oxidized to HAc with over 90% yield, corroborating the opening of pyranose rings in chitin. The polymeric nature of the freeze-thawing dissolved chitin was further confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) (inset of Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>) and <sup>1</sup>H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">23</xref>). The possible reaction pathways are illustrated in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">24</xref> based on the intermediates and products identified. First, chitin is depolymerized and deacetylated under anodic condition to afford glucosamine, releasing HAc from the side chain. Afterward, most glucosamine is further hydrolyzed to open the ring, followed by several oxidations and bond-breakings. All intermediates are unstable under the oxidative environment and finally converted into small organic acids as the reaction progresses. Due to the highly oxidative reaction conditions, only HAc and minor formic acid were collected eventually. On the other hand, minor glucosamine undergoes dehydration to form furanic compounds, followed by either oxygen-nitrogen exchange to produce N-methyl-2-pyrolidone, or rupture of amine group to afford tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol that have all been detected.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Identification and quantification of products.</title><p>Gas chromatography-mass spectrum (GC-MS) analysis of anodic reaction products after <bold>a</bold>, liquid–liquid extraction (LLE) and <bold>b</bold> solid-phase extraction (SPE).

From the evolution of the reactant color with increased reaction time (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">29</xref>), one can see that the electrolyte rapidly became clearer in the first 3-h reaction, and then color slowly faded. Eventually, the electrolyte became almost clear after 24-h reaction. The final product consisted of mainly HAc with minor formic acid (&lt;5%) as suggested by GC-MS (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">30</xref>), GC-FID (inset of Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">26d</xref>), and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) measurements (see Methods for details). The yield of HAc was obtained to range from 73.7 to 77.5% from batch to batch.</p><p id="Par14">Our proof-of-concept single-compartment AWE prototype shows great compatibility with intermittent solar energy. With decreasing the price of PV and wind electricity to $0.02 kW h<sup>−1</sup>, conventional AWE can be more cost-effective ($ 100–400 kW<sup>−1</sup>) than methane reforming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Our hybrid electrolysis will further reduce the price of green hydrogen production via water electrolysis. Moreover, direct coupling of renewable energy to electrolyzer avoids the integration of renewable energy to electrical grid, which faces many challenges currently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. This will also reduce electricity consumption in various AC/DC converters, voltage/current regulators, etc. Lastly, the single-compartment electrolyzer simplifies the overall device and system design, and thus reduces the cost of manufacturing, maintenance, and operation. Albeit the energy consumption of ball mill at current stage still hinders the practical application of our hybrid electrolysis to some extent, further reduction of energy consumption by using the appropriate cocatalyst or/and increasing the processing scale (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Notes</xref>, Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">31</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">32</xref>, and Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref> for more details).

Shrimp shells (Caridina heteropoda), which contain 29 wt% calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), were pretreated under the same kaolinite-assisted ball milling process as chitin pretreatment, except that different ratio was used. CaCO<sub>3</sub> remained insoluble after ball milling and was removed by a simple filtration after dispersing the products in water. While the rest ~71 wt% mass (mainly protein and chitin) underwent partial depolymerization and amorphization under the mechanochemical treatment and then dissolved in water. The MALDI-TOF-MS result (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>) shows that the molecular weight of the dissolved section mainly locates in the range of 800–1300 Da, while the results from size exclusion chromatography coupled with organic carbon detection and organic nitrogen detection (SEC-OCD-OND) (see the inset of Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>) demonstrate that the main categories of the dissolved section are humic substance and low molecular weight polysaccharide.

Electrocatalytic oxidation of chitin that produces high-purity organic acids is coupled to water reduction. Such modified electrolysis is much safer than traditional water electrolysis because the product acetate is dissolved in the electrolyte, and thus avoids the formation of the explosive gas mixture with hydrogen. This feature allows direct coupling of intermittent solar energy to water electrolysis because the partial load issue is addressed. A solar energy-driven membrane-free single-compartment reactor is demonstrated to produce hydrogen gas at the rate of 73 mL per min with over 70% yield of acetic acid from chitin. Most importantly, chitin oxidation is as scalable as water reduction for hydrogen generation because chitin is produced more than 100 billion tons annually in nature. Chitin-containing waste shrimp shell also shows a high conversion rate, suggesting the excellent sustainability of the process. Putting together, the new hybrid electrolysis system has a few advantages over the traditional water electrolysis including (1) free of partial load issue and thus compatible with intermittent renewable energy sources, (2) electrooxidation of chitin reforms raw biomass to commodity chemicals in a green process, (3) much safer operation due to highly soluble products generated on anode, (4) much lower cost due to cheap renewable electricity, simple device configuration, and easy operation, (5) much more valuable product (organic acid) than oxygen is produced on anode, and (6) significant environmental benefit by upcycling chitin/shrimp shell waste, a major composition of solid waste. Therefore, our work paves the way towards a safe and scalable raw biomass electroreforming and green hydrogen production for a sustainable future.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Chemicals</title><p id="Par17">Ammonium chloride, nickel sulfate hexahydrate, potassium hydroxide, potassium ferricyanide, formic acid, sodium sulfate, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, kaolinite, and chitin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, hydrochloric acid and methanol were purchased from VWR, Sodium hypophosphite monohydrate was purchased from Alfa Aesar, Ag/AgCl (sat KCl) was purchased from CHI, and other chemicals were purchased from commercial vendors.
