The PBRs were inoculated with pure <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic>, and the cultivation was conducted in housing state wastewater. The productivity of <italic>C. vulgaris</italic> was found to be 0.0960 g/l/d in a pH-controlled outdoor PBR with pH in between 7.0 and 8.0, 0.0618 g/l/d in outdoor PBR with no control, and 0.0131 g/l/d in indoor pH-controlled PBR (with a fixed pH of 7.5). <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> did not show growth in indoor PBR with no pH control. Indoor PBRs consumed 232 to 270 times more energy and needed 25 to 57 times more capital cost, and 3.8 to 16.8 times more operating cost than that of outdoor PBRs. Outdoor PBRs showed better nutrient removal efficiency of housing state wastewater than that of the wastewater treatment plant, i.e., 100% removal of biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, total phosphorus and more than 96% removal of total nitrogen; However, required time and energy consumption were more in outdoor PBRs. The possibility of improving the process performance by controlling pH, by supplying CO<sub>2</sub> from additional source, and by supplying continuous aeration appears as an attractive option. Although precautions should be taken for CO<sub>2</sub> supply, high concentration CO<sub>2</sub> caused a significant drop in pH and an increase of total dissolved solids. Light transmission efficiency of PBR material polyethylene terephthalate material was 85.45% to 92.08%, and efficiency decreased with the increase in light intensity.</p></abstract><kwd-group

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Microalgae is a promising feedstock and raw material for bioenergy, animal feed, fish feed, human food supplement, medicine, cosmetics products, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Microalgae can be cultivated in any place where enough nutrients, tolerable temperature, and adequate sunlight are available. Even in the places where edible crops cannot be cultivated like non-fertile lands, rocks, hilly areas and on rooftops, microalgae can be cultivated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Like every other plant, CO<sub>2</sub> is one of the necessary nutrients for the growth of microalgae. Therefore algal biomass production systems can be an effective means of CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Sources of CO<sub>2</sub> can be the atmosphere, industrial flue gas, untreated raw biogas or raw natural gas from gas wells, etc. The algal cultivation process can potentially replace the traditional CO<sub>2</sub> removal processes from gas streams where chemicals like amine solvents are used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">Among the possible existence of around one million algal species, only around seventy-two thousand species have been identified so far, and about forty-four thousand species were characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Among the characterized species <italic>Chlorella</italic> strains are considered as potential sources of biofuel because they contain high protein and lipids under unfavorable cultivation conditions like limited nutrients, very high or deficient temperature, or light intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Commercial production of <italic>Chlorella</italic> can be conducted with both freshwaters with fertilizer or with wastewater. Microalgae consume pollutants of wastewater as growth nutrients such as ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, and organic carbon and reduce or remove them during algal cultivation. Integration of wastewater with algal cultivation not only treats wastewater but also offers several benefits like reduction of water footprint and cost as using freshwater and fertilizers or any other nutrients will become inessential.</p><p id="Par4">Microalgae cultivation can be classified broadly into two major categories, i.e., cultivation in Ponds and PBRs. The distinctive characteristics between an open pond system and a PBR are that cultivation in ponds mostly depends on natural resources, whereas PBRs are operated in a controlled environment. An example is given in Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Light enters the pond from the top side only (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>(1), (2) represents morning and afternoon, respectively. Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows that light enters the PBR from all sides except bottom all day round causing more efficient light distribution in the PBR. The PBR requires higher capital and operating cost than that of the pond; as of now 90% of total microalgae is produced commercially in ponds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The cultivation cost can be reduced by installing PBRs in outdoor. The practicality of outdoor PBRs depends on geography and weather. Some small to medium scale entrepreneurs’ have come up with innovative ideas of microalgae production in developing countries in tropical regions. For example, EnerGaia, a startup from Bangkok grows Spirulina on rooftops in 15- to 20-l cylindrical PBRs and sells Spirulina as an edible product. PBRs are receiving more attention from algal researchers, and simple PBRs are used in small to medium scale commercial production.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic diagram of open pond</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/42452_2019_1704_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic diagram of a PBR kept in outdoor, where sunlight is available from sunrise to sunset.

Nevertheless, enough research has not been undertaken to assess microalgae cultivation in outdoor PBRs in tropical regions. As living organisms, microalgae are sensitive to changes in weather. Results obtained from the experiments on microalgae conducted in cold regions may not be useful in tropical weather conditions. Lack of adequate knowledge and data is one of the barriers to the expansion of commercial production of algae in tropical regions. This study attempts to help to fill in this gap. In this study, the experiments were conducted in simple PBRs with housing state wastewater in Bangkok, the capital city of Thailand, a country with a tropical climate. In Thailand, housing state wastewater is a subclassification of municipal wastewater. Only less than one-fourth of municipal wastewater generated in Thailand goes through the wastewater treatment process. Successful microalgae cultivation with wastewater can open new potentialities to address wastewater-related concerns in Thailand as well as other developing countries in tropical regions. The mean dry bulb temperature of Bangkok ranges from 28.46 to 30.23 °C, and the relative humidity is between 70 and 76% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The monthly average sunshine hours are from 3.58 to 9.55 h/day, and the range of monthly average Global Solar Radiation (GSR) is in between 5.64 and 22.53 MJ/m<sup>2</sup>/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> shows satisfactory growth in between 20 and 40 °C, which makes it a viable option for the weather of Bangkok [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> (<italic>C. vulgaris</italic>) is mixotrophic, it has shown satisfactory algal biomass and lipid productivity in autotropic and heterotropic conditions as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This study showcases the comparison of the productivity of microalgae, laboratory-scale capital costs, operating costs and energy consumption of cultivation for both indoor and outdoor systems for <italic>C. vulgaris</italic>. We compared the bioremediation efficiency of algal cultivation system with the traditional water treatment plant. In this study, we also analyzed other engineering problems related to algal cultivation, i.e., CO<sub>2</sub> supply, aeration, and light transmission efficiency.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Microalgae sample</title><p id="Par6">Pure <italic>C. vulgaris</italic> strain was collected from the Thailand Institute of Scientific and Technological Research (TISTR), and then, it was kept in N-8 medium in a dark place at 4 °C.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>PBRs and experimental conditions</title><p id="Par7"><italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> cultivation experiments were conducted with twelve identical vertical tubular-shaped PBRs of 16.5 cm diameter and 6 l volume made of transparent PET material.

The sunlight intensity exceeded optimum condition by several folds, and indoor light intensity was less than half of optimum light intensity. Both low and excess light limit algal growth. This experiment suggests that insufficient light intensity negatively affects algal growth more than excess light intensity. Among the indoor PBRs, microalgae did not grow in the PBR2, whereas algal growth was found in the PBR1. Among the outdoor PBRs, PBR3 displayed better algal density and growth rate than the PBR4. The growth difference between PBR1 and PBR2 and between PBR3 and PBR4 proves the effectiveness of pH control.</p><p id="Par18">Singh et al.

Frumento et al., (2013) reported a specific growth rate of 0.289 1/d and a productivity of 33.4 mg/l/d with 5 Klux light intensity. The above findings suggest that the possible reasons of PBR1’s low productivity and PBR2’s failure were not employing optimum light intensity (because of lack of adequate facility) and using large PBRs (16.5 cm diameter and 4 l culture medium). However, it should be noted that PBRs with large diameter and size are used for commercial practices.

The light transmission efficiency of the PET indoor was 92.08%. Algal growth in outdoor PBRs (PBR3 and PBR4) was monitored for 8 days. The weather condition during those days has been shown in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. Temperature and light intensity varied from 24 to 41 °C and 4559 to 68,193 lx, respectively. Sun condition affected the light intensity and temperature in the day time; however, little variation of temperature was found at night. Light transmission efficiency was examined in various weather conditions such as on a cloudy, rainy, and sunny day outdoor. In all conditions, light transmission efficiency and light intensity showed a negative correlation. For instance, when sunlight intensity was 1935, 28,568, and 59,822 lx, light transmission efficiency was 90.44%, 87.72%, and 85.45%, respectively. This test was performed with PET, but with different types of materials, the result could be in varying trends. As actual amount of light received by the culture medium depends on the light transmission efficiency, a material with higher transmission efficiency requires the deployment of a light source with comparatively less intensity for indoor PBRs. The relation between transmission efficiency and sunlight intensity should be taken into account carefully during material selection for the outdoor PBRs as sunlight intensity changes all year round. Additionally, the durability of the material is also important for a long time algal production. As the transmission efficiency of PET was found to be more than 80% in every condition, it was durable for simple cultivation mechanisms and of low cost, and the PET can be a standard choice for microalgae cultivation with simple operation techniques.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Outdoor weather conditions</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2"><p>Days</p></th><th align="left" rowspan="2"><p>Date</p></th><th align="left" rowspan="2"><p>Weather condition</p></th><th align="left" colspan="3"><p>Temperature (<sup>o</sup>C)</p></th><th align="left" colspan="2"><p>Direct sun light intensity (lux)</p></th></tr><tr><th align="left"><p>11 a.m.</p></th><th align="left"><p>4 p.m.</p></th><th align="left"><p>11 p.m.</p></th><th align="left"><p>11 a.m.</p></th><th align="left"><p>4 p.m.</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>1</p></td><td align="left"><p>14-01-2018</p></td><td align="left"><p>Moderate sunny</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>25.4 ± 0.1</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>28.9 ± 0.1</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>23.7 ± 0.1</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>42,599 ± 201</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>13,261 ± 94</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>2</p></td><td align="left"><p>15-01-2018</p></td><td align="left"><p>Partly sunny</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>26.7 ± 0.1</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>33.5 ± 0.1</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>24.3 ± 0.1</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>42,032 ± 234</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>4559 ± 52</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>3</p></td><td align="left"><p>16-01-2018</p></td><td align="left"><p>Very sunny</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>33.5 ± 0.1</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>38.2 ± 0.1</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>25.3 ± 0.1</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>61,994 ± 334</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>22,581 ± 206</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>4</p></td><td align="left"><p>17-01-2018</p></td><td align="left"><p>Very sunny</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>33.3 ± 0.1</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>36.9 ± 0.1</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>25.7 ± 0.1</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>62,409 ± 352</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>21,922 ± 194</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>5</p></td><td align="left"><p>18-01-2018</p></td><td align="left"><p>Very sunny</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>33.2 ± 0.1</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>34.4 ± 0.1</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>27.0 ± 0.1</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>61,503 ± 315</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>16,205 ± 158</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>6</p></td><td align="left"><p>19-01-2018</p></td><td align="left"><p>Very sunny</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>40.7 ± 0.1</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>37.1 ± 0.1</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>27.1 ± 0.1</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>65,547 ± 327</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>17,951 ± 145</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>7</p></td><td align="left"><p>20-01-2018</p></td><td align="left"><p>Very sunny</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>41.0 ± 0.1</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>35.8 ± 0.1</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>26.6 ± 0.1</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>68,193 ± 344</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>18,903 ± 152</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>8</p></td><td align="left"><p>21-01-2018</p></td><td align="left"><p>Very sunny</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>39.9 ± 0.1</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>36.2 ± 0.1</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>26.5 ± 0.1</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>65,973 ± 316</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>18,439 ± 137</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Cost analysis</title><p id="Par20">Production of microalgae is the primary purpose of commercial algal cultivation.

Air pumps, the only energy-consuming equipment of outdoor PBRs, were accounted for less than 0.5% of the total energy in both PBR1 and PBR2.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Total operating cost</title><p id="Par22">For every cycle of cultivation, PBR4 required minimum operating cost (20 THB), and PBR3 required 2.5 times more than of PBR4. The contributing factors to the higher operating cost of the BR4 were the use of chemical (NaOH) to control pH and longer duration of the cycle (6 days). The operating cost of PBR1 was 336 THB for one cycle, 68% higher than of PBR2. The cycle period of both indoor PBRs was considered the same. Equipment and chemicals used for automatic pH control in PBR1 contributed to the higher operating cost. Operating costs of PBR1 and PBR2 were 16.8 and 10 times PBR4, respectively, and 6.4 and 3.8 times PBR3, respectively. The indoor PBRs consumed significantly higher energy than of outdoor PBRs; this additional energy and more extended cycle period was conducive to the higher operating cost of indoor PBRs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Total capital cost</title><p id="Par23">Parameters of outdoor algal cultivation such as temperature, light intensity, light wavelength or light color, and day/night cycle depend on geographic conditions and weather. The advantages of indoor cultivation systems over outdoor cultivation systems are that most of these parameters are subject to control in indoor systems. The pH of the medium can be controlled both in outdoor and indoor systems. However, the advantages of indoor cultivation systems are bestowed utilizing capital cost and energy consumption. For example, indoor light intensity could be increased to the average outdoor intensity by increasing 20 to 30 times. However, it would also require a higher number of lamps and bulbs which would, in turn, increase the energy consumption and the cost.</p><p id="Par24">In countries like Thailand, where fossil fuel is the dominant energy source, the indoor microalgae cultivation system reduces the attainability of microalgae cultivation as a potential medium of the carbon capture system. For example, In Thailand, 1 kWh of electricity production emits 0.60 kg CO<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In this study, indoor PBRs consumed 232 to 270 times more energy than of outdoor PBRs causing emission of the proportional amount of increased CO<sub>2</sub> emission during algal growth. Outdoor systems (PBR3 and PBR4) were accounted for a total capital cost of 740 THB, whereas it was 30,580 THB for indoor systems (PBR1 and PBR2<bold>)</bold>. The indoor cultivation system requires more land, infrastructure, and equipment inducing more capital costs. Figures <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> show that more area and equipment was required for two PBRs in the indoor system than of the outdoor system. However, capital cost for the roof, building, or land was not considered in this study. The cost required to protect equipment from sudden rain outdoor was reported as “Other” cost in Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>. An equal number of pumps were deployed in both outdoor and indoor systems, but cost of pump accounted for 38% of total outdoor capital cost, whereas it contributed less than 1% of total indoor capital cost. The temperature controller (air conditioner) possessed the highest share of indoor capital cost followed by the pH controller, lighting system (bulb + lamp), and timer. The air conditioner contributed to half, and along with the pH controller contributed to 87.5% of the total indoor capital cost. Controlling temperature and pH with cost-effective innovative techniques would reduce total indoor costs. Among the indoor PBRs, the capital and operating cost of the pH controller was the reason for the difference between PBR1 and PBR2.

In Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, pH in every PBR before and after CO<sub>2</sub> supply is shown. From Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, it is evident that pH drop due to CO<sub>2</sub> was dependent on the pH before the CO<sub>2</sub> supply. The pH trends of after and before CO<sub>2</sub> supply were almost parallel. For the PBRs where pH was not adjusted, higher pH was found every next day. It indicates that, below or around 7.0 pH in the absence of pH control, aeration increases pH of the culture medium. For the first 4 days before CO<sub>2</sub> supply, the pH of PBR3 where pH was controlled manually, was in between 7.0 and 8.0. So, both PBR1 and PBR3 maintained favorable pH condition throughout their respective whole cycle. In PBR2 and PBR4, pH was in between 7.0 and 8.0 for 5th to 9th and 3rd to 6th days, respectively. Similar profile was found for both PBR2 and PBR4 suggesting that pH was not the main reason for not growing microalgae in PBR2. Rachlin and Grosso (1991) claimed that the growth rate of <italic>C. vulgaris</italic> dropped by 78.2% at pH 3.0, 71% at pH 4.0, 55.5% at pH 5.0, and 26.4% at pH 6.2 compared to the maximum growth rate found at pH 7.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Some studies also suggested that frequent pH fluctuation can alter the lipid composition of microalgae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. TDS increased from around 30% to more than 80% with the pH drop in every PBR but never exceeded the standard of treated wastewater effluent in Thailand (500 ppm). CO<sub>2</sub> supply for a long time would cause further pH drop, which would inhibit the algal growth and further increase of TDS. If the cultivation mechanism requires CO<sub>2</sub> supply for a more extended period or continuously, CO<sub>2</sub> can be supplied very low concentrations to prevent rapid pH drop, e.g., Cuellar-Bermudez et al. (2015) reported that continuous aeration with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> kept pH of the medium between 7.0 and 8.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>pH in the PBRs before and after the supply of CO<sub>2</sub></p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/42452_2019_1704_Fig7_HTML.png" id="MO9"/></fig></p><p id="Par26">Aeration was provided continuously to agitate medium to prevent microalgae culture from self-shading especially at higher algal density. Aeration was also a source of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. The absence of aeration caused settling down of the algal cells to the bottom of the PBRs at high algal density. Algal cells settled down in light green cultures when aeration was halted for 10 to 12 h; however, the algal cell settling down required 10 to 12 min at the absence of aeration in dark green medium. Keeping culture medium unstirred for a long time also caused algal cells to adhere to the PBR wall hindering light entrance into PBR. In this particular condition, the start of aeration again did not unfasten most of the cells on the wall; the wall needed cleaning. However, cleaning the wall in the presence of the culture medium is very difficult which may require the withdrawal of culture medium before completion of the cultivation cycle.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Bioremediation efficiency</title><p id="Par27">Bioremediation efficiency was estimated only of the wastewater used in outdoor systems (PBR3 and PBR4) because outdoor systems outperformed indoor systems in terms of productivity, energy consumption, and cost. After that was found, bioremediation efficiency was compared with the wastewater treatment efficiency of the AIT wastewater plant. Algal biomass density of PBR3 and PBR4 reached highest after 4 and 6 days, respectively, but algal growth pattern in the outdoor system was observed for 10 days. The wastewater inside of PBR3 and PBR4 went through bioremediation continuously for 10 days. Details of bioremediation of PBR3 and PBR4 along with wastewater treatment efficiency of AIT wastewater treatment plant are reported in Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>. The complete removal of BOD, COD, and TP was successfully achieved in both PBR3 and PBR4, whereas BOD and COD removal efficiency of the wastewater treatment plant was 70.38% and 90.65%, respectively. Furthermore, 99.28% and 98.01% TKN, 92.02%, and 80.63% nitrate and nitrite and 98.5% and 96.1% TN were removed from the wastewater used in PBR3 and PBR4, respectively. TKN removal efficiency of the wastewater treatment plant in AIT was 72.98%, lower than both outdoor PBRs in this study. AIT treatment plant does not measure TP, TN, nitrite, and nitrate. Although the overall bioremediation performance of PBR3 was slightly better than of PBR4, both of them displayed significantly higher pollutants removal capacity than of the wastewater treatment plant. However, the downside of bioremediation in algal cultivation systems is that it requires more time and energy. Wastewater treatment plant treats all wastewater collected in its collector tank in just 1 day; it also can be operated continuously. Nevertheless, in this experiment, all PBRs were batch, and the residence time of wastewater in outdoor PBRs was 10 days, 10 times higher than the wastewater treatment plant. The plant consumed 0.44 Wh energy for treating 1-l wastewater, 82 times lower than each outdoor PBR.<table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Comparison of the efficiency of AIT wastewater treatment plant and outdoor PBRs</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Contents</p></th><th align="left"><p>Treatment plant effluent</p></th><th align="left"><p>PBR3</p></th><th align="left"><p>PBR4</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>BOD removal percentage (%)</p></td><td align="left"><p>70.38</p></td><td align="left"><p>100 ± 0.00</p></td><td align="left"><p>100 ± 0.00</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>COD removal percentage (%)</p></td><td align="left"><p>90.65</p></td><td align="left"><p>100 ± 0.00</p></td><td align="left"><p>100 ± 0.00</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>TKN removal percentage (%)</p></td><td align="left"><p>72.98</p></td><td align="left"><p>99.28 ± 0.16</p></td><td align="left"><p>98.01 ± 0.24</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Nitrite and nitrate removal percentage (%)</p></td><td align="left"><p>–</p></td><td align="left"><p>92.02 ± 0.21</p></td><td align="left"><p>80.63 ± 0.09</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>TN removal percentage (%)</p></td><td align="left"><p>–</p></td><td align="left"><p>98.51 ± 0.14</p></td><td align="left"><p>96.11 ± 0.22</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>TP removal percentage (%)</p></td><td align="left"><p>–</p></td><td align="left"><p>100 ± 0.00</p></td><td align="left"><p>100 ± 0.00</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Total time required (days)</p></td><td align="left"><p>1</p></td><td align="left"><p>10</p></td><td align="left"><p>10</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Total energy required (Wh/l)</p></td><td align="left"><p>0.44</p></td><td align="left"><p>36.0</p></td><td align="left"><p>36.0</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par28">While there are many studies available on microalgae about nutrient removal from wastewater used in indoor PBRs in literature, limited studies on outdoor PBRs have been found. TN and TP removal were found maximum up to 90% and 100%, respectively, in indoor PBRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Several studies claim that algal systems integrated with different types of wastewater, i.e., brewery wastewater, swine wastewater, municipal wastewater, etc., 90–100% BOD, 60–99.9% COD, 99.96% TP, 100% total carbon and 40–90% ammonium nitrogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Nutrient removal from wastewater depends on algal growth, characteristics of wastewater, the quantity of nutrients and pollutants, incubation period, etc. Usually, very high nutrient removal efficiency is not required from wastewater unless the purpose of treatment is to produce drinking water or water for domestic or industrial usage where water purity is required to be very high. The effluent discharge standard varies from country to country also, such as in Bangladesh “Department of Environment” approved BOD and COD limit of effluent is 50 ppm and 200 ppm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], respectively, and in Germany “Federal Environment Agency” approved BOD and COD limit of municipal wastewater effluent is 15 ppm and 75 ppm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Energy consumption and operation cost of a traditional treatment plant could be changed with change of effluent standard; higher standard requires higher degree of nutrient removal requiring higher cost. But with the result found in this study, bioremediation of outdoor algal cultivation can fit with any standard of wastewater treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par29">This study recommends for outdoor systems over indoor systems for microalgae cultivation in PBRs in tropical regions. Seasonal weather changes would affect algal productivity. Experimentation in different conditions, i.e., cold weather and in the rainy season will help to understand the nature of algal growth throughout the year. The integration of wastewater with an algal cultivation system is recommended because of achieved high bioremediation efficiency in this study. Higher energy and time requirements may cause concern; however, it should be noted that in commercial algal cultivation system bioremediation takes place simultaneously and is part and parcel of algal biomass production, whereas in the wastewater treatment plant the treated effluent has no value addition and the produced sludge is dumped to landfill. pH control is recommended, and manual pH control is preferred because of lower energy and money requirement. Lower concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> and continuous aeration are also recommended for smooth operation. Adequate light transmission efficiency, durability, and low cost make PET a standard material of PBR for simple operations. Simple PBR type and operation mechanism was used in this experiment. Better algal growth can be found by more developed PBR and complex operation mechanisms, but in that case, both operation and capital costs will increase.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Authors express their gratitude to Ranhill Water Technologies (Thai) Ltd. for allowing to collect wastewater and providing
