Indonesia has been actively implementing solar water pumping systems (SWPS) since 1982. However, for almost four decades, SWPS, as a niche innovation, have not achieved significant adoption of solar technology in the water utility sector. This study aimed to assess local governance aspects of SWPS in the context of sustainability transition from two perspectives: internal niche management and local actors. We assessed nine SWPS projects in Yogyakarta Province, Indonesia, using structured interviews that were analyzed using descriptive statistics and qualitative content analysis. The results showed that the discontinuation of support made SWPS unsustainable, operating only for an average of 4Â years. Crucial operational factors included electrical damage, insufficient training, and lack of funds for damage repair. The iterative process of learning, network building, and vision did not eventuate. SWPS have direct benefit on the water supply; however, technological performance feedback related to the karst environment was insufficiently addressed and the network of actors did not expand to higher levels of local government. SWPS were viewed as an unreliable technology; hence, there was no vision for applying SWPS as a water utility. Solar photovoltaic pumps need strong support to compete with diesel and electrical water utility pumps. To achieve sustainability transition, it is imperative to generate vision, promote policy change, and build committed networks within local government rather than simply replicate the number of project installations.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Governance</kwd><kwd>Indonesia</kwd><kwd>Sustainability transition</kwd><kwd>SWPS</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>chapter-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>chapter-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/978-3-031-15904-6_Chapter_23.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></book-part-meta><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par6">Efforts for sustainable<index-term id="ITerm1"><term>Governance</term><index-term><term>local</term></index-term></index-term><index-term id="ITerm2"><term>Sustainability transition</term></index-term>transition<index-term id="ITerm3"><term>Transitions</term></index-term> often begin with niche innovations<index-term id="ITerm4"><term>Innovations</term></index-term> (Geels &amp; Schot, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2007</xref>) carried out in local context and expected to scale up for broader societal changes in a regime selection environment (Schot &amp; Geels, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2008</xref>). Many sustainability experiments have been implemented in a societal context with the expectation of substantial sustainability gains in not only environmental but also social and economic aspects (Sengers et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2019</xref>). Community-scale solar water pumping system (SWPS)<index-term id="ITerm5"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> is one example of an innovation<index-term id="ITerm6"><term>Innovations</term></index-term> to create a more sustainable waterâenergy system. The technology<index-term id="ITerm7"><term>Technologies</term></index-term> combines a pump that operates on electricity generated by photovoltaic (PV) cells. It is an ideal alternative to electricity- and diesel-based pumps that rely heavily on fossil fuel (Li et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">In Indonesia, SWPS<index-term id="ITerm8"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> have been actively implemented since 1982 (UNESCAP, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">1991</xref>). However, the total number of projects is unknown and the official evaluation documents are lacking. Data from Lorentz (Lorentz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">n.d.</xref>), a German supplier of solar pumps, reported approximately 189 SWPS<index-term id="ITerm9"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> projects across Indonesia during 2005â2021. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">23.1</xref> shows the distribution of SWPS<index-term id="ITerm10"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> projects per province on the bivariate thematic ratio map for electrification (Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources Republic of Indonesia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2019</xref>) and decent drinking water<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> (BPS Indonesia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2019</xref>). It is shown in the map that SWPS<index-term id="ITerm11"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> is applied in regions with low electricity and water access, such as Nusa Tenggara Timur (54 projects), as well as regions that have access to both, such as Java Island (19 projects). This provides insight that the SWPS<index-term id="ITerm12"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> has become an interesting option across rural Indonesia, promising an affordable water supply, energy security, and environmental protection.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 23.1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Distribution of SWPS<index-term id="ITerm13"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> projects in the bivariate map of electrification to decent drinking water ratio</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/512479_1_En_23_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"><caption><p id="Par75">An Indonesian map depicts the distribution of S W P S according to electrification and clean water ratio.

The internal process of innovation<index-term id="ITerm16"><term>Innovations</term></index-term> to transition<index-term id="ITerm17"><term>Transitions</term></index-term> has been addressed through a framework of strategic niche management, that is, governance approach to create favorable environment to enhance further development<index-term id="ITerm18"><term>Developments</term></index-term> of new technology<index-term id="ITerm19"><term>Technologies</term></index-term> (Kemp et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1998</xref>; Schot &amp; Geels, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2008</xref>; Seyfang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2014</xref>; Smith et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2016</xref>).

In the Local Government<index-term id="ITerm28"><term>Local governments</term></index-term> Water Utilityâs (PDAM) energy efficiency guidelines and strategic plan of 2018â2022 (Ministry of Public Work Republic of Indonesia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2017</xref>), there is no specific plan to adopt SWPS<index-term id="ITerm29"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> nor RE. Several PDAM had considered using solar power<index-term id="ITerm30"><term>Powers</term></index-term> (PERPAMSI, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2016</xref>; Samudra, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2021</xref>); however, to the best of our knowledge, none is yet to be built. Energy aspect is crucial because PDAM has issues of unstable power<index-term id="ITerm31"><term>Powers</term></index-term> supply from the national grid (Nurmalia et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2006</xref>). Energy is needed at every stage of the water service cycle (Plappally &amp; Lienhard, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2012</xref>) and often accounts for the largest (approximately 55%) proportion of operating costs (IRENA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2015</xref>). RE, specifically solar PV in water utilities, offers opportunities to improve energy security. One example of this is the Valley Center Municipal Water District in California, where 1.1 MW solar PV was applied to supply 20% of the electricity required by the utilityâs largest pumping station (IRENA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2015</xref>). However, in Indonesia, throughout almost four decades of experience implementing SWPS<index-term id="ITerm32"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term>, adoption of this technology<index-term id="ITerm33"><term>Technologies</term></index-term> in water utility operations has not emerged.</p><p id="Par11">Various aspects of SWPS<index-term id="ITerm34"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> in Indonesia have been studied in the last few years. Most papers explored design analysis, technical challenges, and economic feasibilities, such as in Gunungkidul and Banten (Arifin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2018</xref>; Setiawan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">b</xref>; Simamora, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2020</xref>). Development<index-term id="ITerm35"><term>Developments</term></index-term> processes have been evaluated regarding implementation (Primawan &amp; Iswanjono, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>; Riyanto et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2021</xref>; Setiawan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">b</xref>) and the participation<index-term id="ITerm36"><term>Participation</term></index-term> of diverse stakeholders<index-term id="ITerm37"><term>Stakeholders</term></index-term> (Wahyuni et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2015</xref>), which comes from Gunungkidul and Ponorogo. Recently, a paper investigated some socioeconomic impacts of SWPS<index-term id="ITerm38"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> projects in Gunungkidul (Rahmani et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2021</xref>). Despite the growing body of studies on SWPS<index-term id="ITerm39"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> in Indonesia, examination of local<index-term id="ITerm40"><term>Governance</term><index-term><term>locals</term></index-term></index-term> governance aspects has not been sufficiently reported. Initiative from government is crucial for growth and development<index-term id="ITerm41"><term>Developments</term></index-term> of SWPS<index-term id="ITerm42"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term>, as reported in India, where large-scale implementation took place across country, targeting 1 million SWPS<index-term id="ITerm43"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> by 2021 (Rathore et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2018</xref>). In Indonesia, there is a gap in literature about SWPS<index-term id="ITerm44"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> in the context of governance aspect and sustainability transition<index-term id="ITerm45"><term>Sustainability transitions</term></index-term> into a broader water utility application.</p><p id="Par12">This study aimed to assess local<index-term id="ITerm46"><term>Governance</term><index-term><term>locals</term></index-term></index-term> governance aspects in SWPS<index-term id="ITerm47"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> in the context of sustainability transition<index-term id="ITerm48"><term>Sustainability transitions</term></index-term>. We define local governance at two levels: internal niche management<index-term id="ITerm49"><term>Internal niche management</term></index-term> and local actors, including local government<index-term id="ITerm50"><term>Local governments</term></index-term> and the implementing organization. We argue that the lack of a supportive environment from local actors contributes to the unsustainability of SWPS<index-term id="ITerm51"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> in the water utility sector. To show this, we test our hypothesis in a case study. We selected Gunungkidul Regency<index-term id="ITerm52"><term>Regencies</term></index-term> in Yogyakarta<index-term id="ITerm53"><term>Yogyakarta</term></index-term> Province, because several institutions there have actively implemented SWPS<index-term id="ITerm54"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> during 1986â2017. The district comprises a rural region (94%) (BPS Kabupaten Gunungkidul, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2019</xref>) and has a karst landscape, which is formed by the dissolution of carbonate rocks, and prolonged water issues. High rock solubility results in caves and extensive underground aquifers (Bakalowicz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2005</xref>). Water is sourced from caves, deep wells, or springs that are often off-grid and far from settlements. SWPS<index-term id="ITerm55"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> project was expected to solve the water problem. The projects were replicated in many villages, but some local articles reported that systems became fully nonfunctional after several years of operation (Kusuma, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2008</xref>; WKM, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2009</xref>). Official documents concerning the evaluation and performance status were lacking. We investigated nine SWPS<index-term id="ITerm56"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> projects and interviewed community-based organizations (CBOs), the implementing organizations, village and subdistrict leaders, and local governments<index-term id="ITerm57"><term>Local governments</term></index-term>, and conducted a qualitative analysis of their responses.</p><p id="Par13">The novelty of this paper is based on two key points. First, it fills the gap in the current literature dedicated to community-scale SWPS<index-term id="ITerm58"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> regarding the major issue of support systems that enable sustainability transition<index-term id="ITerm59"><term>Sustainability transitions</term></index-term>. Second, the research is innovative in taking the perspective and analysis of institutional arrangements<index-term id="ITerm60"><term>Institutional arrangements</term></index-term> from each actor in the local stakeholder<index-term id="ITerm61"><term>Stakeholders</term></index-term> cohort. As a study case, SWPS<index-term id="ITerm62"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> in Gunungkidul represents the typology of small-scale (&lt;1Â MW) solar PV for productive use, specifically for rural community water supply. Worldwide, India has been the major implementer of SWPS<index-term id="ITerm63"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> for agricultural farms<index-term id="ITerm64"><term>Farms</term></index-term> (Chandel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2015</xref>), while in developed countries, the applications are commonly for ranchland, livestock, and vacation homes (Meah et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">b</xref>). As an RE technology<index-term id="ITerm65"><term>Technologies</term></index-term>, SWPS<index-term id="ITerm66"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> produces the direct benefit of water, not electricity. Therefore, the technology<index-term id="ITerm67"><term>Technologies</term></index-term> performance is strongly associated with an underground aquifer and challenging environmental conditions such as the karst landscape of Gunungkidul.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Analytical Framework</title><p id="Par14">To the best of our knowledge, scholars have not assessed SWPS<index-term id="ITerm68"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> in Indonesia through a niche management framework and the institutional arrangements<index-term id="ITerm69"><term>Institutional arrangements</term></index-term> of local actors; hence, we decided to add these considerations in the research as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">23.3</xref>. We hypothesized that the lack of a supportive environment, from local actors to internal niche, leads to SWPS<index-term id="ITerm70"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> malfunction and eventually difficulty in adopting the technology<index-term id="ITerm71"><term>Technologies</term></index-term>. The first level of analysis is the internal niche. The definitions of niche management process are as follows: (a) <italic>Learning</italic><index-term id="ITerm72"><term>Learning</term></index-term><italic>process</italic> includes the articulation of needs, problems, and possibilities at multiple dimensions. (b) <italic>Network building</italic> contributes to niche development<index-term id="ITerm73"><term>Developments</term></index-term> when it has diverse actors providing multiple views and can mobilize commitment and resources. (c) <italic>Visions and expectations</italic> are crucial to drive the nurturing process and it should be shared among actors (Kemp et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1998</xref>; Schot &amp; Geels, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2008</xref>; Seyfang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2014</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 23.3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Analytical framework</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/512479_1_En_23_Fig3_HTML.png" id="MO3"><caption><p id="Par77">A chart depicts the malfunction of the S W P S project in Indonesia due to a lack of a supportive environment, from local actors to niche management, which leads to difficulties in the water utility sector.</p></caption></graphic></fig></p><p id="Par15">The second step of analysis is the connection of niche with the institutional arrangements<index-term id="ITerm74"><term>Institutional arrangements</term></index-term> of local<index-term id="ITerm75"><term>Governance</term><index-term><term>locals</term></index-term></index-term> actors. In our analysis, local actors consist of local government<index-term id="ITerm76"><term>Local governments</term></index-term> and the implementing organizations. Since the democratizations process in 1998, central government has decentralized many of its function to local government<index-term id="ITerm77"><term>Local governments</term></index-term>, which is divided into autonomous provinces, districts (or regencies<index-term id="ITerm78"><term>Regencies</term></index-term>, <italic>kabupaten</italic>), and municipalities (<italic>kota</italic>) (Usman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2001</xref>). In districts comprising rural areas, there are smaller government administrative units called subdistricts (<italic>kecamatan</italic>) and villages (<italic>desa</italic>). To fully understand the context, we added an important actor in the SWPS<index-term id="ITerm79"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> process: the implementing organizations that drive SWPS<index-term id="ITerm80"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term>development<index-term id="ITerm81"><term>Developments</term></index-term>, such as universities, nonprofit organizations (NPOs), the national agency<index-term id="ITerm82"><term>Agencies</term></index-term>, and international donors. We analyzed the actorsâ governance aspect based on three indicators: policy<index-term id="ITerm83"><term>Policies</term></index-term>, structure, and management. The definitions are as follows: (1) <italic>Policy</italic><index-term id="ITerm84"><term>Policies</term></index-term><italic>and institutional mandate</italic> is how government follows a certain method to achieve the desired result; (2) <italic>Structure</italic> means allocation of responsibility<index-term id="ITerm85"><term>Responsibilities</term></index-term> and budgeting; and (3) <italic>Management</italic> focuses on the governmentâs relationship with society, particularly in regard to engaging in SWPS<index-term id="ITerm86"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> issues (Boesveldt et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2018</xref>; Smits et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2011</xref>). Our findings are intended to encourage decision-makers to create favorable local governance arrangements and policies<index-term id="ITerm87"><term>Policies</term></index-term> that continuously support SWPS<index-term id="ITerm88"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> to achieve sustainable transition<index-term id="ITerm89"><term>Transitions</term></index-term>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title><p id="Par16">This study employed a qualitative analysis using deductive and inductive approaches.

SWPS<index-term id="ITerm131"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> has multiple parts that are exposed to inclement conditions such as bad weather, changes in water level, and human manipulation; therefore, mechanical wear and tear is inevitable. While the design system of each project is different, in general, the pump and controller are the most prone elements of the system. Six projects mentioned problem in the pump (GK1, GK2, GK4, GK6, GK7, GK8) and three projects mentioned problems in the controller/inverter (GK3, GK5, GK 9).

However, from an analysis of institutional arrangements<index-term id="ITerm258"><term>Institutional arrangements</term></index-term>, it is apparent that their policy<index-term id="ITerm259"><term>Policies</term></index-term> mandate, level of responsibility<index-term id="ITerm260"><term>Responsibilities</term></index-term>, and financing are not aligned to continuously support SWPS<index-term id="ITerm261"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term>. Hence, their assistance was discontinued. The Yogyakarta<index-term id="ITerm262"><term>Yogyakarta</term></index-term> province agency<index-term id="ITerm263"><term>Agencies</term></index-term> and Gunungkidul district department were never drivers of the SWPS<index-term id="ITerm264"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term>development<index-term id="ITerm265"><term>Developments</term></index-term>; therefore, they perceived the installations to be outside their scope of responsibility<index-term id="ITerm266"><term>Responsibilities</term></index-term>. At the local government<index-term id="ITerm267"><term>Local governments</term></index-term> level, networks only exist within the village government as the closest government unit to the CBO.</p><p id="Par49">Without a supportive environment, SWPS<index-term id="ITerm268"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term>, as a niche innovation<index-term id="ITerm269"><term>Innovations</term></index-term>, was unstable and unsustainable. The barrier of niche adoption in relation to the karst case-specific problem also needs to be properly addressed. The study area of Gunungkidul Regency<index-term id="ITerm270"><term>Regencies</term></index-term> is challenging for the exploration of and lifting of water to the surface, as said by district departments and implementing organization. Reflecting on the rapid deterioration of electrical components, the karst environment is arguably one of the contributing factors to SWPS<index-term id="ITerm271"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> not meeting expectations in terms of longevity. Interviewees mentioned the problems associated with limestone sedimentation and low water level, which are typical in a karst environment. Karst formations develop a distinct hydrological system that needs specific exploration techniques and approaches (Hartmann et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2014</xref>). Future design configurations should consider such issues to improve SWPS<index-term id="ITerm272"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> durability.</p><p id="Par50">The local government<index-term id="ITerm273"><term>Local governments</term></index-term> has acknowledged the benefit of RE and shown interest in applying the technology<index-term id="ITerm274"><term>Technologies</term></index-term>, as shown in the âRegional Energy Plan 2020â2050â of Yogyakarta<index-term id="ITerm275"><term>Yogyakarta</term></index-term> Province. However, they are yet to involve in water-energy sector and SWPS<index-term id="ITerm276"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> field. From the interview, several barriers existed, such as huge initial investments<index-term id="ITerm277"><term>Investments</term></index-term>, perceived uncertainties<index-term id="ITerm278"><term>Uncertainties</term></index-term> of technological performance, and limited public funding [10], [11], [12]. Unavailability of a supportive environment has made it difficult for SWPS<index-term id="ITerm279"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> to compete with incumbent technology<index-term id="ITerm280"><term>Technologies</term></index-term>, in this case, diesel, and electric utility pumps. Circling back to the vision in project planning, this raises a question regarding how long the SWPS<index-term id="ITerm281"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> is expected to last and whether it is regarded as an interim condition prior to grid electrification (Kumar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2019</xref>). Small-scale SWPS<index-term id="ITerm282"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> in Gunungkidul are unable to fulfill the vision of a reliable water supply. Consequently, visions to apply solar PV in regional water utilities have not yet emerged.</p><p id="Par51">These above findings reflect three points. First, supportive policy<index-term id="ITerm283"><term>Policies</term></index-term> environment that promotes SWPS<index-term id="ITerm284"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> is unavailable in the municipality; as a result, any initiative to build community-scale SWPS<index-term id="ITerm285"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> project could not be integrated into a certain grand plan, and eventually received little support from the municipalities. Further, when a project successfully implemented, there is a deeper structural problem regarding the tendency to deliver early quantitative, measurable results instead of performance and empirical impacts feedback (Derks &amp; Romijn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2019</xref>). Second, as initiator, the implementing organizations have been focused on replicating SWPS<index-term id="ITerm286"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> installations rather than on building networks<index-term id="ITerm287"><term>Governance</term><index-term><term>networks</term></index-term></index-term> with local government<index-term id="ITerm288"><term>Local governments</term></index-term> and bridging policy<index-term id="ITerm289"><term>Policies</term></index-term> change. Political harmonization and support is extremely crucial, including stakeholders<index-term id="ITerm290"><term>Stakeholders</term></index-term>â engagement, creating forums gathering the actors, routine meeting and consultation<index-term id="ITerm291"><term>Consultation</term></index-term>, that induce progress in policy<index-term id="ITerm292"><term>Policies</term></index-term> framework (Sovacool, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2018</xref>). Third, province and district governments have not demonstrated an adaptive governance approach toward SWPS<index-term id="ITerm293"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> installations as an opportunity to initiate more action or strategic intervention in low-carbon development<index-term id="ITerm294"><term>Developments</term></index-term>. Study conducted by Morita et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2020</xref>) mentioned that local government<index-term id="ITerm295"><term>Local governments</term></index-term> level of Indonesia has several challenges to achieve sustainable development goals<index-term id="ITerm296"><term>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</term></index-term>, that are the lack of a coordinated system involving multiple stakeholders<index-term id="ITerm297"><term>Stakeholders</term></index-term>, inadequate capacity, experience, resources<index-term id="ITerm298"><term>Governance</term><index-term><term>resources</term></index-term></index-term>, and data for implementing and reporting. Shortcoming in local level is arguably related to the perception that national authorities is seen as driving forces of renewables (such as Ministry for Energy and Mineral Resources and state electricity company, or PLN), however the lack of coordination<index-term id="ITerm299"><term>Coordination</term></index-term> between national and subnational decision makers also exist (Marquardt, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par52">Delegation from national mandate, such as declaring in national plan<index-term id="ITerm300"><term>National plan</term></index-term> the obligation to adopt SWPS<index-term id="ITerm301"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> in water utility, will not necessarily achieve success in the implementation of sustainability transition<index-term id="ITerm302"><term>Sustainability transitions</term></index-term>. For a local<index-term id="ITerm303"><term>Governance</term><index-term><term>locals</term></index-term></index-term>innovation<index-term id="ITerm304"><term>Innovations</term></index-term> to be successfully adopted in a broader environment, significant changes are required in the institutional and governance aspect. Transition<index-term id="ITerm305"><term>Transitions</term></index-term> management is an iterative process (Loorbach &amp; Rotmans, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2006</xref>), in the process of learning<index-term id="ITerm306"><term>Learning</term></index-term>, systematic monitoring<index-term id="ITerm307"><term>Monitoring</term></index-term>, and evaluation. The intention to scale should be in stakeholder<index-term id="ITerm308"><term>Stakeholders</term></index-term>âs mindset and part of the design to assess the scalability of innovation<index-term id="ITerm309"><term>Innovations</term></index-term>. Then, the decision to scale is based on the evidence, whether the desirable result is achieved and has potential to expand (Holcombe, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2012</xref>). This is not exclusive in our case about the transition<index-term id="ITerm310"><term>Transitions</term></index-term> of SWPS<index-term id="ITerm311"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term>technology<index-term id="ITerm312"><term>Technologies</term></index-term> into water utility, but also in general local RE project that dreamed to pioneer regional energy transition<index-term id="ITerm313"><term>Energy transition</term></index-term>. A dedicated institution has to be in place to facilitate the transition<index-term id="ITerm314"><term>Transitions</term></index-term> process. RE in general has a barrier to high upfront cost, perceived technology<index-term id="ITerm315"><term>Technologies</term></index-term> performance uncertainty<index-term id="ITerm316"><term>Uncertainties</term></index-term>, and risk (Vallecha et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2021</xref>). Hence, a strong leadership<index-term id="ITerm317"><term>Leaderships</term></index-term> and committed institution who willing to take risk and advocating change is very crucial (Sovacool, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2018</xref>). Due to limited public finance, private sector<index-term id="ITerm318"><term>Private sector</term></index-term>investment<index-term id="ITerm319"><term>Investments</term></index-term> will be very important. In essence, the efficacy of transition<index-term id="ITerm320"><term>Transitions</term></index-term> needs capacity building<index-term id="ITerm321"><term>Capacity building</term></index-term>, stakeholder<index-term id="ITerm322"><term>Stakeholders</term></index-term>participation<index-term id="ITerm323"><term>Participation</term></index-term>, policy<index-term id="ITerm324"><term>Policies</term></index-term> alignment, technological learning<index-term id="ITerm325"><term>Learning</term></index-term>, and continuous support commitment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par53">SWPS<index-term id="ITerm326"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> in Indonesia has been developed as a community-scale project since 1982; however, the technology<index-term id="ITerm327"><term>Technologies</term></index-term> is yet to be adopted in the water utility sector. Through the lens of governance, we addressed this problem through an analysis of internal niche management<index-term id="ITerm328"><term>Internal niche management</term></index-term> and local actorsâ arrangements using a case study in Gunungkidul Regency<index-term id="ITerm329"><term>Regencies</term></index-term>. Our data on SWPS<index-term id="ITerm330"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> projects between 1986 and 2017 show that the average lifetime of the nine SWPS<index-term id="ITerm331"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> projects was 4Â years. The discontinuation of support by implementing organizations meant CBOs struggled to overcome system malfunctions. The interviewees repeatedly mentioned that damage to the electrical components was frequently associated with the need for support in order to repair equipment and a lack of reserve funds. The community needs this support due to the insufficient training they received. The iterative process of learning<index-term id="ITerm332"><term>Learning</term></index-term>, network building, and articulation of vision was not pursued. Challenges to the adoption of SWPS<index-term id="ITerm333"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> in a karst environment were insufficiently addressed. The network of actors did not extend to higher local government<index-term id="ITerm334"><term>Local governments</term></index-term> levels (province and district), whereas at the same time, their initiative to engage was also limited. Responsibility<index-term id="ITerm335"><term>Responsibilities</term></index-term> rested on village government as the closest government unit to the CBO; however, there was reluctance at this level to prioritize village funding for SWPS<index-term id="ITerm336"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term>, because it had failed to meet their vision. As an internal niche, SWPS<index-term id="ITerm337"><term>Solar water pumping system (SWPS)</term></index-term> is seen as unstable and unsustainable by CBOs and local government<index-term id="ITerm338"><term>Local governments</term></index-term>; accordingly, there is no vision to apply the technology<index-term id="ITerm339"><term>Technologies</term></index-term> to the larger water utility.</p><p id="Par54">Solar PV pump technology<index-term id="ITerm340"><term>Technologies</term></index-term> needs stronger support to compete with diesel and electric utility pumps in the water utility sector. To achieve sustainability transition<index-term id="ITerm341"><term>Sustainability transitions</term></index-term>, supportive policy<index-term id="ITerm342"><term>Policies</term></index-term> promoting RE-water sectors should be in place, and more efforts on building vision and committed networks in local actors rather than replicating the number of installations. Transition<index-term id="ITerm343"><term>Transitions</term></index-term> management is an iterative learning<index-term id="ITerm344"><term>Learning</term></index-term> cycle; hence, the involved stakeholders<index-term id="ITerm345"><term>Stakeholders</term></index-term> need to be dedicated to facilitating and assisting the process. Using insight from our analytical framework and the Gunungkidul case, it could be helpful for parties to identify similar cases of community-scale RE projects in rural settings.</p><p id="Par55">We consider the following limitations in our research. First, we did not explore diverse aspects such as the market, industry, science, culture, and infrastructure<index-term id="ITerm346"><term>Infrastructures</term></index-term>. Second, we did not delve into the national and local linkage of waterâenergy policy<index-term id="ITerm347"><term>Policies</term></index-term>.
