Aerosol particles are involved in numerous feedback mechanisms in the Arctic, e.g., aerosol-cloud/radiation interactions, which have important climatic implications. To understand changes in different Arctic aerosol types and number concentrations, we have performed a trend analysis of particle number size distributions, their properties, and their associated air mass history at Villum Research Station, northeastern Greenland, from 2010 to 2018. We found that, during spring, the total/ultrafine mode number concentration and the time air masses spent over the open ocean is significantly increasing, which can be ascribed to transport patterns changing to more frequent arrival from the ice-free Greenland Sea. We found that, during summer, the total/ultrafine mode number concentration, the occurrence of the <italic>Nucleation</italic> cluster (i.e. newly formed particles from gas to particle conversion), and the time air masses spent over the open ocean is significantly increasing. This can also be attributed to changing transport patterns, here with air masses arriving more frequently from Baffin Bay. Finally, we found that, during autumn, the ultrafine number concentration and the occurrence of the <italic>Pristine</italic> cluster (i.e. clean, natural Arctic background conditions) is significantly increasing, which is likely due to increasing amounts of accumulated precipitation along the trajectory path and decreasing time air masses spent above the mixed layer, respectively. Our results demonstrate that changing circulation and precipitation patterns are the factors predominantly affecting the trends in aerosol particle number concentrations and the occurrence of different aerosol types in northeastern Greenland.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Danish Environmental Protection Agency and the Danish Energy Agency (MIKA/DANCEA) (project nos.

They can directly affect the surface energy budget through scattering and absorption of light (direct radiative effects) and indirectly through the modification of cloud microphysical properties (indirect radiative effects)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. However, the processes of natural Arctic aerosols and their effects on the radiative balance are poorly characterized in global climate models, thus a more complete understanding of the factors affecting the aerosol burden is pertinent for the prediction of the future Arctic climate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">In the Arctic, there are strong seasonal variations in aerosol particle number size distributions and concentrations, with long-range transport of accumulation (Acc) mode particles (particles with a diameter (D<sub>p</sub>) &gt; 100 nm) in late winter and early spring and local production of ultrafine (UF) mode particles (D<sub>p</sub> &lt; 100 nm) in the summer and autumn seasons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Expansion of the polar dome, limited turbulent transfer due to stably stratified atmospheric layers, and inefficient wet removal in the late winter and early spring allow for the long-range transport and accumulation of anthropogenic pollution (e.g., sulfate and black carbon) in the lower Arctic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, resulting in the Arctic haze phenomenon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">During the summer, contraction of the polar dome, increase in wet removal, and retreating sea ice cause regional sources of aerosols and precursor gases to become more dominant, which is manifested in an increase in nucleation and Aitken mode particles through new particle formation (NPF) and subsequent growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Marine and cryosphere emissions of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and iodine-containing compounds can photochemically oxidize into low-volatility vapors (e.g., sulfuric acid and iodic acid), which can initiate new particle formation and undergo further condensational growth to sizes that can affect cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and thus the atmospheric radiative budget indirectly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. These emissions have been shown to proceed under biotic (marine biological activity in the marginal ice zone) and abiotic (photochemically induced snowpack emissions) conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Biogenic sources can also contribute to the atmospheric burden of aerosol particles through the direct emission of primary particles, especially in the summer months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Changes in the atmospheric burden of aerosol particles have been observed within the Arctic. Recently, Heslin-Rees et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> showed that coarse mode aerosols (most likely of sea spray origin) have increased over the past 2 decades (1999–2016) at Zeppelin Observatory on Svalbard. This was mainly due to changing air mass circulation patterns, with air masses more frequently arriving from the Northern Atlantic, with sea ice decrease having only a marginal influence. Collaud Coen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> recently demonstrated that aerosol radiative properties in the polar regions showed a mix of increasing and decreasing trends, which were seasonally and spatially inhomogeneous. Moffett et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> analyzed summertime particulate methanesulfonic acid (MSA) and non-sea-salt sulfate (nns-SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>) concentrations at Utqiaġvik (formerly known as Barrow), AK from 1998–2017, an increase of 2.5 and 2.1% yr<sup>−1</sup> was observed for MSA and nns-SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>, respectively. Sharma et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> showed that during January–March at Alert, CA, anthropogenic aerosol constituents (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>, H<sup>+</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, non-soil V, non-soil Mn, and equivalent black carbon) have decreased between 23 and 80% between 1980 and 2013 due to emission reductions in Eurasia. Subsequently, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> has increased by 20% while aerosol acidity (defined as the concentration of H<sup>+</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> has decreased by 76%. Sea salt components Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>−</sup> have increased by 19 and 43%, respectively, during November–March. Schmale et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> analyzed nine aerosol chemical species at 10 Arctic sites, they found the majority of significantly decreasing trends are occurring during the winter (due to reductions in anthropogenic emissions) while the summer period displayed a mix of negative and positive trends. Interestingly, during June–August at Alert, CA, MSA decreased by 0.28 ng yr<sup>−1</sup> from 1981–1999, and no significant change after 2000 was observed, while at Kevo, Finland, MSA increased by 0.326 ng yr<sup>−1</sup> from 1965–2010<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. These studies highlight how aerosol properties, both microphysical and chemical, have changed in recent decades, both in different regions and periods, and emphasize the importance of long-term measurements of aerosol microphysical and chemical properties in the High Arctic.</p><p id="Par6">With the Arctic region experiencing drastic changes in the recent decades, illuminating the effects of sea ice retreat, temperature increase, atmospheric transport patterns, and changing biogeochemical cycles, on the formation, growth, and removal of natural aerosols remains a significant hurdle for experimentalists and climate modelers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. There remain key knowledge gaps concerning Arctic aerosols, which need to be addressed to understand the role of anthropogenic and natural aerosols in aerosol–radiation–cloud interactions, and how this relates to Arctic climate change. Therefore, a detailed investigation of the changes in aerosol particle properties (number concentrations and types) and air mass history in the High Arctic was undertaken. This study aims to accomplish the following objectives: (1) determine how the aerosol particle number concentration has changed during the past decade, (2) examine which aerosol types are responsible for this change, and (3) investigate which processes are driving this change.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Seasonality of PNSD, clusters, and air mass history</title><p id="Par7">The particle number size distribution (PNSD) and number concentration of total, UF mode, and Acc mode aerosols at Villum experience a strong seasonality, as evident from Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a and b</xref>, for the years 2010–2018 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> displays the data capture for this period). During the winter, the total number concentration is low, although, during late winter/early spring, Acc mode particles start to build up (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). This is due to inefficient wet removal (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>) and expansion of the polar dome, which enables the transport and subsequent accumulation of anthropogenic emissions from the mid-latitudes to the Arctic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Acc mode particles peak in early spring, which drives the local maximum of total number concentration in April<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, although UF mode particles make a small contribution due to the return of photochemical activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. During May, when the polar dome contracts, long-range transport loses its importance, while wet deposition becomes more prominent (due to the transition from less-efficient ice-phase cloud scavenging to more-efficient warm cloud scavenging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>), and thus accumulation mode particles significantly diminish. During the summer, in the near absence of local sources of Acc mode particles, UF mode particles increase in concentration. The increase occurs in air masses confined to the High Arctic, where there is little to no influence of anthropogenic sources. An increase in biogenic emissions of DMS and organics from the freshly exposed open ocean and marginal ice zones, which are oxidized in the atmosphere, drive NPF and growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.

These are the same clusters found in previous studies at Villum albeit over shorter periods and using different temporal averaging (daily versus hourly in this study)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.

For a schematic of the air mass history calculation see Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>. During winter and early spring, air masses are above the mixed layer (AML) most of the time, when air masses reside below the mixed layer, they traverse mainly over sea ice and snow with minor contributions from the sea. This minor contribution from the sea likely reflects the longer distances traveled by trajectories during the winter months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, while the majority contribution from above the mixed layer reflects the expansion of the polar dome and accompanying long-range transport. During early spring (March and April), similar transport patterns are observed compared to winter, as the polar dome reaches its maximum. In May, when the polar dome starts to recede, air masses spend considerably less time above the mixed layer and more time over sea ice. During the summer, air masses spend most of the time over sea ice and snow with increased contributions from the sea and land, likely due to retreating sea ice and melting snow, as well as air masses being confined to the Arctic region. During autumn, air masses experience the maximum time over the sea (reflecting the minimum sea ice extent) and the time above the mixed layer starts to increase (reflecting the expansion of the polar dome).</p><p id="Par10">The particles associated with the Acc mode clusters (<italic>Acc Bimodal</italic>, <italic>Haze</italic>, and <italic>Aged</italic>) and the <italic>Pristine</italic> cluster spend most of the time above the mixed layer, with contributions from sea ice and snow when below the mixed layer. For the Acc mode clusters, this reflects the influence of long-range transport on the origin of these clusters, while for the <italic>Pristine</italic> cluster, this shows the influence of cloud processing (indicated by the Hoppel minimum at 60 nm,) and wet removal (indicated by the low number concentration for this cluster, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). The particles associated with the UF mode clusters (<italic>Nucleation</italic>, <italic>Bursting</italic>, <italic>Nascent</italic>, and <italic>UF Bimodal</italic>) spend less time above the mixed layer compared to the Acc mode clusters (although they still experience substantial time above the mixed layer, ~50–59%), and increased time over sea ice, sea, and land.

When referring to a direction and magnitude of a trend, it is implied that said trend is statistically significant. The total, UF, and Acc hourly number concentration was temporally aggregated to daily resolution using percentiles from 1 to 100.

The slopes of the total number concentration trends are highest during summer, followed by spring and autumn, and the slopes are largest at the highest percentiles for all three seasons. This indicates that the upper concentration regime of the daily aerosol particle number concentration is increasing at a higher rate than the middle or lower concentration regimes. Given the similarity in the percentiles that show significant trends and similarities in the magnitude of the slopes during spring (total: 2.2–6.4 cm<sup>−3</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>, UF: 0.7–3.9 cm<sup>−3</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>) and summer (total: 3.8–18.1 cm<sup>−3</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>, UF: 2.7–15.5 cm<sup>−3</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>), the increase in total number concentration is likely driven by increases in the UF mode number concentration (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Interestingly, during the autumn, there are more significant trends in the lower and middle percentiles for the UF mode (10<sup>th</sup>–22<sup>nd</sup> and 56<sup>th</sup>–95<sup>th</sup>) than for the total number concentration (75<sup>th</sup>–88<sup>th</sup> and 91<sup>st</sup>–94<sup>th</sup>). Total number concentration slopes (1.33–2.20 cm<sup>−3</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>) and UF mode number concentration slopes (0.6–1.8 cm<sup>−3</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>) are both low during the autumn. For the Acc mode number concentration, there are only a few significant trends in the upper percentiles during spring (86<sup>th</sup>–88<sup>th</sup>) and summer (91<sup>st</sup>–100<sup>th</sup>) and the magnitude of the slope is lower compared to the other size ranges (spring: 1.17–1.23 cm<sup>−3</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>, summer: 1.15–1.23 cm<sup>−3</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). The increase in the upper regimes for the total and UF number concentrations suggests an increase either in the frequency or intensity of NPF events, which contribute greatly to the number concentration at Villum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par13">While it is clear that the total and UF number concentrations are increasing during spring and summer and this increase is strongest in the upper regimes, the mechanisms behind these increases remain unclear. Therefore, to address research objective 2 (examine which aerosol types are responsible for this change), we examined the changes in the temporal occurrence of the PNSD clusters. The results are presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. These trends were calculated using the monthly contribution of each cluster (as described in the Methods section), as the daily contribution produced too many zero values for a reliable trend calculation.

Therefore, this trend analysis informs us about which PNSD clusters are occurring more or less often and not the magnitude of the PNSD in each cluster. The increasing trend for <italic>Nucleation</italic> during summer suggests the increase in the upper regimes of the total/UF mode number concentrations is likely due to an increase in the frequency of NPF events, although further research is required to elucidate whether the intensity of NPF events is increasing or not.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Seasonal trends of PNSD cluster occurrence.</title><p>Trends for the monthly occurrence of each cluster for each meteorological season.

Similarly, trends in each surface footprint type can help elucidate which processes might drive the trends for each cluster. The results of the trend analysis for the surface footprint types are presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. Analogous to the trends in the PNSD clusters, these trends were calculated using the monthly contribution. The time air masses spend over the sea is increasing during spring (0.35 [−0.002–0.93] % yr<sup>−1</sup>) and summer (0.69 [0.15–1.23] % yr<sup>−1</sup>). The geospatial coverage of these surface footprint types and their trends will be discussed below. The time air masses spent above the mixed layer is decreasing during autumn (−1.58 [−3.53–1.17] % yr<sup>−1</sup>). The trend in accumulated precipitation was calculated using the daily median as well as for each percentile (same methodology as used for the trends in number concentration). The daily median of accumulated precipitation is increasing during autumn (0.29 [0.14–0.45] mm yr<sup>−1</sup>) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Trends and their associated confidence intervals for the different percentiles of accumulated precipitation are shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>. Accumulated precipitation is increasing across all percentiles (0.06–0.56 mm yr<sup>−1</sup>) during autumn, with the largest increase seen in the upper regime (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>). Similar to the increase in the upper regimes of the UF/total number concentrations, this suggests that precipitation along the trajectory path is either becoming more intense or more frequent. This increase in precipitation during the autumn has also been observed at Zeppelin Observatory (~5% yr<sup>−1</sup>) during autumn from 1999 to 2016 by Heslin-Rees et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, who applied a similar approach to the one utilized in this study (integrating precipitation along HYSPLIT produced trajectories). While Heslin-Rees et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> used a different meteorological field to drive the HYSPLIT model than this study (GDAS1 vs NCAR/NCEP), this gives confidence that the increase in accumulated precipitation is realistic, it also highlights the need to produce accurate meteorological fields which will aid researchers in future atmospheric studies.

Supplementary Figures <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref> show that as the time air masses spent over the sea reaches the higher deciles, the distribution of total and UF mode number concentration increases during the spring and summer, respectively. Thus, the increase in total and UF mode number concentrations during spring can likely be attributed to the increase in time air masses spent over the sea.</p><p id="Par17">During summer, a correlation analysis between the monthly occurrence of the <italic>Nucleation</italic> cluster and time spent over the sea exhibits a moderately positive correlation (<italic>R</italic> = 0.46, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).

As the percentiles of time spent over the sea increase during summer, the median PNSD experiences a decrease in concentration for particles &gt;100 nm and an increase in particles &lt;100 nm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). The median <italic>Nucleation</italic> cluster PNSD during summer is presented for comparison. Air masses associated with our <italic>Nucleation</italic> cluster spend most of the time over the sea and below the mixed layer during summer compared to other UF mode clusters (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref>). While the PNSDs for the upper percentiles of the time spent over the sea closely resemble that of the <italic>Nucleation</italic> cluster &gt;100 nm, the PNSDs in the UF mode deviate from the <italic>Nucleation</italic> cluster &lt;100 nm. There is a large increase in the concentration of particles between 30 and 40 nm for the upper percentiles of time spent over the sea as well as a slight increase for particles &gt;20 nm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). This indicates that as the time spent over the sea increases so does the number of ultrafine, and thus total, particles (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). It also indicates that the time air masses spent over the sea results in a lowering of the condensation sink (CS) (this relationship is also displayed in a 3-D format in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). The lowering of the CS for air masses below the mixed layer during summer is likely caused by a combination of diminished sources and enhanced sinks. As air masses spend more time below the mixed layer, they are less likely to be influenced by long-range transport of accumulation mode particles (diminished sources) and are more likely to be subject to dry and especially wet deposition (enhanced sinks)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Wet deposition occurs through in-cloud scavenging (cloud droplet activation, in-cloud impaction, and diffusion scavenging) and below-cloud impaction scavenging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Tunved et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> showed precipitation to be a major sink of Acc mode particles and a source of UF mode particles at Zeppelin Observatory during the summer. This results from Acc mode preferentially forming CCN (in-cloud scavenging) and their removal creates conditions conducive for NPF as well as the inefficient in-cloud scavenging of UF mode aerosols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Freud et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, showed that during the summer an increase in the time spent within a cloud decreases the Acc mode number concentration and that an increase in time spent within the boundary layer resulted in a decrease in Acc mode number concentration. These results are valid not only for Villum but for several other Pan-Arctic stations. Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref> shows the seasonal cycle of accumulated precipitation and the percentage of time the trajectory RH was above 95% (a proxy for time spent in-cloud), respectively. While accumulated precipitation peaks during the autumn, the in-cloud proxy peaks during the summer. In-cloud scavenging has been shown to be the more efficient removal mechanism for Acc mode particles over UF mode particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup> while below cloud scavenging is most efficient for UF mode particles compared to Acc mode particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. This likely points toward in-cloud scavenging being the dominant sink, although we cannot draw robust conclusions at this time from our dataset and further research is required to fully elucidate the removal mechanisms of aerosols during the High Arctic summer. The reduction in the CS as air masses spend time below the mixed layer and over the sea is therefore likely a result of diminished sources and enhanced sinks, notably in-cloud scavenging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par18">While a reduction in the CS sets the stage for NPF, other environmental parameters are likely required to reproduce the <italic>Nucleation</italic> cluster PNSD. Other factors that have been shown to influence the aerosol particle number concentrations in the Arctic include increased emission strength of precursor vapors, or the rate of oxidation of said vapors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, increased occurrence of low-level inversions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, or decreased cloud cover over the Arctic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.

Both of these trends were calculated outside of the period in this study, so while they are expected to affect aerosol formation as well as aerosol–cloud–radiation interactions their effect on aerosol particle properties at Villum remains to be seen during this period (2010–2018). Further analysis is required to elucidate the effects of the above-mentioned phenomena on total/UF mode number concentrations as well as the frequency and intensity of new particle formation and growth at Villum.</p><p id="Par19">Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref> shows the effects of accumulated precipitation on the PNSD during autumn. It can be seen that as accumulated precipitation reaches the upper percentiles, the PNSD begins to closely resemble the median <italic>Pristine</italic> cluster PNSD during autumn, although less so for the sub-30 nm size range. The monthly <italic>Pristine</italic> cluster occurrence and monthly mean accumulated precipitation display a moderately positive correlation (<italic>R</italic> = 0.59, <italic>p</italic> = 0.013, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>) and the period of peak <italic>Pristine</italic> cluster occurrence and peak accumulated precipitation are both during the autumn (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). Given the positive correlation and similarity between the PNSD for the upper percentiles of accumulated precipitation and the median <italic>Pristine</italic> cluster PNSD, the increase in the occurrence of the <italic>Pristine</italic> cluster is most likely due to the increase in accumulated precipitation during autumn.</p><p id="Par20">The effect of time spent above the mixed layer on the PNSD and UF/total number concentrations during autumn is displayed in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c and f</xref>. As the time spent above the mixed layer reaches the upper percentiles during autumn, the PNSD strengthens in the Acc mode, although the number concentration generally decreases (except for an increase around the ~85<sup>th</sup> percentile). Conversely, as the time spent above the mixed layer decreases, the UF mode number concentration begins to increase (which is driving a similar pattern for the total number concentration), indicating a surface source of UF mode particles (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>). The distribution of UF mode number concentration binned by deciles of the time spent above the mixed layer supports this posture, with increasing UF mode concentrations with decreasing time spent above the mixed layer during the autumn (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>). This observation, combined with the negative correlation displayed in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>, suggests that decreased time spent above the mixed layer is responsible for the increase in UF mode particles during autumn. While total/UF mode number concentrations both slightly increase with increasing percentiles of accumulated precipitation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14</xref>) concentrations were consistently low for all percentiles. Furthermore, no correlation was found for these parameters during autumn, therefore, there appears to be little effect of the amount of accumulated precipitation on the total/UF mode number concentrations. Increased precipitation will remove Acc mode aerosols, thus lowering the condensation sink, therefore creating conditions conducive for secondary particle formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.

A logical hypothesis to the outcome of research objective 3 (investigate which processes are driving this change) would be retreating sea ice and the exposure of air masses to the open ocean, where biogenic emissions are more likely to escape to the atmosphere if transport patterns are similar between years. However, there was no statistically significant trend for the time spent over the sea ice during any season (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), therefore, we hypothesize that changing transport patterns are driving the increased time spent over the sea during the summer.

Freud et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> analyzed transport patterns for 240-hour back trajectories, regardless of altitude, arriving at Villum from 2010–2013, and found a similar transport pattern during March and April, although with a greater geographical extent due to the extended trajectory length. For trajectory steps over the sea during spring, the main source regions are the Greenland Sea, the Denmark Strait, and the Davis Strait (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). During the spring, trajectories arriving only when SMPS measurements are available are more frequently arriving from the Greenland and Barents Sea and less frequently from the central Arctic Ocean (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). Thus, air masses are experiencing a shift from a northerly origin to a more southerly one. Trajectory steps over the sea are more frequently arriving from the Greenland and Barents Sea, although with much fewer significant trends due to the scarce occurrence of the open ocean during the spring (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>). The shifting transport patterns during spring are supported by a decrease in the frequency of air masses arriving from sea ice-covered regions in the central Arctic Ocean and an increase in the frequency from sea ice-covered regions on the east coast of Greenland and in the Barents Sea, north and west of Svalbard (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">15</xref>).

This observation further supports the postulate of changing transport patterns as the reason for the increased time spent over the sea.

For sea ice concentrations, there are no significant trends in the Greenland Sea during spring nor in Baffin Bay during summer and none of the other parameters listed above exhibit significant trends on this time scale. While sea ice is declining on long time-scales<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup> the period analyzed in this study is likely too short to reflect large-scale significant changes in these parameters. The Arctic Oscillation has exhibited a shift towards more negative values in recent years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>, which indicates increased meridional transport and supports observations in this study, although no significant trends were observed during this period (2010–2018).</p><p id="Par29">This analysis shows that on short time scales at a single site, changes in aerosol number concentrations and PNSDs are affected by transport and precipitation patterns. During the spring and summer, changing transport patterns, to areas of open ocean, are leading to increased total and UF mode aerosol number concentrations, and the increased occurrence of the <italic>Nucleation</italic> cluster. Interestingly, the spring and summer seasons show contrasting source regions, with the Greenland Sea for spring and Baffin Bay for summer. Whilst during the autumn, increases in precipitation are likely driving an increase in the occurrence of the <italic>Pristine</italic> cluster (representing clean, natural Arctic background conditions), and changes in atmospheric dynamics (air masses residing more often below the mixed layer) result in the increase of UF mode particles. The synopsis of this study is that atmospheric dynamics (transport patterns) and sinks (precipitation) influence the aerosol population, however, it remains unclear how the impact of source strengths has changed over this period. The contribution of changing source strengths (concentrations of chlorophyll-a along with individual phytoplankton functional types, emissions of DMS and iodine, and the conversion efficiency of DMS to MSA and sulfuric acid) in Baffin Bay and the Greenland Sea to changes in the aerosol population require further investigation.</p><p id="Par30">The changing total/UF mode aerosol number concentrations will have important implications for aerosol–cloud–radiation interactions during the summer. These changes will alter the short and long-wave radiation budget through increased scattering and absorption (depending on the chemical composition), however, the implications for cloud formation remain to be seen. This will only occur if the aerosols grow to sizes where they can act as CCN, which has been demonstrated at Zeppelin Observatory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and the central Arctic Ocean<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, although not currently for Villum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Resolving the effect of increased aerosol concentrations on cloud formation will have important implications for the radiation budget during the summer, when the cloud-albedo effect results in negative radiative forcing, whereas for the other seasons it is positive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. Similarly, for the autumn season, if the observed trends persist (increase in the occurrence of the <italic>Pristine</italic> cluster and accumulated precipitation, decrease in time air masses spend above the mixed layer) then this could have implications for the CCN burden as well as the CS. With the autumn freeze-up expected to occur later in the year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>, a decrease in the CS (through increased precipitation) and an increase in air masses residing in the mixed layer could extend the period of NPF and growth into the autumn. This will have impacts on cloud formation and the radiative budget, as the autumn is often a CCN-limited regime, therefore increases in CCN active aerosols could increase the downward longwave emissivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. The increase in the occurrence of the Pristine cluster could also increase the supersaturation (through fewer Acc mode particles), and coupled with the increase in UF mode particles could allow sub-micrometer size aerosols to activate more easily into CCN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>. If the observed increase in precipitation continues in the future, there will also be drastic consequences for the Arctic environment.

This work demonstrates how the state of the Arctic is changing fast, as stressed by Schmale et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. These changes will likely drive changes in the aerosol burden for the Arctic region as a whole further impacting the climate locally and by teleconnections globally.

The data were segmented into the different meteorological seasons. A threshold of 50% data coverage for each day (for aerosol number concentration and accumulated precipitation) and month (for PNSD cluster and surface footprint types) was applied to ensure proper statistical representation of each temporal aggregation. The Mann–Kendall test was used to determine the presence of a significant trend at the 90<sup>th</sup>% confidence level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref></sup> and the Theil Sen slope estimator was used to calculate the magnitude of the trend slope<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref></sup>, via the 3PW algorithm from Collaud Coen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. The upper and lower 95<sup>th</sup>% confidence intervals contain the middle 95% of the pairwise slopes, which are normally distributed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref></sup>. These tests require the data to be serially independent and homogeneously distributed, however, these measurements experience significant lag-1 autocorrelation and exhibit distinct seasonal patterns. Therefore, to satisfy the requirements of the Mann–Kendall test, the data were prewhitened (to remove the lag-1 autocorrelation) and the seasonal Mann–Kendall test was applied (to address the seasonality present in the data)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref></sup>. The strong seasonality in the Arctic results in different processes and sources dominating at different times of the year (anthropogenic pollution from long-range transport in winter/spring and natural emissions from regional sources in summer/autumn), therefore investigating trends on a seasonal basis investigates the different processes/sources occurring throughout the year. An alternative approach to satisfying the assumptions of the Mann–Kendall test is averaging to coarser time granularities (monthly, seasonal, or annual averages), although this might not necessarily remove the autocorrelation and will significantly reduce the number of data points, which will decrease the statistical robustness of the results, and gives no seasonal information. Therefore, using the seasonal Mann–Kendall test and prewhitening over coarsely time-resolved data will increase the number of data points (thus increasing the statistical robustness) and determine the season in which these changes are occurring (which, due to the strong seasonality of solar radiation and atmospheric constituents, can have large implications for the climate forcing). The 3PW algorithm utilizes two prewhitening methods prior to testing for statistical significance. The first method from Kulkarni and Storch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref></sup> removes the lag-1 autocorrelation; this method has a low rate of false positives but lowers the power of the Mann–Kendall test. The second prewhitening method from Yue and Wang<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref></sup> removes the trend from the data before prewhitening, this method restores the power of the Mann–Kendall test although increases the rate of false positives. Trends must be statistically significant using both methods to be considered significant in the 3PW algorithm and the significance of the trends is taken as the higher one between the two methods. If a significant trend is present, then the slope is calculated using the variance corrected trend free prewhitening (VCTFPW) method from Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref></sup>, which gives an unbiased estimate of the Theil Sen slope. This method maximizes the advantages of these prewhitening methods and minimizes their disadvantages. It should be noted that the slope and confidence intervals are determined from the Theil Sen slope estimator and the statistical significance is determined from the Mann–Kendall test, therefore trends can be statistically significant while the confidence intervals of the slope can cross zero<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par36">The occurrence of these clusters and time spent over different surface types is based on their relative contribution to the total amount of observations expressed as a percentage, thus their contributions sum to 100%.

This method analyzes only trajectories that are below the mixed layer, therefore, changes in a given grid cell could either be due to a shift in trajectory frequency horizontally (i.e., changing circulation patterns below the mixed layer) or vertically (i.e., air masses residing below the mixed layer more often in a given grid cell).
