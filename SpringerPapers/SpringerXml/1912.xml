However, this technology is not widely used because of control issues, particularly for hydrogen refuelling stations. At present, direct or DC-DC converter couplings are the most common system configurations for hydrogen refuelling stations. However, these system configurations are costly and suffer from gas shortage at hydrogen refuelling stations. Furthermore, the hydrogen produced by such system configurations varies considerably depending on the levels of solar radiation. In order to address these issues, a new system configuration is proposed, incorporating the feedback signal of the storage level in the control system. The photovoltaic (PV) system, electrolyzer, and storage tank are integrated with a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) to determine the backup current compensation for electrolyzer operation in order to obtain the minimum power required for hydrogen production. The proposed FLC is constructed with three input variables which are the PV current, hydrogen storage level, and the battery state of charge. The rules-based fuzzy inference process is based on the proposed configuration which combines the advantages of direct and DC-DC converter coupling configurations. The simulation results show that the proposed configuration offers better adaptability to variable radiation conditions compared to other methods. This gives a more promising option for ensuring the adequacy of hydrogen supply at hydrogen refuelling stations.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Key words</title><kwd>Hydrogen energy</kwd><kwd>Solar energy</kwd><kwd>Hydrogen refueling facility</kwd><kwd>Fuzzy logic</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group><title>CLC number</title><kwd>TK51</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Zhejiang University Press, co-published with Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2013</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2013</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2013</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>11</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/11582_2013_Article_3527.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2013</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>11</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>9</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Mechanical Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Civil Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Classical Continuum Physics</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Industrial Chemistry/Chemical Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="Misc"><p>Project (No. RP012C-13AET) supported by the University of Malaya Research Grant (UMRG) Project (under Cluster Research of Advance Engineering and Technology), Malaysia</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>1 Introduction</title><p>Renewable energy is a primary, domestic, and clean energy resource which is available in endless supply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">Dincer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">Bilgen et al., 2004</xref>). Renewable energy comprises solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower, and biomass harvested without fossil fuels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">Rathore and Panwar, 2007</xref>). Development of renewable energy systems significantly decreases emissions of greenhouse gases that contribute to smog, acid rain, and global warming. Solar energy is potentially the most abundant renewable energy resource available to mankind and hydrogen production from solar energy is considered to be the ultimate solution for sustainable energy. Many studies have described techniques for using solar energy as the primary source of energy production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">Veziroğlu and Kakac, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">Barber and Veziroglu, 2010</xref>). One of the challenges in harnessing solar energy for hydrogen gas production lies in developing an optimum system configuration for hydrogen refuelling stations bearing in mind the significant variations of solar radiation depending upon weather conditions and location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">Levene et al., 2007</xref>). Reports on operational data from the first solar hydrogen system in China indicate that the system efficiency and economic analysis are not cost-effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). Hence, there is an urgent need to improve energy conversion between solar energy and the electrolyzer; this can be achieved by developing optimum system configurations.</p><p>Usually, the solar power system is integrated with a battery and controller to provide constant current output to satisfy load requirements; this is referred to as a DC-DC converter configuration. The excess solar energy is used to recharge the battery but the PV modules and battery need to be oversized in order to prevent energy shortage during critical periods when there is insufficient insolation. This brings additional costs of the inverters, power-conditioning electronics and connections, and the overall system will definitely be more expensive than a stand-alone one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">Gibson and Kelly, 2008</xref>). Currently, the primary focus of hydrogen refuelling stations is to avoid this oversizing by using direct coupling between the photo-voltaic (PV) and hydrogen production systems. This approach has been shown to significantly reduce production costs. The direct coupling method also reduces efficiency losses in energy conversion by reducing the amount of auxiliary equipment. However, this approach is hindered by the fact that the production of hydrogen gas fluctuates according to the solar irradiance received. Hence, hydrogen shortage may occur in a hydrogen refuelling station when the solar irradiance received is less than that desired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">Kelly et al., 2011</xref>). This problem cannot be neglected in tropical rainforest countries where rain occurs frequently, even though most studies have been carried out on sunny/summer days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">Kelly et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2010</xref>).</p><p>In order to address the above issue, a new system configuration is proposed in this paper, which is capable of maintaining hydrogen storage levels by using the feedback signal from the hydrogen storage to determine the buffer battery compensation for insufficient solar energy. The proposed control algorithm combines the direct coupled configuration (which is able to provide higher efficiency) and the DC-DC converter configuration which can give better adaptability to variations in solar irradiance. The integrated system is designed using a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) by defining three input variables (PV current, hydrogen storage level, and battery state of charge) to determine two output variables which are the compensation battery load and the battery charging/discharging condition. A total of 27 rules are applied to construct the relationship between the inputs and outputs based on the designed configuration algorithm. A sample set of solar irradiance data obtained from the Malaysian Meteorological Department (MMD) is used to simulate the performance of the proposed system configuration. Three system configurations are investigated and analyzed based on weather conditions in Malaysia (a rainforest country). The proposed configuration for monitoring the storage level to determine the compensation power supply and its response in cloudy conditions is investigated and analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>2 System configuration</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>2.1 Overview</title><p>A system configuration for coupling a PV system and an electrolyzer is one of the most promising options for producing hydrogen from renewable energy sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">Garciavalverde et al., 2008</xref>). PV and electrolysis of water are both well-known technologies. Numerous studies have investigated the applications and correlation between PV and hydrogen production systems in power generation plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">Abd El-Aal, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">Wang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">Uzunoglu et al., 2009</xref>). The applications and outputs of power generation plants are different compared to hydrogen refuelling stations. In hybrid power plants, hydrogen gas acts as excess energy storage and integrates with the fuel cells to provide the required electricity. However, the main concern for hydrogen refuelling stations is the availability of hydrogen gas. Fuel cells are not relevant in refuelling stations and the system configuration needs to be restructured based on the requirements of hydrogen facilities so that hydrogen gas shortage is avoided.</p><p>An efficient system configuration presents some challenges due to the high variability of solar radiation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">Arriaga et al. (2007)</xref> prescribed a few basic requirements when connecting PV and hydrogen production systems. The system configuration should be able to supply a minimum operating voltage to the hydrogen production system. The system should also contain a minimum number of auxiliary systems such as power-conditioning electronics and DC-DC converters in order to reduce overall efficiency losses. Finally, each subsystem should work at the maximum power point (MPP) to attain the maximum efficiency.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>2.2 Alternative configuration</title><p>Direct coupling configuration of solar-hydrogen systems can be defined as a PV system that is directly connected to an electrolyzer, in which the PV voltage is slightly above or equal to the operating voltage (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). A solar-hydrogen system configuration should be capable of maximizing energy output of the PV system by consistently operating at its MPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">Garciavalverde et al., 2008</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">Gibson and Kelly (2008)</xref>, a direct coupling configuration is capable of attaining higher solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency than one using a DC-DC converter. The current-voltage (<italic>I</italic>-<italic>U</italic>) curves of the PV system and electrolyzer exhibit good agreement when the relative sizing of the PV system and electrolyzer is optimized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">Barbir, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">Garciavalverde et al., 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">Paul and Andrews (2008)</xref> also showed that direct coupling of the PV system and electrolyzer yields an overall annual energy transfer by an appropriate series-parallel combination of both systems. However, direct coupling reduces flexibility in sizing since the voltage range of the electrolyzer must match the range of possible voltages at the MPP in the PV generator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">Garciavalverde et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">Gibson and Kelly, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">Paul and Andrews, 2008</xref>). It can be deduced that the direct coupling configuration of solar hydrogen systems offers higher efficiency, but is negated by the fact that hydrogen production fluctuates according to local solar irradiance. This poses a challenge in hydrogen refuelling stations, as hydrogen storage cannot be ensured during critical periods such as copious rainfall.
<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>Configuration 1: Photovoltaic system direct coupling with electrolyzer</bold></p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11582_2013_3527_Fig1.jpg" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>An alternative configuration used in solar hydrogen systems involves introducing a DC-DC converter to supply the necessary DC current to the electrolyzer at the maximum power of the PV system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">Bilgen, 2001</xref>). The PV output voltage is adjusted upwards or downwards until it meets the operational voltage required by the electrolyzer. When the solar power is higher than the load of the hydrogen system, the excess current from the solar module is used to charge the battery. When the solar power is less than the load required, the controller allows the battery to discharge and to supply a constant current to the hydrogen system. However, the additional resistance imposed by the voltage converters and batteries in these systems also leads to a significant reduction in efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">Gibson and Kelly, 2008</xref>). This configuration is shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">Garciavalverde et al. (2008)</xref> showed that the use of a DC-DC converter improves the adaptability of the system under variable solar radiation conditions and increases flexibility in sizing the PV system and electrolyzer. The main concerns of this configuration are the conversion efficiency and higher cost due to the additional components. The output DC current of the hydrogen refuelling station also influences hydrogen storage due to the fact that high current consumes excess battery energy, whereas low current may cause hydrogen shortage at the refuelling station.

The battery supplies electricity when the solar current is less than the minimum current required to operate the electrolyzer. The battery energy is supplementing the solar energy to achieve the minimum current requirement. The hydrogen storage feedback signal is used to control the charging and discharging conditions of the battery. The proposed system configuration ensures that hydrogen storage is maintained at desired levels. Although much attention has been paid to the output power of solar hydrogen power systems, it should be emphasized that, for refuelling stations, hydrogen gas production is the primary output that is of most importance.

The first step involves clarifying the major requirement of the hydrogen facility, which is to ensure the availability of hydrogen gas with least size and cost of equipment. The input parameters are defined from the configuration algorithm and integrated into the system to form a simulation model. Fuzzy logic control is applied to the model to provide the desired control. The input parameters are classified into different levels in the fuzzification process while the IF-THEN rules are constructed according to the algorithm. The simulation results are defuzzified and analysed in the discussion. The methodology flow chart is shown in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>.

The flow chart in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> shows the control method when sufficient battery capacity is available. The hydrogen storage level is the input that determines whether the battery is in a charging or discharging condition. The PV output current is used to determine the battery discharge load. The battery SOC acts as a feedback signal to avoid overcharge conditions. The battery begins to supply current along with the PV current to the electrolyzer in order to increase the production rate when the hydrogen storage level falls below the desired level. When the storage tank reaches a level above 50%, the battery acts as backup energy for cases where the PV current is more than the minimum operating current, and the system becomes direct coupled. In this manner, the hydrogen storage level in the refuelling station can be monitored and maintained consistently at desired levels based on the available local solar radiation. Moreover, the system can give higher efficiency as a direct coupled system. The control flow chart for the condition of insufficient battery capacity is shown in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>. The system will act as a direct coupling system.

The result shows that the hydrogen production fluctuates with the solar irradiance incident on the PV modules. Hydrogen production is automatically shut off when the PV output current is less than the operating requirement. Thus, in the event of insufficient solar irradiance such as rainy and cloudy conditions, this configuration is incapable of ensuring continuous hydrogen supply in the refuelling station.

Hence, this method is typically implemented in power-saving systems.

In this paper, a novel configuration for a solar powered hydrogen refuelling system is proposed using fuzzy logic control strategy. The proposed algorithm uses the feedback signal from the storage tank to determine the battery compensation load to overcome the insufficiency of solar irradiance received. The system configuration is specifically implemented for hydrogen facilities and responds to the availability of local solar irradiance and the demand for hydrogen gas. Output battery load is defined by a fuzzy control which has three input variables of PV current, storage level, and battery SOC. Set-up of fuzzy rules and parameters of membership functions are determined by the proposed algorithm. The integrated model has been designed and simulated using a MATLAB/ Simulink software package. The results from the simulation show that the proposed configuration has a better adaptability to variable solar irradiance whilst minimising the size of the PV system. Furthermore, the hydrogen gas storage levels can be monitored on an on-going basis, preventing hydrogen shortage. In a nutshell, this study proves that, by using fuzzy logic control, the proposed configuration offers a promising alternative to conventional methods for ensuring the availability of hydrogen.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abd
