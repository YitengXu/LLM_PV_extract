This powerful method has yet to be deployed in the context of nanoparticles—yet size–effect tuning of quantum dots is among their most distinctive and application-relevant features. Here we report the first gradient nanoparticle films to be constructed in a single step. By creating a stable colloid of nanoparticles that are capped with electronic-conduction-compatible ligands we were able to leverage centrifugal casting for thin-films devices. This new method, termed centrifugal colloidal casting, is demonstrated to form films in a bandgap-ordered manner with efficient carrier funnelling towards the lowest energy layer. We constructed the first quantum-gradient photodiode to be formed in a single deposition step and, as a result of the gradient-enhanced electric field, experimentally measured the highest normalized detectivity of any colloidal quantum dot photodetector.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Centrifugal casting is widely used to fabricate functional materials that exhibit built-in spatial gradients due to the variation in material density.

This manufacturing technique has been exploited when large size, low cost and extremely high materials utilization are needed. Metals, ceramics and polymers can be cast with this process, and novel composites can be formed by introducing additional compounds.</p><p id="Par4">Since centrifugal forces act continuously during material casting, solutions containing mixtures of constituent materials will see the various components deposited at different velocities, as determined by the materials’ densities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In most prior applications, the resultant gradient films represent a disadvantage of centrifugal casting, since many applications prize homogeneity rather than segregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">We take the view that materials and devices that benefit from spatial gradients would represent attractive systems in which to feature the excellent scalability and materials utilization efficiency of the process. Until the present work, functional gradient materials made via the centrifugal casting process have focused on bulk metallic, ceramic composite structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">We instead deploy centrifugal casting to form controllably spatially graded architectures that feature nanoscale-tuned particles and properties.

The resultant CQD solids feature nanoparticles whose diameters change programmably over the vertical extent of the film.

We developed a method to prepare a stable solution of CQDs capped using a wide range of short ligand molecules.</p><p id="Par9">We illustrate the method using the specific example of mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), a molecule of particular interest since it led to the best performance achieved in this work. We devised a two-phase exchange to replace long and bulky ligand capped CQDs in a non-polar solvent to a short linker-capped system in a polar solvent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. We combined solutions of as-synthesized oleic acid (OA)-capped PbS CQDs in a non-polar solvent (for example, octane or toluene) with a solution of short MPA ligands in a polar solvent (for example, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or dimethylformamide). After mixing the two-phase mixture containing immiscible layers of polar and non-polar solvent, we observed complete transfer of CQDs from the non-polar to the polar solvent (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). The original organic ligands remain in the non-polar phase. The ligand exchange is complete, confirmed by comparing the infrared absorption spectra for CQDs before and after the ligand exchange procedure (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). After exchange, C–H stretching modes distinctive to OA are no longer present in the spectra. The excitonic features of the PbS CQDs in the optical absorption spectra are fully preserved following the ligand exchange (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). No changes in CQD size and shape were seen, but dense packing was observed, again consistent with complete OA removal (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM404">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Direct formation of CQD solids via centrifugal casting of CQD ink.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Photograph showing the ligand exchange process of OA–PbS CQD solution with MPA molecules.

To implement C3, we placed a substrate in a centrifuge tube, filled the tube with CQD ink (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>) and optimized the choice of tilt angle (∼30°) and rotation speed (∼15,000 <italic>g</italic>) to achieve uniform casting. We found that we could control the centrifugal sedimentation rate of CQDs systematically through the careful addition of small amounts of marginal solvents into the CQD ink. The centrifugation time was determined empirically by observing when the CQD ink became colourless. This supernatant was then discarded and the substrate removed from the tube and further dried at room temperature in air. Given the resultant complete materials utilization, the film thickness was systematically controlled by varying the total volume of CQDs in the solution.</p><p id="Par11">C3 enabled the facile deposition of macroscopically uniform CQD films directly from solution (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM404">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). The method led to compact, void- and crack-free CQD films (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>). CQD films built up using the centrifugal method did not contain the segregated interfaces characteristic of layer-by-layer deposited films, but instead were homogeneous when visualized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM; <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref>). Grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) showed no scattering peak in the CQD films, suggesting the absence of in-plane and out-of-plane ordering (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM404">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). The absorption spectra for the films of MPA-exchanged PbS CQDs closely resembled spectra of the colloidal solution, indicating that the quantum-confined bandgap was fully retained and that the CQDs did not aggregate during the casting process (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM404">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). In films, the ∼30 meV redshift compared with in solution points to the partial relaxation of the quantum confinement due to strong electronic coupling among the particles, combined with the effect of an increased dielectric constant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. The magnitude of the absorption coefficient in the centrifuged film compared favourably with that of the film prepared with a layer-by-layer method, indicating dense packing of CQDs inside the film.</p><p id="Par12">To the best our knowledge, this is the first experimental demonstration of single-step direct fabrication of CQD films employing a stable CQD ink whose constituent nanoparticles were coated using electron-transport-favouring short ligand molecules. We were able to fabricate from a wide range of CQD solutions on a range of substrates, a finding that suggests broad application of C3 processing (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM404">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>CQD size characteristics in C3-created films</title><p id="Par13">Our development of C3 was motivated by the desire to impart gradual changes in nanoparticle diameter, and thus bandgap, via the action of the centrifugal force. We hypothesized that assembling CQDs under an applied centrifugal force would stratify the film by nanoparticle size, giving rise to an additional internal electric field induced by the graded topology that would promote carrier transport.</p><p id="Par14">We therefore studied the conditions for spatial CQD gradient formation, first examining the sedimentation rate of differently sized particles in a mixture of CQDs (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). We obtained absorption spectra of the colloidal dispersion at many stages along the centrifugal deposition process. The studied solution contained a mixture of three different-sized MPA–CQDs with excitonic peaks of 950, 1,250 and 1,520 nm, making clear comparisons possible.
