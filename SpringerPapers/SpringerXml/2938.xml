Although binary metal oxides (such as TiO<sub>2</sub>, ZnO and SnO<sub>2</sub>) are widely acknowledged as being highly suited semiconductor materials for these applications, ternary metal oxides such as Zn<sub>2</sub>SnO<sub>4</sub> (ZTO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, Zn<sub>2</sub>TiO<sub>3</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and BaSnO<sub>3</sub> have recently emerged as promising alternatives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. This is because ternary metal oxides exhibit several advantages. For instance, ternary metal oxides allow for a broader choice of materials. Further, they exhibit better corrosion resistance than do binary metal oxides. Finally, their chemical and electrical properties can be readily tailored by altering their composition. As a result, ternary metal oxides have recently been investigated for use as photoelectrode materials for DSSCs.</p><p>In particular, ZTO is being investigated extensively for use as a photoelectrode material for DSSCs because it exhibits a high electron mobility (15 cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>; in contrast that of TiO<sub>2</sub> is 0.1–1 cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) and an appropriate surface work function (~3.6 eV). In addition, it can also be readily synthesized in the form of nanoparticles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Recently, Wu and coworkers reported the fabrication of DSSCs using ZTO nanoparticles (NPs) as the photoelectrode material. The DSCCs exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Similarly, our group fabricated amorphous ZTO nanofibers using the electrospinning method and used them as a photoelectrode material for DSSCs. The improved electron-transport properties of the ZTO nanofibers resulted in the cells exhibiting a PCE of 3.7%. It is known that photoelectrode materials with a one-dimensional (1D) morphology have lower charge-recombination rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>; however, the increase in the performance of the cells owing to the use of the nanofibers was limited because charge transport in the amorphous ZTO nanofibers was not optimized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Further improvements in ZTO nanomaterials in terms of their crystallinity and morphology, resulting in improved electron transport, dye absorption and light scattering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, will lead to ZTO-based DSSCs showing even better performances. Further, the development of sensitizers that have high molar absorbabilities and are sufficiently compatibility with ZTO is also essential for improvements in the performance of ZTO-based DSSCs.</p><p>In this study, we fabricated high-efficiency DSSCs using novel ZTO materials and organic sensitizers. We first synthesized uniformly sized amphiphilic ZTO nanoparticles (ZTO-NP) in aqueous media. Next, we used a unique fabrication method to obtain hierarchically structured mesoporous ZTO beads (ZTO-B) through electrostatic spraying (e-spraying). Finally, we used organic sensitizers that exhibited high absorbabilities and were highly compatible with the ZTO beads to fabricate ZTO photoelectrodes. The submicron-scaled ZTO-Bs (~600 nm), which contained embedded ZTO-NPs (~20 nm), were fabricated by the e-spraying of a colloidal dispersion of the amphiphilic ZTO-NPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Two different organic sensitizers (SJ-T1 and SJ-ET1), both of which have a donor-π-conjugated-acceptor (D-π-A) structure, were synthesized and used as the dyes for the DSSCs. The performances of the organic dye-sensitized cells fabricated using the various ZTO-based photoelectrodes were investigated and compared with those of cells based on a conventional ruthenium complex dye (N719). Using the ZTO-B photoelectrodes led to the PCE of the corresponding DSSCs to be almost twice that of cells based on the ZTO-NP photoelectrodes. Further, the PCE values of the DSSCs based on the organic dyes were approximately thrice those of the cells based on the conventional N719 dye. The optimized SJ-ET1-sensitized DSSCs displayed the highest PCE value, which was as high as ~6.3%, when 5-μm-thick ZTO-B photoelectrodes were used. To the best of our knowledge, this result is the highest value ever achieved in ternary metal oxide-based DSSCs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results Section</title><p>The amphiphilic ZTO-NPs were synthesized by the hydrothermal sol-gel method using ZnSn(OH)<sub>6</sub> as the precursor. The fabrication method is described in the Experimental section and in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S1 in Supporting Information (SI)</xref>. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> show the evolution of the ZTO precursor, ZnSn(OH)<sub>6</sub>, into the ZTO-NPs through a sol-gel conversion process. The TEM images (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A to G</xref>) were obtained after hydrothermal treatments of different durations (T<sub>D</sub>). In the early stage, small rods of ZnSn(OH)<sub>6</sub>, which had a size of ~70 nm and whose surfaces were covered with crystalline ZTO, were formed (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.s 1A–F</xref>). The NPs started to form when T<sub>D</sub> was greater than 10 h; these rods increased to approximately 10–30 nm in diameter after a reaction time of 30 h (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). The resulting ZTO-NPs were modified using an amphiphilic surfactant, tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH), under ultrasonication, affording a stable colloidal dispersion of the ZTO-NPs in ethanol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S2</xref>). The zeta potential of the colloidal ZTO-NP dispersion was less than −35 mV, confirming that it was highly stable over a period of several months at room temperature. The average diameter of the ZTO-NPs was ~20 nm (see TEM image in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S1</xref>). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>) of the NPs were indexed to the reflection of the polycrystalline ZTO in the structure. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the ZTO-NPs is shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>. The characteristic peaks of crystalline zinc stannate, that is, the (220), (311), (220), (400), (422) and (511) peaks, were observed after calcination. These peaks corresponded to a spinel structure, in which all the Sn<sup>4+</sup> ions are octahedrally coordinated, while half of the Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions are distributed in a tetrahedral coordination and the other half in an octahedral coordination. The estimated lattice parameter was 8.68 Å, which is in a good agreement with the reported value of 8.65 Å (JCPDS Card No. 6–416). On the other hand, the XRD spectrum of the white precipitate formed after the mixing of the Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions with the Sn<sup>2+</sup> ions (the amorphous structure is shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>, green line) did not correspond to that of ZTO. Thus, it can be concluded that the treatment of the ZTO precursor at 220°C for 30 h in the autoclave resulted in the formation of zinc stannate.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>TEM images of the reaction products after various hydrothermal treatment times during ZTO synthesis (A ~ F), ZTO-NPs after completion of the synthesis (G), diffraction patterns of the polycrystalline ZTO nanoparticle powder (H), high-resolution TEM images of the ZTO (I) (yellow lines illustrate ZTO fringes), XRD patterns (J), morphology changes during synthesis process (K).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep07353_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>The ZTO-Bs were prepared by the e-spraying method using the ZTO colloidal solution (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S3 in SI</xref>). The colloidal dispersion of the ZTO-NPs was directly e-sprayed onto a fluorine-doped SnO<sub>2</sub> (FTO)-coated glass substrate. The resulting submicron-scaled ZTO-Bs possessed a hierarchical structure (particles-in-beads), as can be seen from their scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The ZTO-Bs exhibited a relatively narrow size distribution, evenly covering the entire area of the substrate, as shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S3</xref>. The average diameter of the ZTO-Bs was determined to be ~600 nm using Gaussian curve fitting (inset in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). It should be noted that the ZTO dispersion should exhibit sufficient colloidal stability and solvent polarity to allow for the fabrication of hierarchically structured ZTO-Bs by the e-spraying process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The size of the ZTO-Bs could be controlled by manipulating the e-spraying parameters such as the applied voltage, the concentration of ZTO in the dispersion and the solvent composition. In this study, we chose to fabricate ZTO-Bs with an average size of ~600 nm in order to enhance the degree of visible light-scattering and hence the light-harvesting efficiency of the cells (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Within the ZTO-Bs, the embedded primary ZTO-NPs were closely packed together, with the ZTO-Bs exhibiting the particles-in-beads structure shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>SEM images of the hierarchically structured e-sprayed ZTO-Bs on FTO/glass (A and B) and size distribution of ZTO-Bs used in this study (inserted graph – line is the fitted result by Gaussian function), illustration of ZTO-B (C), Diffused reflectance spectra (D), nitrogen sorption isotherms (E) and pore volume distribution of the ZTO based photoelectrodes (green: ZTO-NP, red: ZTO-B).

The results are listed in <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. In order to elucidate the effects of the morphological characteristics of the fabricated ZTO-Bs on their performance as a photoelectrode material for DSSCs, we also prepared ZTO-NP-based photoelectrodes by e-spraying a colloidal solution of ZTO-NPs that did not exhibit a “particles-in-beads” structure and compared the performances of the two. The specific surface areas of the e-sprayed ZTO-Bs and ZTO-NPs were 98.6 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup> and 66.4 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup>, while the porosities (P) of the ZTO-Bs and ZTO-NPs were 74.5% and 64.6%, respectively (<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These results demonstrated that the ZTO-B-based photoelectrodes had a larger surface area and higher porosity than did the ZTO-NP-based photoelectrodes.

That the molar extinction coefficients of the organic dyes (SJ-T1 and SJ-ET1) were higher than those of N719, the most commonly used ruthenium-based dye, can be deduced from the fact that the short-circuit current density of the cells based on the former was higher. The high absorbability of the organic dyes also allowed for the required thickness of the ZTO photoelectrodes to be reduced, lowering the charge-transport distance. The highest <italic>J</italic><sub>SC</sub> value of the organic dye-based DSSC-ZTOs was exhibited at a thickness of ~5 μm; at this thickness, the absorption level and the rate of charge transport were at the optimal levels. On the other hand, the optimal photoelectrode thickness was &gt;10 μm in the case of the N719-based DSSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig.s S8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Tables S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S5</xref>).</p><p>In addition to improving light harvesting, the hierarchical morphology of the ZTO-Bs also enhanced the charge-transport properties in the resultant DSSCs. The internal series resistance (<italic>R</italic><sub>S</sub>) values of the cells, which are closely related to their FF values, were determined through electrochemical impedance (EIS) analysis. The procedure for determining the <italic>R</italic><sub>S</sub> values of the DSSCs from the results of the EIS-based characterization of the DSSC-ZTOs is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig.s S11</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S12</xref>. The Nyquist plot in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S11A</xref> shows that the <italic>R</italic><sub>S</sub> values of the DSSC-ZTO-Bs were lower than that of the DSSC-ZTO-NPs, regardless of the dye used. This result was in a good agreement with the fact that the FF of the DSSC-ZTO-Bs was higher than that of the DSSC-ZTO-NPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Table S6</xref>). This can be attributed to the presence of macropores in ZTO-Bs, which facilitated the penetration of the electrolyte into the ZTO photoelectrodes, allowing the surfaces of the photoelectrodes to be wetted to a greater degree. This phenomenon has been noticed in photoelectrodes based on other hierarchical materials as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p>The charge-transport times (τ<sub>CT</sub>) and recombination lifetimes (τ<sub>R</sub>) of the DSSC-ZTOs were determined using the intensity-modulated photocurrent/photovoltage (IMPS/IMVS) analysis techniques; the results are shown in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.s 4C–F</xref>. The τ<sub>CT</sub> values were estimated from the results of the IMPS analysis using the following relation: τ<sub>CT</sub> = 1/2π <italic>f</italic><sub>min(IMPS)</sub>, where <italic>f</italic><sub>min</sub> is the minimum current of the imaginary part of the low-frequency range in the IMPS spectra (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S13</xref>). The τ<sub>CT</sub> value of the DSSC-ZTO-Bs was more than two times smaller than that of the DSSC-ZTO-NPs; this can be attributed to the lower junction density of the hierarchical structure of the ZTO-Bs. The tightly connected primary ZTO-NPs packed within the ZTO-Bs (see the SEM images in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) exhibited a lower resistance for charge transport compared to the randomly stacked ZTO-NPs; this was regardless of whether they were fabricated by e-spraying or using a doctor's blade. The net charge transport was greater in the ZTO-B photoelectrodes than in the ZTO-NP photoelectrodes, even though the total charge-transport distance may have been greater in the former owing to the pore volume being higher. The τ<sub>R</sub> values were estimated from the results of the IMVS analysis (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>) using the following relation: τ<sub><italic>r</italic></sub> = 1/2π <italic>f</italic><sub>min(IMVS)</sub>, where <italic>f</italic><sub>min</sub> is the minimum voltage in the imaginary part of the low-frequency range of the IMVS spectra. The τ<sub>R</sub> value of the DSSC-ZTO-Bs was ~6 times higher than that of the DSSC-ZTO-NPs under an incident photon flux of 3.18 × 10<sup>18</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S13B in SI</xref>.

This result indicated that the probability of the electrons arriving from the ZTO-B photoelectrode layers to the charge-collecting electrode (FTO) was considerably higher than that of them arriving from the ZTO-NP photoelectrodes. The charge-collection efficiency (η<sub>CC</sub>) of the DSSC-ZTO-Bs, determined from the relationship η<sub>CC</sub> = 1 - (τ<sub>CT</sub>/τ<sub>R</sub>), was an order of magnitude greater than that of the DSSC-ZTO-NPs, owing to the longer charge-recombination lifetime and shorter electron-transport time of the former. The higher η<sub>CC</sub> coupled with the higher dye adsorption resulted in an increase in the <italic>J</italic><sub>SC</sub> and FF values of the DSSC-ZTO-Bs (<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>The photoelectron density (PED), <italic>n</italic>, in a ZTO photoelectrode determines its quasi-Fermi level, which, in turn, determines the <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> value of the corresponding DSSC.

Highly absorbable organic dyes (SJ-T1 and SJ-ET1) were synthesized and used as the sensitizers. To the best of our knowledge, the DSSCs based on the fabricated ZTO-Bs and organic dyes exhibited the highest performance yet reported for DSSCs fabricated using ternary metal oxide-based photoelectrodes. The optimized DSSC-ZTO-Bs based on SJ-ET1 showed a PCE of 6.25% (<italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> of 0.71 V, <italic>J</italic><sub>SC</sub> of 12.2 mA cm<sup>−2</sup>, FF of 0.72), which was approximately two times higher than that of the DSSC-ZTO-NPs (PCE of 3.5% with <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> of 0.64 V, <italic>J</italic><sub>SC</sub> of 8.6 mA cm<sup>−2</sup>, FF of 0.64) as well as that of other devices reported in the literature. The high molar absorbability of the organic dyes fabricated in this study as well as the hierarchical morphology of the ZTO-Bs resulted in the drastic increase in performance. The unique morphology of the ZTO-Bs, in which the high-crystallinity primary ZTO-NPs were embedded within submicron-scaled beads, led to improved dye absorption, light scattering and electrolyte penetration and a lower charge-recombination lifetime. These improvements, in turn, resulted in enhancements in the photoelectron-conversion properties of the devices. Considering that the improved performances were obtained using films of relatively low thicknesses (&lt;5 μm), the results suggest that the proposed fabrication technique should be suited for fabricating solid-state and/or flexible DSSCs as well.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge support from the Basic Science Research Program of the National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea (2012045675); the New &amp; Renewable Energy Core Technology Program of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP), which is funded by the Ministry of Trade, Industry &amp; Energy, Republic of Korea (No. 20133030000210) (S.Y.J.); the Global Frontier R&amp;D Program of the Center for Multiscale Energy System, funded by the NRF through the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, Korea (2012-8-2018) (D.K.); and the KIST Institutional Programs (2E23900 and 2K02120) (D.Y.K.).</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>D.H., H.L., D.K. and S.Y.J. wrote the main manuscript text and Fig. 1 and 2.
