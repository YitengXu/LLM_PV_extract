It is low-cost, high-tensile, lightweight, flexible, durable, and capable of proliferating even in ineffectual areas (e.g., incline). This review discusses the unique properties of bamboo for making charcoal and biochar for diverse applications. To produce bamboo charcoal and biochar, this study reports on the pyrolysis process for the thermal degradation of organic materials in an oxygen-depleted atmosphere under a specific temperature. This is an alternative method for turning waste biomass into products with additional value, such as biochar. Due to various advantages, bamboo charcoal is preferred over regular charcoal as it has four times the absorption rate and ten times more surface area reported. According to the reports, the charcoal yield ranges from 24.60 to 74.27%. Bamboo chopsticks were the most useful source for producing charcoal, with a high yield of 74.27% at 300 °C in nitrogen, but the thorny bamboo species have a tremendous amount of minimal charcoal, i.e., 24.60%. The reported biochar from bamboo yield ranges from 32 to 80%. The most extensive biochar production is produced by the bamboo <italic>D. giganteus</italic>, which yields 80% biochar at 300 °C. Dry bamboo stalks at 400 °C produced 32% biochar. One of the sections highlights biochar as a sustainable solution for plastic trash management produced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Another section is dedicated to the knowledge enhancement about the broad application spectrum of the charcoal and biochar. The last section highlights the conclusions, future perspectives, and recommendations on the charcoal and biochar derived from bamboo.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2" specific-use="web-only"><title>Graphical Abstract</title><p id="Par2"><fig id="Figa" position="anchor"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13399_2022_3715_Figa_HTML.png" position="anchor" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Bamboo</kwd><kwd>Charcoal</kwd><kwd>Biochar</kwd><kwd>Pyrolysis</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>26</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/13399_2022_Article_3715.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>ReviewPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Renewable and Green Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Renewable and Green Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Biotechnology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="Misc"><title>Highlights</title><p>• The review emphasizes the importance of bamboo for producing charcoal and biochar.</p><p>• Various processes are being focused upon, primarily pyrolysis; which produces charcoal and biochar by heating biomass in the presence of complete or some oxygen.</p><p>• The work also highlighted the versatile applications of charcoal and biochar.</p></notes><notes notes-type="CopyrightComment" specific-use="RightsRetention"><title>Copyright comment</title><p>Springer Nature or its licensor (e.g. a society or other partner) holds exclusive rights to this article under a publishing agreement with the author(s) or other rightsholder(s); author self-archiving of the accepted manuscript version of this article is solely governed by the terms of such publishing agreement and applicable law.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">The world’s fastest-growing plant, bamboo, may expand by at least 60 cm daily. Bamboos belong to the grass family and have a columnar shape as opposed to a tapering one. The bamboos have enormous social, economic, and cultural ramifications globally, especially in East and South Asia. They are mainly used as raw materials and as a root of food and building materials. The bamboos have good bending strength and are flexible. The bamboo plant may reach a height of 40 m while still withstanding wind force Yuming Y et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Bamboo is cheaper, lighter, flexible, stronger, and adaptable than steel. Because bamboo offers many advantages over other building materials, it must be used widely in construction. Due to its superior physical and mechanical properties, bamboo is often used in place of wood. Contrasting to wood, which requires almost 20 years reaching maturity, it does so in 3–4 years. It can breed in unproductive regions (like on an eroding hillside), and because its root system keeps growing even after harvest, it can produce new shoots. Most soil types support bamboo growth except alkaline soils, deserts, marsh, plains, hilly regions, and mountainous regions. According to some research, bamboo grows at a rate of 30 to 60 cm per day, reaches a height of around 36 m over the growth season, and yields more biomass than other lignocellulose crops.</p><p id="Par4">Scientists, engineers, and architects are working to create various building components that use bamboo as their primary building material. Bamboo is an environmentally friendly building material that offers several advantages, such as sustainability, the potential to be recycled or used again, and environmental accessibility, as researched by Xia and other members in 2016. The world’s fastest-growing trees, bamboo has a special rhizome-dependent growth strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Bamboo has more silica, charcoal, and alkaline extractives than wood. Its compressive strength is more important than wood and brick, and its tensile strength is notable compared to steel. However, bamboo is a plant that contains a lot of fibrovascular bundles. Due to their use as a supply of food, building materials, and adaptable raw materials, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia are significant regions both economically and culturally.</p><p id="Par5">Further, biochar and charcoal are precisely two essential and non-similar materials. The International Biochar Initiative describes biochar as “a compacted material produced by the thermochemical reduction of biomass in an oxygen-limited environment” wherein charcoal is defined as “a dark or black porous carbon primed from vegetable or animal materials where the air is excluded”. The primary source material for making biochar is biomass like plant residues, agricultural waste, wood chips, etc. In contrast, the main source of charcoal is wood-based biomass, which may be divided into four categories: common charcoal (made of wood, peat, coconut husk, and petroleum). Although pyrolysis, heat conversion processes of organic matter like organic wastes into carbon in the lack of oxygen, is used to create biochar and charcoal. But the contemporary pyrolysis technique uses the heat generated by gas combustion to promote pyrolysis and produces biochar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Both biochar and charcoal are forms of black carbon that are amorphous (without a definite shape) and have many pores and grooves. Because it is more porous and has a larger surface area than charcoal, a few ounces of biochar can have an interior surface area the equivalent of a football field. This surface and porosity area aid biochar in enhancing the structure of the soil and housing helpful bacteria, resulting in healthy soil. Charcoal has less porosity than biochar because of its low manufacturing temperatures. In addition, this temperature produces some less stable forms of carbon, which breaks down in the soil more quickly than biochar. As a good insulator, charcoal also has low electric and thermal conductivity. The chemical properties of charcoal and biochar vary. The amount of macronutrients (such as phosphorus) and micronutrients (such as zinc) in biochar may vary depending on the source of the feedstock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Although it typically has an alkaline pH, it can range from 4.6 to 9.3 based on the source material's temperature and the manufacturing temperature. Because of its negative charge, it aids in boosting soil's exchange capacity, improving nutrient availability for plants. Charcoal typically has less than 1% moisture; charcoal loses heating performance at higher moisture levels. Activated charcoal has a pH range of 9 to 11, making it more alkaline than biochar. This aids in its ability to absorb organic material from water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Due to its inexpensive cost, bamboo is a perfect starting material for synthesizing biochar and activated carbon, high biomass yield and significantly accelerated growth rate. Further, to improve their properties, biochar and charcoal can be activated. Furthermore, bamboo charcoal has garnered much attention due to its excellent adsorption properties, huge surface area, and highly porous structure. For various reasons, a bamboo is a superior option to other wood planks. Bamboo is superior to wood in all ways, including strength, environmental friendliness, water resistance, cost, soil protection, and contribution to air quality. Due to its superior physical and mechanical characteristics, bamboo is a substitute for wood. It has multifold benefits. Proliferates and do not bound to follow the stringent rules for growing, harvesting, propagating and cutting. Bamboos can tolerate a wide range of temperatures (− 28–38 °C), efficient in its water and soil usage and needs no fertilizers or pesticides. Bamboo is an excellent absorber of carbon dioxide and releases a large amount of oxygen (approximately 30%) back into the atmosphere, thus,  can cure global warming. High strength bamboo grows quickly and can be collected for usage for charcoal in just three to six years, making it far more desirable than wood, which takes a lot longer to grow. In addition, bamboo charcoal has four times the absorption rate of conventional charcoal and ten times more surface area. Bamboo charcoal’s porous structure offers microscopic holes that efficiently absorb odors, moisture, and airborne pollutants like formaldehyde, ammonia, and benzene and also act as a Carbon dioxide absorbent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These benefits were the driving force behind several uses for this material, including blood purification, electromagnetic-wave absorbers, and water purifiers. These benefits are influenced by the activation and carbonization procedures used to make bamboo charcoal. Green bamboo wood is roasted to a constant temperature to create activated charcoal when charcoal is exposed to oxygen by using the pyrolysis method, as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The biomass' cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, volatile matter, and fixed carbon content substantially impact the biochar’s characteristics and shape.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p> Generation of activated charcoal from natural bamboo</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13399_2022_3715_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par8">In view of the above unique and essential aspects of bamboo, charcoal, and biochar importance, this review focuses on the potentiality of bamboo for its uniqueness in making charcoal and biochar for multiple uses. Bamboo as a source for making biochar via pyrolysis is another focus of this investigation. The significant scientific advancements in bamboo charcoal and biochar from bamboo are highlighted critically. This will give the updated version of the present times in the scientific community to understand and develop more interest in the potentiality of bamboo for making charcoal or biochar, depending upon the requirement and applications. The review also highlights the practical concept of using activated bamboo charcoal and biochar in many potential applications and for many valuable purposes. The experimental results displayed excellent performance when analyzed. Another section is dedicated to the knowledge enhancement about the utilization spectrum of the activated charcoal and biochar derived from bamboo. The last section highlights the conclusions, future perspectives, and recommendations on the charcoal and biochar derived from bamboo as a unique natural source full of versatile characteristics.</p><p id="Par9">A diagram of the process flow of producing charcoal and biochar from bamboo for versatile applications is illustrated in the Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p> Process flow diagram of producing charcoal and biochar from bamboo for versatile applications</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13399_2022_3715_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO3"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Brief on pyrolysis method</title><p id="Par10">The term “pyrolysis” refers to the non-oxygen thermal breakdown of organic molecules at a temperature around 250 and 900 °C. Using contemporary biomass pyrolysis techniques to produce biofuels , biochar , syngas and other valuable goods , this could be a huge step toward enabling worldwide carbon capture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Producing biochar from agricultural waste is a practical solution for handling these massive amounts of garbage and lowering greenhouse gas emissions from burning. Obtainable by the pyrolysis of diverse biomass and biodegradable waste, biochar is a fine-grained charcoal-like product with a high amount of organic carbon and low degradation susceptibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Biochar has more significant catalytic activity, surface area, permeability, and physico- chemical stability than other biomass materials, Yaashikaa et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Char and bio-oil are the products that are solid and liquid, while carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and syngas are the gaseous products (C1-C2 hydrocarbons). Various reactor designs manufacture biochar, including bubbling fluidized beds and kilns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The kind and nature of the biomass used determine biochar yield during the pyrolysis process. The most significant variables affecting chars’ yields, pore volumes, and surface areas are temperature and holding time. Low-temperature biochar production causes combustible aliphatic volatile materials to become trapped in the pores rather than escaping the structure. The volatiles in such a low-temperature biochar works as fuel when heated, enabling the combustion of the biochar. However, all the volatiles evaporate when biochar is produced at higher temperatures (for instance, &gt; 500 °C), leaving only a carbon skeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Because it contains no volatiles and only pores, biochar produced at high temperatures is way ahead more combustible than biochar produced at lower temperatures. Excellent fire resistance is another benefit of the high-temperature biochar’s robust C–C covalent bonds. High pyrolysis temperatures (&gt; 500 ℃) yield biochar with high fire resistance properties due to the development of strong C–C covalent bonds and the absence of volatile matters. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> depicts the pyrolysis process’ mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Depending upon the reaction temperature, temperature, residence duration, and pressure, pyrolysis can be distributed into fast and slow pyrolysis processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The figure illustrates the mechanism of pyrolysis (adapted from Yaashikaa et al.

The feedstock types and pyrolysis conditions affect how productive biochar is. Pyrolysis conditions, gasification, and carbonization were used to create biochar for soil remediation. As a result, biochar has become a value-added product that supports the bioeconomy by reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and global warming in the environment, reducing nutrient leaching losses, sequestering carbon from the atmosphere into the soil, raising agricultural production, and reducing the bioavailability of environmental contaminants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Biochar soil has been advocated as a potential large scale solution to offset global greenhouse gas emissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Therefore, biochar is affordable and environmentally beneficial, contrary to polymer and cementitious materials. Identifying sources of contaminated wood in waste stream feedstocks is crucial before large-scale application of biochar or wood ash to soil is considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In recent years, carbonaceous materials such as activated carbons and char products (biochar) from thermochemical processing (slow/fast pyrolysis and gasification) of biomass for biofuel production purposes have received considerable interests as a waste-derived soil/sediment amendment for in situ stabilization of inorganic and organic contaminants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Different biomasses can be used for making biochar, and the biomass feedstocks for biochar can be broadly classified into (1) wood, (2) grasses and straw, (3) husks and shells, (4) manures and sludges, and (5) other industrial wastes such as papermill waste. Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows the environmental benefits of biochar, which in turn improves its profitable functionality. The combination of the large surface area, charged groups, and functional group elaborate the potential to absorb heavy metallic elements and other contaminants, mainly organic ones. It discusses the wide range of characteristics and beneficial properties with broad spectrum of reactivty for overall chemical and microbial stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Environmental benefits of biochar</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13399_2022_3715_Fig4_HTML.png" id="MO5"/></fig></p><p id="Par13">Activated carbon is a key component of the filter material used to clean exhaust gases utilized in treating wastewater and drinking water. Activated carbon is a popular adsorbent with a huge surface area, a consistent microporous structure, and radiation stability Mahanim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Numerous uses of this substance exist, such as in treating electromagnetic radiation and blood. Furthermore, these advantages depend on bamboo charcoal's activation and carbonization processes. Bamboo charcoals have four times the voids, three times the nutrient levels, and nearly double the adsorption efficiency of wood charcoal. The majority of bamboo charcoal’s applications include adsorbent material, an anode for dye-sensitive solar panels, a water purifier, an electromagnetic wave insulator for communication systems, a blood purifier, and many more, driven by the effectiveness of its absorption properties. Bamboo charcoal’s carbonization and activation processes chiefly determine its uses. These actions might impact adsorption, surface area, and porosity. For carbon capture, inexpensive activated carbons made from biomass that have a high capacity for CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption are appealing. It was discovered that bamboo makes a good precursor for making activated carbon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Another carbon-rich compound identified as biochar is created whenever feedstock, such as wood, leaves are baked in a sealed vessel with little to no available air. About 70% of biochar is made up of carbon. The remaining components include various substances such as oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen Shareef et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Biochar is a by-product of the pyrolysis process converting biomass into valuable products such as chemicals and energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. An inexpensive, renewable, and environmentally friendly adsorbent is bamboo biochar. Numerous advantageous effects of biochar are reported in the agricultural sector. Biochar increases soil fertility by loading up the soil on the ground. Recent research has shown that turning biomass into biochar generates renewable energy and reduces the number of pollutants, especially carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Biochar,  has received potential interest as a cost-efficient and environmentfriendly sorbent material to remediate metal contamination recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. It has a unique microporous structure, has recently attracted much attention. These provide the porous carbonaceous structure of activated carbon and other qualities like quick growth, higher productivity, and small production circles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Bamboo charcoal has four fold times the pores, three times the ions, and four times the adsorption rate of wood charcoal. Bamboo charcoal has a surface area of 300 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup>, which is ten times that of wood charcoal and is significantly larger than MWCNT (200 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup>). The majority of applications for this activated charcoal are studied on its proper absorption qualities, including the purification of water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], as an anode in dye-sensitive solar cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], as an electromagnetic wave absorbing material in communication devices, and in the purification of the blood, among other applications.</p><p id="Par15">Thus, bamboo charcoal is preferred over regular charcoal as it has four times the absorption rate of conventional charcoal and ten times more surface area. Bamboo charcoal is a powerful adsorbent due to its natural adsorption properties and large surface area. Numerous pollutants and other dangerous compounds can be captured and stored in its millions of pores. By trapping odour and pollution particles as air or water passes through its pores, charcoal purifies the air or water in its immediate vicinity. Therefore, bamboo charcoal is substantially more effective than standard charcoal due to its greater porosity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The uniqueness of bamboo for obtaining charcoal and biochar</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Bamboo-derived charcoal</title><p id="Par16">Bamboo charcoal has been utilized in ample ways since 1486 AD because of its exceptional qualities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. By heating bamboo stems in an argon environment, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] investigated and published a simple and customizable method for producing fluorescent carbon nanostructures. Bamboo can be carbonized by annealing it in an argon atmosphere, forming a graphitic cluster in the amorphous carbon matrix. The band gap of the nanostructured carbon produced after 500 °C annealing is 2.8 eV. However, the optical band-gap of bamboo charcoal (BC), when annealed at 600 °C (BC-600) is discovered to be 3.3 eV. The XRD investigation confirmed the generation of graphite nano-structure submerged in the amorphous carbon matrix. At ambient temperature, bamboo charcoal exhibits photo-luminescence (PL), mimicking the luminescence of its crystalline counterparts. The specimens of synthetic charcoal were discovered to contain two optical centers. Two photo-luminescence spectra were shown to be excitation wavelength-independent when stimulated with UV light. One of them has distinct, robust spectroscopy in the range of green light, and the other is in the region of yellow light. Predominant transitions are responsible for the PL emission of the carbon nano-crystallites, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. External sp<sup>2</sup> packed band gap produced each of the PL spectra. The -C-O, -COOH, and -NH<sub>2</sub> compounds that are physically connected to the sp2 carbon backbone change the band gap energy of the graphene sheets.

In additional research by Kaur et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], the production and use of bamboo charcoal as an adsorbent to remove sulfur from polluted water and effectively absorb smells, humidity, and sulfur from sulfur solutions was reported. Due to its incredible porousness, bamboo charcoal enables the absorption of substances containing sulfur. Bamboo charcoal was produced in two directions: by pyrolyzing it with tin foil. The moisture content in this example is 40.80%, the weight reduction (%) of the bamboo charcoal is 69.61%, and the pure sodium sulphate adsorption parameters are found to be 2.63 g/125 g for a swirling time of 60 min and 0.88 g/125 g for a stirring time of 120 min. In another process, the bamboo pieces are pyrolyzed at 600 °C, and the solvent is then purified. In this, the moisture content was 15.87%, the weight loss was 93.88%, and the optimal sodium sulphate adsorption condition was 0.88 g/125 g for a stirring time of 120 min. The absolute adsorption condition was 2.63 g/125 g.</p><p id="Par20">The XRD analysis of charcoal then showed there are two distinct peaks at 44° and 25°, correspondingly associated with (001) and (002) reflections and supporting the high degree of graphitization. The FTIR spectroscopy of activated charcoal carbonized at various times can determine the breakdown temperature of the hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin present in bamboo. Bamboo charcoal was exposed to two chemicals (sodium per-sulfate and sodium sulphate powder) to ascertain the ideal adsorption conditions and the material's intrinsic change. Bamboos hemicelluloses are broken down, and large numbers of cellulose and hemicellulose hydroxyl groups from cellulose and hemicellulose are dislocated when bamboo is pyrolyzed using aluminum foil, which causes water to escape. Additionally, the net architecture of lignin collapses when pyrolyzed in a muffle furnace at 600 °C. More aryl group positions are then substituted based on the band's disappearance, which originates in the skeletal vibration and alteration in the intensity values of a trio-band. According to the experiment results, bamboo can be an absorber for extracting sulfur from contaminated water.</p><p id="Par21">In a study by Liu and his coworkers’, 2009, bamboo was microwave-induced activated to generate activated carbon, with combination of phosphoric acid as the activating agent. Since it had an acidic surface and was largely microporous, the activated carbon was discovered to be superb for adsorption of organic pollutants. The impacts of many variables like radiation period, the proportion of phosphoric acid to carbon when activated, etc., have been examined. The increase in these factors promoted the generation of the pore structure of activated carbon. To achieve a high surface area and a carbon yield of 48%, the ideal activation parameters were found to be: microwave power of 350 W, with a radiation time of 20 min, and a phosphoric acid/carbon ratio of 1:1. The surface chemical characteristics were analyzed by different methods including FTIR spectra, XPS spectra, point of zero charges measurement, and acid–base titration. The pH measurement and acid–base titration showed that there were several acidic groups present on the carbon surface. While the XPS spectrum displays the changes in the relative amounts of different elements and carbon species, the FTIR spectra qualitatively characterize the surface groups. Both conventional thermal and microwave-prepared activated carbons showed similar surface chemistry characteristics.

The bamboo was collected and underwent simultaneous physical and chemical activations to become activated carbon, which was then given the name H<sub>3</sub> PO<sub>4</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O activated carbon. The yield, ash content, surface area, apparent density, thermogravimetric analysis, MB and iodine indices, pH and point of zero charge analysis, Boehm titration method, and SEM were used to describe the obtained material.

The ideal working conditions adopted were an activation temperature of 900 °C for 2 h and an impregnation ratio of 1. The premise surface was estimated by using BET surface area analysis.

Bamboo was cleaned multiple times to eliminate contaminants before being crushed, cut, and used. Bamboo biomass was used as the feedstock and was pyrolyzed at 460 °C. Nitrogen was utilized as the flush gas to guarantee an atmosphere devoid of oxygen and consistent heating conditions. The biochar product was crushed and sieved after pyrolysis. The material was dried in the oven after being rinsed with DI water numerous times. The bamboo feedstock obtained using the processes above was used to create the bamboo-biochar composite with montmorillonite (BC-D). Clay substance MK10 powder was mixed with DI water to create a suspension, which was then sonicated using a sonicator. A suspension of produced bamboo feedstock (10 g) and MK10 was fluxed in, and the mixture was stirred for two hours. After being separated from the mixture, the feedstock was dried.

According to numerous researches, biochar is helpful for soil emendation and purification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Additionally, the biochar can disable heavy metals, including Cu, Pb, Zn, and Cd, through various mechanisms, such as raising soil pH. A value-added product that supports the economy, biochar has made significant advancements. In addition to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and global warming, biochar has also helped to increase agricultural output, absorb carbon from the environment into the soil, and decrease the bioavailability of environmental pollutants. Exploration and utilization of bio-resources are implied by the term “bio-economy,” which also refers to the utilization of biotechnology to produce valuable bio-products. Producing biochar can therefore improve soil quality and provide prospects for additional income.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par69">Release of nutrients from biochar</p><p id="Par70">Numerous studies demonstrate biochar improves nutrient availability, making it an excellent candidate for use as a slow release of fertilizer in the soil.

This is due to the pore size distribution, surface energy, packings, particle sizes, and bulk density change. However, it alters the soil’s properties, directly impacting how well the plant grows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>]. It modifies the soil’s physical makeup, increasing its specific surface area, which unquestionably improves the soil's aeration and structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>]. Mycorrhiza fungi are stimulated by biochar in their activity. The mycorrhiza fungi’s ability to live in biochar and the soil quality is improved. It increases the soil’s ability to exchange cations and anions, enhancing soil characteristics and raising the pH and total P and N levels while lowering any possible levels of aluminum. The soil’s moisture is increased, nutrients loss and soil degradation are decreased, and drought is lessened by biochar. This results in substantial potential for the adsorption of hazardous compounds since the biochar surface comprises a range of reactive chemical groups, such as acetone, diols, and carboxylic. In heavy metal-polluted soils, the dangerous elements include leads, cadmium, nickel, and copper. Acidic soils often include manganese and aluminum. Due to some biochar granules, the soil becomes substantially more porous. These particles also promote circulation through the waste disposal site and improve oxygen diffusion within the landfill cover, which may cause severe microbial degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>].

Comparing the release of carbon (IV) oxide from soil respiration to that from burning fossil fuels, the difference is around ten times greater [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>]. To moderate climate change, it is also crucial to reduce carbon dioxide pollutants in agricultural soil. Biochar is utilised to lower nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) and CH<sub>4</sub> emissions while increasing soil carbon sequestration. Recent research suggests that charcoal could lessen soil releases of methane and nitrous oxide, two greenhouse gases (GHGs) incredibly influential in global warming and are in charge of global warming. An illustration of this can be seen in the fact that chicken litter made from green waste, biosolids, and paper mill waste lowers N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from an acidic Ferro sol, despite the claims of specific researchers. These demonstrate that different biochar forms have various effects on soil GHGs emissions. The soil's water content, the feedstocks used to produce biochar, and the material’s heat temperature is pyrolyzed all impact the material’s ability to lower greenhouse gas emissions. Biochar has a large surface area and provides suitable nitrous oxide and nitrogen adsorption sites, which decrease the spread of these pollutants from the land ecology. The removal of nutrients and GHGs from constructed wetlands (CWs) was determined using biochar and various COD/N ratios, according to Guo and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>].

The primary methods for removing organic pollutants are physisorption and chemisorption (electrophilic interaction). There are further methods, such as bio-degradation. The biochar interaction with organic pollutants is influenced by pH, the temperature of pyrolysis, bio-feedstock, and pollutant ratios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>]. Because the biochar produced at higher pyrolysis temperatures has more surface area and microporosity, which makes it ideal for removing nonpolar organic contaminants, it is not produced at lower temperatures. At higher pyrolysis temperatures (above 500 °C), removing O- and H-containing functional groups upon biochar is associated with increased aromaticity, low polarity, and acidity. However, biochar produced at the lower temperatures than 500 °C may have more functional groups that contain O and H, making it more naturally attracted to hydrophilic organic molecules. Hydrophobic interactions quicken as functional groups containing the O- start to decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].

The broad application spectrum of charcoal and biochar has been highlighted in a separate section. The charcoal is a promising adsorbent that can be used as an electromagnetic wave absorber, play a role in dye-sensitized solar cells as electrodes, and water purification as an absorbent. Biochar is reported to be helpful for the release of nutrients, gas remediation, effect on soil properties, biochar and greenhouse gasses and removal of organic pollutants. The COVID-19 era’s medical and plastic wastes was decomposed through pyrolysis, producing fuels and char. Thus, bamboo, a lignocellulosic material, has evolved and changed into several forms, such as charcoal and biochar, for various environmental benefits. This in-depth analysis of bamboo's distinctive ability to yield charcoal and biochar is fundamental. The research's findings imply that charcoal and biochar will soon hold a significant position in the urban, green building, and gardening industries and help increase the nation's economic aspects. Thus, it is enforced to enhance the property of the developed charcoal and biochar from bamboo as an unique natural gift source. Researchers, producers, and potential adopters have all expressed interest in using charcoal and biochar in these areas since they may offer many advantages and opportunities. Due to its multifunctional properties, we propose that the tailored biochar technique has to continue to be developed in other domains.
