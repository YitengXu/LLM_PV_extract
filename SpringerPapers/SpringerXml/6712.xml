From a commercial point of view, they are the go-to solution for many applications and are increasingly displacing lead-acid and nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. At the same time, they represent a prime example of the successful results of joint academic and industrial research.</p><p id="Par4">Lithium-ion batteries are complex, multi-component devices with a long list of inventors, key inventions, and contributions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. According to Akira Yoshino, lithium-ion batteries were born in 1986 after the successful safety testing of early prototypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Since then, the performance of lithium-ion cells (the fundamental building block of a battery pack) has improved substantially, and the specific energy and energy density have more than doubled from 120 Wh kg<sup>−1</sup>/264 Wh L<sup>−1</sup> (Sony, 1991)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> to today’s ≥270 Wh kg<sup>−1</sup>/≥ 650 Wh L<sup>−1</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. These values represent mass-produced commercial cells. Plants today typically produce over 1–10 GWh annually. Suppliers need to demonstrate the ability to manufacture at this scale to pass the stringent qualification tests of automakers and for the manufactured cells to be cost-competitive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Mass production contributed to a sharp decline in cell prices, which fell 98% from <italic>ca</italic>. 5000 $ kWh<sup>−1</sup> in 1991 to 101 $ kWh<sup>−1</sup> in 2021 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Low cost and high energy density cells resulted in the so-called “decade of the smartphone” around 2007<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Since then, demand for lithium-ion batteries has grown more than ten-fold, from ca. 30 GWh in 2011 to 492 GWh in 2021<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Demand is set to grow steadily and is forecasted to reach 2–3.5 TWh by 2030<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Growing demand for batteries can be expected to lead to further improvements in performance and falls in prices, with lithium-ion technology becoming ubiquitous.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Observed lithium-ion battery cell prices 1991-2021.</title><p>“Observed Consumer electronics” price data comes from ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and reflects the prices paid for cells used in consumer electronics between 1991 and 2010. “Observed BNEF” price data comes from ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR197">197</xref></sup> and reflects the average price paid for cells used in electric vehicles and stationary storage applications. “Experience curve” shows the battery price decline trend as deployments increase.

Sony commercialized cells in 1991 using lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO<sub>2</sub> or LCO) “cathodes” and carbon-based “anodes”, in which the positive electrode active material is comprised of 60% cobalt by mass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Note that from this point forward, we use “positive” and “negative” electrodes in place of the common terminology “cathode” and “anode” to avoid ambiguity since the latter terms are only valid for the discharge of a rechargeable battery.</p><p id="Par6">The current state of the art<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> lies in cells with specific energy over 270 Wh kg<sup>−1</sup>. These require a high nickel, low cobalt positive electrode active material, for example, lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (LiNi<sub>1-a-b</sub>Mn<sub>a</sub>Co<sub>b</sub>O<sub>2</sub> where a + b = 1, or NMCxyz where x:y:z reflects the molar ratio of metals Ni:Mn:Co). A particularly important example is NMC811, which contains only 6% cobalt by mass. The low cobalt content means that the raw material cost, excluding processing costs (for example, raw material refinement cost or active/inactive material and cell manufacturing costs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>), is less than half that of LCO: 54 $ kWh<sup>−1</sup> compared to 135 $ kWh<sup>−1</sup>, based on January 2022 raw material prices from Shanghai Metals Market, SMM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. It is worth highlighting that these are spot prices, which may not be representative of long-term contract pricing.</p><p id="Par7">Adopting new materials that increase energy content and decrease the raw material cost of cells has contributed significantly to reducing cell/pack costs ($ kWh<sup>−1</sup>). However, starting in 2020, similar improvements in both energy and cost have been obtained by employing existing positive electrode chemistries, such as lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO<sub>4</sub> or LFP) in a cell-to-pack (CTP) configuration. In this configuration, an LFP-based cell with a specific energy of ca. 160 Wh kg<sup>−1</sup> and energy density of 330 Wh L<sup>−1</sup> can lead to pack-level energies of ca. 135 Wh kg<sup>−1</sup> and 210 Wh L<sup>−1</sup>. This represents a 64% packing efficiency on a volume basis, compared to a 35–40% pack efficiency for a standard pack<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. These CTP systems have the additional benefit of using a comparatively safer and potentially cheaper<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> positive electrode active material than NMCxyz.</p><p id="Par8">As lithium-ion batteries and the current generation of positive electrodes, i.e., those based on intercalation reactions, are reaching their theoretical performance limits, manufacturers and researchers are focusing on other key components and processing techniques. Negative electrodes with high silicon content, lithium metal negative electrodes, solid electrolytes, negative electrode pre-lithiation strategies and dry electrode coatings promise decreased cost, increased performance or both in the medium term (5–10 years). Looking further out, positive electrode active materials based on conversion reactions, like sulfur or oxygen, could present an opportunity for the further cost reduction of lithium-based batteries, although generally at the expense of cell performance.</p><p id="Par9">However, particular attention must be devoted to the type of research carried out to advance lithium-based batteries. Indeed, as also recently discussed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, researchers should consider the current trajectory of battery technology, how to approach the industry and to present their work to provide the maximum benefit to the research community.</p><p id="Par10">When carrying out research focusing on industrial product development, researchers should develop products that solve a problem rather than develop a solution that needs to find a problem to solve. We believe that lithium-ion batteries are an example of an industrial product, and research should focus on solving existing problems with the technology. However, a growing portion of research published on lithium-based batteries today does little to solve the industry’s challenges. Often this result from a lack of understanding of the wider end uses and performance parameters required for lithium-based batteries in end applications.</p><p id="Par11">In this perspective, we present a non-academic view on applied research in electrochemical energy storage to help bridge the gap between academic and industrial research. We primarily consider lithium-based batteries, focusing on the automotive sector: a sector that has driven technological development in recent years, dominates today’s demand and is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. While we recognize that there are other emerging technologies, such as Na-ion batteries, as well as other application sectors, such as stationary energy storage, we choose to focus on electric vehicles (EVs), which are a core area of the energy transition. However, we recognize that these other topics warrant their separate discussions. To illustrate this perspective, we discuss technology maturity scales and what we believe are common pitfalls when evaluating performance requirements to bring a technology to market. We then select a few technologies as case studies. We use these to discuss what we believe the market will need and not need, provide practical, numerical examples, consider opportunities and barriers when scaling up, and ultimately explore which technologies currently show distinct promise.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Technology readiness level from the lithium-ion battery perspective</title><p id="Par12">First proposed by NASA in 1974, the Technology Readiness Level (TRL)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> is a scale used to estimate the maturity of a technology. Although a specific TRL scale has been recently proposed for battery manufacturing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, we propose a different TRL scale that considers the steps required for EV adoption to help decision-makers assess the actual status of technology development on the pathway to commercialization.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Technology readiness level scale for EV battery application.</title><p>The “Risk of Failure” arrow indicates risks of project failure or technology not transitioning to the next level. The scale starts with lab innovation and considers key milestones in cell manufacturing to reach EV qualification and vehicle Start-of-Production (SOP). The definitions of A- and C-samples are discussed later in the “Challenges in scaling up” paragraph. Risk increases with decreasing TRL number. US dollar figures are ballpark estimates of the minimum investment required per project based on industrial data or publicly available press releases. The present TRL scale is based on the consideration of energy storage innovation disclosed in ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR198">198</xref></sup>.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2023_35933_Fig2_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par13">Technologies at a lower TRL are associated with a higher risk of project failure or technology not transitioning to the next level. However, this risk is offset by lower capital investments required to complete a project, e.g., 10k-100k $ at TRL 1-2 for battery science. Moving across TRLs generally requires increasing levels of capital investments. For example, over 1–10B US $ are the typical investments required to scale-up battery cell production to 4–20 GWh annually and reach vehicle Start-of-Production (SOP) at TRL 8 or to develop a new EV platform/powertrain and manufacture a vehicle at scale TRL 9-10. The capital figures are ballpark estimates of the minimum investment required per project based on industrial data or publicly available press releases.</p><p id="Par14">Academic researchers usually operate at TRL 1–4, so they are generally less concerned with or unexposed to end-user requirements or criticalities that need to be considered when scaling up and manufacturing an energy storage device. Batteries in a research laboratory are often tested using conditions and parameters very far from commercial devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Moreover, scientific research in electrochemical energy storage is generally plagued by misrepresentation of data and a lack of transparency. This leads to a high risk of over-extrapolation, exacerbated by a lack of reproduced or even reproducible studies. Criticism of this situation is often kept within the community but has recently been spotlighted by various commentary and editorial articles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par15">Within the battery industry, there have been several high-profile examples of companies investing in over-hyped technologies which failed to meet the promised performance. For example, Envia, a spin-out from Argonne National Laboratories (USA), was close to securing an investment from automaker General Motors to bring the technology to mass market EVs. However, the latter could not reproduce the results that Envia claimed, eventually leading to the demise of Envia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Similarly, in 2015 the consumer products company Dyson acquired the US-based solid-state battery start-up Sakti3 for 90 million US $. Three years later, in 2018, the company wrote off the investment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Practical evaluation of lithium-ion battery performance</title><p id="Par16">Battery research and development is strongly driven and judged on a series of metrics with an often-complex connection between the requirements set by the application and the cell itself. For an EV, requirements on safety, range, available pack installation space, cost, power, and lifespan will heavily inform requirements at the cell level, such as energy density, chemistry, cell design, as well as calendar and cycle life. These requirements will depend not only on the demands of a specific application but also on other factors, such as legally mandated safety requirements in target markets.</p><p id="Par17">Research into new battery chemistries (e.g., lithium-sulfur, solid-state, sodium-ion) and other concepts (e.g., redox flow, metal-air), regardless of application, has for many years been heavily driven by improving on these metrics, particularly (but not limited to) energy density, cycle life and cost. These metrics have a complex relationship between the material properties typically investigated at the fundamental research stage and the eventual application. We can take energy content on a weight or volume basis as a relevant example.</p><p id="Par18">The left panel of Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> presents the specific energy (Wh kg<sup>−1</sup>) and energy density (Wh L<sup>−1</sup>) for a broad selection of Li-ion and so-called “post-Li-ion” cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> with publicly available specifications grouped by chemistry type. A list of cell specifications used to construct this plot is given in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>.

This comparison is based on two contrasting state-of-the-art battery pack concepts: one based on small, high-energy-density cylindrical lithium nickel-cobalt-aluminium oxide (NCA) or high-nickel NMCxyz, in 18650 or 2170 cylindrical format cells, as currently used by companies such as Tesla. The other is based on large format LFP cells, such as those used in CTP concepts developed by companies such as BYD (“Build Your Dreams Co. Ltd.”) and CATL (“Contemporary Amperex Technology Co.

From the right panel of Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, it can be seen that NCA (with a small, e.g., 3.5 wt. % inclusion of silicon oxide in the negative electrode) has approximately double the theoretical energy density of the graphite||LFP chemistry due to a higher cell voltage, capacity, and material density. However, the fraction of the theoretical energy content that can be reversibly obtained (repeatedly charged and discharged) is presently smaller for graphite-SiO<sub>x</sub>||NCA than graphite||LFP. Constructing a functioning rechargeable Li-ion cell requires the addition of inactive weight and volume, such as current collectors, separators, electrolyte, and packaging, which can be 50% by weight or more of the cell and reduces the energy density accordingly. For large systems such as EV batteries, comprising hundreds or thousands of cells, the cells must be installed into a pack with additional structural components and auxiliary systems such as cooling and electronic control. Other practical limitations might be required to realize certain requirements. For example, packs based on high-Ni-content NMC or NCA chemistries are typically limited further in terms of charging voltage (i.e., state-of-charge (SoC) and depth-of-discharge (DoD) ranges) to ensure an acceptable lifetime; the same limitations do not bind LFP-based batteries.</p><p id="Par21">System (pack)-level design considerations may differ considerably with different chemistries; we can consider the comparison in the right panel of Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> as an example. Small, high-energy density cylindrical cells using high nickel content positive electrodes, with &lt;20 Wh stored energy, are preferred by some original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) as thermal propagation in the event of thermal runaway can be more easily managed. Here we consider OEMs to be companies that produce battery packs. Other companies can use these packs as components to produce finished items, such as EVs, sold to users.</p><p id="Par22">In contrast, the good thermal stability of LFP allows for relatively large (300–1000 Wh) cells with lower energy density and less stringent thermal management requirements.

Achieving today’s cell performance has been far from trivial, requiring a holistic approach to research and development and three decades of incremental improvements since market introduction. Because the positive electrode active material provides energy to the system during discharge, ideally, the mass and volume of all other components should be minimized while maximizing cell lifetime and performance without compromising safety. To achieve these targets, it is essential to realistically acknowledge the state-of-the-art and what are, or could be, practical constraints when conceiving a design of experiments. One should consider key variables, often referred to as key performance indicators (KPIs), such as the ratio of the capacities of the negative relative to the positive electrode (“N/P ratio”), practical electrode capacities, coating thicknesses, porosities and electrolyte loadings (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

A variety of established manufacturers and start-ups are pursuing these materials, e.g., Haldor Topsøe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">160</xref></sup> and Nano One Materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">161</xref></sup> in the case of LNMO, BASF in the case of NMC 370, SVOLT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">162</xref></sup> in the case of NMx, and HCM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">163</xref></sup>, SAFT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">164</xref></sup> and CATL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">165</xref></sup> in the case of LMFP or LxFP (with x an undisclosed number of different substituents, such as CATLʼs “M3P”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">166</xref></sup>). These companies are advancing the large-scale production of, and claim to achieve, high-performing positive electrode materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">160</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">161</xref></sup>. However, the current battery-grade manganese supply chain is insufficient to support these technologies’ widespread adoption today. Indeed, current projections for manganese sulfate supply show that demand will outstrip supply as early as 2025 if chemical companies do not invest in additional capacity (see Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). To prevent manganese sulfate availability from being a bottleneck, companies that plan to use these positive electrode materials will need to work closely with chemical suppliers to ensure that production capacity is ramped up in line with their requirements. These issues are not only a problem for the producers of the material but also potentially disruptive for the plans of end-users, such as Norwegian battery manufacturer Morrow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">167</xref></sup> (who have partnered with Haldor Topsøe to produce LNMO cells) and companies like Volkswagen who have indicated manganese-rich chemistries as a key part of their future plans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">152</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">168</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par71">Batteries using inorganic solid-state electrolytes face similar supply chain constraints. There is no existing supply chain for cells using sulfide electrolytes (e.g., Li<sub>3</sub>PS<sub>4</sub>) to provide the required lithium sulfide materials. This means that companies have to develop their supply chains while also commercializing the batteries themselves. The supply chains of oxide-based solid-state electrolytes (e.g., Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub>, LLZO) face similar difficulties. Lanthanum, as used in LLZO, was estimated to have an annual production of around 50,000 tons in 2019<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">169</xref></sup>. We estimate that 1 GWh of batteries using a 20 µm thick LLZO electrolyte with an 80 µm thick NMC811 positive electrode will require around 255 tons of lanthanum. Current lanthanum production could therefore support around 200 GWh of all-solid-state battery production.</p><p id="Par72">The growing use of inorganic solid-state electrolytes and the application of pre-lithiation technologies and lithium metal negative electrodes promise to increase lithium demand significantly. If the rate of demand increase is not properly understood with cooperation amongst companies from across the value chain, this could lead to further material bottlenecks. It is already difficult to forecast future demand for lithium, and other battery raw materials, as forecasts for passenger EV sales and their associated lithium-ion battery demand vary wildly. In its 2021 electric vehicle outlook, BloombergNEF forecasted around 32 million passenger battery EV and plug-in hybrid EV sales annually by 2030<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">170</xref></sup>. In contrast, the International Energy Agency (IEA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, for the same year, draws a few scenarios for EV sales. Their most conservative forecast is at &gt;30 million EV sales by 2030 but expects that over 65 million EV sales would be needed in 2030 to meet the requirements of the 2050 Net Zero Emissions scenario<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. This uncertainty alone creates difficulty in scaling up. However, material suppliers can de-risk this to some extent by working closely with their customers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Cost forecasting</title><p id="Par73">When developing new technologies, academic researchers or start-ups need to forecast the cost of the new system compared to the incumbent technology to justify commercialization, win funding and pursue development. This aspect requires multiple assumptions about existing manufacturing processes and supply chains and how they will change in the future. For academic researchers and start-ups, it can be difficult to get an accurate representation of what these costs are and how they will change. However, there are publicly available tools, such as BatPac<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, which can be helpful. If the assumptions used are not reflective of the industry, then the cost forecasts could result in unrealistic expectations of the competitiveness of the final product. This, in turn, will damage the business case of start-ups or lead to funding being allocated to academic lines of research that are unlikely to result in technology improvements that will benefit the industry or result in technological advancements.</p><p id="Par74">Difficulties in accurately forecasting production timescales can also damage the scale-up opportunities of new technologies. Overly aggressive timelines for introducing new technologies can make an investment attractive to naive investors, but in the end, may lead to a final product that is more expensive than the incumbent technology. For example, a new cell design may be commercialized on the basis that when produced, it will be cheaper than the incumbent. However, a delay in production could mean that gradual improvements to the incumbent cell design leads to the manufactured cost of the incumbent design passing below the forecasted manufactured cost of the new design. While seasoned investors may be more cautious than companies looking to raise capital, technology developers should be realistic about what is achievable. Overpromising and underachieving will cause more harm to the industry as a whole.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Manufacturing processes and system design</title><p id="Par75">We have mainly discussed the advantages and drawbacks of introducing new materials into the battery industry. However, it can be equally difficult to introduce new manufacturing processes and techniques as well as electrode and cell designs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In the manufacturing space, companies are exploring new processes such as pre-lithiation, dry electrode coating, and improved quality control processes. However, it is challenging to persuade cell manufacturers to adopt these technologies, which, when initially introduced, are likely to lower yields and increase CapEx. This generally leads to higher manufactured cell costs. Despite these challenges, some companies are trying to commercialize these technologies</p><p id="Par76">Prominent examples include 24M’s “SemiSolid” cell design, which Norwegian cell manufacturer Freyr is adopting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">171</xref></sup> among others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">172</xref></sup>. While 24M’s technology is being commercially adopted, it is notable that a major cell manufacturer has not licensed the technology but is instead being commercialized by a battery cell manufacturing start-up company, presenting venture on venture risk and reducing the likelihood of commercial deployments to some extent. In some respects, this should be expected for large-step changes in manufacturing, as established companies are typically more risk-averse than small start-ups. The promise of leapfrogging incumbents and gaining market share is often reason enough for a start-up to take on this technology risk.</p><p id="Par77">Start-up companies such as EnPower and Addionics are also in the process of scaling and commercializing their proprietary electrode designs. These companies claim their products would enable the development of simultaneous high-power and energy devices. However, Addionics is yet to start large-scale pilot production (&gt;100 MWh)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">173</xref></sup>, and EnPower is having to scale pilot production internally to provide the volume of batteries required for customer qualification, requiring significant CapEx investment from the company<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">174</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par78">Finally, series, or bipolar, stacking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175">175</xref></sup> is being actively researched and scaled-up by companies such as ProLogium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR176">176</xref></sup> and Toyota<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR177">177</xref></sup>. Advantages can include better thermal and electrical properties, and reduced packaging but at the expense of a more complex manufacturing process and system design.</p><p id="Par79">The biggest system design adopted commercially over recent years is the so-called “cell-to-pack” design, such as BYD’s Blade Battery. These systems have been quickly adopted as they improve performance but do not fundamentally alter the chemistry of cells or require radically new manufacturing processes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Qualification of parts in the automotive industry</title><p id="Par80">Even with a mature value chain, supplying parts to the automotive industry is non-trivial, and the process can be time-consuming. Suppliers who wish to engage with the automotive industry must undergo a standardized, rigid qualification process, which is regulated at the international level (see, e.g., International Automotive Task Force, IATF 16949<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178">178</xref></sup>). The most common automotive standards for part qualification are the German Verband der Automobilindustrie (VDA) production process and product approval (PPA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179">179</xref></sup> and the Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG) Production Part Approval Process (PPAP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180">180</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par81">Some considerations for serving the auto industry are discussed in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR181">181</xref></sup>, with guidelines available from governmental and automotive standard bodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182">182</xref></sup>. For example, let us consider the supply of Li-ion battery cells to an automotive OEM for integration into a battery pack. In this case, battery cell suppliers, such as Samsung SDI, CATL, and LG Energy Solution, are expected to reliably supply safe, high-quality parts with minimum rejects, i.e., in a batch of cells supplied to an automotive customer, where less than 10 cells in a million (10 ppm) could be defective. Parts need to be rigorously tested using robust processes.</p><p id="Par82">Following VDA guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182">182</xref></sup>, qualification for new cells would start at the A-sample, a prototype cell at TRL 5. The A-sample cell does not need to be series produced, but it must be safe, functional, and close to the final design both in terms of performance and geometry: cell footprint and size are fixed. This prototype can compromise on lifetime and performance but should satisfy most of the requirements to lead to the qualification of B-samples, where the cell design is unalterable. Past the B-sample stage, the focus is on manufacturing. A larger number of trial modules/packs are assembled, and cells are series produced, which constitutes the C-sample stage (TRL 6). Finally, in the D-sample stage, the battery cells are produced at scale, ready to be implemented commercially, and ready to pass automotive part approval, e.g., undergo Production Part Approval (PPA) and reach TRL 7.</p><p id="Par83">Testing requirements can increase ten-fold, from hundreds of cells for A-samples to tens of thousands for C-samples. The type of tests required includes performance and safety, with the latter being a strict requirement at any stage. Tests are also rigorously defined in standards, guidelines and regulations (such as by the International Electrotechnical Commission, IEC 62660, by the United Nations, UN38.3, UN ECE R100<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR181">181</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">183</xref></sup>) or routine testing (e.g., United States Advanced Battery Consortium LLC, USABC, guidelines)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR184">184</xref></sup>. It is essential to understand that most actors, academic or industrial, particularly during the initial stage (where start-up companies are usually involved), lack the resources to accurately carry out these tests or enter the supplier qualification step for the automotive segment. A lack of appropriate process control can also result in manufacturing defects, potentially leading to costly product recalls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185">185</xref></sup>.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Summary and recommendations</title><p id="Par84">Taking into account all the various aspects of battery research discussed in this perspective article, we summarize below the main take-home messages that we hope could be useful for expert, non-expert, academic and industrial researchers when evaluating claims in the field of lithium-based secondary batteries and, energy storage research in general.</p><p id="Par85">Remarkable improvements to cost and performance in lithium-based batteries owe just as much to innovation at the cell, system and supply chain level as to materials development. Battery development is an interdisciplinary technical area with a complex value chain. For academic research to provide the largest benefit to these sectors, there needs to be collaboration across disciplines, with the industry actively advising academia on specific end-customer requirements. This could be fostered, for example, by supporting industrial researchers taking shared positions with academia, encouraging industrial researchers to publish more peer-reviewed papers, and increasing academic representation at industry conferences (and vice versa).</p><p id="Par86">Metrics are important, but which metrics matter and how they translate from theory to system is case-dependent. A clear consideration of the bigger picture is vital for effective applied research. We have evidenced how the high theoretical energy density/specific energy of a positive electrode active material, like NCA, does not necessarily translate to higher performance at the pack level. Many KPIs need to be considered when scaling a material, as a battery with high energy and low cycle life could have limited applications. All KPIs need to be evaluated for devices at high TRL, and manufacturing itself can be the biggest challenge, particularly when innovative technologies are not “drop-in”. In cell developer QuantumScape’s recent earnings call, when asked if the company needed to make perfectly uniform and totally defect-free solid-electrolyte-based separators for its cells to work, CEO Jagdeep Singh hinted at these challenges when he replied, “the key is knowing which defects matter and which ones don’t and to focus on the former”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR186">186</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par87">Moving up in the TRL scale is an increasingly expensive and complex task. The ability to reach TRL 9 requires an understanding of many requirements and a quick transition across lower TRLs. It is easy to over-simplify the factors involved in commercialising a technology, subject to a vast and continuously changing global industry that naturally introduces uncertainty into economic viability. It is perhaps too easy for academic researchers to be overly optimistic about the ability of a certain technology to scale based on, for example, preliminary performance data or raw materials costs, unaware of the exponentially increasing requirements on resources required to bring a new technology to market. This is perhaps best exemplified by Tesla’s chief executive officer Elon Musk’s comments regarding “the machine that builds the machine”, which references the difficulties companies face in manufacturing at scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR187">187</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par88">Hype, over-extrapolation and perverse incentives only risk harm to the sector in the long run, and all participants should take responsibility for fostering good communication and best practices. Within academia and industry alike, the battery field has unfortunately cultivated a reputation for hype, false promises and unrealistic goals. Many other scientific areas have had to grapple with reproducibility or scientific integrity crises in recent years, brought on by shortcomings which can just as easily be found in the battery scientific literature. In this regard, the whole battery research community must support initiatives such as the adoption of standardised testing protocols, standardisation of data collection, and requirement of publishing raw data. Such developments promote transparency and transferability of knowledge, especially considering the increasing importance of research approaches based on machine learning or, more broadly, artificial intelligence.</p><p id="Par89">In particular, we strongly recommend that battery researchers keep in mind the following aspects to improve material development without neglecting the practical application aspect:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par90">The electrolyte effectively sets the electrochemical energy storage system boundaries, including safety and cycle life, and electrolyte development is an exercise in compromise. For example, cost has to be balanced with electrochemical stability and ionic conductivity. Improvements in cycle life are key for most applications, and research on new electrolyte systems should be incentivised.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par91">In recent years, the focus of the industry, and particularly automakers, has been on achieving a step change in energy density, which has sharpened the focus on introducing or switching to silicon and lithium metal negative electrodes, thus, necessitating a re-thinking of cell design. These new concepts must, of course, meet minimum performance requirements. However, the continued improvement to what could be considered ‘legacy’ battery concepts, as well as increasing raw material costs, have seen some companies achieving competitive performance from such ‘legacy’ systems as graphite | |LFP batteries. Further improvements in these battery systems could open up the possibility of business model innovations, such as vehicle-to-grid (V2G) integration.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par92">Targets in terms of cost reduction and increased energy and lifetime can also be achieved with incremental improvements, e.g., by refining pack design and manufacturing processes such as BYD’s Blade battery and pack, but also active and inactive materials, e.g., electrolyte and additive optimisation as highlighted by Professor Jeff Dahn (Dalhousie University)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR188">188</xref></sup>.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par93">Positive electrode active materials generally differentiate lithium-based batteries, and choice is driven as much by cost as by performance; this is likely to continue in the short to medium term. In the future, negative electrode material choice could similarly differentiate these batteries.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par94">We would also remark on the strategic role of the supply chain. This area is crucial in reducing cost and improving lithium-based batteries’ performance while strongly influencing the manufacturing and material production processes. Another equally important area is the need for data-driven environmental sustainability analysis, such as life cycle assessments, to understand the environmental impact of batteries from raw-material mining to recycling.</p><p id="Par95">As an increasing number of researchers with various scientific and technical backgrounds turn their focus to the battery industry, it is important that they acquire a broader view of the research and development landscape across the sector, not narrowing their vision to only focus on their field of expertise. In doing so, it is possible to avoid reaching misleading or ineffective conclusions that fail to advance the scientific understanding and progress of lithium-based batteries.</p><p id="Par96">In this regard, we consider the growth of the online battery community during COVID−19 as an encouraging development. Hybrid conferences can be effective forums for experts and non-experts to engage with each other and acquire a broader view. Open, inclusive, and cost-effective initiatives should be incentivized, starting from free access to scientific research and including accessible communication platforms with academic and non-academic participation, such as the Battery Modelling Webinar Series<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR189">189</xref></sup>, Battery Brunch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR190">190</xref></sup>, and Battery Pub<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR191">191</xref></sup>. However, these initiatives come with some challenges and limitations, such as (i) a risk that misinformation may spread (moderators are needed); (ii) open data can be misused by entities with a conflict of interest or misinterpreted by non-experts; (iii) risk of communities becoming self-referential;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR192">192</xref></sup> (iv) confidentiality issues, where researchers working closely with industry can be restricted by non-disclosure agreements. In addition, many scientists have found social media platforms, such as Twitter or LinkedIn, valuable venues for networking and outreach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR193">193</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par97">A more rigorous approach to science is ultimately needed. The end goal should be accelerating innovations that directly improve battery systems and increasing the number of relevant, reproducible, and openly accessible peer-reviewed scientific articles. This is particularly important considering that the amount of time and non-time resources needed to drive the energy transition are finite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR194">194</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par98">Nowadays, there is too much research that confuses, rather than adds to, progress, and we need joint action from stakeholders, industry, academia, and publishers to solve this issue. Resources should not be squandered on the basis of (often unknowingly, potentially in good faith) biased and/or unreliable studies or well-sounding press releases. Indeed, a more critical, engineering-led, numerical, and transparent approach to scientific research is certainly required.</p><p id="Par99">As a closing message, the reader should bear in mind that transparency is a key requirement, and the lack of adequate, impartial, and exhaustive communication is usually the main reason for the divide between academia and industry or, more broadly, for the failure of collaborative research activities.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>U.U. would like to acknowledge Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.
