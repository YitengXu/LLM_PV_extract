However, the impact of the shale and tight oil revolution in the USA demonstrates the potential of new technologies to leapfrog aspects of traditional development. This is most likely in the renewable energy space provided the challenges associated with energy storage can be overcome. Already the uptake of mobile phones and the internet have brought financial services to millions and mobile telephony is at the forefront of social change in Africa.

It is inherently disruptive as it either destroys the value of ‘old stuff’ and/or presents ways of doing things where it was not previously possible.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par8">What distinguishes the twenty-first century from previous periods is the exponential rate at which scientific knowledge is advancing and our ability to more rapidly translate that knowledge into practical application, in other words, the rate at which we are leapfrogging<index-term id="ITerm4"><term>leapfrogging</term></index-term>. Each new generation of technology<index-term id="ITerm5"><term>technology</term></index-term> stands on the shoulders of its predecessors but today the rate of progress from version to version is driving advancement at rates of change that are sometimes breathtaking. Leapfrogging is the story of innovation<index-term id="ITerm6"><term>innovation</term></index-term>, disruption and rapid development.

The story is, of course, much broader. We trail, globally, on every dimension of infrastructure<index-term id="ITerm8"><term>infrastructure</term></index-term>, with the largest deficits being the lack of reliable electricity, transport, particularly roads, rail and suchlike.

Every piece of existing infrastructure creates vested interests that are subsequently difficult to uproot. The result is a tendency towards ‘path dependency’ where governments and the private sector do things in a particular manner because that seems to be the way things should be done and because it is difficult to get the public to change their ways.

</title><p id="Par26">By 2005 US domestic oil production had declined for 35 years after its 1970 peak at 9.6 million barrels per day. The USA was importing almost half of its total petroleum consumption. The future appeared to consist of growing imports<index-term id="ITerm35"><term>imports</term></index-term> of oil and gas from unstable countries such as Venezuela and dictatorships like Saudi Arabia. To the chagrin of the Americans, Russia was also rapidly emerging as an energy superpower. The situation with natural gas was only marginally better.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn9">9</xref></p><p id="Par28">Then came the fracking<index-term id="ITerm36"><term>fracking</term></index-term> revolution.</p><p id="Par29">Fracking<index-term id="ITerm37"><term>fracking</term></index-term> has been around for several decades and has been used extensively to increase production rates from conventional oil and gas wells. It involves the high-pressure injection of water, chemicals and sand into shale deposits to release more of the gas and oil trapped within the rock. The original mode of fracking entailed drilling vertically through a deposit, but today, horizontal drilling and other improvements in technology<index-term id="ITerm38"><term>technology</term></index-term> are commonly used. Once in the permeable layer of rock where the gas or oil is locked up, the drill is turned horizontal to access a greater portion of the deposit. In this manner fracking is able to harvest large stores of gas and oil that could not previously be commercially extracted.</p><p id="Par30">Gas suppliers were the first to benefit. From 2005 US natural gas production increased year on year for ten straight years and by 2015 the USA was the world’s largest gas producer<index-term id="ITerm39"><term>gas producer</term></index-term>. From 2008 oil production followed. By 2018 domestic US crude production was running at about 11.6 million barrels per day, a little ahead of Russia, the world’s second largest producer.</p><p id="Par31">In just a few years the shale oil and gas revolution in the USA has changed geopolitics. It reduced the price of energy and thus broke the stranglehold that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries<index-term id="ITerm40"><term>Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)</term></index-term> (OPEC) had on energy production. It also led to a severe slump in the prospects of many oil exporting countries such as those in the Middle East, Venezuela, Angola and Nigeria.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn10">10</xref> By 2025, US oil production could equal the combined output of Saudi Arabia and Russia and, according to the head of the International Energy Agency (IEA), ‘completely change the balance of oil markets’.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn11">11</xref></p><p id="Par34">In the process the Middle East and Africa lost much of its strategic relevance to the USA. But it has not fully achieved energy independence as the law of unintended consequences took its toll. Low energy prices have pushed up domestic demand as consumers flock to gasoline-guzzling sports utility vehicles and consumption of liquid fuels may soon be back to the 2005 peak at 20.8 million barrels of oil a day.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn12">12</xref></p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>The Potential of Renewable Energy in Africa
</title><p id="Par36">Whereas the shale gas revolution<index-term id="ITerm41"><term>shale gas revolution</term></index-term> in the USA is based on a large oil and gas industrial ecosystem that is still difficult to replicate elsewhere, many other rapid advances in technology<index-term id="ITerm42"><term>technology</term></index-term> such as those linked to renewable sources of energy require a much smaller technology footprint. They could have a significant impact on Africa.</p><p id="Par37">Hydropower, geothermal, solar and wind have the potential to revolutionise electricity access in Africa in a way not dissimilar to fracking<index-term id="ITerm43"><term>fracking</term></index-term> in the USA, but with the same result of empowering the local versus those further away. It is coming to Africa in three forms. The first is through distributed local systems using renewables, mostly solar, wind and geothermal. The second is through the improvement and distributed installation of electricity storage<index-term id="ITerm44"><term>electricity storage</term></index-term> systems such as new types of batteries. The third is through new technologies such as harnessing the energy in ocean currents and waste-to-biomass conversion<index-term id="ITerm45"><term>waste-to-biomass conversion</term></index-term>.</p><p id="Par38">In addition to its large hydro schemes, Ethiopia alone has the potential to generate up to 10 gigawatt (GW) of power from its geothermal resources. And then Power Africa<index-term id="ITerm46"><term>Power Africa</term></index-term>, the initiative started under former US president Barack Obama, already supports 15 geothermal projects with 1 GW potential generation capacity. Different to the fluctuating energy supply from wind and solar, ocean currents and geothermal can probably provide near-stable baseload electricity generation comparable to that provided by hydro, coal, oil, gas and nuclear.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn13">13</xref></p><p id="Par40">Data on the share of renewables in global energy supply vary between sources. According to <italic>Global Trends in Renewable Energy Investment</italic>, in 2017, 12% of electricity globally came from clean sources since it does not include large hydroelectric dams.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn14">14</xref> Other estimates are that renewable electricity transmission is around 22% globally, of which 17% is hydropower, about five or six percent is wind, and one or two percent is solar. The share of fossil energy in the global energy mix (oil, coal and gas) has remained at about 80% for the last two decades.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn15">15</xref></p><p id="Par43">The IFs Current Path forecast<index-term id="ITerm47"><term>Current Path forecast</term></index-term> points to a plateauing of fossil fuel use<index-term id="ITerm48"><term>fossil fuel</term></index-term> in the 2030s followed by a steady decline after 2040, with non-fossil fuel sources overtaking fossil fuels around mid-century and constituting more than 80% of all supply by 2100. Leaving the huge challenge of the environment and climate change<index-term id="ITerm49"><term>climate change</term></index-term> aside for the moment (see Chapter <ext-link xlink:href="10.1007/978-3-030-46590-2_15" ext-link-type="doi">15</ext-link>), this will be a world where electricity for households will likely be provided by individual supply or decentralised micro or mini-grids<index-term id="ITerm50"><term>mini-grids</term></index-term> that are powered by renewables, not from large-scale coal, nuclear or other plants. According to a recent report,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn16">16</xref> at least 19,000 mini-grids installed in 134 countries already provide electricity to about 47 million people, most of whom are in rural areas<index-term id="ITerm51"><term>rural areas</term></index-term>. It will be a world of potential energy abundance at a time when the lack of electricity is generally considered one of the largest constraints on Africa’s development.</p><p id="Par45">In a region with more than 600 million extremely poor people (see Chapter <ext-link xlink:href="10.1007/978-3-030-46590-2_7" ext-link-type="doi">7</ext-link> for the associated definitions), electricity is often an unaffordable luxury even where connections exist. The average price for electricity in Africa is about US$0.14 per kilowatt hour (kWh), compared to US$0.04 in South Asia<index-term id="ITerm52"><term>South Asia</term></index-term> and US$0.07 in East Asia<index-term id="ITerm53"><term>East Asia</term></index-term>. Some in the industry cite the actual cost of electricity in Africa closer to US$0.20 per kWh, largely due to the high cost of running a backup generator during regular power shortages.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn17">17</xref></p><p id="Par47">High electricity prices and intermittent supply means that many households in Africa do not even try to access electricity from a central system. Those homes that have an electricity connection often find the supply inconsistent and cost extremely high. Lack of electricity also acts as a strong disincentive to private investment especially in sectors where a dependable supply is crucial such as cold storage<index-term id="ITerm54"><term>cold storage</term></index-term> in the distribution of food<index-term id="ITerm55"><term>food</term></index-term> from farm to consumer to minerals beneficiation and manufacturing.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn18">18</xref> Consider that, in 2018 only about 53% of Africa’s population had access to electricity in contrast to about 85% in South Asia<index-term id="ITerm56"><term>South Asia</term></index-term> and well over 90% in the World except Africa. The rapid electrification of the African continent would improve both human development and economic prospects. Among its obvious many economic benefits, affordable, reliable electricity eliminates the need to use traditional fuels inside the home for cooking and heating—thereby reducing the potential for respiratory ailments—and also allows children to study longer at night.</p><p id="Par49">Currently Africa generates very little electricity.

Of course, lots of additional work needs to be done to verify these very large increases, but the forecast does indicate the extent to which leapfrogging<index-term id="ITerm212"><term>leapfrogging</term></index-term> can unlock potential. Most increases are generally in the range of one to three percentage points. Because the economies being compared are quite different in size, the actual dollar numbers are much more impressive. For example, the Nigerian economy will, in 2040, be US$125 billion bigger than in the Current Path.

Madagascar, a low-income country, will benefit the most, reducing its 2040 poverty headcount (using US$1.90) by 13 percentage points below the Current Path. São Tomé and Príncipe, a lower-middle-income country, will reduce its poverty headcount (using US$3.20) by five percentage points below the Current Path.

Where technological adaptation is inevitable, its impact will be magnified by efficient and open markets, clear and transparent regulatory frameworks and effective governance<index-term id="ITerm228"><term>governance</term></index-term> in the public and private sectors, as well as the ability to bypass or short-circuit established systems.</p><p id="Par159">That is particularly important given the potential environmental impact of the large hydroelectric schemes mentioned earlier that could result in the rerouting of rivers and flooding of valleys and the opportunity cost of developing Africa’s biodiversity.
