At low penetration, intermittency can usually be accommodated at low cost. High-penetration VRE will displace conventional generation, and require increased grid flexibility, geographic and technology diversity, and the use of electrical storage. Energy return on investment (EROI) is a tool that gives greater weight to the principles of energetics over market prices, and may provide a long-term guide to prospective energy transitions. The EROI of electrical storage may be critical to the efficacy of high-penetration renewable scenarios. However, there is no generally agreed upon methodology for incorporating storage into EROI. In recent years, there have been important contributions to applying net-energy analysis to storage, including the development of storage-specific net-energy metrics. However, there remains uncertainty as to how to apply these metrics to practical systems to derive useful or predictive information. This paper will introduce a framework for evaluating storage at a system level. It introduces the surplus energy-storage synergy hypothesis as a general principle for exploring the role of storage. It is argued that the useful energy available to society is determined by both the net-energy of the energy source and the stored energy as stocks. This hypothesis is translated across to electricity systems with the use of electrical reliability indices to evaluate the value of storage. A case study applies the framework to a suite of VRE simulations. The case study was modelled as a limiting case of VRE plus storage, and is therefore not intended as a comprehensive cost-optimised solution to high-penetration VRE. A shift from an electrical system based mostly on energy stocks to one based mostly on natural flows is constrained by the quantity of storage required, and the quantity of VRE overbuild to charge the stores. The application of the framework shows that the value of electrical storage and overbuild exhibits a marked diminishing returns behaviour at rising VRE penetration and therefore the first units of storage are the most valuable. The framework is intended to stimulate further research into using EROI to better understand the role of VRE and storage in prospective energy transitions.</p></abstract><kwd-group

id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Overview</title><p>Regardless of climate goals, the contribution from renewable energy is projected to increase significantly over the medium to long term (Krey and Clarke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2011</xref>). The IPCC AR5 450Â ppm suite of energy scenarios (Edenhofer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2014</xref>, p.Â 12) are characterised by rapid improvements in energy efficiency, and a significant scaling up of the share of low-carbon energy supply. Nearly all substantially increase the deployment of renewables, many deploy an increasing share from nuclear and/or fossil fuels with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), and some include the possibility of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). All of these options have net-energy implications, and some (e.g. nuclear and CCS) face additional barriers and risks (Edenhofer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2014</xref>, pp.Â 20â22).</p><p>At low penetration, intermittency can usually be accommodated at low cost (Gross et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2006</xref>). High-penetration RE will displace conventional generation, and require increased grid flexibility, geographic and technology diversity, and the use of electrical storage (Denholm and Hand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2011</xref>).</p><p>The need for storage increases the energy burden of electricity supply systems, and thus lowers the EROI (Carbajales-Dale et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2014</xref>). However, there is ongoing debate as to how much storage will be required in a shift to an electrical system based mostly on VRE, and whether this represents an additional but affordable cost, or a fundamental constraint on VRE penetration (Morgan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2014</xref>). Although there are estimates of the embodied energy of storage from the life-cycle literature, there is no agreed methodology on how to apply these estimates to a comprehensive estimate of EROI (Pickard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2014a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Definition of EROI</title><p>EROI is a unitless ratio, defined as the ratio of the gross flow of energy <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub> over the lifetime of the project, and the sum of the energy for construction <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>, operation <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>op</italic></sub>, and decommissioning <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> (Murphy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2011</xref>, Eq.Â <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>). More generally, Murphy and Hall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2010</xref>) state that âEROI is the ratio of how much energy is gained from an energy production process compared to how much of that energy (or its equivalent from some other source) is required to extract, grow, etc., a new unit of the energy in questionâ.<disp-formula id="Equ1"><label>1</label><alternatives><mml:math display="block" id="Equ1_Math"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow/><mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="3.33333pt"/><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="3.33333pt"/><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math><tex-math id="Equ1_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The divergence is perhaps most acute with VRE, compared to say oil, because VRE does not substitute one-for-one with conventional generation, with uncertainty related to the allocation of energy costs for integration and storage. Unlike oil, which is pervasive and substitutable, VRE produces electricity, which has high utility but is not globally fungible and currently makes up only 18% of global total final energy consumption (International Energy Agency (IEA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2016</xref>, p.Â 28).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Storage Literature Review</title><p>Much of the literature that explores the value of storage has focused on the relationship between storage and markets, and the potential for storage to add value within incumbent systems [e.g. McConnell et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2015</xref>); Salles et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2016</xref>)]. Some of the analyses explore a strategic network role (i.e. supporting networks rather than contributing to bulk generation) and the potential role of technological disruption of distributed solar and storage, although much of the disruption is occurring within markets, rather than in transformations of the physical systems.</p><p>There have been a number of approaches taken to include the embodied energy of storage into a system-level EROI analysis. Much of the analysis has attempted to isolate storage devices to determine a device-specific EROI. The main weakness to date has been establishing a dynamic function for incorporating storage into EROI.</p><p>Barnhart and Benson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2013</xref>) defined the metric <italic>Energy stored on invested (ESOI)</italic>, defined as the ratio of electrical energy stored over the lifetime of a storage device, to the embodied primary energy required to build the device. In contrast, WeiÃbach et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2013</xref>) considered the storage <italic>capacity</italic> of the storage device (in this case, pumped hydro storage) required to provide an equivalent baseload role for VRE. Both of these approaches try to ascertain the embodied energy debt of storage, but may not reflect the differing value of storage depending on their role and context. WeiÃbach assumed a baseload role with 10Â days of storage; however, it is not clear why 10Â days should be a reference and a high-VRE scenario would value other characteristics, especially flexibility. Furthermore, Raugei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2013</xref>) noted some methodology inconsistencies that reflect differing approaches to net-energy analysis.</p><p>Barnhart et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2015</xref>) provided a broader context for the role of storage by exploring the various trade-offs between curtailment, storage, and greenhouse emissions. The trade-off was illustrated with the use of a graphic that depicted energy intensity (as a proxy for EROI) versus carbon intensity. The plot encompassed both generation and storage devices. It was dissected into four quadrants; âdo todayâ, reflecting options that are worthwhile; âreduce emissionsâ and âimprove EROIâ, as prospective options requiring further development; and âavoidâ, reflecting options that have a poor EROI and poor emission performance.</p><p>Using the specific context of off-grid rooftop solar, Palmer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2013</xref>) considered the role of storage within the context of an overall system. In this case, the role of storage and surplus solar capacity (to ensure adequate winter supply) in a rooftop solar system was evaluated to establish the lifetime EROI of the complete system.</p><p>Denholm and Kulcinski (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2004</xref>) is representative of studies that are measuring the embodied energy of storage devices, but not attempting to account for the relative value that storage provides. In this case, pumped hydro storage (PHS) was evaluated, along with compressed air storage (CAES) and large-scale batteries. Denholm and Kulcinski were concerned with establishing the life-cycle parameters for a given power capacity (GW) rather than a given storage capacity (GWh).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Renewable Simulation Literature Review</title><p>This study will apply the framework to a renewable energy simulation. Although there are many published regional VRE simulations [e.g. Budischak et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2012</xref>); Jacobson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2015</xref>)], few apply or publish a loss-of-load probabilistic assessment, or explicitly include reserve margins. Where a reserve margin has been applied, it is usually applied as a simple exogenous multiplier rather than emerging from the probabilistic assessment [e.g. (MacDonald et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2016b</xref>, pg. 32)]. These are described as âfirst orderâ demand-balance simulations (see Hart et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2012</xref>)) and could be regarded as high-level, exploratory studies rather than the âsecond-orderâ system-level reliability analyses typically carried out by electrical system operators.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Storage Requirements</title><p>Storage requirements of VRE are dominated by stretches of low-wind and solar resource (the âbig gapsâ problem) (Lenzen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2016</xref>). The ratio between the average monthly solar insolation between summer and winter varies greatly across geographic regions (PV Education <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2016</xref>). Low latitude regions, such as Singapore, show a relatively small summer/winter ratio of 1.3â1.7, rising to 3â4 in the mid-latitudes such as Nevada USA, and above 10 for higher latitudes, such as London. Cloud cover is also region dependent, with clear skies and low aerosols typically located in the latitudes from 15Â° to 40Â° north or south (International Energy Agency (IEA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2014</xref>). Concentrated solar thermal requires high direct normal radiation (DNI) and is usually located in arid regions in the subtropical band. Winter insolation and extended cloudy periods define the storage requirements for systems reliant on solar.</p><p>In the case of wind, geographic dispersion, the physical inertia of wind machines, and aggregation provide smoothing of bulk wind power at sub-hourly scales (Archer and Jacobson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2007</xref>). At an hourly and above scale, wind speeds are highly correlated within wind regimes, which may span distances of hundreds to thousands of kilometres (Huva et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2016</xref>). Seasonal variation is usually much less than for solar but multi-day low-wind conditions appear to be a characteristic of many regions (MacKay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2008</xref>, p.Â 187; Oswald et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2008</xref>), and these low-wind stretches define the quantity of storage or backup capacity required.</p><p>In a review of VRE storage, Pickard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2014b</xref>) assumed that around 7Â days of storage would be required in a high-penetration VRE scenario. In a simulation for the PJM network in the US, Budischak et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2012</xref>) used between 9 and 72Â h storage, with 3-times VRE overbuild, which included maintaining a significant share of the legacy fossil fuel capacity, operating as infrequent reserve capacity. Abdulla et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">2014</xref>) found that 58Â h of storage (calculated at 1500Â GWh and 25.5Â GW demand) would be required for a high PV scenario in Australia in an explorative assessment. Oswald et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2008</xref>) found that around 6Â days of storage would be required to cope with continental scale low-wind conditions in Europe.</p><p>In a 100% renewable simulation, including sector coupling (i.e. heat and electricity) for Germany, 55Â GWh of battery storage, 60Â GWh of PHS, and 62,000Â GWh of methane storage was used in the âmediumâ scenario (Palzer and Henning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2014</xref>, Fig.Â 3.4). At 500Â TWh annual consumption, the storage capacity represents around 45Â days of full-load electrical capacity (equated at average annual demand). Likewise for North America (Canada, USA, and Mexico), Aghahosseini et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2016</xref>) used around 3-times VRE overbuild, around 2000Â GWh of battery storage and 174,000â230,000Â GWh of methane storage. At 6059Â TWh annual consumption, the storage capacity represents around 14Â days of full-load electrical capacity.</p><p>Much of the scenario literature avoids the problem of large-scale storage by maintaining a significant share of conventional capacity [e.g. Budischak et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2012</xref>)] or assuming the ready availability of large-scale biomass. For example, Lenzen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2016</xref>, TableÂ 2) did not employ conventional electrical storage but used concentrated solar thermal with 15Â h storage (equating to a theoretical 917Â GWh of storage), and generated 16,500Â GWh with biofuelled powered gas turbines in a simulation for Australia. Assuming the biofuels were used for seasonal storage equates to 21Â days of full-load electrical capacity (equated at average annual demand). In a simulation covering the eastern populated regions of Australia, Elliston et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2012</xref>) employed a similar generation suite, with biofuelled turbine capacity set at 71% of annual peak demand but at low capacity factor. The resulting 28,000Â GWh of electricity generated from biofuels equates to 50Â days full-load electrical capacity, assuming seasonal storage. Both of these simulations set the minimisation of biofuels as an objective.</p><p>This study is not seeking to prescribe a storage type and only considers the role of electrical storage. Sector coupling (e.g. power-to-heat, power-to-gas, power-to-desalination, vehicle-to-grid), and other forms of storage (e.g. thermal storage in concentrated solar thermal) may offer opportunities to substitute for electrical storage.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Goal Definitions</title><p>Carbajales-Dale et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2015</xref>) identifies three distinct goal definitions for EROI as it applies to VRE: a descriptive assessment of a particular technology; a comparative assessment of alternative energy technologies; and an exploration of the viability of emerging technologies to completely substitute for the incumbent system.</p><p>As a tool for comparative assessment, net-energy analysis is frequently used to assess the degree to which VRE displaces fossil fuel consumption. For example, Raugei et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2012</xref>) derived a âprimary energy equivalentâ multiplier in conjunction with EROI to describe the equivalent primary energy that is âvirtually returned to societyâ (i.e. coal or gas that is preserved for alternative uses). Raugei et al. argue that a unit of energy invested in solar significantly reduces the depletion of fossil fuels over the lifetime of the solar system. This is consistent with much of the discussion of VRE as an abatement tool within an incumbent system. From this perspective, it is assumed that the problem is that there is too much readily available fossil fuel and that without policy intervention the IPCC ârepresentative concentration pathwaysâ (RCPs) at the high-end are more likely (e.g. RCP 6.0, RCP 8.5). Although RCP 8.5 should not be taken as a no-climate-policy reference scenario (Moss et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2010</xref>), it nonetheless assumes continuing growth in fossil fuel demand (Riahi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2007</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Goal and Scope of the Present Study</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Different Roles of Storage</title><p>This study is focused on the use of storage to buffer or complement VRE, modelled as natural renewable flows. But to date, most of the use of storage in electricity grids has been for arbitrage and time-shifting in conjunction with baseload (Yang and Jackson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2011</xref>). It will be argued that the role of storage as a complement to VRE is different to its traditional role with baseload. Furthermore, the <italic>output</italic> of electrical storage is usually directly substitutable with energy stocks, especially flexible generation (Denholm and Hand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2011</xref>).</p><p>Storage can also be reduced to the extent that renewable flows coincide with demand, or demand can be modulated with demand management (Schreiber et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2015</xref>). Furthermore, geographic diversity (Grossmann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2015</xref>; Huva et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2016</xref>; MacDonald et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2016a</xref>) and resource diversity (Bogdanov and Breyer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2016</xref>) provide a quasi-storage role by raising the effective availability factor.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Energy Capital Substitution</title><p>This study will frame EROI in the context of energy capital substitution, rather than fuel substitution (i.e. to what degree can VRE plus storage replace the capital stock of fossil fuel extraction and conversion rather than just supplant the flow of fossil fuels). It is more concerned with assessing the possibility of future energy systems being able to both sustain themselves, and provide society with sufficient surplus energy (Hall et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2009</xref>).</p><p>A justification for focusing on substitution of capital is the German <italic>Energiewende</italic>. The term â<italic>Energiewendeâ</italic> can be dated to a study by the German Ãko-Institut in 1980 (Krause et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1981</xref>), with the title âEnergy turnaround, growth and prosperity without oil and uraniumâ (Joas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2016</xref>; Maubach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2014</xref>). Between the starting point of the EEG in 2003 and 2014, total installed power generation capacity grew by 51%, although total annual generation was virtually unchanged (Bundesministerium fÃ¼r Wirtschaft und Technologie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2015</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>Energiewende</italic> has been accompanied by grid expansions and tariff increases, although wholesale spot prices have declined (Poser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2014</xref>). Hence the <italic>Energiewende</italic> is reducing the direct fuel load and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, at a cost, but not replicating the substitution of infrastructure that has typically accompanied historic transitions (i.e. the incentive policies encourage a process of adding to the capital stock rather than substituting away from the legacy capital stock). The tariff increases need to be balanced against the broader societal costs of energy, including substantial German fossil fuel and nuclear subsidies (Morris and Jungjohann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2016</xref>; van der Burg and Pickard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2015</xref>). One interpretation is that the <italic>Energiewende</italic> is succeeding in reducing the environmental burden of electricity generation, but that the shift is reliant on the strength of the German economy, the relatively high economic output per unit of energy, and the high EROI of the global energy system.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Reformulation of Storage and EROI</title><p>The contribution of this study is to reformulate the analysis of storage. Firstly, it will be argued that energy storage is a fundamental property of net-energy. An understanding of the transition from hunter-gatherer, through pastoralism and agriculture, the Industrial Revolution, and twentieth century economic development, can be enhanced through supplementing the concept of net-energy with the concept of the <italic>energy surplus-storage synergy</italic>. This approach follows the precedent of applying behaviours observed in natural ecology to industrial ecology [e.g. Brown et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2011</xref>)]. In the pre-industrial context, energy referred mostly to food and fodder, but by the twentieth century, energy included a broader range of traded energy sources and biomass (King et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2015</xref>).</p><p>Secondly, the cost structure of electricity systems is dominated by capital-intensive infrastructure and fixed operating costs (Brown and Faruqui <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2014</xref>). It is the nature of all utilities (e.g. electricity, water, telecommunications) and many public services (e.g. passenger rail) that the infrastructure must be built to meet peak demand. Some services, such as urban transit systems and water supply systems, can dampen peak demand by permitting congestion or using built-in storage. For example, trains can queue passengers on platforms during peak periods, allowing congestion to buffer peak demand without the train system failing; the pressure of water supply can fall during summer heat waves, permitting a stressed system to remain functional but at a lower quality of service.</p><p>In contrast, the real-time flow limitation of electrical systems does not permit âsoftâ congestion management during peak periods. Furthermore, unlike gas or water pipelines, which may store several hours (or days) of product within distribution networks that can be readily drawn down, AC networks do not possess an equivalent âdraw downâ capability without storage devices. Instead, infrastructure must be maximally sized to meet reliability standards, although infrastructure requirements could be marginally reduced if reliability standards were relaxed (Australian Productivity Commission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2013</xref>).</p><p>Finally, a framework for incorporating storage into EROI is presented. This requires calculating EROI of the VRE and storage as a sub-system, and measuring the resulting <italic>EROI</italic><sub><italic>VRE</italic>+<italic>storage</italic></sub> relative to the displaced capacity of conventional generation. The benefit of measuring the result relative to the displaced capacity is that it is possible to trade-off the rising availability factor with the diminishing returns of marginal storage, thereby overcoming the limitation of arbitrarily setting the quantity of storage and RE overbuild. The result reflects the energy investment to substitute for energy infrastructure, rather than displacing fossil fuel consumption.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Historical Precedents</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Food Storage as a Pivotal Development</title><p>The contemporary value of energy storage is not unique, and a historical parallel can be drawn from the Neolithic transition, beginning around 10,000Â years ago. Prior to this period, Palaeolithic man lived a subsistence life of hunting and gathering, governed by the diurnal and seasonal cycles (Diamond <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2005</xref>).</p><p>In the transition, humans began domesticating plants and animals (Hibbs and Olsson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2004</xref>). There are different hypotheses for why humans chose to adopt agriculture in the first place (Diamond <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2005</xref>). But it gradually led to specialised crop cultivation, land clearing, and basic irrigation. These advances permitted seasonal food storage for the first time, increased population density, and represented a prelude to non-farming specialists, villages and later, cities.</p><p>The decisive break came from collecting of grain, then the evolution of grain, and cereal farming. The crucial advantage of grains and cereals was that it permitted agricultural surpluses to be converted into seasonal storage. But in the early period at least, the relative calorific return from agriculture may have been less than traditional foraging and hunting, and it is not obvious that farming would have been worth the effort. Agriculture requires intense effort over long periods, often with variable results.</p><p>The capacity for storage was to prove crucial. On the one hand, grains have several useful properties. They are hard and dry, and do not readily rot and go bad. Since they are dry, they have a high calorific-to-weight ratio, making them both storable and readily transportable (Laudan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2015</xref>). But on the other hand, they are exceptionally difficult to turn into something useful and digestible. Most food gathered or caught by hunter-gatherers is eaten in its raw state or cooked over a fire, but grains require several processing and conversion stages. Wheat must be harvested, threshed, winnowed, and ground. Finally, the flour can be mixed with water and baked to produce unleavened bread. The case of wheat suggests that there must have been a strong evolutionary advantage to adopting agriculture and perhaps derive an easily storable product.</p><p>The history of salt provides another example of the importance of food storage. Salt was used since antiquity for curing foods such as beef, pork, fish, and later butter. Such was its importance that it was sometimes a strategic commodity and was used as an early form of currency (Cowen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Value as the Vector of Energy Surplus and Storage</title><p>The evolution of storage is depicted in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> in which âvalueâ is defined as the vector of energy surplus and storage.

Newcomenâs early engines were around 1% efficient and Wattâs early innovations lifted this to 2â4% (Buenstorf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2004</xref>). Nonetheless, as âstored sunlightâ, coal was able to provide copious quantities of power <italic>on demand</italic>. Coal and steam power evolved within a virtuous cycle to leverage the power output of steam, and were to break the âorganic limitâ imposed by reliance on solar energy flows (Wrigley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2010</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>The Role of Energy Storage</title><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conventional Storage</title><p>Nearly all electrical storage to date has been pumped hydro storage (PHS), which makes up 97% or 142Â GW of global power capacity for electrical storage (United States Department of Energy (DOE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2016</xref>). The three leading PHS countries are Japan with 26Â GW, China at 24Â GW, and the US at 22Â GW. The Eurelectric region comprising the 34 European countries that are part of the five European synchronous regions has a total installed capacity of 35Â GW. These figures relate to power but comprehensive data on storage capacity (GWh) are less readily available.</p><p>From facility-level author calculations, the storage capacity of most PHS facilities in the US, Japan, and China range from 8 to 25Â GWh per GW of installed capacity, corresponding to a typical daily arbitrage cycle with spare capacity. In Europe, the storage capacity of 2500Â GWh is dominated by Spain with 1530Â GWh in 17 PHS plants comprising around 4.8Â GW (Pirker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2011</xref>).</p><p>From Pickard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2012</xref>), the ten largest capacity facilities in the US total 13.4Â GW with 332Â GWh of storage capacity, equating to 25Â GWh per GW. If the storage ratio is extrapolated to all 36 facilities, the storage capacity equates to 545Â GWh.</p><p>PHS has historically operated in unison with coal and nuclear baseload. In the US, the deployment of PHS was relatively slow until the 1960s, but developed in parallel with nuclear during the 1960s and 1970s, and subsequently slowed in the 1980s when nuclear deployment came to a standstill (Yang and Jackson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2011</xref>). Baseload-PHS usually operates with a daily arbitrage cycle between inflexible overnight off-peak and daytime peak. The daily cycling maximises energy throughput for a given storage capacity and underpins the economic return for PHS, while providing a demand sink for surplus off-peak baseload (Barnes and Levine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2011</xref>). Since the deregulation of electricity markets, the use of pumped hydro has expanded to cover a range of additional services, including rotational inertia, load following, frequency control, spinning reserve, and voltage regulation (MWH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2009</xref>).</p><p>At a global scale, other utility scale storage includes thermal storage (e.g. concentrated solar thermal) at 1.7Â GW, which assuming 6Â h storage equates to around 10Â GWh. Other storage includes electro-mechanical (e.g. flywheel) at 1.4Â GW, battery at 0.75Â GW, and hydrogen at 0.003Â GW (United States Department of Energy (DOE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Connecting the Pre-Industrial with the Contemporary Role of Storage</title><p>The question isâhow to connect the pre-industrial or organic conception of surplus-storage with the role of storage within a modern electricity system? In the pre-industrial context, the value of storage was in guaranteeing survival during winter or times of poor harvest. Survival during austere times was more important than feasting during good harvestsâfavourable harvests were valuable to the extent that food could be stored for later consumption. This aligns with a marginalist interpretation of energy supply (i.e. the first units of energy are the most valuable but there is a diminishing return to surplus energy).</p><p>In the contemporary interpretation, the guarantee of electricity supply is provided by the built infrastructure and a high âavailability factorâ from a suite of generators. Modern electricity markets are founded on the concept of marginal cost pricing, in which there is always a surplus of available power. Generators with the lowest short-run marginal cost (SRMC) bid into the market first, with higher marginal cost generators providing load following.</p><p>Most of the value to residential and industrial consumers, and the cost of providing that service, is in the guaranteed connection and available power flow, rather than the cumulative energy consumption <italic>per se</italic>. For example, the electrification of the United States during the twentieth century was a major contributor to rising productivity and output (Jorgenson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1984</xref>; Schurr <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">1990</xref>). Much of the productivity gain from industry was a result of the âfact of electrificationâ and the associated re-organisation of industrial production. In the early industrial period, the shift away from line-drive permitted organisations to adopt flexible and more efficient production processes (Rosenberg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">1994</xref>). Electricity was a key enabler of innovation in industrial and consumer devices through the twentieth century.</p><p>The value of storage is therefore proportional to the degree that storage contributes to the assurance of demanded power flow. Fortunately, the electricity supply industry has a suite of probabilistic reliability indices that fall under the broad categories of <italic>availability factor</italic> and <italic>forced outage</italic> (Billinton and Allan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1996</xref>). The <italic>availability factor</italic> defines the proportion of nameplate power that is available on demand, or in the case of VRE, the quantity of dispatchable power that is displaced (Preston <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2015b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Availability Versus Capacity Factor</title><p>The value of stored energy is evident in the <italic>availability factor versus capacity factor</italic> graph (see Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

The methodology can be applied at any point along an energy transition pathway. In this context, conventional generation refers to thermal generation or hydro. The key concept is that the EROI of conventional generation substitutes should be compared against the capacity they are replacing. In contrast, the conventional abatement approach is to consider the cost of displacing fossil fuel consumption as a consequence of applying environmental taxes or regulation on energy (Enevoldsen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Reliability Metrics for Conventional Generation</title><p>The availability of conventional generation is approximately proportional to the inverse of the forced outage rate (Billinton and Allan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1996</xref>, chpt.11). The forced outage rate is defined as the proportion of operating time that a unit is out of service due to unexpected problems or failures. Since forced outages are usually uncorrelated between conventional generators (i.e. the distribution functions are independent random variables), the system reliability at a given power asymptotes towards 100% as additional generators are added to the system.</p><p>To illustrate this, Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> plots the cumulative density function (CDF) (left) and probability density function (PDF) of a given capacity being available in any hour for a hypothetical suite of 10 generators, each 100Â MW with a forced outage rate (FOR) of 0.1 (or equivalently, an availability of 0.9). An FOR of 0.1 means that there is a 10% probability of an outage in a given hour.

The probability of demand exceeding supply for each hour is termed the loss-of-load-probability (LOLP). The LOLPs for every hour are added to give the loss-of-load-hours (LOLH) over the projected time frame (e.g. 1Â year). Alternatively, the LOLP for the peak hour only for each day can be added to give the loss-of-load-expectation (LOLE). There may be slight differences in methodology across regional operators. For example, LOLE can be expressed as either days/year, or hours/year (OFGEM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2013</xref>).

Since renewable converters <italic>within a region</italic> are highly correlated (i.e. it is sunny or relatively windy everywhere), VRE cannot be modelled as random independent variables using a convolution algorithm. Instead, they must be modelled as <italic>load reducers</italic> (Preston <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2015b</xref>). The distinction between âadding to supplyâ and âsubtracting from demandâ may appear subtle, but is important because the value of VRE depends on both the supply and demand functions. VRE can be conceptualised as changing the shape of the PDF of demand (left side of Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The degree to which VRE changes the LOLE is related to the degree that the rightward tail of the distribution is shifted leftward (i.e. the reliability value of VRE is dominated by the co-incidence of VRE with annual peak loads).</p><p>The first units of wind (or solar) produce the highest availability factor, with additional wind power subject to diminishing returns. The reason for this is that if the first units of wind reduce peak loads, those hours are no longer peak hours, and the system reliability is dominated by other load hours not well served by wind (Preston <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2015b</xref>). Therefore additional wind during those (now) non-peak hours reduces net-demand but does not contribute further to peak demand mitigation. This general property applies regardless of the composition of the grid. The sub-system of interest could also be composed of multiple VRE types (e.g. windâ+âsolar PV), which would yield a composite density function.</p><p>Therefore, the availability of a suite of VRE is defined as the reduction in net-demand as a proportion of nameplate capacity, at a given probabilistic reliability. For example, if 100Â MW of wind power permits an additional 10Â MW of demand at a given reliability level, the availability is expressed as 10% or 10Â MW.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Charging Storage with VRE Overbuild</title><p>A key question is the quantity of storage and the VRE overbuild that is required to substitute for generation over and above inflexible or baseload generation. Storage must be accompanied by VRE overbuild in order to charge stores. Overbuild is defined as capacity that is surplus to demandâit can be defined at both a local or system level. For example, at a household level, rooftop solar that produces surplus solar power could be either stored locally or exported into the grid. At a system level, wind power that exceeds a given usable proportion of system supply could be exported to an adjoining grid, stored, or curtailed (Denholm and Hand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Marginal Returns to Storage</title><p>The first units of storage and overbuild are the most useful. The reason is that the PDF (i.e. the histogram describing the number of annual hours for each âbinâ of power) for typical electricity systems is approximately bell shaped with a tail extending rightward representing short duration peak loads (see Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Therefore a relatively modest quantity of storage can shift the PDF of generator availability leftward (right side of Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), âfillingâ the highest peak loads that make up the rightward tail of the demand distribution. These peak loads are often the most valuable and easiest to fill, particular if the peaks tend to correlate with VRE power (e.g. solar power and air conditioning). However, progressively greater amounts of energy must be used to fill the (new) peaks after the first peaks are filled. The marginal returns to storage aligns with market-based estimates of the value of storage [e.g. McConnell et al.

The simulations are for the Texas ERCOT network. ERCOT is one of nine independent system operators (ISO) in the US. It supplies electric power to around 24Â million Texas customers. The ERCOT region has abundant wind and solar resources.</p><p>The Preston simulations were modelled as time-series, demand-balance simulations using Fortran, optimised for least cost but constrained to VRE plus electrical storage, with a further reliability constraint (LOLE). Since the simulations were modelled with higher cost seasonal storage, they are not intended as a comprehensive cost-optimised solution to high-penetration VRE. Indeed, commercially available electrical storage is economic only for storage up to several hours (Luo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2015</xref>, Table 12). Since this study is concerned with VRE plus storage, they provide a valuable tool to establish reference points to demonstrate the framework. Furthermore, the magnitude of seasonal storage (of any type) at high-VRE penetration is consistent with the published scenario literature in relation to the days of full-load storage required (see â<xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">Storage requirements</xref>â Section and Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).</p><p><fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Storage status for Preston simulation (<italic>left</italic>) for 1 Jan 2010â31 Dec 2010 and Henning and Palzer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2014</xref>, Fig.Â 4.5) gas storage (<italic>right</italic>).

Each of the simulations traced 3 consecutive years with a maximum demand of around 71Â GW and minimum 28Â GW. Annual energy consumption is around 340Â TWh. Additional wind and solar PV was added, while thermal generation was reduced, to maintain a LOLE of 0.1. Hence, the VRE has replaced the installed capacity of thermal plant at the given system reliability level. Nextly, storage was added while reducing thermal generation to also maintain a LOLE of 0.1.

These have been selected to provide low and high embodied energy references for commercially mature storage devices. PHS is the dominant form of electrical storage globally, providing a valuable reference for a near lower bound for embodied energy and high round-trip efficiency. Li-ion is projected to expand and provides a distributed generation reference. In practice, PHS is not a large-scale option in TexasâHall and Lee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2014</xref>) identified several possible PHS projects in Texas but these were relatively small. Compressed air energy storage (CAES) possesses intermediate embodied energy (Denholm and Kulcinski <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2004</xref>). Power-to-gas combined with gas turbine is a potential future seasonal storage option (Schiebahn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2015</xref>), which could be assessed with the proposed framework.</p><p>In this study, embodied energy for storage is defined as the embodied energy per unit of storage (MJ per kWh of storage). There are uncertainties with Li-ion embodied energy, which is largely related to accessing firm-level energy consumption and production data. Furthermore, nearly all battery life-cycle assessments are carried out as process-based attributional assessments, which understate embodied energy relative to systematically complete hybrid assessments [see Crawford (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2009</xref>)].</p><p>This study uses data from Ellingsen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2014</xref>), and is based on primary data for a traction battery cell. Ellingsenâs medium âASVâ value of 960Â MJ/kWh was used, which is representative of the broader literature [e.g. Zackrisson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2010</xref>) 790Â MJ/kWh, Rydh and SandÃ©n (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2005</xref>, Table 6) 1510â1870Â MJ/kWh for recycled and virgin materials, respectively]. The current learning rate (the cost reduction following a cumulative doubling of production) of vehicle battery packs using Li-ion is 6â9% (Nykvist and Nilsson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2015</xref>). Barnhart and Benson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2013</xref>) explored the theoretical and resource constraints of battery manufacture and concluded that embodied energy of batteries could be reduced âat most by a factor 2 to 3â, but also note that the greatest potential for reducing the per-cycle embodied energy lies in increasing the cycle life (Barnhart and Benson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2013</xref>, Sect.Â 3.3). The recyclability of Li-ion packs is constrained by the complexity of cell and battery construction, and diffusion of elements throughout the anode, cathode, and electrolyte (Gaines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2014</xref>). Therefore the energetic benefit of recycling Li-ion chemistry is relatively low (Rydh and SandÃ©n <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2005</xref>, Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Repurposing of EV battery pack cells for grid storage to extend their service life has also been proposed, with as yet uncertain commercial value (Neubauer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2012</xref>). The repurposing has been described as âcascading reuseâ in the life-cycle literature, and requires allocating the environmental burden across multiple uses. Various procedures have been proposed for allocation, including âquality basedâ, âcut-offâ, and â50/50â (Richa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2015</xref>). The use of vehicle-to-grid storage would similarly entail allocation across multiple uses.</p><p>The embodied energy for PHS of 400Â MJ/kWh is taken from Denholm and Kulcinski (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2004</xref>). PHS is a mature civil engineering technology and therefore not subject to a projected significant decline in embodied energy. An advantage of PHS is its long life of 60Â years or greater.</p><p>The embodied energy for wind and solar PV were calculated from the respective assumed EROI data as shown in TableÂ <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. For wind, a meta-review by Kubiszewski et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2010</xref>) estimated 19.8â25.2 in 2009. Since wind has progressed in recent years, this study assumes 30:1. For solar PV, Raugei et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2012</xref>) calculated 5.9â11.8 for data from 2009 to 2011. Since solar PV has progressed significantly in recent years, this study takes a high-end estimate of around 25 from a review from Dale and Benson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2013</xref>).

Furthermore, ERCOT is a single region in the US, and the simulation is not seeking to capture the benefits of geographic diversity. However, the qualitative relationships would be expected to be broadly similarâall large grids exhibit a similarly shaped load duration curve [e.g. Billinton and Allan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1996</xref>, Fig.Â 2.4)] giving the characteristic PDF shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>.

In the case of conventional generation, the risk of outage between generators is mostly uncorrelated. Therefore each generator can be treated as a random independent variable, cumulatively adding to system available capacity. In contrast, VRE of a particular type is highly correlated within a region, limiting the available firm capacity. Technology diversity and geographic dispersion are two methods to de-correlate VRE availability.</p><p>Nextly, conventional generation can be considered to have unlimited storage available from the perspective of an individual generator within a planning time frame. VRE does not have access to storage except through discrete storage devices. The devices can only be charged through overbuilding VRE capacity to produce a surplus at times of high wind speeds or solar irradiation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Consequence of Diminishing Returns</title><p>Rising VRE penetration is subject to diminishing returns such that the marginal EROI may fall below the minimum useful EROI for society. Hall et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2009</xref>) identifies an EROI of around 3:1 as being the absolute lowest useful EROI for oil or corn-based ethanol to provide unsubsidised energy to society, but an EROI of 10:1 being required to deliver unsubsidised energy for a modern developed society. Lambert et al.

From this case study, it is readily apparent that Li-ion batteries could only usefully contribute a short-term role to buffering VRE.

A high EROI estimate would imply that the system is energetically viable from a net-energy perspective, and therefore capable of converting natural energy flows into demand-based electricity. A low EROI estimate (&lt;10:1) would imply that the system is not energetically viable without access to an external source of inexpensive energy (i.e. the system is only energetically viable due to the importation of components from regions with inexpensive energy).</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Availability of Storage</title><p>This study makes no assumptions about the prospective availability of storage. To put the scale of the PHS into perspective, the US is the third leading country in pumped hydro storage, with an estimated 547Â GWh of storage capacity, and Prestonâs 100% VRE ERCOT scenario requires 18,970Â GWh of storage. ERCOT (340Â TWh) represents around 9% of total annual US electrical generation (3764Â TWh).</p><p>The methane or hydrogen storage option, via the power-to-gas and gas turbine pathways described in Palzer and Henning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2014</xref>), offers another prospective long-term pathway with as yet uncertain costs (GÃ¶tz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>; Sterner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2009</xref>) and embodied energy. The high energy density of methane, stored either within pipelines, underground storage, or as liquefied LNG, potentially offers seasonal storage. For example, it has been estimated that the storage capacity of the German gas network is of the order of âhundreds of TWhâ (i.e. &gt;300,000Â GWh) (Sterner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2009</xref>, p.Â 105). The use of existing gas infrastructure would be favourable from a net-energy perspective. GÃ¶tz et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>) details the various technical and economic barriers that would need to be resolved for successful commercialisation, including the availability of CO<sub>2</sub> sources, the dynamic behaviour of the various processes, a low round-trip efficiency, and high capital cost.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec37" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>It was argued that energy storage, along with net-energy, is a fundamental property of the useful energy available to society, and can be described by the vector of surplus energy and storage. The examples of the development of agriculture, especially grains, provide an example of the value of storage. Despite the relatively high energetic demand of early agriculture, grains provided calories when they were neededâaccess to food during austere times was more important than feasting during good harvests. The early Industrial Revolution provides a similar lesson. Early coal-fired steam was extremely inefficient and energetically expensive but gave access to essentially unlimited âstored sunlightâ, providing copious quantities of power on demand.</p><p>These historic lessons inform a methodology for evaluating the value of variable renewable energy and storage in a modern context. The methodology is based on the EROI metric, which gives greater weight to the principles of energetics over market prices.</p><p>Much of the contemporary global shift to variable renewable energy is adding to the capital stock rather than substituting away from legacy infrastructure. This could be contrasted with earlier transitions in which the substituting energy source replaced legacy infrastructure and enhanced productivity. The case of coal substituting for wood, and oil for coal provides early examples. However, it may not be necessary to completely substitute to provide value. The addition of VRE to existing electrical grids reduces the fossil fuel that would otherwise have been consumed, thereby providing emission abatement, usually measured as the marginal abatement cost in $/tonne CO2Eq.</p><p>This study argues that a long-run transition is better measured by substitution of generation capacity. Through the use of demand-balance simulations and probabilistic reliability assessments, the embodied energy of alternative VRE-storage options can be plotted against displaced generation to compare their efficacy in substituting for capacity. In a 100% VRE scenario, the system-wide EROI is calculated as a stand-alone estimate. The most important conclusion is that rising VRE and storage exhibit marked diminishing returns, and therefore the first units of storage are the least energetically expensive. Unlike conventional generation, which has access to essentially unlimited storage in the form of fuels, VRE is handicapped by the energetic demands of surplus VRE and storage.</p><p>The rate of diminishing returns is dominated by the embodied energy of the storage device. Pumped hydro storage is currently the dominant form of electrical storage, and gives a much shallower diminishing return than Li-ion. It is apparent that the EROI of a system reliant on Li-ion (and other similar electro-chemical storage devices) would rapidly fall below the minimum useful EROI for society. In principle, if regional topography and water availability permitted, the large-scale use of pumped hydro storage would permit VRE to displace a substantial proportion of conventional generation capacity. Since electrical storage is not currently economic for seasonal storage, the scenario literature adopts lower cost strategies, such as demand management, maintaining a significant share of conventional capacity, or assuming the ready availability of large-scale biomass. In the future, other storage options may emerge, such as methane via the power-to-gas and gas turbine pathways.</p><p>The goal of this study was to introduce a framework for exploring the role of storage with net-energy and stimulate further research. Further work should include renewable simulations across different regions that are tailored to netenergy analysis and loss-of-load reliability metrics.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The author would like to thank Roger Dargaville of the Melbourne Energy Institute at the University of Melbourne for valuable comments and feedback.
