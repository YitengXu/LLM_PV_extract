However, thermal instability and the ease of oxidation hinder the practical applications of CuNW films. We present oxidation-resistive CuNW-based composite electrodes that are highly transparent, conductive and flexible. Lactic acid treatment effectively removes both the organic capping molecule and the surface oxide/hydroxide from the CuNWs, allowing direct contact between the nanowires. This chemical approach enables the fabrication of transparent electrodes with excellent properties (19.8 Ω sq<sup>−1</sup> and 88.7% at 550 nm) at room temperature without any atmospheric control. Furthermore, the embedded structure of CuNWs with Al-doped ZnO (AZO) dramatically improves the thermal stability and oxidation resistance of CuNWs. These AZO/CuNW/AZO composite electrodes exhibit high transparency (83.9% at 550 nm) and low sheet resistance (35.9 Ω sq<sup>−1</sup>), maintaining these properties even with a bending number of 1280 under a bending radius of 2.5 mm. When implemented in a Cu(In<sub>1−<italic>x</italic></sub>,Gax)(S,Se)<sub>2</sub> thin-film solar cell, this composite electrode demonstrated substantial potential as a low-cost (Ag-, In-free), high performance transparent electrode, comparable to a conventional sputtered ITO-based solar cell.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">A highly thermal and oxidation-resistive AZO/Cu nanowire/AZO composite electrode for thin-film solar cells was fabricated at room temperature without any atmospheric control.

Current efforts, however, have been hampered by the need for expensive silver nanowires; lower-cost materials, such as copper nanowires, possess an insulating surface oxide film that deteriorates device conductivity. Jooho Moon and co-workers from Yonsei University, South Korea, have now uncovered a surprising way to remove oxides and organic capping molecules from copper nanowires using lactic acid, a biomolecule commonly found in milk. Room temperature lactic acid treatments, followed by washes with organic solvents, yielded transparent copper nanowire networks that feature direct, metal-to-metal contact.

various optoelectronic devices, such as flat panel displays, touch screens, organic light emitting diodes and thin-film solar cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> Indium tin oxide (ITO) has been the most widely explored material, because of its excellent transparency (∼90% at 550 nm) and low sheet resistance (∼20 Ω sq<sup>−1</sup>). However, with the rising demand for transparent electrodes, the development of cost-effective alternatives to ITO has been of great importance. The quest for alternative transparent conductors, including conducting polymers, carbon nanotubes, graphenes and nanostructured electrodes, has been a topic of active research for the last decade.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> Among these materials, metal–nanowire network films are thought to be a substantial candidate. The metallic nanowire film is capable of providing high transparency and conductivity by virtue of its characteristic structure, which consists of a percolated random network of nanowires.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> Unlike the brittle metal oxide skeleton-based ITO, metal–nanowire films are easily applicable to bendable, wearable active devices, because of the inherently flexible nature of metals. A high aspect ratio is a critical factor for high transparency and conductivity, but metal nanowires possessing this quality suffer from thermal instability. The dramatically lowered melting point of nanostructured, one-dimensional metal materials results in the collapse of the interconnected web-like structure above 200 °C, significantly raising the sheet resistance. To improve thermal stability, metal oxide/nanowire composite electrodes have been exploited, and have been shown to possess optical/electrical properties comparable to ITO as well as superior flexibility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> The silver nanowire (AgNWs) sandwiched within ZnO layers maintained a sheet resistance (<italic>R</italic><sub>sh</sub>) around 11.3 Ω sq<sup>−1</sup> at 225 °C, while the <italic>R</italic><sub>sh</sub> of AgNW films soared to 505.5 Ω sq<sup>−1</sup> at the same temperature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> However, in spite of the successful demonstration of improved thermal stability of AgNWs, the high cost of noble metals has hindered the wider use of this appealing approach.</p><p id="Par5">Copper is a promising alternative material, as it is highly conductive, but significantly cheaper than Ag. Recently, the development of copper nanowire (CuNW)-based network films has emerged as a new cost-effective, substantial pathway for creating transparent electrodes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> CuNW network films have been prepared by either electrospinning or solution deposition using nanowire dispersions. Polymer nanofiber webs containing a copper salt were electrospun onto substrates, and the subsequent calcination process, followed by a reduction under H<sub>2</sub>, led to the formation of copper nanofibers with good electrical resistance (∼50 Ω sq<sup>−1</sup>) and optical transmittance (∼90% at 550 nm).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> The other approach involves CuNW inks, with which transparent electrodes were fabricated by either a coating or filtration method. Large-scale, low-cost fabrication of transparent electrodes could be effectively implemented using this method, as long as high-quality CuNWs are obtainable. The synthesis of CuNWs relies primarily on the chemical reduction of copper precursors in an aqueous medium. CuNWs ∼20 nm in diameter and ∼60 μm in length were synthesized by either hydrazine or glucose-based reduction of copper salts with the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> or hexadecylamine (HDA),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> respectively. The resulting nanowire network films exhibited excellent sheet resistance (∼30 Ω sq<sup>−1</sup>) and optical transmittance (∼85% at 550 nm) as well flexibility. Recently, Zhang <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> reported a nonaqueous synthetic methodology for ultralong single-crystalline CuNWs.</p><p id="Par6">In addition to thermally induced structural evolution into discontinued, isolated morphologies, the thermal oxidation of copper nanomaterials of high surface area, even at slightly elevated temperatures, should be resolved for CuNW-based network films. Furthermore, in synthesizing CuNWs, the formation of a surface oxide layer should be suppressed in a controlled, sophisticated manner, as the oxide phases are thermodynamically stable; the presence of surface copper oxides increases the annealing temperature for the formation of intrananowire junctions as well as deteriorates the electrical conductivity of CuNW network films. To address the thermal-stability issue, which involves both thermal oxidation and structural evolution, two approaches were proposed: (i) core-shell structure and (ii) lamination-based layered structure. These methods prevent the CuNW surface from being exposed to oxygen by forming a passivation layer. Rathmell <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> reported the synthesis of the core-shell CuNWs, in which the core CuNWs were surrounded by a nickel shell in the form of cupronickel nanowires. However, the resistivity of such film was 3.1 times higher than pure CuNWs, due to the intrinsically higher resistivity of nickel. Luo <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> demonstrated the synthesis of the CuNWs surrounded by a silver shell (AgCuNWs), but silver is an expensive metal. The surface passivation of electrospun copper nanofibers with double layers of transparent aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO)/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> has been performed by atomic layer deposition, yielding a sheet resistance of 47.1 Ω sq<sup>−1</sup> and transmittance of 80% at 550 nm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> However, in this methodology, even if the external oxide layers allow for oxidative resistance by preventing the direct contact of copper surfaces with oxygen, the electrospun copper nanofiber films require a high-temperature (500 °C) annealing under a reductive atmosphere. This annealing decomposes the organic residues and allows them to be transformed into the metallic copper phase, which is not amenable to flexible substrates. For lamination-based layered nanowire films by hybridization with the reduced graphene oxide, it is difficult to fulfill a uniform large-area lamination and, inevitably, a reductive post annealing at 180 °C is required.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> Most importantly, as of yet, the chemical and/or physical methodology needed to form surface oxide-free CuNWs for further improvement of their electrical conductivity has not been studied.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par7">Copper (II) chloride dihydrate, 1-HDA, dextrose and <sc>DL</sc>-lactic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, Missouri, USA). Isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and n-hexane were purchased from Duksan Pure Chemical (Ansan-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea) and mixed cellulose ester membrane filter (a white filter with a diameter of 25 mm and a pore size of 1 μm in diameter) was purchased from ADVANTEC (Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Otowa, Japan). All chemicals were used as received without further purification.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>CuNW synthesis and lactic acid treatment</title><p id="Par8">The CuNWs were synthesized in a manner similar to that previously reported after a slight modificagtion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> To synthesize thin and long CuNWs, CuCl<sub>2</sub>˙2H<sub>2</sub>O (50 mg), HDA (280 mg) and dextrose (100 mg) were dissolved in water (20 ml) at room temperature. The final solution was placed in a vial and was aged at room temperature for 12 h while magnetically stirred. After the vial was capped with paraffin tape, the capped vial was heated in an oil bath at 100 °C for 6 h under magnetic stirring. Upon complete reaction, the solution had a red-brown color. The synthesized nanowires were washed three times with hexane and IPA, and then purified CuNWs were stored in IPA. After the nanowire aggregation sediment was removed by centrifugation (500 r.p.m. for 3 min), the CuNW dispersion was treated with lactic acid for 10 s. Lactic acid was added into the solution to assist with the removal of residual organics and copper oxide.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Determination of the concentration of the CuNW dispersion</title><p id="Par9">The concentration of the CuNW dispersion was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (OPTIMA 8300, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) analysis. To determine the concentration of the CuNW dispersion used for filtration, a set volume of the dispersion (3 ml) was dissolved in nitric acid (3 ml) followed by evaporation at 70 °C. Then the dried substance was further redissolved in a mixture of deionized water (1 ml), nitric acid (3 ml) and hydrogen peroxide (1 ml).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Preparation of transparent electrodes</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>CuNW film</title><p id="Par10">To prepare a transparent nanowire electrode with acid-treated CuNWs, vacuum filtration was used, which involves the filtration of a CuNW suspension containing 1 wt% of lactic acid through a mixed cellulose ester membrane with an average pore size of 1 μm. The nanowire density of the film was varied by filtrate volume. The membranes with captured CuNWs were transferred by pressing against the substrate surface with the CuNWs side in contact with the substrate. The membrane was then removed and final CuNW films were rinsed with an acetone followed by vacuum drying at 25 °C.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>AZO layer</title><p id="Par11">The AZO bottom layers in the AZO/CuNW/AZO composite electrodes with various CuNW densities were fabricated by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering. The bottom layer (∼55 nm) was sputtered using an Al-doped ZnO target (2 wt%) at a constant RF power of 100 W, an Argon gas flow of 50 ml and 1 mTorr working pressure at room temperature. AZO films were used without a post annealing under a reduction gas. The CuNW layer was transferred onto the bottom AZO-coated glass substrate. The outermost AZO layer (25–110 nm) was then deposited on the CuNW/AZO layers by sputtering as described previously.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>AgNW film</title><p id="Par12">The AgNW density was controlled by the rotation speed used for the AgNW dispersion (AgNW-25, Seashell Technology, CA, USA). The AgNW films were dried at 150 °C for 60 s. A ultraviolet ozone treatment was also performed to remove any organic binders and additives from the AgNW film.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Film characterization</title><p id="Par13">Field emission scanning electron microscopy (JEOL-6701 F, JEOL Inc., Peabody, MA, USA) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM-ARM200F, JEOL Inc.) with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (Quantax 400, Bruker Optics Inc., Billerica, MA, USA) were used to characterize the structural properties of the nanostructured thin films. The cross-section of the AZO/CuNW/AZO was achieved using a focused dual ion beam system (Helios NanoLab, Hillsboro, OR, USA) by FEI. The effect of lactic acid treatment was also investigated by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, Vertex70, Bruker Optics Inc.), X-ray diffraction (Ultima IV, RIGAKU, Tokyo, Japan), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy-depth profile (XPS-depth profile, monochromated Al K-alpha, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). The sputtering of an area of 2 × 2 mm<sup>2</sup> was performed with an Ar<sup>+</sup> ion gun (0.2 kV). All binding energies were readjusted with respect to C 1 s (284.8 eV). Optical transmittances (<italic>T</italic>) were measured using a ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometer (V-630, JASCO, Tokyo, Japan) in the wavelength range from 300–1100 nm. The baseline on the ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometer was corrected using a clear slide glass, free of any nanowires. The sheet resistances (<italic>R</italic><sub>sh</sub>) of the CuNW and AZO/CuNW/AZO composite samples were measured by a four-point probe system (RS8, BEGA Technologies, Gyeonggi-do, Korea) as a function of nanowire density. The resistance reported here is the average value obtained after at least 10 multiple measurements. Thermal oxidation stability testing was also carried out by monitoring the change of the sheet resistance of the AZO/CuNW/AZO composite and the bare CuNW film as a function of the atmospheric temperature. The mechanical flexibility of the CuNW and ITO films as function of the number of bend cycles were also determined by repeatedly bending the composite films with a two-point bending device that consisted of two parallel plates, where the radius of curvature was set at 2.5 mm and the bend speed was about one cycle per second.

The CuNW network films were prepared using CuNWs, the surface oxide of which was easily etched by the heretofore-unrecognized carboxylic acid treatment at a room temperature without any atmospheric control. The carboxylic acid treatment effectively removed the organic capping molecules as well as the surface oxide/hydroxide, which significantly reduced the junction resistance of the metal–nanowire contacts without a high temperature post annealing. The subsequent passivation of chemically treated CuNWs with a transparent conductive oxide (for example, AZO) provided excellent long-term thermal stability in air at elevated temperatures. Our approach enables the fabrication of a transparent AZO/CuNW/AZO composite electrode at room temperature, which possessed excellent transparency and low sheet resistance with excellent flexibility.
