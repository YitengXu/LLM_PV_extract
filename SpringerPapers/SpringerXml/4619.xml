However, a considerable fraction of organic substrate was consumed for the growth of PFB as biocatalysts, furthermore, these PFB were continuously washed out from the photobioreactor in continuous operation because of their poor flocculation. In this work, PFB bioaggregate induced by L-cysteine was applied in a sequencing batch photobioreactor to enhance continuous hydrogen production and reduce biomass washout. The effects of the hydraulic retention time (HRT), influent concentration and light intensity on hydrogen production of the photobioreactor were investigated. The maximum hydrogen yield (3.35 mol H<sub>2</sub>/mol acetate) and production rate (1044 ml/l/d) were obtained at the HRT of 96 h, influent concentration of 3.84 g COD/l and light intensity of 200 W/m<sup>2</sup>. With excellent settling ability, biomass accumulated in the photobioreactor and reached 2.15 g/l under the optimum conditions. Structural analysis of bioaggregate showed that bacterial cells were covered and tightly linked together by extracellular polymeric substances and formed a stable structure. Therefore, PFB bioaggregate induced by L-cysteine is an efficient strategy to improve biomass retention capacity of the photobioreactor and enhance hydrogen recovery efficiency from organic wastes.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>10933</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>11</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep16174.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>21</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep16174" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep16174</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Increasing concerns about fossil fuels depletion and environmental pollutions caused by continuously growing energy demands have promoted worldwide production and use of renewable energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Hydrogen is an attractive potential alternative energy source for reducing global dependence on fossil fuels and mitigating the climate footprint of economies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Among the various processes, biological hydrogen production stands out as an appealing choice, as hydrogen can be produced from renewable sources by certain groups of microorganisms at ambient temperatures and normal pressures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, the major challenge for the commercialization of biological hydrogen production is low product yields, since high hydrogen yields are critical to achieve their production economics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Photo-fermentative hydrogen production has the potential to increase the feedstock conversion efficiency, as it incorporates solar energy into renewable energy production from waste biomass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. During the photo-fermentation, photo-fermentative bacteria (PFB) capture energy from sunlight to oxidize organic compounds and generate electron potential needed to drive hydrogen production and then nitrogenase acts as an ATP-powered hydrogenase to produce hydrogen exclusively without inhibitory feedback<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Through solar-driven biomass conversion, PFB could potentially divert 100% of electrons from organic substrates to hydrogen production. Therefore, photo-fermentative hydrogen production has been suggested as one of the most promising hydrogen production processes.</p><p>To achieve a rapid and stable hydrogen production, PFB are expected to be retained in the photobioreactor to produce hydrogen continuously. However, continuous hydrogen production by PFB always suffers from a serious biomass washout from photobioreactor, due to their poor flocculation. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) covered on the cell surface have been demonstrated to play a decisive role in the process of bioaggregate formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In order to understand the flocculation behavior of PFB, EPS production by <italic>Rhodopseudomonas acidophila</italic> under various conditions, relationship among EPS contents, components and the bacterial flocculation were investigated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The results showed that EPS and their contents and composition have a significant effect on the bacterial surface characteristics and flocculability. According to the DLVO theory, contribution of van der Waals interaction energy to total interaction energy could be neglected because effective Hamaker constant between <italic>R. acidophila</italic> and water was only 2.27 × 10<sup>−23</sup> J<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. As a result, the bacterial particles could not overcome the total energy barrier to flocculate effectively. In addition, cell particles of <italic>R. acidophila</italic> repelled each other due to positive total interfacial free energy between the bacterial cells and water, which resulted in a great stability of the cell suspensions. Consequently, PFB were washed out with effluent from reactor continuously in the continuous operation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, which contributed to effluent turbidity and led to increases in pollutants. Moreover, organic substrate was continuously utilized for cell growth to supplement biomass washout and maintain the biomass concentration in the steady state operation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. As a result, most of substrate (37–50%) was used for biomass synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, while substrate used for hydrogen production only accounted for little proportion (16–45%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p>In our previous study, L-cysteine was demonstrated to induce remarkable aggregation of <italic>Rhodopseudomonas faecalis</italic> RLD-53 and simultaneously improve hydrogen production in the batch culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Through formation of disulphide bonds which are the medium for extracellular secretion of proteins, L-cysteine not only promoted production of EPS, in particular the secretion of protein, but also stabilized the final conformation of protein in EPS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. With the increase of EPS covering on cell surface, cell surface properties, especially surface charged groups, have also been changed. Consequently, absolute zeta potential reached a minimum value at 1.0 g/l of L-cysteine, which indicated significant decrease of electrostatic repulsion interaction energy based on the DLVO theory. Total interaction energy barrier decreased from 389.77 <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub><italic>T</italic> (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub>, Boltzmann constant; <italic>T</italic>, absolute temperature) at 0.0 g/l of L-cysteine to 127.21 <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub><italic>T</italic> at 1.0 g/l. Therefore, <italic>R. faecalis</italic> overcame the total energy barrier and flocculated effectively. After a short settlement, the biomass washout will be significantly reduced and the effluent quality will be greatly improved.</p><p>The objective of this work is to evaluate the operational stability of the bioflocculation induced by L-cysteine for the continuous hydrogen production in a sequencing batch photobioreactor. Firstly, three key operational parameters, hydraulic retention time (HRT), influent concentration and light intensity, were optimized for investigating the hydrogen production performance and biomass retention capacity in bioreactor. Then, the structure and components distribution of bacterial floc were also investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Effect of HRT on the performance of PFB bioaggregate</title><p>The hydrogen production performance and biomass retention capacity of the photobioreactor were influenced well by the variations of the HRT (48, 96 and 144 h) (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Hydrogen production rate at HRT of 144 h was fluctuating with a mean value of 395 ml/l/d, which may be due to that substrate was exhausted at the end of each cycle period (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). Under such conditions, poor hydrogen productivity was expected since the PFB were receiving inadequate reducing equivalents and thus producing lower amount of hydrogen per reactor volume<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. As a result, a hydrogen yield was only 2.17 mol H<sub>2</sub>/mol acetate at HRT of 144 h. With the decrease of HRT to 96 h, hydrogen production rate increased up to 702 ml/l/d with the maximum hydrogen yield of 2.54 mol H<sub>2</sub>/mol acetate. The results indicated that shortening HRT could enhance the hydrogen production performance, due to the availability of more substrate to the PFB. Biomass concentration also achieved its maximum of 1.55 g/l at the HRT of 96 h, which consequently supported the hydrogen production. However, with the further decreasing HRT to 48 h, the biomass concentration was decreased from 1.55 g/l to 1.12 g/l and it was obvious that shorter HRT washed out more biomass. With the decrease of hydrogen producers in the photobioreactor, hydrogen production rate dropped to 651 ml/l/d at HRT of 48 h. In addition, acetate concentration in the effluent was about 23.52 mmol/l with substrate removal efficiency only 52.96% (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>), which indicated that a significant proportion of substrates were not converted into hydrogen but were washed away with the effluent at shorter HRT.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Continuous hydrogen production by bioaggregate of <italic>R. faecalis</italic> RLD-53 under different HRTs: (<bold>a</bold>), biomass concentration; (<bold>b</bold>), hydrogen yield; (<bold>c</bold>) hydrogen production rate.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep16174_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Substrate concentration in photobioreactor under different HRTs: (<bold>a</bold>), 48 h; (<bold>b</bold>), 96 h; (<bold>c</bold>), 144 h.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep16174_Fig2_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Effect of influent concentration on performance of PFB bioaggregate</title><p>The effect of influent concentration on COD removal efficiency and COD removal rate were shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>.

At light intensity of 100 W/m<sup>2</sup>, the hydrogen production rate and hydrogen yield was only 806 ml/l/d and 2.56 mol H<sub>2</sub>/mol acetate. This was attributed to the fact that the driven force of light was weak in limited incident light intensity, which induced little excited electrons for the substrate degradation. As a result, there was high concentration of substrate in the effluent. When sufficient light energy provided (200 W/m<sup>2</sup>), the photosynthetic apparatus of PFB could absorb more photon to excite the biological activity and promote the substrate degradation for hydrogen production (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Consequently, the maximum hydrogen production rate of 1044 ml/l/d and hydrogen yield of 3.35 mol H<sub>2</sub>/mol acetate were observed at 200 W/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively.

Long HRTs from 25 h<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> to 120 h<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> were usually required for photo-fermentation, because of slow conversion of organic substrates to H<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> and slow growth rate of PFB. In this study, better performance was achieved at longer HRT (144 h) in terms of organic substrate removal (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), while the hydrogen production was limited due to insufficient carbon source supply. The unsettleable cells were removed as HRT decreased to 96 h, which favored the growth of aggregating biomass within the photobioreactor. Further shortening of the HRT (48 h) resulted in excessive hydrogen producer washout and consequently production rate and yield of hydrogen were poor. Moreover, the reducing HRT also increase the availability of organic substrate to PFB, while low biomass concentration in reactor led to the decrease of substrate consumption. As a result, a significant amount of organic substrate was wash out at HRT of 48 h, giving the substrate removal efficiency of 52.96%.</p><p>It is essential to determine the proper range of influent concentration that the photobioreactor can handle effectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> and influent concentration has also been considered as the most important parameter to control the formation of anaerobic bioaggregate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. When influent concentration reached 5.12 g COD/l, large numbers of planktonic cells presented in the photobioreactor, which indicated that higher influent concentration exceeded the limitation that flocs could withstand and stimulated the growth of planktonic cells. With a considerable amount of stably suspended cells discharged from the reactors, the biomass concentration decreased from 1.89 g/l at 3.48 g COD/l to 1.57 g/l at 5.12 g COD/l. It has been shown that an increased substrate concentration raises the biomass growth rate and high growth rate of anaerobic microorganisms would reduce the strength of the three-dimensional structure of bioaggregate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. As a result, the bioaggregate would easily lose their structural integrity and disintegration would occur. The disintegration of bioaggregate caused by excessive influent concentration was also observed in aerobic granular reactor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. When influent concentration increased to 3000 mg COD/l, the aerobic granular sludge gradually disintegrated, resulted in a large amount of flocculent sludge discharged from the reactors and eventually led to collapse of the system.</p><p>Light intensity is another important parameter that regulates the photo-fermentative hydrogen process. High illumination intensity offers more ATP and reductive power to the photosynthetic system, which are favorable for hydrogen production. However, when the photosynthetic system of PFB exposed to excessive photons under high light intensity of 300 W/m<sup>2</sup>, photons cannot all be used for reaction energy but are dissipated as heat energy which may damage the photosynthetic apparatus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. As a result, hydrogen production was decreased at high light intensity of 300 W/m<sup>2</sup>. In this study optimum hydrogen production was obtained under light intensity of 200 W/m<sup>2</sup>, which is relatively higher than solid-carrier assisted photo-fermentation with internal optical-fiber illumination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. The sunlight intensity during the day was very high<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> even with the maximum of 1000 W/m<sup>2</sup>, which is much higher than the optimum light intensity that photo-fermentative bioaggregate required. In order to avoid light saturation effect caused by excessive sunlight, spatial dispersion of the high illumination has been developed using light shade bands covered on the photobioreactor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p>Bioflocculation is the process of microbial aggregation, which is critical to biomass/liquid separation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. In this study, the bioflocculation of PFB in the photobioreactor at the optimum conditions was shown in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>. It was evident that the PFB formed the bioaggregate with reddish-pink colour. SEM analysis also showed that bacteria cell formed a stable structure through covered and tightly linked together by EPS. Individual microbial flocs were composed of numerous bacterial cells, immobilized in matrices constituting polymers of proteins, polysaccharides, humic acids and lipids. The distribution of these components in the bioflocculation was determined by staining the EPS and cells in bioaggregates (<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). According to the fluorescent intensity data presented in the <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, β-polysaccharides and proteins mainly accumulated at the outer layer of floc, whereas the lipids and α-polysaccharide evenly distributed in the floc. On the other hand, proteins were also within the core of the floc but to a lesser extent than the lips. With excellent settling abilities, photo-fermentative hydrogen producer gradually accumulated in the reactor and reached high concentration of 2.15 g/l.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Bioaggregate of <italic>R. faecalis</italic> RLD-53 in photobioreactor at the optimum conditions.</p><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Photo of bioaggregate; (<bold>b</bold>) and (<bold>c</bold>) SEM images of bioaggregate.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep16174_Fig6_HTML.jpg"/></fig><fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The CLSM images of bioaggregate of <italic>R. faecalis</italic> RLD-53 at the optimum conditions: (a), phase contrast photograph; (b), β-polysaccharides, light blue (calcofluor white), (c), proteins, violet (FITC), (d), lipids, yellow (Nile red); (e), α-polysaccharide, red (Con A rhodamine); (f), total cells, green (SYTO 63), (g), combined image of individual images in (b–f).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep16174_Fig7_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>Theoretically, PFB could convert 100% organic waste into hydrogen in the photobioreactor through harvesting energy from sunlight. However, photo-fermentation must consume a significant fraction of substrate for the production of biomass as biocatalysts, which decrease potential yield of the desired product<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Furthermore, PFB are stable suspension in the photobioreactor due to the poor flocculation, cannot be efficiently separated from supernatant and are washed out with effluent continuously. In the steady state of continuous operation, a considerable proportion of organic substrate have to be used for cell growth to mantain the biomass concentration at constant level. Hydrogen yields by growing PFB are relatively low as the vast majority of the electrons from organic feedstocks are used for biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. As a result, the poor flocculation of PFB resulting in continuous washout of biomass leads to poor performance of the photobioreactor. In this study, stable floc of PFB induced by L-cysteine was applied in a photobioreactor operated in sequencing batch mode for enhancing hydrogen production. During settle stage of reactor operation, bacterial cells within the floc settled to the bottom of the reactor, rather than washed out with effluent. Consequently, a significant fraction of the reductant from organic substrate was diverted away from biomass synthesis into hydrogen production. Therefore, maximum hydrogen production rate 1044 ml/l/d and substrate conversion efficiency of 83.75% were obtained by PFB bioaggregate induced by L-cysteine in a sequencing batch photobioreactor.</p><p>In conclusion, this work presented a novel strategy to significantly enhance hydrogen recovery from organic wastes through bioflocculation of PFB induced by L-cysteine in a sequencing batch photobioreactor. During settling stage, bacterial cells within the floc were retained in the photobioreactor and thereby most of the biomass avoided been washed out with effluent. This greatly improved the biomass retention capacity of the photobioreactor, which enabled the photobioreactor to be operated at a short HRT and high organic loading rate. As maximum biomass concentration achieved 2.10 g/l, the photobioreactor required more light energy at intensity of 200 W/m<sup>2</sup>. Under the optimum conditions, the maximum yield and rate of hydrogen production reached 3.35 mol H<sub>2</sub>/mol acetate and 1044 ml/l/d, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Bacterium and medium</title><p>A photo-fermentative bacterium, <italic>Rhodopseudomonas faecalis</italic> RLD-53 was used as the photo-hydrogen producer, which was isolated from fresh water pond sludge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.
