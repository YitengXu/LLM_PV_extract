This NaCl–KCl composition has a melting point of 657 °C, which makes it suitable for latent-heat thermal energy storage in concentrating solar power applications. Several nickel-based MCrAlX coatings were tested, where M = Ni and/or Co and X = Y, Ta, Hf, and/or Si. Electrochemical testing was carried out to determine corrosion rates. The bare In800H and 310SS alloys corroded rapidly (~2500 and 4500 µm/yr, respectively, assuming uniform corrosion). Concentrating solar power plants need containment materials with a lifetime of at least 30 years; thus, these corrosion rates are excessive. Corrosion mitigation approaches are being investigated to obtain degradation on the order of 20 µm/yr or lower. The lowest corrosion rate of 190 µm/yr was obtained for atmospheric plasma spray NiCoCrAlY coatings pre-oxidized in air at 900 °C for 24 h with a heating/cooling rate of 0.5 °C/min. Metallographic characterization of the corroded surfaces showed that the formation of a uniform thin alumina scale before exposure to the molten chloride system considerably reduced the corrosion of the alloy. However, the rates of corrosion determined herein are considerable, highlighting the relevance of testing materials durability in solar power applications.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary" specific-use="web-only"><title>Solar power: alloys wear protective coats</title><p id="Par2">Spraying materials used in solar thermal power stations with protective coatings could minimize corrosion and extend their lifetimes.

Unfortunately, these molten salts are prone to corroding the alloys from which power plant components are typically made. Judith Gomez-Vidal at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in the US found that spraying and oxidizing NiCoCrAlYTa coatings on inexpensive alloys caused evenly-spread thin alumina films to form, protecting them from corrosion upon exposure to high-temperature salts.

With the advantage of having thermal energy storage (TES), CSP can deliver renewable energy while providing important capacity, reliability, and stability attributes to the electrical grid. Current state-of-the-art CSP plants deliver thermal energy up to 565 °C using nitrate salts as the heat-transfer fluid (HTF) and TES material. Because these salts are unstable at temperatures above 600 °C, other salt chemistries must be investigated. Molten chlorides are being considered as candidates for advanced high-temperature CSP applications because of their low cost, high decomposition temperatures, and good thermal properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> Molten chloride salts could be used as the HTF in solar receivers and/or as sensible or latent TES material. However, in general, they are corrosive to common alloys used in CSP thermal components, e.g., heat exchangers, piping, and storage vessels at these high temperatures. We are investigating corrosion in molten salts at high temperatures for solar applications and its mitigation to obtain degradation of containment materials around 20 µm/yr or lower, thus providing a lifetime for CSP plants of 30 years or more.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup></p><p id="Par4">Corrosion behavior of steel containers in latent TES molten eutectic KCl–LiCl from 310 to 420 °C in air and argon has been evaluated with the long-term weight-loss technique for up to 4000 h of immersion.

Although it was not possible to resolve the chemical composition of individual features, EDS chemical analyses of the region of dispersion compared to deeper regions free of the dispersion features indicated elevated levels of Cr and relatively lower levels of Al compared to the overall chemical composition of the coating. It would then appear that the chloride molten-salt degradation of the HVOF–NiCrAl coating is associated with formation of a 50-µm-thick layer that contains a dispersion of fine dark features. The layer is elevated in Cr, probably due to the formation of a Cr-rich oxide. If the dispersion of features is associated with a fine-scale porosity, this assumption would be consistent with a mechanism for molten-salt corrosion proposed by others. That mechanism proposes preferential oxidation of Cr by the chloride molten salt and literal fluxing or de-alloying of the Cr.

Chromium and aluminum in the coating were preferentially oxidized during pre-oxidation. This oxide layer could help increase the corrosion resistance of the coatings. Alumina is a protective oxide with few defects in its structure, which minimizes or avoids the diffusion of elements; thus, corrosion is controlled or mitigated. The surface characterization of the pre-oxidized NiCoCrAlYTa exposed to the molten chloride indicates that the treated coating was more resistant to chloride molten-salt corrosion.

Sensitization occurs with relatively high C levels in the steel and sufficient time in the temperature range of 700–900 °C. The same effect will be obtained with slow cooling in the same temperature range. The sensitization of the as-deposited sample could occur during the spray deposition process. The molten particles impacting the surface of the substrate increase the surface temperature locally, increasing the feasibility of carbide precipitation. This effect is observed in the heat-affected zone during welding processes.

The salts were then placed in an alumina crucible because this material has been shown to be stable in chloride molten-salt systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> The crucible containing the salt mixture was kept in a vacuum furnace at 120 °C for 24 h and then transferred to a muffle furnace (Vulcan 3-1750), where it was heated and held at 300 °C for 3 h. The temperature was then raised to 850 °C, where it was maintained for 30 min to completely melt the components. To avoid moisture absorption after cooling, the pre-melted and solidified salt mixture was stored at 120 °C in the drying oven until needed for testing. CSP plants cannot pursue very complicated and expensive mixing and melting procedures of the salts, so the salt preparation followed here did not consider any further purification of the mixture.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Preparation of alloys and coatings</title><p id="Par44">The nominal composition of substrate alloys and coatings tested are shown in Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM19">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM20">4</xref>. Alloys In800H and 310SS were machined to 8 mm in diameter and 12 mm in height. High-velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) and atmospheric thermal plasma spray (APS) technologies were employed for the coating deposition. Coating deposition was setup to have thicknesses ~1 mm for the corrosion electrochemical tests. These coatings need to be ground and polished to very flat surfaces to use the geometrical area to normalize the corrosion current and thus determine the chemical performance of the coating material. Bare and coated alloys were progressively polished using up to a 1200-grit SiC abrasive paper, cleaned with deionized (DI) water, and dried with acetone and compressed air. Polishing is required before electrochemical corrosion tests to control the amount of area exposed to the corroding fluid and thus normalize the measured current to obtain the current density. To determine the effect of alumina layers against molten chloride corrosion, some coatings were oxidized in air prior to molten-salt exposure. To establish the electrical connection required for electrochemical testing, nickel-chromium wire (0.5-mm diameter) was welded to the sample. Alumina tubing sealed with refractory cement was employed to insulate the wire. Pre-oxidation of the coatings were performed in atmospheric air at different temperatures and dwelling times using 0.5 °C/min as the heating and cooling rates.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Electrochemical corrosion tests</title><p id="Par45">The electrochemical cell experimental setup used in this work is given elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> A crucible electrical resistance furnace was used to contain the cell made of 316L. The electrochemical cell contains a quartz liner and an off-gas treatment to trap the chloride by-products. A three-electrode arrangement was used with the working electrode (WE) as the sample to be tested. The pseudo reference electrode (RE) was made from 0.5-mm-diameter Pt wire, and the counter electrode (CE) was Pt-gauge spot welded to 0.5-mm-diameter Pt wire. The couple pseudo-PtRE/PtCE electrical stability in molten chloride salts has been reported in previous work to be reached after around 45 min.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup></p><p id="Par46">The corrosion evaluations were performed at 700 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere using a potentiostat (AUTOLAB–PGSTAT302N). A type-K thermocouple in an alumina well was used near the electrodes to record the temperature test. The electrochemical cell setup was sealed and purged with nitrogen for about 24 h before the corrosion testing. The off-gas passed through a series of traps to remove hazardous chlorine vapors before being vented to local exhaust. After reaching thermal equilibration (about 1 h) at 700 °C, the pseudo-PtRE and the PtCE were immersed into the molten chloride salt and allowed to stabilize for about 45–60 min.</p><p id="Par47">To determine the near-steady OCP, potential was continuously recorded starting immediately after its immersion in the molten chloride until a constant potential (dE/dt ≤ 100 µV/s) was obtained. Potentiodynamic polarization studies were conducted immediately after by applying cathodic and anodic external potentials starting with cathodic polarization at 0.001-V steps and 0.001 V/s. Cathodic overpotentials were limited to only – 0.35 V below the OCP to avoid surface modifications of the sample during cathodic polarization due to reduction of impurities over the surface. Anodic polarization was performed up to + 0.6 V above the OCP to determine if the sample is capable of passivation. More than three coupons per test were performed under the same conditions to evaluate the reproducibility of the results.

The sample preparation for these analyses was performed by encapsulating the samples in bakelite for cross-section analyses. For this, the encapsulated samples were progressively polished using up to a 1200-grit SiC abrasive paper followed by 6-μm, 1-μm, and 0.1-μm diamond lapping. Lapping was performed on low-nap polishing cloths, at low speed for short time, to prevent edge rounding at the outer surface of the coating. After polishing, the samples were cleaned with DI water, and dried with acetone and compressed air. The specimens were initially prepared for observation in an unetched condition. Subsequently, they were electroetched in an aqueous 10% oxalic acid electrolyte to characterize the microstructure of the stainless-steel substrate. It should be noted that oxalic acid electroetching represents a test for sensitization of stainless steels, described in ASTM B162. Sensitization represents a corrosion-prone condition in which Cr-rich carbides precipitate at microstructural features such as grain boundaries.</p><p id="Par49">Cross-sectioned and polished samples were metallographically characterized using LM and environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM). Secondary electron and backscattered electron (BSE) imaging was accomplished. Regions of relatively light contrast in BSE images are associated with elements having relatively lower atomic weight. Localized semi-quantitative chemical analysis was accomplished in conjunction with SEM via energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS). Semi-quantitative EDS analyses were performed, resulting in low accuracy for elements of low atomic number such as C, N, and O.</p><p id="Par50">After the corrosion test, samples were removed from the corrosion cell and cleaned in warm DI water to dissolve solidified salt from the surface. After salt removal, the samples were cleaned with acetone and kept in the drying furnace before encapsulation in bakelite for cross-section analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Data availability</title><p id="Par51">The data sets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The work at NREL was supported financially by the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC36-08-GO28308.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>Dr. J.C.G.-V., as the sole author and contributor of the paper, was the principal investigator of the project.
