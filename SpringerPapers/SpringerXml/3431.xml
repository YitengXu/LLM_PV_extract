Municipal solid waste (MSW) is generally accepted as a renewable energy resource. This research study presents a techno-economic assessment potential to utilize the energy obtainable from MSW for the generation of electrical power. The assessment was carried out for energy generation by thermochemical (incineration or combustion) and biochemical (landfilling and anaerobic digestion) processes and based on the available data from seven selected municipalities. Due to the broad scope of this topic, life cycle impact of waste management, social acceptance, policy aspects, and emission reduction or fossil fuel offset are not considered and are not part of the assessment. Results presented in tabular form indicate, for example, that the price of steam generated by a fluidized steam generator is in the range of US$0.018/kWh<sub><italic>t</italic></sub> (Lagos) to US$0.044/kWh (Nsukka) and compares favorably with the typical cost of steam at US$0.015/kWh. Electrical power generation using a combined heat and power plant provides electricity at a cost that is in the range of US$0.017/kWh<sub><italic>e</italic></sub> (Lagos) to US$0.040/kWh<sub><italic>e</italic></sub> (Nsukka) and also compares well with the typical cost of electricity in Nigeria at US$0.14/kWh<sub><italic>e</italic></sub> (as of 2012).</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Municipal solid waste</kwd><kwd>Combustion</kwd><kwd>Energy</kwd><kwd>Electricity</kwd><kwd>Environment</kwd><kwd>Economics</kwd><kwd>Nigeria</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>45</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2013</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2013</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>26</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/40095_2013_Article_71.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Renewable and Green Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1186/2251-6832-4-42" ext-link-type="doi">10.1186/2251-6832-4-42</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Nations are today faced with an overwhelming social problem of processing and disposal of municipal solid waste (MSW). With increasing population growth, rapid urbanization, rising levels of affluence, and resource scarcity, waste-to-energy (WTE) is reestablishing itself as an attractive technology option to promote low carbon growth among other renewable energy technologies. WTE is a proven process that provides electricity and steam generation in a sustainable way.</p><p>Nigeria is the most populated nation in Africa. With a 2011 population estimate of 162.4 million, growing annually at an estimated rate of 3% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and generating 0.55 to 0.58 kg of municipal solid waste per person per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], Nigeria can be said to be equally experiencing significant waste-related environmental problems. These problems can be said to have begun in the period when Nigeria gained independence, became rapidly urbanized, and thus generated more solid waste than nature can absorb or that Nigeria can efficiently dispose. MSW is produced daily all over the world, and it is a renewable energy resource with the potential to produce energy via WTE plants while also reducing the volume of waste. WTE can address the twin issues of land use and pollution from landfills and the well-established environmental perils of fossil fuels known as greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the map of Nigeria showing Abuja, the capital.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>Map of Nigeria.</bold></p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40095_2013_Article_71_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>Rapid urbanization, oil spills, and loss of arable land have created several environmental problems in Nigeria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Among these environmental problems are sheet and gully erosion, coastal and marine erosion and land subsidence, flooding, drought and desertification, oil pollution, urban decay and squatter settlements, industrial pollution and waste, municipal solid waste, biodegradable petrochemical products, concrete jungles or cities, loss of fauna and flora, and climatic change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>MSW can be regarded as 'useless’ , unwanted, and discarded materials that resulted from society's normal or routine daily activities and, in general, may be in solid, liquid, or gaseous form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It is often accompanied by commercial waste, whether solid or semisolid. It also comes in the form of food wastes, paper, cardboard, plastics, textiles, leather, wood, glass, and other household items. In most industrialized nations, from the time wastes are generated, they go through a solid waste chain, consisting of waste handling and separation; storage and processing at source; collection, separation, processing, and transformation of solid wastes; transfer and transport; energy generation; and disposal. This is however not the case in Nigeria or most developing countries. In many parts of the developing world, solid waste disposal is done through dumping and burning without control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These practices pollute land, water, and air. Although these practices are illegal and their consequences recognized and felt in Nigeria, they persist in both urban and rural areas because of weak law enforcement regimen and limited public sector financial resources. A sustainable solution to this gigantic problem, which affects every populace, is through more efficient solid waste management. The generation of energy from MSW (though largely dependent on MSW composition) has the propensity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to generate renewable energy, and to provide energy diversity while also ensuring safe, hygienic, and reliable disposal practices.</p><p>The volume of waste generated in the world today is enormous. This volume of waste generated is to some degree due to inefficiencies (e.g., in usage, sorting, and processing) and, in principle, might be reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. As of 2011, the world generated an estimated two billion tons of MSW, and this number is expected to grow much higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. MSW is a renewable form of energy that includes both commercial and residential wastes generated in municipalities. The US Environmental Pollution Agency (USEPA) goes further to classify MSW as a source of clean energy. From a sustainable development perspective, the focus is on reduction of waste, followed by recycling, both of which are advantageous in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Several analysis done using the USEPA models show that WTE avoids 36 million tons of greenhouse gases yearly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, not all wastes are recyclable, and as such, an energy recovery method becomes essential.</p><p>The interest in the practical applications of WTE dates back to several decades. WTE is hardly a new or novel idea. What is however new is the confluence of factors that have increased the attractiveness of WTE. These factors include rising oil prices, urban air pollution, energy supply security, reduction in foreign oil imports, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions, and climate change. These considerations are not confined to a single nation or part of the world and thus render the concept of WTE as abundantly and equitably available to humanity. Energy recovery through WTE can be defined as a waste treatment process that allows for the generation of energy in the form of electricity or heat from wastes that would have otherwise been disposed off in landfills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It involves the use of modern combustion technologies for the recovery of energy from a mix of MSW. Today, more than 800 thermal WTE plants currently operate in nearly 40 countries around the globe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. WTE systems will treat at least 261 million tons of waste annually by 2022, with a total estimated output of 283 TWh of electricity and heat generation, which increased from 221 TWh in 2010. Under a more optimistic scenario, WTE will potentially treat 396 million tons of MSW a year, producing 429 TWh of power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The global market for thermal and biological WTE technologies will reach about US$6.2 billion in 2012 and grow to about US$29.2 billion by 2022, according to forecasts by Cleantech market intelligence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], while under an optimistic scenario, market value could reach US$80.6 billion by 2022. WTE facilities are integrated into broader waste management practices and policies with the goal of reducing the use of landfills. Although combustion technologies continue to lead the market, advanced thermal treatment technology deployments such as pyrolysis are expected to pick up as diminishing landfill capacity improves WTE economics. The utilization of biological technologies is also expected to increase worldwide.</p><p>It is imperative for every nation to find environmentally benign methods related to sound management of MSW for sustainable development. The energy potential of MSW is contained in materials that are either biogenic or anthropogenic in origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Biogenic materials are those that include paper, food, and yard wastes and are considered to be renewable. Anthropogenic materials, on the other hand, are those that include plastics which are derived from fossil fuels and are not sustainable. Several methods exist to analytically determine the biogenic and anthropogenic fractions of energy-generating components of MSW. Unlike some other renewable energy resources such as tidal, solar, and wind, MSW is always available. Benefits of WTE include waste volume reduction, sanitation and detoxification, stabilization, and energy recovery. The technologies that exist to produce energy from wastes are anaerobic digestion, combustion, gasification, and landfill gas to energy.</p><p>WTE has been well proven in Europe, where energy and solid waste policies have evolved from the Kyoto protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] GHG reduction goals, to include renewable energy (RE) and decreased waste emissions from landfills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This has been invariably good in advancing the state of technology for waste management and conversion to energy such that it is an integral component of solid waste management in Europe. About 18 European Union countries engage in thermally treating 58 million tons of wastes in WTE plants to produce energy annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. As such, RE aspects of solid waste management policies work well together with waste reduction policies.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Waste management practices in Nigeria</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Waste management practices then and now</title><p>The collection and disposal of solid waste in Nigeria were controllable and not a problem before the country's independence in 1960. Before the 1960s, the population was low and not concentrated in urban areas, and people lived in traditional ways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Previous studies described the major cities of Nigeria, such as Ibadan, Calabar, and Port Harcourt, as clean and beautiful. However, when the country gained independence from the colonial masters and oil was subsequently discovered, migration from rural areas to urban areas increased as a result of people wanting to live more comfortably. Nigeria began importing many varieties of foods and luxury goods with consequent increase in solid wastes. Plastics and polythene produced negligible waste in 1971. Today, they make up a large part of the refuse. Empty beverage cans are found littered in every corner of the road. In fact, consumption patterns have dramatically changed since the 1960s and 1970s. For example, according to Paris-based magazine <italic>Jeane Afrique</italic>, Nigerians consumed 593,000 bottles of champagne in 2010, 50% more than the richer rival nation of South Africa - possibly due to the population effect with Nigeria being at least three times larger in population than South Africa.</p><p>Solid waste is now a troubling problem to both the government and the public [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. As with many other nations, solid waste generation in Nigeria is a function of the population, its industrialization level, socioeconomic status, and dominant commercial activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Some of the factors, which influence the generation and stockpiling of solid waste, are the lack of modern waste disposal technology; the lack of facility to separate the waste at source; the effectiveness of existing solid waste management policy and its enforcement, environmental education, and awareness; and the income status. The indiscriminate dumping of secondhand electronic gadgets has also contributed to the waste disposal problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Waste storage and collection are the responsibility of state environmental agencies, private companies, or both. The wastes collected are dumped together, that is, unsegregated, indicating a lack of awareness of their nature and compatibility with one another. The populace also burns their refuse in open dump sites, e.g., documents, rags, and tires, often without sanitary or environmental control. This attracts scavengers at the dumps where they gather plastic cans and bottles, glass, and other recyclables mainly for sale to other secondhand goods markets. More than 50% of the people's wastes are highly decaying food surpluses, and more than 15% are plastic wastes. Wastes are generally recycled by the informal sector while scavengers scan for usable items, as described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>The solid waste problem is acutely felt in Lagos State because it is the most populated city and among the most industrialized in sub-Saharan Africa. In 1995 alone, it produced approximately four million tons of solid wastes. The long history of the waste problem in Lagos goes back to the transfer of waste management from the local governments to the state. Policies kept on changing, leading to management lag. The wastes are generally not treated but moved to landfill sites where they are openly burned. The two incineration plants in Lagos are capable of treating wastes with less than 20% water, but they have never been used as the state's wastes contain 30% to 40% water. Lagos is currently undertaking efforts to generate revenue from waste management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>A brief on waste management policies in Nigeria</title><p>Intervention by the Federal Ministry of Environment has been in the form of a revised policy on environment in 1999 and the National Agenda 21 published also in 1999 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. These measures complemented existing guidelines and standards for environmental pollution, the waste management regulation of 1991, the Environmental Impact Assessment Decree number 86 of 1992, and an environmental edit of 1997. However, as earlier mentioned, nature's way of absorbing waste and human efforts combined have been surpassed by the enormity of the problem and its impact on the environment. Every material or product goes through a long cycle, consisting of activities, which produce greenhouse gas emissions. These are through energy consumption, methane emissions, and carbon storage. The current state of waste management in Nigeria is clearly a picture of neglect and failure in the enforcement of solid waste management policies. The effects of this neglect include unnecessarily lost resources, increased adverse impact on biological processes, disruption of infrastructure, greater risks of flooding and distribution of vermin and pests, and the deterioration of air quality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Waste-to-energy technologies and opportunities for Nigeria</title><p>Technologies for WTE production have been rapidly evolving and changing communities and countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] yielding dual benefits from effective solid waste management practices. Not only will WTE deliver useful energy that is needed in many countries, but it will also aid to dispose of MSW effectively and safely. A community or country's solid waste management goals and objectives, the environmental impact, and production and consumption patterns will help determine if WTE production technology is appropriate for that community or country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. For example, with current government interest and the necessary investment, over the coming years, Lagos State is expected to generate revenue from better waste management, which would be beneficial to remote and rural areas of the state overall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>The main categories of waste to energy technologies are (1) physical technologies which process waste to produce fuel (i.e., refuse-derived fuel or solid-recovered fuel), (2) thermal technologies which can produce heat, fuel oil, or syngas from both organic and inorganic wastes, and (3) biological technologies whereby bacterial fermentation is used to digest organic wastes to produce useful fuel. These can be further elaborated as gasification (pyrolysis - thermal and plasma-arc types), anaerobic digestion, and combustion. Gasification of waste involves thermochemical conversion reactions, which will induce gases under high temperature and low concentration of pure oxygen or air. Methane is produced and can be applied to run an internal combustion engine to generate electricity. Gasification can reduce waste by 70% to 80% while preserving the land area.</p><p>Anaerobic digestion is a biochemical conversion process, which produces fuel for energy through an enclosure called a <italic>digester</italic>. It is currently used in both developed and developing countries to treat both wet and dry biomass resources and to convert MSW and other wastes and residues. It has been successfully used to generate electricity for rural and remote areas of developing countries.</p><p>Combustion or incineration consists of burning the whole mass of waste in an incinerator. Incineration of MSW can drastically reduce the volume of MSW by up to 80% to 90%. The process releases gaseous pollutants such that a pollution control system needs to be set up along with it. This technology operates at 800°C to 1,000°C. It is also important to note that it is however not as popular as gasification.</p><p>Since WTE would be a relatively new concept in Nigeria, the populace would need effective public awareness and sensitization programs and campaigns. The government, for its part, must establish partnership with the organized private sector entities for the needed investments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. With the exception of recent progress on waste issues in Lagos State, issues related to sound MSW management such as recycling programs, waste reduction, and waste disposal have not been adequately addressed in Nigeria. Investigation of the potential contribution of such underutilized fuels like MSW to the energy mix in a sustainable way while minimizing GHG emissions currently produced from landfilling, open dumps, and open burning of solid wastes is a worthwhile undertaking in a developing country like Nigeria.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Materials and methodology for the estimation of the potential</title><p>We begin this work by estimating the calorific value in MSW for selected municipalities in Nigeria based on available data from the literature. The calorific value is derived from the MSW weight distribution (wt.% for as-received MSW on a wet basis) that was obtained from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The MSW was categorized as food waste or vegetables as well as putrescibles, paper, plastics, metals, textile or rubber, and inert or miscellaneous. The calorific values in the MSW collected for Lagos, Port Harcourt, Abuja, Ibadan, Kano, Makurdi, and Nsukka are estimated from their respective MSW data. We consider three ways of handling MSW which have been mentioned earlier. Solid waste is not recycled or composted and is hence disposed to the MSW collection system. It is assumed that plastics, metals, and glass will be recycled with a high degree of success and will not be introduced into a landfill, an incinerator, or an anaerobic digester. From the known moisture and ash content, the dry percentage weight (wt.%) for each category of the MSW was determined.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Calorific value by thermochemical conversion or direct combustion</title><p>The calorific value has been determined using a universal correlation for the process where MSW is incinerated. Two processes - using grate furnace and fluidized furnace steam generators - were considered to convert chemical energy to thermal energy (steam). Conventional Rankine cycle and combined heat and power (CHP) plant were considered to convert chemical energy to electrical energy. The thermal energy (steam generation) or electrical energy generated was calculated using assumed conversion efficiencies for the processes. In the first instance, calorific value was determined for the following categories: vegetables and putrescible or food waste, paper, textiles, and plastics. Glass and metals with zero or negligible free carbon content were not included in the calculation of the calorific value.

The small- and medium-sized plants had two incinerator lines each, while the large plant had three incinerator lines. The plants are equipped with air pollution control devices (APCD) and continuous emission monitoring systems (CEM) and use dry lime injectors, fabric filters, and/or spray drying for air pollution control. The small plants were designed to produce steam, while the medium- and large-sized plants generate electricity. The capital investment costs and operating costs for the reference plants were averaged for each size classification, and the average costs were used in the calculations. The capital cost includes the cost of the incinerator plant and cost of APCD and CEM facilities. The plant is assumed to operate for 7,488 h/year. The annual operating cost includes both direct and indirect operating costs. The amount of MSW collected per month was compared to the plant size in the baseline that was the closest.

These calculations determine the methane generation potential from the landfill. The results are summarized in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.</p><p>The calculated methane generation potential (in m<sup>3</sup> methane/Mg MSW) is lower than the typical range of about 50 to 100 kg methane per tonne MSW (70 to 140 m<sup>3</sup> methane per Mg MSW) for a landfill methane generation estimated by the International Energy Agency (IEA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The difference could be attributed to the fact that the IEA estimate is based on landfill methane plants operated in developed countries where the degradable carbon content may be higher. Furthermore, the landfill WIP at the end of 30 years for the various cities in Nigeria ranges from approximately 133 million metric tonnes (MMT) for Lagos to 4.3 MMT for Nsukka.</p><p>Table <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref> gives the summary of the monthly MSW collection and the cost (not the net cost) per tonne of MSW handled. This is the cost incurred at the landfill for collection and sorting operations and does not include the cost associated with electricity generation or direct gas use. The costs of electricity and direct landfill methane are also presented. The daily MSW collection rate ranges from 12,350 to 400 tonnes/day for the selected municipalities. These numbers are derived from the data that was provided. USEPA guidelines for full cost accounting data state that in this range of daily MSW collection rates, the net cost per ton of MSW handled ranges from less than about $36/ton (at 1,500 tons/day) to about $85/ton (at 400 tons/day). The numbers estimated reveal the same trend but are slightly lower because the cost of capital to establish the landfill is not included. The calculations also assume that the MSW in a place like Lagos goes to a single appropriately sized large landfill. The EPA estimates consider a landfill with 1,500 tonnes/day for the highest daily capacity. The landfill rule was promulgated in the USA as a part of the Clean Air Act of 1996. According to this rule, future landfills, with the size larger than 2.5 MMT and volume greater than 2.5 million m<sup>3</sup>, will have to install features that would either collect or flare the landfill gas. The USEPA report has determined the economics of electricity generated from direct gas use of the landfill methane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. For landfills that are not subject to the landfill rule and whose range in size is from 50,000 to 11,000,000 MT, the break-even gas price was calculated. For these landfills, electricity generation was not considered feasible. The break-even gas price is the price of gas at which the project results in US$0 NPV (net present value) at the end of the 15-year life of the project. For the landfill project to be viable, the WIP must be greater than or equal to the break-even WIP.

The market price of natural gas is about US$2.74 per one million British thermal units (MMBtu)<bold>,</bold> and the average industrial gas methane price is about US$3.42 per MMBtu. The cost of coal mine gas is also in the same range, about US$2.53 per MMBtu. For a landfill generating electricity to be viable, the break-even WIP is 2.9 MMT and the price of electricity would be US$0.04/kWh<sub><italic>e</italic></sub>. For a landfill that produces gas for direct use, the price of gas is about US$2.74 per MMBtu (US$2.59/GJ) for a break-even landfill with a WIP of about 1 MMT. Both these projections assume US$0/TCE, i.e., no extra value for the offset of greenhouse gas emission, and do show incremental emission reductions. This renders the cost of landfill direct gas scenario to nearly 17 to 20 times higher for the municipalities considered. A significant reason for the higher estimate for Nigeria is because the calculations assume a minimally managed landfill with gas collection in place but only capturing 50% of the generated methane. This same factor contributes to the higher estimate for the price of gas. In addition, for a given landfill, the capital investments and operating costs appear to be much higher for a direct gas plant versus an ICE power plant. The extra cost comes from the cost of compression that is about 344,737.5 Pa and piping gas to the consumer from the plant. It must be emphasized that this is an estimate that does not take into account any revenue-generating stream such as tipping fee or garbage collection fee.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Anaerobic digestion</title><p>The methane is combusted in an ICE power plant or can be sold as a direct gas at higher pressures transported through a pipe network. The volume of methane generated by anaerobic digestion for each location that was considered is given in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>.</p><p>It may be noted that the cost of methane generated through anaerobic digestion is much cheaper than landfill methane. The price of the low pressure gas compares very closely with the average cost of natural gas (US$2.59/GJ) as presented in Table <xref rid="Tab9" ref-type="table">9</xref>. When the product gas has to be sold as direct gas to the consumer, it may have to be purified, compressed, and transported through pipes to the consumer. Thus, a factor of 15% has been added to the price of low-pressure product gas to arrive at the price of direct gas. The percentage increase in price is the same as what was estimated to deliver landfill methane for direct gas use. The price of the direct gas obtained through anaerobic digestion is very much competitive with the price of natural gas. In the scenario where methane is generated using an AD process, the methane is subsequently combusted in an ICE power plant or is sold as direct gas at higher pressures, transported through a pipe network. The price of methane is competitive with the market price of natural gas at about US$2.74 per MMBtu, and the average industrial methane gas price is about US$3.42 per MMBtu for most of the selected municipalities except perhaps Nsukka. In addition and as an added benefit, the AD process produces compost that has use in agricultural practices.<table-wrap id="Tab9"><label>Table 9</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>Specific cost estimate for electricity and gas produced by AD of MSW for various locations in Nigeria</bold></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th><p>Location</p></th><th align="center"><p>Nominal capacity of power plant (MW<sub><bold><italic>e</italic></bold></sub>)</p></th><th align="center"><p>Cost of electricity (US$/kWh<sub><bold><italic>e</italic></bold></sub>)</p></th><th align="center"><p>Cost of low-pressure gas (US$/GJ CH<sub>4</sub>)</p></th><th align="center"><p>Cost of direct gas (US$/GJ CH<sub>4</sub>)</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Lagos</p></td><td align="center"><p>117</p></td><td align="center"><p>0.0209</p></td><td align="center"><p>0.89</p></td><td align="center"><p>1.27</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Port Harcourt</p></td><td align="center"><p>57</p></td><td align="center"><p>0.0239</p></td><td align="center"><p>0.8</p></td><td align="center"><p>1.25</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Abuja</p></td><td align="center"><p>9</p></td><td align="center"><p>0.0560</p></td><td align="center"><p>2.28</p></td><td align="center"><p>3.24</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ibadan</p></td><td align="center"><p>43</p></td><td align="center"><p>0.0317</p></td><td align="center"><p>1.37</p></td><td align="center"><p>1.94</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Kano</p></td><td align="center"><p>49</p></td><td align="center"><p>0.0268</p></td><td align="center"><p>1.04</p></td><td align="center"><p>1.48</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Makurdi</p></td><td align="center"><p>8</p></td><td align="center"><p>0.0584</p></td><td align="center"><p>2.35</p></td><td align="center"><p>3.35</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Nsukka</p></td><td align="center"><p>4</p></td><td align="center"><p>0.0792</p></td><td align="center"><p>3.28</p></td><td align="center"><p>4.66</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Incineration or combustion</title><p>Table <xref rid="Tab10" ref-type="table">10</xref> shows the potential for energy generation (<italic>E</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub> in MJ<sub><italic>e</italic></sub>) or thermal (<italic>E</italic><sub>th</sub> in MJ<sub><italic>t</italic></sub>) by incinerating the <italic>organic part</italic> of the MSW.

The operational reliability of WTE systems will be improved over time as more systems are commissioned and operated at a commercial level. WTE should be recognized as part of a future, balanced mix of energy technologies and policies. The location of WTE plants in order to consolidate MSW from various locations to achieve economies of scale will be important. In addition, waste composition is highly unlikely to remain stable, and changes in waste policies and population habits can contribute to waste composition changes which would also affect the performance of WTE plants. Waste having high calorific value will result in more energy recovery. As more societies in the world increasingly adopt the reduce, reuse and recycle strategies, the amount of MSW collected would reduce significantly. While the authors in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] have equally estimated in one capacity or the other the potential for energy generation from other renewable energy sources such as biomass, corn cob, and animal waste for Nigeria, they however did not consider the economics of the potential. Technical and economic assessments of three waste treatment methodologies have been reported in this study. The calorific value and methane generation potential for MSW generated in various towns in Nigeria has been determined. From the estimates of the calorific value and the methane generation potential, the technical feasibility of power generation and/or direct (methane) gas availability has been determined. Within the study, it appears that incineration (particularly a CHP) or anaerobic digestion may be more economical. The costs for power produced by incineration and AD compare very well with what it is in developed countries.</p><p>This study has not addressed the emission aspects and carbon offset arguments of the three MSW management approaches considered here. A compelling argument is self-evident if we consider what happens to MSW today in developing countries that are also energy hungry. Currently, MSW is discarded in most developing nations in a landfill. These landfills are undeveloped swath of land that pollutes the environment. Methane and CO<sub>2</sub> are produced in the landfill, often without any means for methane capture and recovery. Given this scenario, the direct benefits of offsetting methane emission are compelling. It is true that at the end of incinerating the MSW or combusting the methane gas, CO<sub>2</sub> will be produced. On the one hand, it is less potent than methane, and it is hoped that local environmental regulations will regulate carbon dioxide emissions as well. Within the stated study limitations, the following were found:</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>An incinerator plant based on CHP or a fluidized combustion technology is a viable option for Lagos, Ibadan, and Kano.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The viability of landfill methane generation may not be excluded, but it requires further analysis, specifically determining the capital cost with better specificity and methane recovery benefits of a landfill with a MCF of 0.7 and a methane recovery greater than 50%. Landfills tend to take up vital land resource, and such lands cannot be put to any other use for years. This may act as a reason against adopting landfill as a MSW management strategy.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Anaerobic digestion certainly appears to be a promising and viable MSW management strategy for Nigeria. The price of gas or electricity produced is competitive with fuel currently used and electricity generated through other fossil fuel means.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The economic performance of the different waste management options is sensitive to their capital costs and this would depend on plant scale, suppliers and local area logistics. As such, there are some inevitable and inherent uncertainties in the estimated values.</p></list-item></list></p><p>This work serves as a preliminary assessment aimed at identifying which MSW management option would be technically and economically viable. The benefits of energy recovery from waste fuels are such that any nation's waste management policy should embrace energy recovery irrespective of the individual local strategic preferences.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors wish to acknowledge the anonymous reviewers for their recommendations to improve the paper.
