Thermal spray coatings are crucial to the enhanced utilization of various engineering systems. Industries, in recognition of thermal spray’s versatility and economics, have introduced it into manufacturing environments. The majority of modern thermal spray applications are “passive” protective coatings, and they rarely perform an electronic function. The ability to consolidate dissimilar material multilayers without substrate thermal loading has long been considered a virtue for thick-film electronics. However, the complexity of understanding/controlling materials functions especially those resulting from rapid solidification and layered assemblage has stymied expansion into electronics. That situation is changing: enhancements in process/material science are allowing reconsideration for novel electronic/sensor devices. This review critically examines past efforts in terms of materials functionality from a device perspective, along with ongoing/future concepts addressing the aforementioned deficiencies. The analysis points to intriguing future possibilities for thermal spray technology in the world of thick-film sensors.</p></abstract><kwd-group

id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Over the last several decades, the thermal spray process has emerged as an innovative and unique means for processing and synthesizing a range of materials from low-melting plastics to complex multicomponent alloys and refractory ceramics (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>). Numerous industries, in recognition of thermal spray’s versatility and inherent economics, have introduced the technology into the realm of medium and high volume rate manufacturing. The main advantages of the process are:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Versatility with respect to feed materials (metals, ceramics, and polymers in wire, rod, and powder form)</p></list-item><list-item><p>The capacity to form coatings on wide-ranging substrates at relatively low substrate temperatures</p></list-item><list-item><p>The ability to create thick deposits and free-standing structures of ceramics, composites, and functionally graded materials</p></list-item><list-item><p>Nonequilibrium synthesis of novel materials and phases</p></list-item></list></p><p>The majority of present day thermal spray applications are in the field of protective coatings, where the principle function of the overlay coating is to protect the underlying substrate from heat, contact damage (e.g., wear), or the surrounding operational environment (corrosion). Thermal barrier coatings for protection of hot section superalloys in energy and propulsion gas turbines, wide-ranging hard metal cermet and advanced alloy coatings in situations involving abrasive, sliding, or erosion wear, and passive and active (cathodic) protection in corrosive environments are among the most prominent applications (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>). In most of these situations, the coatings can at best be classified as “passive materials” and typically do not contribute to physical or chemical functional response other than providing a barrier function. As such, the applications of thermal spray in truly functional systems, that is, where the deposited materials must provide an electronic or sensory function, is to date limited in scale and scope. However, new opportunities are now emerging in advanced functional surfaces, including dielectrics, electrical conductors, bioactive materials, and solid oxide fuel cells. In these new applications, thermal spray offers advantages for manufacture of deposits over large area substrates and for the creation of complex conformal functional devices and systems. Perhaps the most significant current functional application of thermal spray lies in the manufacture of solid oxide fuel cells, involving layered material architecture of high-temperature ceramics and metals. There is considerable research underway in this field, and it is deserving of a focused review in itself and therefore is not addressed here. This paper seeks to examine the applications of thermal spray technology in thick-film or mesoscale electronic devices and sensor materials where there is clearly an untapped opportunity.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Thick-Film Electronics and Sensors</title><p>Traditional thick-film-based mesoscale (10 micrometer to millimeter dimension) electronic devices represent a vast industry. These devices are the backbone of the semiconductor industry, providing power, circuit management, signal processing, thermal management, and so forth, to microelectronics-based logic circuits. Thick-film circuits also provide a framework for a range of sensing devices and sensor systems, where the circuit can be used by itself without the need to integrate a semiconductor logic circuit. Thick-film-based devices usually comprise multilayers of metals and resistors that are fabricated on a ceramic (usually 96% alumina) platform. These circuits are fabricated in patterned form using screen printing of material formulations in the form of pastes that are applied layer by layer and followed by a thermal exposure (firing) cycle. The thermal exposures can be as high as 800 °C for low-temperature cofired ceramic (LTCC) modules and as high as 1400 °C for high-temperature cofired ceramic (HTCC) modules. Although this process has been very well developed over the last several decades, it relies on a high level of material and design considerations for each device. For instance, each functional inorganic material needs to be first developed in a paste formulation that ultimately will yield a functional sintered thick-film device. The interfacial mismatch among the layers also requires careful optimization because of the high fabrication temperature and subsequent cool down. The temperature exposure severely restricts the substrate and material selection and also limits the size and conformality of the substrates.</p><p>Thermal spray offers a number unique attributes and advantages in thick-film sensor and electronics manufacturing. The virtues and unique advantages of thermal spray with respect to thick-film electronics fabrication and related processes are:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>High throughput manufacturing capability</p></list-item><list-item><p>In situ application of metals, ceramics, polymers, or any combinations of these without thermal treatment or curing, incorporating mixed or graded layers</p></list-item><list-item><p>Potentially useful materials properties in the as-deposited state</p></list-item><list-item><p>Cost-effective, efficient processability in virtually any environment</p></list-item><list-item><p>Limited thermal input during processing, allowing for deposition onto a variety of substrates</p></list-item><list-item><p>Adaptable to flexible manufacturing concepts; for example, lean manufacturing</p></list-item><list-item><p>Three-dimensional (3D) capability using robotics and the ability to apply functional electronics on actual structures</p></list-item><list-item><p>Readily available for customizing special electronics and sensor systems (i.e., prototyping)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Green technology vis-à-vis plating, lithography, and so forth.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Can be applied on a wide range of substrates and conformal shapes</p></list-item><list-item><p>Rapidly translatable development to manufacturing (using existing infrastructure)</p></list-item></list></p><p>Thermal spray methods offer means to produce blanket deposits of films and coatings as well as the ability to produce patches, lines, and vias <italic>(</italic>through the use of masking or by direct writing). Multilayers can be produced on plastic, metal, and ceramic substrates, both planar and conformal. Embedded functional electronics or sensors can be overcoated with a protective coating, allowing applications in harsh environments. As this article shows, such embedded harsh environment sensors can be used for condition-based maintenance of engineering components.</p><p>As shown throughout this paper, there are a number of published accounts describing consideration of thermal spray for electronics applications that date back almost 40 years for the production of electronics components, sensors, ceramic superconductors, waveguide components, insulated metal substrates, various magnetic deposits, photochemical coatings, and so forth. However, there has been limited success in terms of translating these concepts into applications. This can be attributed to several deficiencies, among which are:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Inability to deposit materials that decompose or sublime during thermal processing (e.g., resistor materials such as RuO<sub>2</sub> or semiconductors such as SiC)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Presence of a large number of extrinsic defects in the rapidly quenched materials including pores, cracks, and interfaces that can affect the functional response of the material</p></list-item><list-item><p>Intrinsic defects in the form of disorder, vacancies, and chemical changes associated with the back-to-back rapid heating and rapid cooling processes and associated phase changes (melting and solidification)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Residual stresses within the material and in the assemblage</p></list-item><list-item><p>Difficulty in characterizing the functional properties of these anisotropic, layered high-defect density systems and methodologies to modify the requisite functional properties through advanced processing and control strategies</p></list-item><list-item><p>Lack of fundamental understanding of the process and the ensuing process-materials-property relationships, leading to insufficient process control and limited personnel expertise with both materials knowledge and advanced processing</p></list-item></list></p><p>The capabilities of thermal spray technology, even as recently as a decade ago, were deficient for meeting the requirements of functional electronics. However, a number of important changes have occurred: cost-driven application developments in the automotive industry (e.g., electrical applications), availability of sophisticated affordable diagnostic tools, enhanced process control and reliability, and, finally, improved fundamental understanding through integrated interdisciplinary research. Our understanding of the process and the ability to control microstructures now offer unique opportunities with which to synthesize functional surfaces of a variety of complex materials systems. Actually, off-the-shelf current technology remains restricted in its capacity to satisfy the needs of electronics. The present limitation, however, is a classic case of a technology on the verge of a needs-driven upheaval. Thermal spray in electronics, therefore, represents a potential <italic>disruptive technology</italic>.</p><p>In this review, we first critically examine developments and advances in deposition of functional materials via thermal spray and what progress has been made. Subsequently, an analysis of device-level integration contemplated or demonstrated via thermal spray is explored. The impact of technological evolution in terms of new processes, materials, and measurement capabilities in advancing the capability of functional electronic materials is discussed. Finally, an illustrative example of a new frontier in thermal spray applications in electronics derived through a major initiative in the authors group is provided. It is envisioned that the fusion of technological advances, expanded knowledge through fundamental research, and novel applications will propel thermal spray into a rich new territory.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Properties of Thermal Sprayed Functional Electronic Materials: A Review</title><p>As identified previously, one of the key challenges in thermal spraying of thick-film electronics and sensors is achieving the requisite functional response from the deposited material. The thermal spray process can impart significant changes to the starting material, resulting in deviations in properties in relation to their bulk counterpart. This section critically examines developments broken down by electronic subcomponents and materials.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Dielectrics</title><p>One of the key benefits of thermal spray, notably plasma spray, is the ability to deposit refractory ceramics on metallic substrates. This capability naturally lends itself to the production of insulated metal substrates either for electrical isolation or to provide substrates having specific dielectric constants. This capability has allowed consideration of plasma spray for a number of decades as a means to produce electrically insulating/dielectric coatings. Flame and plasma sprayed dielectrics were considered as early as 1966. Luke in a company report characterized various flame and plasma sprayed alumina coatings for electrical breakdown applications (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>). One of the earliest applications was to use plasma spray to produce dielectric coatings for heat sinks in electronic packaging. Mackay and Muller demonstrated the applicability of alumina and beryllia to satisfy the dual function of providing a dielectric barrier as well as allowing sufficient heat conduction for aluminum heat sinks (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>). Wide-ranging properties of both as-deposited and sealed coatings were measured at ambient and at elevated temperatures in the presence of humidity. They noted that the porosity in the coating is sensitive to water vapor, and as such density control or sealing methods were necessary. Subsequently, in the late 1960s and 1970s Harris and coworkers considered plasma sprayed dielectrics of wide-ranging materials including alumina, beryllia, Mg(Sr)TiO<sub>3</sub>, nonmagnetic ferrites, garnets, and niobates for applications in ceramic wave guides and microwave integrated circuits (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>).</p><p>Since the late 1980s, there have been several papers exploring the process-microstructure-property relationships in thermal sprayed alumina-based ceramics as candidate dielectrics and insulated metals substrates. Brown et al. conducted detailed studies on plasma sprayed insulated metal substrates, particularly from the viewpoint of process-structure-property relationships (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>). Detailed investigations of plasma sprayed alumina revealed that the metastable nature of the plasma sprayed coatings resulted in extreme sensitivity of the dielectric properties to moisture. A remarkable result that was demonstrated is the reversibility of the dielectric constant with relative humidity (those points were repeated under cyclic exposure). This was done for various frequencies, and the results are summarized in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Additional studies were also conducted on single-phase cubic spinel (MgO-3Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) coatings, and the dielectric properties (dielectric constant and loss tangent) were reported in both as-sprayed and annealed conditions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Matejka and Benko examined the role of alloying alumina with various concentrations of TiO<sub>2</sub> on both the dielectric constant and the breakdown voltage (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>). The relative dielectric constant changed significantly with the addition of TiO<sub>2</sub>, although the dielectric breakdown strengths did not show any specific trend. In a similar investigation, Filmer et al. examined the dielectric strength not only of TiO<sub>2</sub> alloyed alumina, but a range of other oxide ceramics, including SiO<sub>2</sub>, MgO, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, and Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>). By optimizing plasma spray gases and parameters, they demonstrated that coatings with excellent dielectric strength can be produced. The alumina-titania system demonstrated not only very good dielectric breakdown strength (&gt;500 V/mm) but also enhanced toughness for durable performance. The results are summarized in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Dielectric properties of APS alumina as a function of relative humidity measured at various frequencies [adapted from Brown et al.

These advanced processes allow for high coating density and excellent smoothness compared to traditional air plasma spray as well as the ability to deposit thin layers.</p><p>In the late 1990s, through a major U.S. Department of Defense initiative, the author’s group at Stony Brook conducted detailed investigations of the dielectric properties of thermal sprayed alumina ceramics deposited using both plasma and HVOF methods (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>). Materials of interest included alumina, alumina-13% titania, and spinel (MgO-3Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). One of the issues in measuring the dielectric properties of plasma sprayed ceramics is the coating roughness as well as contamination/oxidation of the substrate, which can affect the accuracy of dielectric measurements (the native oxide layer of the metallic substrate will participate in the dielectric measurement and lead to series capacitance issues). These effects were examined by deposition on platinum or AgPd plated ceramic substrates. For all of the alumina-based materials, the dielectric constant varied between 6 and 9 and showed some microstructural dependence. The dielectric constant measured over a range of frequencies up to 5 GHz showed stable performance and relatively low dissipation factors (loss tangent). The surface roughness of the coatings played an important role in accurate determination of the dissipation factor as indicated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. These results showed viability in terms of advanced thermal spray techniques to produce high-frequency dielectric materials.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Effect of roughness on dielectric loss tangent of HVOF sprayed spinel coatings</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11666_2010_9475_Fig3_HTML.gif" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p>The reported dielectric properties of the alumina coating is somewhat smaller (~20%) than those observed for bulk sintered alumina. This can be attributed to two factors: porosity/interfaces and phase purity. Of the two, the interfaces between splat layers and interpass layers play a much bigger role in reducing the dielectric constant; that is, the interface between the spray deposited layers can comprise nanoscale gaps of pores/air and can participate in the dielectric response by acting as <italic>series capacitors</italic>. To explore this issue, Turunen et al. conducted a series of experiments with HVOF in which the deposit build rate was manipulated to deliberately introduce interfacial porosity (via interpass porosity) (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>). As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, it is not only feasible to describe the reduction in dielectric constant of thermal sprayed alumina based on porosity, but it is possible to manipulate the properties through processing control.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Variation in dielectric constant of HVOF alumina as a function of number of interpass layers represented in microns (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11666_2010_9475_Fig4_HTML.gif" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p>In recent years, Sulzer Metco Corporation developed a new process for large-area thin-film deposition based on LPPS technology (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>). Classified as LPPS thin film, this technique essentially evaporates powder particles in a large direct current (DC) thermal plasma operated in relatively low pressure of ~1 Torr. The resultant films are thin and dense and can be applied over a large area very rapidly. Young et al. reported on the dielectric characteristics of these films (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>). Although microstructurally there were heterogeneities, the coatings displayed excellent dielectric strength &gt;1000 kV/cm for a 20 μm film, which is several times that of comparable air plasma sprayed coatings. Ironically, thicker coatings in the ~50 μm range actually showed lower dielectric strength, suggesting that the microstructures were not uniformly reproduced through thickness of this relatively new process.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Non-Alumina Dielectrics and Perovskites</title><p>Other dielectric materials also received attention during the same period. Wang and Herman examined the dielectric properties of cordierite (2MgO-2Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-5SiO<sub>2</sub>) and forsterite (MgO-SiO<sub>2</sub>) (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>). These are complex ternary compositions have low dielectric constant and excellent chemical durability and were considered potential materials for integrated circuits. Wang et al. showed that in the case of cordierite the as-deposited material is generally amorphous with a dielectric constant of about 7 and is independent of frequency (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>). The annealed material shows variation in dielectric constant as a function of frequency from about 7.3 at 100 Hz to about 5.7 at 1 MHz. In the case of forsterite, the dielectric constant and loss tangent changed substantially upon annealing, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. The as-sprayed material displays significant dielectric loss compared to the annealed material. Wang and Herman provided detailed explanation on the microstructural implications on the dielectric performance.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Dielectric constant and loss tangent as a function of frequency for APS forsterite coating in as-sprayed and annealed conditions</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11666_2010_9475_Fig5_HTML.gif" id="MO5"/></fig></p><p>More complex perovskite-based dielectric systems including lead zirconate titanate (PZT), BaTiO<sub>3</sub>, and strontium-doped BaTiO<sub>3</sub> have been investigated in significant detail over the last two decades. BaTiO<sub>3</sub>-based perovskite materials are a class of high dielectric constant materials that are of interest for capacitor applications. Multilayer ceramic capacitors based on these perovskite materials are produced by stacking very thin plates of the ceramic with parallel plate electrodes, and these materials are incorporated as part of thick-film hybrid electronic circuitry. The properties of BaTiO<sub>3</sub> result from structural order in the material that results in very high permittivity or dielectric constant.</p><p>Malric et al. examined the crystal structure of plasma sprayed PZT thick films (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>). Haessler et al. examined both structure and electrical properties of plasma sprayed PZT thick films (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>). They noted that PZT particles melt incongruently, leading to loss of PbO particularly at the required plasma power that produced dense coatings. This conundrum of having to preserve chemistry while minimizing porosity has also been seen in other complex oxide systems as well, when subjected to plasma spray conditions. Compensating for Pb loss through Pb enrichment to the powder can be considered a mitigating strategy but one that requires careful a priori assessment and calculations. The as-deposited material did not yield the perovskite phase resulting in lower dielectric constant, and the films were not polarizable. Annealing of the sprayed films resulted in improvements both to the phase content and the dielectric properties; however, even after annealing at 750 °C there was no reported ferroelectric transition. This may be related the presence nanocrystalline grains, as similar results have been reported in plasma sprayed BaTiO<sub>3</sub> (see next paragraph). Annealing at 850 °C provided both enhanced homogeneity in chemical composition and phase uniformity resulting in improvements to dielectric constant as well as polarizability.</p><p>In 1970, Kimura explored flame spray deposition of BaTiO<sub>3</sub> as a capacitor dielectric (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>). They deposited a 30 μm film onto an iron tape and reported very high dielectric constant of up to 6000. The coating comprised both amorphous and crystalline components. A number of applications were contemplated including variable or fixed capacitors, capacitor networks, and so forth. The reported dielectric constant may have been overestimated because of inaccuracies in thickness measurements and the inappropriate use of measurement electrodes. A few years later, Elyard et al. conducted a detailed process investigation of plasma sprayed BaTiO<sub>3</sub> (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>). Two types of plasma spray systems were used for this study, and a range of parameters were modified. They found feed rate alone made a significant contribution, changing from 280 at 0.1 g/s to 370 at 0.22 g/s. Furthermore, they reported that, at low spray distance of 60 mm, dielectric constant as high as 1600 was achieved, although the layers were not adhered to the substrate. Annealing at 1200-1300 °C made a significant difference to the dielectric properties. For instance, the coating with the dielectric constant of 370 improved to well over 1000. The time required to achieve &gt;1000 dielectric constant depended on annealing temperature. For instance, at 1300 °C, it only took 1 h to achieve properties that took 16 h at 1200 °C. Here again, a notable observation was the absence of ferroelectric transition in the as-sprayed coating when compared to the annealed material. This is discussed below in the paper based on a more recent observation.</p><p>During the last decade, the author’s group carried out extensive investigations on process development of BaTiO<sub>3</sub> and Ba(Sr)TiO<sub>3</sub> compounds as potential capacitor materials for a thermal sprayed electronic circuit. Both HVOF and plasma spray processes were considered.

The dielectric constant of the coating was strongly dependent on the amorphicity in the coating.

Increasing dielectric constant was observed with increasing coating thickness. This suggests that the initial quenched layers formed on the metallic substrates contributed to a larger fraction of the amorphous phase.

Ahn et al. conducted detailed structural evaluation of plasma sprayed BaTiO<sub>3</sub> and the Ba(Sr)TiO<sub>3</sub> coatings (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>). They observed that the amorphous phase plays a key role in suppressing the dielectric properties of the material. Figure <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> shows a transmission electron micrograph of the amorphous region in plasma sprayed BaTiO<sub>3</sub>. The amorphous phases tended to concentrate at the interface between the substrate and the deposited layer, resulting in lowering the effective capacitance. A series capacitance based model was used to assess the dielectric response of the multilayer system (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>).<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Transmission electron micrographs of APS Ba(Sr)TiO<sub>3</sub> coatings displaying mixture of amorphous and nanocrystalline regions resulting from rapid quenching.

They found that “oxidizing” combustion flame was necessary to prevent decomposition of the titanate. In reducing environments, the material changed color from pale yellow in the starting powder to dull gray in the coating. Furthermore, the prevalence of amorphous phases in the coatings was observed. Under certain conditions, the coatings were completely amorphous. Those sprayed at long standoff distances were predominantly amorphous due to limited interaction of the oxyfuel plume with the substrate and resultant absence of self-annealing. Similar parametric analysis was also conducted for plasma sprayed perovskite materials. The overall conclusion was that the dielectric properties were affected by crystallinity, grain size, phase content, and also cracking within the coatings. Dielectric constant up to 115 was achieved in the as-deposited state with further enhancements made possible through low-temperature annealing.</p><p>A particularly noteworthy observation was the rapid increase in dielectric constant with low-temperature heat treatment for a relatively short duration. For example, a 500 °C heat treatment in air for 30 min resulted in almost 4 orders of magnitude improvement in dielectric constant from ~40 to about 180. These results suggest that the critical factor is structural order in the deposited films. As a result of improvements to the feedstock powder (via improved flowability) and enhancing process conditions (through higher particle velocity and increased substrate temperature), dielectric constants of up to 250 were achieved in the as-deposited state. Further low-temperature heat treatment at 500 °C improved the dielectric constant to almost 650. These results suggest that thermal spray offers an interesting avenue to deposit these complex materials. However, significant attention needs to be paid to the mechanisms governing deposit formation and the resultant structure-property relationships.</p><p>Because these complex perovskite-based systems are used in high frequencies, it is important to determine the frequency-dependent dielectric properties of the sprayed layers. Figure <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> shows the normalized capacitance of a plasma sprayed Ba(Sr)TiO<sub>3</sub> as a function of frequency. A change in capacitance of ~5% is seen when testing between 100 kHz and 3 MHz indicating functionality.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Normalized capacitance as a function of frequency for APS BaTiO<sub>3</sub></p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11666_2010_9475_Fig9_HTML.gif" id="MO9"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Conductors</title><p>The ability to deposit a wide range of metallic materials onto insulative substrates is an important capability of thermal spray and lends itself to possible applications as conductor traces and surfaces.

Platinum is another noble material that can provide high conductivities due to the absence of oxidation.

During the spray process, preferential oxidation of select elements can play the role of a “getter” and result in reduced alloy content and oxidation in the matrix material. This can manifest itself as enhanced conductivity of certain components within the heterogeneous system. However, the interpretation can be quite complex and requires careful consideration of local chemical composition and oxidation states.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Clearly for applications in electronics, the conductors are required to be of high quality, thin, and free of localized defects that can introduce resistances and charge buildup. Reduction or elimination of oxides in the coating is vitally important to achieve these goals. Recent interests in solid-state deposition processes has allowed deposition of dense, oxide-free metallic layers of conductive metals with potential capability to produce very high quality conductors.</p><p>A point of further consideration on assessing the electrical response is the measurement itself. Typically, the electrical resistivity is measured using a standard four-point probe. Given that the coatings comprise not only internal defects but also roughness, it has been shown that there exists an unusual thickness dependence on electrical resistivity. In two independent studies, one on solid-state deposited silver and another on air plasma sprayed molybdenum, a similar effect was observed where the electrical resistivity increased with decreasing coating thickness. (Note, resistivity should be constant as it is an intrinsic property, and the dimensions are already accounted for.) The results for solid-state deposited silver is discussed in Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>. Sharma et al. analyzed this peculiar effect for APS Mo by initially treating the roughness and porosity as a secondary medium and linked the resistivity to the net volume fraction of the metal (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>). Figure <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref> displays the experimental results and those based on a two-layer model treating the roughness as a secondary layer. This is a rather important result when considering thermal spray based applications in electronics. Surface roughness effects will dominate the electrical properties of thin thermal sprayed layers and thus limit the applicability of thermal sprayed conductors to greater than 25 μm.<fig id="Fig13"><label>Fig. 13</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Surface roughness effects in measuring resistivity suggesting higher resistivity in thinner coatings (note resistivity should be independent of thickness).

In such situations, AC response of transmission line conductors is important.

In an early report, Smyth and Anderson fabricated a composite resistor based on NiO and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> onto glass substrates and were able to tune the resistivities between 5 and 500 Ohm/sq, and the temperature coefficient of resistance was also studied (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>). They identified particle size as a critical parameter and optimized the resistivity based on this variable. A notable contribution even in this early period was the evaluation of performance durability at temperatures of 150 °C. Many of the resistors showed durable performance even up to 10,000 h. Smyth and Anderson in their pioneering work also speculated that although their initial work was conducted on glass substrates, plasma spray will enable deposition on plastic substrates with the possibility to combine the process with photo-resist masking technology to produce complex patterns.</p><p>Thermal spray techniques also lend themselves to fabrication of thick-film resistors through the following novel means:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Intrinsic modification to a sprayed metallic phase by deliberately introducing oxidation during the spray process.

Valarezo compared the electrical resistivity of thermal sprayed NiCr coatings spray deposited using traditional air plasma spray, high-velocity plasma (Triplex), and a range of gas and liquid fuel HVOF processes. The results indicate that the resistance can be substantially different compared to bulk, although the extent of change among the coatings is still somewhat limited (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Magnetic properties of thermal sprayed permanent magnet materials</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2"/><th align="left" colspan="5"><p>Alloy</p></th></tr><tr><th align="left"><p>SmCo<sub>5</sub> (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>) (37 wt.% Sm)</p></th><th align="left"><p>SmCo<sub>5</sub> (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>) (38.5 wt.% Sm)</p></th><th align="left"><p>Nd-Fe-B (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>) (30.1 wt.% Nd, 5 wt.% Dy, 0.3 wt.% Al, 0.91 wt.% B, Fe)</p></th><th align="left"><p>Nd-Fe-B (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>) (Nd<sub>15</sub>Dy<sub>1</sub>Fe<sub>77</sub>B<sub>7</sub>)</p></th><th align="left"><p>Nd-Fe-B (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>) [Nd<sub>16</sub>Dy<sub>1</sub>Fe<sub>76</sub>B<sub>7</sub> (preheating the substrate ~600 °C)]</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="6"><p><italic>As-deposited</italic></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Remanescence, kG</p></td><td align="left"/><td char="." align="char"><p>3.8</p></td><td align="left"/><td char="–" align="char"><p>8.0-8.4</p></td><td char="–" align="char"><p>5.5-5.7</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Intrinsic coercivity, kOe</p></td><td align="left"/><td char="." align="char"><p>7.5</p></td><td align="left"/><td char="–" align="char"><p>0.2-0.4</p></td><td char="–" align="char"><p>12.0-15.8</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>(BH)<sub>max</sub>, MGOe</p></td><td align="left"/><td char="." align="char"><p>1.9</p></td><td align="left"/><td char="–" align="char"><p>3.0-3.5</p></td><td char="–" align="char"><p>6.5-6.9</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="6"><p><italic>After annealing</italic></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Remanescence, kG</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>5.2</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>5.1</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>17.3</p></td><td char="–" align="char"><p>6.6-7.0</p></td><td char="–" align="char"/></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Intrinsic coercivity, kOe</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>67.5</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>53</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>5.9</p></td><td char="–" align="char"><p>15.2-15.6</p></td><td char="–" align="char"/></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>(BH)<sub>max</sub>, MGOe</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>6.7</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>6.4</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>7.7</p></td><td char="–" align="char"><p>10-10.3</p></td><td char="–" align="char"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></list-item><list-item><p>A second approach to thermal sprayed resistors includes mixed metal-metal oxide layers such that the resistance can be tuned around the percolation limit of the metallic phase.

Resistivity of Ni decreased upon annealing, while the resistivity of NiCr increased with annealing. They attributed this behavior to different underlying mechanisms among the two systems. In the former, it was related to healing of structural defects, while in the latter it may have been related to ordering phenomena within the lattice structure (NiCr shows order-disorder transitions).</p><p>An important application of thermal sprayed resistors lies in the field of heaters.

Over the years, a large number of publications have explored thermal sprayed metallic and oxide magnetic materials.

The sprayed and heat treated material showed some of the highest room-temperature coercivity during that period. Depending on the process conditions that were used, the crystallinity and microstructure can be substantially affected. In certain situations, a predominantly amorphous coating was obtained which, upon crystallization at 700 °C, resulted in structure that showed a stable material with no loss of coercivity. By contrast, when sintered materials were exposed to 750 °C, a loss of coercivity was observed. It was reported that sprayed magnets could be heat treated at lower temperatures compared to traditional sintering while achieving similar coercivities. In a subsequent investigation, they were able to clarify the differences in the thermal stability of the sprayed magnets versus the sintered magnets, indicative of expanded homogeneity range of the sprayed materials (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>). These landmark findings suggested that plasma spray would be a viable manufacturing method for temperature-stable permanent magnets. In a subsequent patent published in 1990, the authors have proposed depositing samarium cobalt onto a substrate preheated to very high temperature (in a controlled atmosphere), enabling oriented growth of the <italic>c</italic>-axis (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>). Although no data were shown, it was suggested that oriented materials will result in high magnetic anisotropy.</p><p>The emergence of Nd-Fe-B as a permanent magnet material led to interest in plasma spraying of these materials particularly since rapid quenching of these materials is an important attribute in their performance. Wyslocki reported a detailed assessment of the microstructure, domain structure, and magnetic properties of plasma sprayed Nd-Fe-B. Here again, a shield of argon was provided around the spray to minimize oxidation (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>). Deposits were made on copper substrates at a variety of substrate temperatures ranging from water cooled to those heated up to 800 °C. Chemistry changes caused by preferential evaporation and oxidation were noted, particularly for Nd and B. Both isotropic and anisotropic films were prepared. Furthermore, the deposits were also annealed for a period of time and magnetic properties measured. As expected, good isotropic magnets were obtained when the material was quenched onto water-cooled substrates followed by an annealing step, while the anisotropic magnets were formed on hot substrates heated up to 600 °C. In the latter case, it is likely that alignment of grains occurred across the splats as the coating was formed. As with all past activities, the as-sprayed materials were significantly deficient in magnetic properties, especially coercivity. Upon annealing, the coercivity increased substantially, achieving a maximum at about 750 °C for a 30 min anneal. When annealing above 750 °C the properties deteriorated. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed the as-sprayed materials showed strong <italic>c</italic>-axis texture that was rendered equiaxed upon recrystallization at annealing temperatures above 750 °C.</p><p>Rieger et al. reported on an approach to fabricate Nd-Fe-B thick films via vacuum plasma spraying (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>). By controlling substrate temperature, they were able to reduce interfacial porosity or cracks and also develop microcrystalline films. They reported magnetic properties of the vacuum sprayed thick films that were similar to those produced by sputtering. A comparison of the data of the various NdFeB studies is summarized in Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and compared with those of bulk properties. Wilson et al. conducted deposition studies in a controlled atmosphere rather than in low pressure (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>). The goal was to produce near-net-shape deposits of thick films in a single step, especially from the viewpoint of preparing permanent magnets in complex shapes. In their study dysprosium was added to substitute for neodymium. A number of preliminary studies were conducted by varying spray parameters to optimize the microstructure and deposit efficiency. As in previous studies, substrate preheating as an important factor was explored. They concluded from x-ray diffraction results that the as-sprayed materials were predominantly amorphous. The magnetic properties of the as-sprayed materials were relatively poor, while they improved significantly upon annealing. They concluded that controlled-atmosphere plasma spraying followed by sintering was a viable approach to manufacturing permanent magnet materials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Ferrites and Soft Magnetic Materials</title><p>Harris in the 1970s reported on an extensive investigation to apply plasma spraying to form ferrite coatings (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>). Ferrites are magnetic ceramics based on naturally occurring magnetite that have been used extensively in a variety of magnetic applications from navigation to transformers to telecommunication devices. Ferrites are usually processed using traditional powder sintering routes or using thin-film deposition technology. However, in many cases more complex objects and multilayer systems are required that pose significant challenges to powder sintering technology. This led to investigations on plasma spray.</p><p>In his early work, Harris et al. focused on building microwave-integrated circuits based on MnMg ferrites and Y-Fe garnet materials (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>). In his landmark paper in 1988, several interesting devices were prepared using plasma spray ferrite technology (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>). Limited information on the properties of these sprayed materials was reported. During this period, there was considerable activity in applying APS ferrites along with some controversies relative to the appropriate processing condition and formation of phases. For instance, Sugimoto reported that plasma gases based on argon alone led to formation of metastable wustite coatings. In 1975, Andrews and Fuller conducted extensive investigations on APS deposition of nickel ferrites (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>). Their work focused on powder preparation (milling and coprecipitation), enhancements to particle velocities via use of smaller nozzles, use of liquid feed powder slurries, and so forth. Deposition studies were conducted on wide-ranging ceramic substrates including alumina, barium/magnesium titanate, and forsterite with the aim of manipulating the thermal expansion mismatch. They demonstrated that ferrite films of reasonable density and surface finish were obtainable with appropriate selection of feedstock materials and plasma spray technology. The as-sprayed films showed significant coercivity that was dramatically reduced by annealing at 1200 °C. Enikov et al. explored plasma sprayed magnetite coatings for microwave applications (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>). They reported that although the structures were crystalline, significant distortion was present, but metastable wustite (FeO) was not recorded in the Mössbauer spectrum.</p><p>Taylor and Vidal conducted studies on simultaneous plasma synthesis and deposition of barium hexaferrite thick films via induction plasma spray (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>). Here precursors containing the species of barium and iron salts dissolved in water were directly injected into a induction thermal plasma torch, enabling conversion of the precursor into inorganic oxide with concomitant deposition. This process is akin to thermal plasma assisted chemical vapor deposition. They were able to provide a complex two-component oxide comprising BaFe<sub>12</sub>O<sub>19</sub> in crystalline forms.</p><p>In light of these interests, in recent years Yan et al. conducted extensive fundamental studies aimed at improved understanding of the process-structure-property relationships in plasma sprayed MnZn ferrite coatings (MZF) (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>).

Annealing leads to vanishing of this exchange bias associated with the transformation of the antiferromagnetic wustite to ferromagnetic hematite (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Finally, several additional papers clarified many of the structural and magnetic observations through detailed studies of structure via neutron diffraction, assessing residual stresses in the films and through magnetostriction and ferromagnetic resonance.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The aforementioned studies were perhaps the most comprehensive characterization of plasma sprayed functional ceramics and have allowed application considerations. As is discussed later, these insights enabled consideration of plasma sprayed ferrites toward the fabrication of thermal sprayed planar magnetic multilayer devices, section <xref rid="Sec31" ref-type="sec">4.3</xref>.</p><p>NiZn ferrites have also been explored via HVOF thermal spray techniques. Ge et al. produced nanostructured films Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Zn<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> films from spray dried powders and examined their crystal characteristics and magnetic permeability (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>). They only reported magnetic properties of films annealed at 1100 °C for 2 h that were stable with frequency. No properties of the as-sprayed nanostructured films with defects were discussed.</p><p>Recent efforts have also focused on APS deposition of ferromagnetic barium hexaferrites as electromagnetic absorbers in telecommunication devices. Lisjak et al. and Begard et al., in studies of both doped and undoped barium hexaferrites, indicated that the as-sprayed materials were deficient with respect to crystallinity and required temperatures in excess of 1100 °C for full crystallization with concomitant improvements in magnetic properties (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, interest in ferrites shifted toward cobalt ferrite materials that are known for their large magnetostriction, that is, resulting from change in magnetization state from a change in stress. Such materials are useful for noncontact measurement of mechanical forces, for example, in torque sensing. Liang et al. conducted plasma spray studies on these materials (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>). Initially, spray deposition was conducted from powders that were produced from a precursor route. Although the powders were nonoptimal from a sprayability viewpoint, a lack of commercial availability of these materials made this the only possible route. The CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> films were successfully prepared via atmospheric plasma spray. Air was used as a carrier gas to prevent degradation of the ferrite in the reducing atmosphere of the Ar/H<sub>2</sub> plasma. Despite this precaution, oxygen loss occurred, resulting in the formation of oxygen deficient wustite (FeO) phase with concomitant decrease in resistance. Annealing the coating at 500 °C allowed reoxidation of the material. Magnetic measurement revealed that the annealed coatings showed magnetostrictive properties approaching those of sintered ceramic equivalent and as such suitable for possible magnetostrictive sensor applications.</p><p>Amorphous alloys, notably FeSi-based ferromagnetic materials, have also been an area of interest within the thermal spray community. Here the goal is to maintain the amorphous nature of the metal-metalloid system by using high quench rates of thermal spray and suppressing crystallization. Parker et al. deposited ferromagnetic amorphous FeSi powder via HVOF spraying (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>). The coating properties were similar to those of powders that were predominantly amorphous produced via spark erosion. They conducted Mössbauer analysis of both samples and also magnetic properties and concluded that differences in magnetic properties of the coatings were the result of precipitation of a-Fe and some oxidation of the coating.</p><p>In a series of recent papers from the LERMPS group in France, Cherigui et al. critically examined the microstructure and magnetic properties of thermal sprayed FeSi and FeNb alloys. Some salient results and conclusions from their work are highlighted here (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>):<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The coatings were nanostructured but crystalline despite significant metalloid content.

The results indicated that for FeNb spray distance was the dominant factor affecting both coercivity and saturation magnetization, while the results for FeSi were somewhat more nonlinear. This was correlated with coating porosity and phase content.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Superconducting Materials</title><p>The advent of high Tc superconductivity based on multicomponent oxide materials in the late 1980s created numerous opportunities for the thermal spray technology. The advantages of high spray rate, in situ consolidation, and the ability to deposit on moderately complex shapes attracted this research interest. Research work was conducted at Stony Brook University (in partnership with Naval Research Laboratory) examining processing-microstructure-property relationships in these spray deposited superconducting materials (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>). In the case of the YBaCuO compound, the as-sprayed material resulted in process-induced compositional deviations (loss of CuO) from the starting material, resulting in the lack of a superconducting transition. Appropriate modifications to the starting powder (enriching with CuO) were required to achieve suitable phase state in the deposited sample. The heat treated material in the temperature range of 850-1000 °C for relatively short exposures (minutes) allowed crystallization of the proper orthorhombic structure with associated superconducting transition at 86 K. In a subsequent investigation, Wang et al. further explored annealing approaches with magnetic susceptibility measurements on plasma sprayed materials and showed that two stages of annealing were required to reorganize the structure and chemistry to yield appropriate superconducting results (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>). Despite achieving the excellent superconducting properties of the material, the electrical transport properties were severely affected by interfaces and porosity in the system. To overcome this texture growth, processing of plasma sprayed YBaCuO was pursued in a collaborative project between Stony Brook and Brookhaven National Laboratory. Here the goal was to melt texture the spray deposited material using a zone heating apparatus (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>). The melt-textured material showed significant improvement in current density compared to the as-sprayed materials and introduced a promising new route for superconducting wire fabrication.</p><p>Although the approach was ultimately not successful in producing a superconducting device, the research paved the way for stimulating research efforts in applying thermal spray for depositing functional layers based on complex multicomponent oxides.</p><p>Although not directly an application of thermal spray coatings in superconducting systems, thermal plasmas in recent years have been an important source for synthesis of nanopowders. In a recent study, Marzik et al. examined the superconducting properties of MgB<sub>2</sub> materials produced with plasma-synthesized B and carbon-doped B nanopowders. They found that the plasma-synthesized materials showed superior superconducting properties within the MgB<sub>2</sub> system compared with those produced from traditional ceramic processing techniques. Alternative alloying concepts are now under consideration through plasma synthesis of strongly covalent compounds in the form of nanopowders.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Semiconducting Materials</title><p>Although Janowiecki et al. had obtained a U.S. patent in the 1970s describing a method for producing plasma sprayed solar cells by combining the deposition technology with appropriate doping schemes to produce the p-n junctions (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>), it was the group at the Laboratoire de Physique des Solides in France, that performed detailed examination of the microstructure-properties of plasma sprayed silicon. In a series of publications in the 1980s, they outlined the growth and electrical properties of plasma sprayed silicon deposits (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>). Driven by the requirement to reduce cost of polycrystalline solar cell Si, they proposed a scheme to produce p-type poly Si substrates via plasma spray followed by a CVD process that was used to grow the functional film. They concluded that although the electron diffusion length of the plasma sprayed material was relatively low because of the presence of oxide impurities and other defects; however, it was still a reasonable base material to use to build a solar cell. Kayali et al. extended this work to apply plasma spraying of Si onto a substrate and producing free-standing ribbons (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>). Here B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> powder was added to the starting powder to eventually result in a p-type dopant. Detailed assessment of the process was conducted in collaboration with University of Limoges, France, and the chemical analysis and property assessment of the ribbons were made. They found that the as-sprayed ribbons were deficient, comprising pores, microcracks, and inhomogeneous distribution of the dopant. Zone remelting of the ribbons improved the properties significantly.</p><p>At the Center for Thermal Spray Research at Stony Brook, at least two Ph.D. theses along with two postdoctoral researchers conducted extensive studies on electrical properties of thermal sprayed silicon. Both vacuum plasma spray and atmospheric thermal spray process (APS and HVOF) were examined. Some key findings are described here.</p><p>A peculiar phenomenon was reported by Goswami et al. in the form of pressure-quenched phases in high-velocity deposited silicon layers (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>). It was concluded that during high-velocity impact of silicon thermal spray particles onto single-crystal silicon wafers, pressure-induced transformations can result where the Si(I) transforms to Si(II) during pressurization and upon decompression can result in BC-8, Si(IX), and even hexagonal silicon. Tan et al. analyzed the electrical properties of these quenched-phase silicon materials and noted that these pressure-quenched materials displayed high electrical conductivity and higher carrier concentration (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>). Tan showed that high conductivity was directly related to the extent of metastable high pressure Si polymorphs. What was notable was that coatings impacted on Si (100) wafers showed this effect, while those on Si (111) did not show this effect, suggesting that the pressure effects are orientation dependent. The exact mechanism of these transformations and associated electrical characteristics remains elusive, but points to novel opportunities for thermal spray based synthesis of metastable polymorphs with unique electrical properties.</p><p>Kharas et al. conducted detailed investigations of air plasma sprayed silicon deposits and related it to the processing conditions and the deposit formation dynamics (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>). They showed that sprayed silicon comprises two microstructural features within each splat. An ultrafine-grained region is observed at the splat boundary associated with the chill zone while columnar grains are formed through the splat thickness. Kharas et al. further conducted electrical anisotropy studies through impedance spectroscopy and showed that a 10:1 anisotropy in conductivity exists between the in-plane and through-thickness regions (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>). The splat interfaces and the nanocrystalline grains at these interfaces are significant barriers to electrical transport, and this must be considered in any device application consideration. These results are depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">17</xref>.<fig id="Fig17"><label>Fig. 17</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Impedance spectroscopy of the plasma sprayed silicon measured in two orientations (in plane and through thickness).

Other studies included characterization of the sprayed Si junction with Si wafers and fabrication of ohmic contacts onto Si through thermal spray deposition of Ni, diode, and FET structures based on thermal sprayed layers. These preliminary studies pointed to interesting opportunities for thermal spraying in the semiconductor field but one that would require substantial fundamental and applied research investigations including process optimization, interface microscopy, transport measurements, and modeling.<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Transport properties of VPS Si and Ge</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Sample</p></th><th align="left"><p>ρ, ohm cm</p></th><th align="left"><p><italic>R</italic><sub>h</sub>, cm<sup>3</sup>/C</p></th><th align="left"><p>μ, cm<sup>2</sup>/V s</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>VPS Si</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>23.3</p></td><td align="left"><p>332</p></td><td align="left"><p>12.3</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>VPS Ge</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>0.86</p></td><td align="left"><p>5.6</p></td><td align="left"><p>6.5</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Single-crystal Si</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>~1.5</p></td><td align="left"><p>1020</p></td><td align="left"><p>~680</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Comparative data for single-crystal Si is included (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>)</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>Recently, Niu et al. examined the phase composition and microstructure of silicon coatings deposited by air plasma spraying (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>). A noteworthy aspect of their contribution was the x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization of the silicon coating both on the as-sprayed surface and interior of the coating. The results suggested that the interior of the coatings was substantially void of oxidation, while considerable oxide concentration was observed on the surface. The microstructure further comprised grains in the 20-50 nm range.</p><p>Another semiconductor material of interest is TiO<sub>2</sub>, particularly from photocatalytic applications viewpoint. Although significant work exists on anatase phase stabilization on plasma sprayed TiO<sub>2</sub> and its impact on photocatalytic properties, only a few studies have examined the electrical properties of these materials. Ohmori et al. examined electrical conductivity of plasma sprayed n-type polycrystalline rutile coatings (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>). They showed that the electrical conductivity of the coatings increased with oxygen deficiency in the coating created by the reducing atmosphere plasma environment. They correlated the oxygen loss to the amount of H<sub>2</sub> in the plasma plume and the conductivity to the extent of oxygen loss. In another novel study Ye et al. examined the formation of p-n junction to enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO<sub>2</sub> (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>). To accomplish this, they used two types of powders TiO<sub>2</sub> (n-type) and TiO<sub>2</sub>-Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (p-type) to form a junction between the two types of splats. They observed the microcells that were formed enhanced the efficiency by a factor of 2.</p><p>Berger conducted a detailed review of processing-phase and property relationships of wide-ranging thermal sprayed TiO<sub>2</sub> coatings (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>). Of particular concern was the ease of oxygen loss leading to substoichiometric oxides of titanium with concomitant implications on phase evolution in the system. Although the principal focus of the paper was the process-property relationships including wear, and photocatalysis, the study established a comparison of electrical resistivities of coatings produced through wide-ranging thermal spray processes.</p><p>Sharma et al. examined anisotropic conductance in the plasma sprayed TiO<sub>2</sub> system (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>). The as-sprayed material with its significant oxygen loss essentially rendered an isotropic conductance behavior between the in-plane and through-thickness directions. However, upon low-temperature annealing they observed that initially the anisotropy increased many fold between the in-plane and through-thickness directions before falling off. This behavior was attributed to heterogeneous oxidation states of the TiO<sub>2</sub> deposits. The interfaces among the splats are where the first re-oxidation occurred during low-temperature annealing resulting in large anisotropy in conductance. This peculiar behavior may be useful in mesoscale functional applications.</p><p>Colmenares-Angulo et al. followed up on this report to examine the effect of particle state and types of thermal spray processes (APS with two different nozzles and HVOF) on electrical resistivity of thermal sprayed TiO<sub>2</sub> (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>). They found that the deoxidation was dependent not only on H<sub>2</sub> content but also on particle temperature and dwell time. The electrical resistivity correlated with these particle parameters is: the greater the deoxidation, the more conductive the TiO<sub>2</sub> films were. There is potential to harness these tailorable resistance characteristics for electrical applications in the future, but will require enhanced fundamental understanding and process control.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Luminescent Materials</title><p>The ability to deposit and consolidate ceramic oxides over large areas via plasma spray has allowed consideration of thermal spraying luminescent materials. Researchers at IBM TJ Watson research center examined the application of plasma spray for the deposition of zinc silicate phosphor materials (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>). Their stated goal was to access metastable phases in the system and examine their luminescent properties. APS deposits were found to be predominantly amorphous. Upon heat treatment of the phosphor at ~800 °C in forming gas, they accessed the metastable β as the majority phase resulting in bright yellow fluorescence under UV excitation. Upon heat treatment further to 1000 °C, the metastable phase transformed into the stable α phase, which developed a green fluorescence.</p><p>Herman et al. for a number of years have been preparing thermal sprayed phosphor flags for beamline visualization at the National Synchrotron Light Source (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>). The phosphor flags were made with P31 phosphor (ZnS:Cu) onto stainless substrate and were used for beam line alignment.</p><p>A key requirement for doped-oxide luminescent materials is the compositional homogeneity, phase stabilization, and appropriate dopant concentration. All of these are difficult to achieve in traditional powder-based plasma spray routes. An alternative approach is to use molecularly mixed precursors that will alleviate a number of the homogeneity challenges. Devi et al. used this approach of using precursors in combination with axial injection RF plasma spray torches toward a single-step approach for synthesis and deposition of Eu-doped yttria and yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) coatings (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>). This investigation was quite successful in achieving requisite luminescence. Ravi et al. in a follow-up study explored the use of precursor derived powder of chromium-doped YAG combined with a traditional powder-based plasma spray approach to successfully deposit phosphor coatings (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>). Another application of flame and plasma spray is synthesis of phosphor particles via flame pyrolysis (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>). These studies point to thermal spray as an enabling technology for large-area phosphor coatings.</p><p>Section <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">2</xref> provides a detailed assessment of past reports on the properties of various thermal sprayed functional material systems. Although much progress has been achieved in each of these systems, numerous challenges remain to be addressed before thermal spray processes can meet the stringent criteria for functional applications. As advances in thermal spray processes and feedstock materials emerge, opportunities exist to enhance the functionality of some but not all of the described electronic components. Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref> provides a snapshot summary of the materials challenges and requisite critical attributes of the various functional materials. Preliminary considerations on scientific mitigation strategies are suggested through interpretation of past activities. Achieving high-quality material properties in as-deposited materials without the need for extended high-temperature annealing is critical for widespread applicability of thermal spray in electronics and sensors. It is clear that a focused and integrated process development and optimization effort will be required.<table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Summary table of processing challenges and mitigation strategies for various thermal sprayed functional electronic layers</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Functional layer</p></th><th align="left"><p>Processing challenges</p></th><th align="left"><p>Property impact</p></th><th align="left"><p>Mitigation strategies</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Dielectrics</p></td><td align="left"><p>Porosity, interfaces, structural disorder, metastable phases, coating roughness</p></td><td align="left"><p>Reduced dielectric constant, increased loss tangent, poor high frequency performance</p></td><td align="left"><p>Dense layers via high kinetic energy processes, optimal material selection, small particle size for reduce roughness</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Capacitors</p></td><td align="left"><p>Structural disorder, amorphous phases, metastability</p></td><td align="left"><p>Substantially reduced properties.

Doug Harris of APS Materials championed the development of plasma spray for electronics applications (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>). Initially, Harris and others working at Monsanto Research Corporation focused on developing dielectrics, resistive films, and magnetic devices as well as thick-film hybrid circuits. They also explored plasma spray as a method to fabricate rudimentary solar cells. Many of their initial studies have been cited in the form of U.S. Department of Defense project reports and referenced in the review paper by Harris. Several specific areas of applications have been considered as is discussed here.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Thick Film and Multilayer Hybrid Circuits</title><p>The primary motivation for considering thermal spray for thick-film multilayers is the ability to consolidate dissimilar materials (metals and ceramics) without resorting to extended high-temperature exposure during processing, such as those required in the LTCC and HTCC methods. The idea is that deposits of near-theoretical density can be formed using all solid materials without requiring binders and sintering aids (e.g., glasses). Numerous examples of concepts and devices have been considered and are primarily reported in the patent literature. Thomas Fairbairn in the late 1960s proposed the idea of plasma spraying intricate conductor traces through a prefabricated template (or mask) on top of plasma sprayed ceramic insulators (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>). The ceramic insulators, generally plasma sprayed alumina, were sealed to prevent moisture infiltration into the porous structure. The desired application was high current carrying conductors in power electronics.</p><p>In a conference on hybrid microelectronics held at the University of Kent in 1973, Braguier et al. from the French Telecommunications company reported on extensive research on developing flame and plasma spray processes for applying thick-film inorganic layers for hybrid microelectronics (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>). Wide-ranging oxides and metallic layers were conceived, and parameter optimization was examined.</p><p>In the late 1970s, Smyth et al. of Metco contemplated thermal spraying as a new method or manufacturing thick-film circuits (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>). The driving force behind this work was to reduce the cost of the alumina substrate by replacing sintered alumina with plasma sprayed alumina coating onto metal backing plates. These insulated metal substrates can serve as the substrate for subsequent screen printing, or alternatively thermal spraying can be considered as a means to manufacture the conductors as well (Cu and Al).</p><p>Gorecka-Drzazga et al. examined fundamental attributes such as phases and thermal properties of plasma sprayed layers in hybrid microelectronics (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>). Of particular concern was the presence of the metastable gamma phase in sprayed alumina and porosity in the insulators. To overcome this, laser surface annealing was conducted with mixed outcome. Although there was deposit densification, thermal shrinkage cracks were present in the treated coatings. They further optimized the process to deposit composite resistors of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/NiO earlier considered by Smyth et al. Although no device studies were reported in this work, detailed characterization of the individual layers was significant.</p><p>The 1990s saw a renewed interest in advanced applications of plasma sprayed materials, perhaps related to developments in high-power electronics. Bosna and Riccio proposed in a U.S. patent an additive subtractive technique for manufacturing printed circuit boards involving thermal spray based copper metallization (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>). The surface of the substrates were engraved in such a manner so as to prevent the sprayed copper from adhering onto select areas. Although the authors described this as a 3D printed circuit manufacturing technique, it was a largely a planar thick film device (can best be referred to as 2½D circuit).</p><p>Quick described a method for laser melt reflow of plasma sprayed alumina and bilayers as a means to enhance the dielectric and thermal properties for heat sink applications (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>). He further considered a multilayer heater device by depositing a high resistance layer onto the reflowed oxide insulator.</p><p>Klassen et al. suggested an ambitious approach of many layers one on top of another by thermal spraying through masks to produce a multilayer interconnection device (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>). The application of interest was automotive electrical distribution system with cost being the driving factor. However, no demonstrated material or performance characteristics were described. Turek et al. described a classic photomask and etching technique as a way to prepare patterned structures of plasma sprayed conductor materials apparently for microwave applications (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>). Again, no description of materials or device performance is reported in the patent literature, and as such it is difficult to assess their performance attributes.</p><p>It is unclear whether any of these approaches have resulted in commercial applications of functioning devices. As material properties improve, opportunities will arise that will take advantage of thermal spray’s unique features for the fabrication of thick-film circuits.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Antennas and Electromagnetic Surfaces</title><p>The ability to deposit broad area metallic conductors conformally onto dielectric surfaces enables consideration of thermal spray processes for fabrication of antennas and electromagnetic surfaces. There is anecdotal evidence of such activities within industry, but not very many have been reported in the scientific publications. Stern and Babbit, working for U.S. Army research, developed a slotted microstrip antenna with a plasma sprayed ferrite coating as the ground plane (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>). Izawa et al. used thermal sprayed metals as part of an assembly of polymeric layers for building a vehicular exterior trim accessory having a built-in antenna (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>). Golovato et al. indicated that B<sub>4</sub>C material was plasma sprayed for high-power antennas used in Tokomak reactors (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>).

The key issue here is atomic-level interactions at the interface between the semiconductor and the conductor in order to reduce barriers for electric current flow. Janowiecki et al. first suggested a scheme for fabrication entire p-n junction based solar cell in the 1970s. Narasimhan et al. in 1982 through a U.S. patent were the first to report an approach to manufacturing ohmic contacts on silicon and other materials by arc plasma spraying conductor metals through a mask onto the semiconductor (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>). The powders used included aluminum, molybdenum, nickel, and alloys such as Ni-Al, NiP, and even Ni-B-Si. Although no results were reported on the <italic>I</italic>-<italic>V</italic> characteristics of the junction, the patent claimed that wide-ranging contact materials were fabricated.</p><p>More recently, extensive characterization of Schottky diode and even transistor response of thermal sprayed metal semiconductor junctions were pursued at Stony Brook University (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>). These early trials pointed to intriguing possibilities for fabrication of semiconductor devices, but also indicated that there are considerable challenges particularly with respect to chemical homogeneity and interface management.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Active Semiconductor Devices</title><p>The original work by Janowiecki et al. on the fabrication of p-n junction solar cells in the 1970s was clearly pioneering for that time (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>). Although their proposed approach was ultimately not successful, it paved the way for advanced consideration of thermal spray in semiconductor devices.</p><p>Dickey and Meek examined atmospheric plasma spray as a means to produce n-p devices by spraying two layers of silicon onto sand-blasted molybdenum substrates (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>). The bottom layer was p-type deposited up to a thickness of 250 μm, while the top layer was of n-type characteristic. In both cases, relatively impure silicon powder (98% grade) was applied. Appropriate thin-film contacts were evaporated onto the deposited materials, and photo response was tested using a HeNe laser. Their preliminary work demonstrated that these multilayers contained the requisite structure and electronic properties to function as a device and demonstrated fabrication of rectifying barriers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Sensors and Sensing Devices</title><p>A well-known application of thermal spray in sensors is the lambda sensor for exhaust gas oxygen measurement for engine fuel control. The lambda sensor uses a porous plasma sprayed zirconia membrane coating between electrodes. When subjected to a differential partial pressure of oxygen, a rapid variation in electric resistance related to the oxygen partial pressure can be monitored through an electrical circuit (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>).</p><p>The lambda sensor was a natural extension of traditional thermal spray strategies. The yttria-stabilized zirconia coating used as the sensor was in many ways similar to the thermal barrier coating application in terms of coating characteristics and enabled transitioning into the functional application.</p><p>Fasching et al. in the mid-1990s proposed pioneering ideas for layered manufacturing of advanced sensors using combination and thermal spray and masking techniques (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>). In their landmark paper “Smart Coatings,” they demonstrated the feasibility of layer-by-layer fabrication of embedded thermocouples and strain sensors through sequential use of deposition and masking. They further elaborated applications of the said approach to fabricate multilayered humidity sensors and strain gages (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>). Although the devices did not perform at the level required for applications because of complexities in obtaining functional performance of the deposited material, their work paved the way for future concepts in thermal sprayed sensors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Power Modules</title><p>Varshney et al. explored the plasma spray approach as a means to produce monolithic magnetic modules for aerospace power electronics applications (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>). Their rationale was based on the ability to apply plasma spray for near-net-shape fabrication of magnetic oxides and thus reducing postconsolidation machining operations. Ferrites of toroidal geometry were deposited using traditional air plasma spray technology. Their results indicated that functional magnetic properties were obtainable in the as-deposited state, although annealing enhanced functionality. Varshney et al. concluded that APS technology was scalable to produce multikilowatt power converters.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Thermoelectric Generators</title><p>There have been several past attempts at exploring thermal spray for the fabrication of thermoelectric devices, notably based on FeSi<sub>2</sub> (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>). The enabling attribute here was thermal spray’s ability to produce thick layers of the silicide materials as well as to retain large amounts of the necessary dopant elements. However, the power factors of the as-sprayed materials were generally inferior to traditional powder metallurgy routes, but could be improved through appropriate heat treatments. It is unclear if any of these sprayed materials were incorporated into functioning devices.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Mesoscale and Microscale Heaters</title><p>The unique ability to deposit both insulator and metallic resistors at high rates has allowed consideration of thermal spray for the fabrication of mesoscale heating elements for a number of decades. In the early 1980s, MacCrone and Herman conducted extensive investigations to fabricate heating elements for cookware applications (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>). These early studies were aimed at replacing the tubular heaters prevalent in cooking ranges with aesthetically pleasing planar devices. Detailed examination of both the insulator (alumina) and the resistive heater (80:20 NiCr) were considered through flame or plasma spraying technique. The heating element was deposited in the requisite pattern using masks, followed by spray on of either an insulator or heat diffuser layer. They contemplated a heat diffuser that was made of TiO<sub>2</sub> rather than alumina as a conductive ceramic. The entire assembly was fabricated on carbon steel substrates. A NiCrAlY bond coat was applied between the insulator and the substrates.</p><p>A number of detailed system and material level studies were conducted and rationalized through fundamental thermodynamic analysis. Essentially their conclusions were:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The heaters would reach 600 °C in less than 1 min.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The resistivity of the NiCr heater was generally stable unless the temperatures exceeded 900 °C.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The insulator material alumina was found to perform adequately as a dielectric material.

To mitigate this they contemplated “segmented cracks” in the ceramics as a means to introduce compliance in the coatings (akin to dense vertically cracked TBCs in application today).</p></list-item></list></p><p>Although the outcome of this 1980s industry-university cooperative project in terms of application transition is unknown, it clearly indicated that thermal spray has an important role to play in manufacturing of novel heating elements.</p><p>In the early 1990s, patent literature pointed to thermal spray based strategies for fabrication of tubular heater for applications as an electrical smoking article (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>). Novel designs of these micro/mesoscale elements conformally formed onto a cylinder were conceived and fabricated by successive deposition of insulators and heating elements.</p><p>Michels et al. examined the performance of high heat flux Ni20Cr resistance heaters prepared by APS, VPS, and HVOF spray deposition testing the heaters up to heat fluxes of 17 MW/m<sup>2</sup> (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>). They continuously applied current until the heaters failed through large-scale cracking. In general, it was observed that VPS and HVOF sprayed heaters performed much better than APS heaters, associated with thickness uniformity and cleaner and denser microstructure.</p><p>Prudenziati et al. reported the design and fabrication of heaters via air plasma spraying of Ni20Cr material and demonstrated operation between 20 and 600 °C (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>). However, the issue of heater failures during sustained high-temperature thermal explosion was still prevalent in these APS materials and requires novel design considerations for large-scale applicability at high temperatures.</p><p>Gadow et al. in a U.S. patent describe the fabrication of a ceramic cooktop via thermal spray technology. The key innovations offered were tailoring porosity of the dielectric layers applied to glass ceramic substrates. Another embodiment of the invention was the use of electrically conductive thermal sprayed ceramic in the form of TiO<sub>2</sub> as the sandwich layer within the ceramic insulator wherein conductivity was obtained through preferential oxygen loss during thermal spraying. The idea of employing an electrically conductive ceramic layer was to reduce the breakdown resistance of the ceramic insulator layer.</p><p>Killinger and Gadow further examined the applicability of thermal sprayed film heating devices on glass-ceramic substrates (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>). Rigorous optimization and characterization of the oxide insulator was conducted to ensure requisite breakdown voltage and leakage current. Humidity played a role in leakage current. NiCr, Fe13Cr, and FeCrAl heating elements were applied using APS, HVOF, and arc spray techniques. As expected, the specific resistances were strongly dependent on the deposition process. Infrared (IR) imaging was used to characterize the heaters and assess performance and homogeneity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Sputtering Targets</title><p>Polyakova et al. used plasma spray to prepare sputtering target materials based on cobalt ferrite films following which DC sputtering was used to deposit cobalt ferrite thin films for magneto-optic memory applications (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>). They found the chemical composition of the sputtered films coincided with that of the targets. They were both reported to be Co<sub>0.7</sub>Fe<sub>2.3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. It was unclear as to the composition of the plasma spray powder source. Invariably, the plasma spray process would induce stoichiometric changes to the material during deposition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Electrical Contact Materials</title><p>The ability to deposit conductive layers by thermal spray will enable the application of electrical contact materials. There is anecdotal evidence of such applications in the industrial literature; however, there is limited scientific information on the microstructure performance linkages. A noteworthy consideration is the role of contact erosion related to the layered microstructures and generally weak interfaces present in the thermal sprayed layers. The adhesion and cohesion of the plasma sprayed layers along with its ability to dissipate thermal loads is significant. Schellekens et al. conducted a detailed study of the performance of plasma sprayed Cu-25%Cr and Cu-15%V alloys as potential contact materials in commercial vacuum interrupters (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">129</xref>). A number of key electrical issues including dielectric properties, chopping current, and high current interruption were examined for the sprayed materials and compared to their sintered counterparts. They observed that although adequate response of the plasma sprayed materials was noted from an application viewpoint, optimization was required. A number of parameters were optimized, the most notable being substrate temperature.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Electrodes and Current Collectors for Electrochemical Devices</title><p>The ability to deposit layered materials over large areas in ambient conditions has always been an important attribute of thermal spray technology. As such, there have been a number of attempts over the last few decades to implement thermal spray technology for depositing anodes/cathodes and current collectors in electrochemical systems (fuel cells, batteries, sensors, gas separation and metal refining membranes).</p><p>In an early paper, Ikeda et al. demonstrated applications of plasma sprayed coatings as current collectors in electric home appliances (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">130</xref>). They demonstrated that plasma sprayed Al was an effective solution to deposit electrodes on double-layer capacitors as well as on film capacitors. Although limited fundamental information was available, the paper suggests that the deposits performed the requisite task.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Coating of Integrated Circuits with Flame Spray</title><p>Although not a functional application, thermal spray has been considered as a technique to protect surface of semiconductor packages against tampering or examination. Heffner and Anderson describe a methodology to achieve this by rod or powder flame spraying of inorganic insulative ceramics (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">131</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Patterned Devices, 2½D Structures, Sensors, Electronics</title><p>The applications described previously involve devices that were created through traditional large-area thermal spray deposition of functional materials. However, in many devices, patterned structures particularly of metal interconnects and resistors are requisite for device-level performance. Patterned structures can be synthesized either via masking (additive-subtractive method) or via maskless (all additive fabrication). The former is a well-established methodology in the electronic industry while the latter, also referred to as “Direct Writing,” has become an enabling technology in recent years. Interest in rapid prototyping as well as the desire to reduce product development lifetimes has enabled computer-aided direct writing material patterns. Wide-ranging direct writing tools are now available for both mesoscale and nanoscale patterning of devices. Direct write methods enable several novel electronics and sensor applications notably for integration of these functional elements in 3D components (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">132</xref>).</p><p>An innovative Direct Writing technology based on thermal spraying has recently come of age. Direct Write Thermal Spray (DWTS) is a new and exciting manufacturing technology capable of depositing a large number of electronic materials on a wide range of substrates, enabling direct write fabrication of multilayer thick-film electronic devices (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">133</xref>). DWTS was conceived and developed under Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)’s Mesoscale Integrated Conformal Electronics (MICE) program by Stony Brook University and program partners. DWTS has the ability to deposit a number of high-quality electronic and sensor materials onto a variety of substrates and conformal geometries. Because the temperature of the substrate is kept low (&lt;200 °C) and no post treatment for certain components (such as annealing or firing at high temperature) is required, the DWTS process naturally lends itself to fabrication of multilayer devices using disparate materials, which is particularly useful for sensor and electronics applications. This is a <italic>unique differentiating</italic> attribute of DWTS even when compared with other direct writing technologies such as ink-jet printing, aerosol-guided deposition, laser forward transfer, and so forth. The ability to directly integrate functional electronics and sensors onto components and structures allows whole new concepts for sensor and electronics integration into engineering systems. Research to date has demonstrated considerable capability of these concepts, leading to a potential “disruptive” transformation to both design and additive integration of novel sensor concepts and technologies. Examples include sensors, passive electronic components (capacitors and inductors), connectors, antennas, and so forth. Of particular importance is the ability to directly fabricate sensors and electronics on truly three-dimensional objects, which would enable a radical new capability for integrating sensors and electronics on engineering systems and components hitherto not envisioned.</p><p>The basis of the DWTS capability lies in the ability to control the footprint of the spray stream along with ability to achieve requisite material characteristics. The core technology uses miniaturized plasma torches as well as alternative solid-state deposition processes along with appropriate collimation schemes to achieve a fine footprint or high-definition spray stream. Given the materials and applications focus of this review, as well as certain proprietary attributes of the processing technologies, details of the process are not included here, but the reader is referred to patent literature (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">134</xref>). It has been shown that a feature size of 300 μm is routinely possible, and demonstrations have been performed to dimensions smaller that that. DWTS can produce blanket deposits of films and coatings as well as patches, lines, and vias. Multilayers can be produced on plastic, metal, and ceramic substrates, both planar and conformal. Embedded functional electronics or sensors can be overcoated with a protective coating, allowing for applications in harsh environments. Such embedded harsh environment sensors are useful for condition-based maintenance of engineering systems and have demonstrated high performance and durability at temperatures up to 1100 °C.</p><p>The first-generation integrated fabrication tool based on a high-precision robot for conformal sensors and electronics fabrication has been set up at Stony Brook University. This tool provides the ability to direct write highly conformal surfaces. An important attribute of this technology is <italic>portability</italic>. A portable mobile direct write tool will allow translation of the laboratory technology into large area conformal applications. An alpha version of the tool was developed and demonstrated as part of a student senior design exercise at Stony Brook University.</p><p>In this section, examples of DWTS-enabled functional devices along with some performance attributes is provided.

As a demonstration of this, a multilayer inductor was produced using thermal spray of all of the inductor components: dielectric, ferrite core, and patterned metal conductors. A Mn-Zn ferrite-based inductor with the 20-turn coil was fabricated using plasma spray to form the insulator (spinel) and ferrite (Fig. <xref rid="Fig20" ref-type="fig">20</xref>).

Complete connectivity in the conductor was achieved. This enabled preliminary evaluation of the inductor. The high-frequency performance of the inductor was evaluated from 40 Hz to 110 MHz. Using a series equivalent circuit model, a plot of the series inductance Ls and series resistance Rs shows a well-defined resonance at 35.2 MHz.

Although it may be feasible to further reduce line width, achieving this would be a herculean task with limited dividends. Very short-pulse or ultrafast laser processing can be used as an auxiliary method to further refine thermal sprayed electronic elements and structures through judicious laser micromachining to produce patterned structures. It has several advantages of being noncontact, maskless patterning approach that can directly avail of computer-aided manufacturing capabilities for both rapid prototyping and manufacturing applications. By using very short pulses (in the pico to femto second time scales), nonthermal ablative means of material removal can be achieved. This is particularly important as thermal sprayed electronic elements can be rather thick for micromachining processes and can comprise a number of inhomogeneities in sprayed layers. Short-pulse laser patterning can be conducted on conformal substrates, they can be delivered either via a fiber or galvanometric mirrors for very high cycle machining. The line width can be as low as 20 μm and can be directly applied on the component in 3D.

Many of the past attempts in harnessing these advantages into products have largely been unsuccessful. This is perhaps attributable not only to a lack of precision in the past technology, but more notably to the difficulty in understanding and control of material properties. In recent years, progress has been achieved on both fronts through science-derived enhancement of process and materials technology and an appreciation of the complexity in materials science of these quenched, layered deposits. The advent of new diagnostic tools and characterization approaches will pave the way for future expansion of thermal spray into the realm of functional electronics, sensors, patterned devices and broadly in the arena of multifunctional systems. Furthermore, it is likely that thermal spray be considered within the framework of a hybrid assembly of deposition tools enabling devices and manufacturing concepts that have hitherto not been conceived.</p><p>It is thus envisioned that in the future, thermal spray techniques may offer new opportunities for hybrid thick-film electronics, thick-film sensors, insulated metal substrates, smart coatings with embedded devices, and other applications, including:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Embedded sensors in coatings and structural parts for condition-based maintenance engineering, processing, and system monitoring (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Various thick-film materials and sensors, including antennas, magnetoresistive sensors, thermistors, thermocouples, gas sensors, etc.</p></list-item><list-item><p>High-frequency inductive components—Inductors, transformers, and antennas, using low-loss ferrites and sprayed windings, interconnects, and dielectrics</p></list-item></list></p><p>The implications of developing, enhancing, and using this technology in electronics can be far reaching and can impact hybrid electronics, large ceramic substrates and conformal devices, and sensor systems.
