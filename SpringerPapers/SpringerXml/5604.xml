The meta-analysis was also extended to methane from renewable electricity (e-CH<sub>4</sub>) since the BP stock may play a role in the provision of CO<sub>2</sub>.

This is well within the range of the top-down analysis of 11–54 TWh (average: 32.5 TWh) for that year. In some scenarios values for e-CH<sub>4</sub> where considerably higher, especially with respect to 2050, but in these studies the sources—including the CO<sub>2</sub> sources—are either not explained at all or they are due to imports of e-CH<sub>4</sub> in combination with direct air capture (DAC) rather than biogenic sources. Concerning the regional dispersion, the bottom-up analysis shows that the largest potentials (53% or 905 of the biogas plants) are located in the northern part of Germany, more particular in Lower-Saxony, Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. These represent 54% or 602 MW of the installed capacity of the clusters.</p></sec><sec id="ASec4"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">The consistency of the outcomes of the two methodologically very different approaches may be called the main result of this research.

With rising shares of renewable electricity supply the focus has gone beyond decarbonizing the electricity sector and has shifted towards the integration of renewable energy sources (RES) within the larger energy system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, p. 795]. That is, issues like sector coupling and defossilizing gas supply have gained attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The latter stems from the insight that (renewable) electricity needs to be complemented by other climate-neutral or defossilized energy carriers for certain applications and uses. These include selected high calorific applications in transport (heavy duty vehicles, sea and air transport) as well as industrial applications such as medium to high temperature processes and basic materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, Trend 8]. Further, a medium is required to store large amounts of energy over longer periods (i.e., seasons). Other storage media, like compressed air storage, flywheel generators or pumped hydro storage are meant to store energy for hours or for some days at maximum. Depending on the technical parameter of the site pumped hydro is able to store energy for some weeks. Only large storage lakes with a natural supply may store energy over seasons. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, pp. 49–51, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, p. 100].</p><p id="Par21">That is, the role of the German natural gas sector within the energy transition has come under discussion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. As of 2018 the German gas storage capacity was 24.3 billion m<sup>3</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] or 242 TWh (own calculation, see “Methods”), being the highest in Europe. In the same year, the German gas grids had a total length of 551 thousand km and were divided into three broad pressure ratings. High pressure grids (125 thousand km, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 1–120 bar) are used for long distance gas transport. Medium pressure distribution grids (249 thousand km, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.1–1 bar) and finally low pressure connection lines (177 thousand km, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.1 bar) are used to transport the gas to the consumers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, p. 350, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, p. 40]. The consumption of natural gas in Germany was 928 TWh in 2018 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, figure 148]. The German natural gas supply comes from very different regions: In 2015, the largest import volumes came from Norway and Russia (32% each) and the Netherlands (27%). 7% was due to domestic exploitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. On the one hand, trying to use the existing natural gas infrastructure as a storage and flexibility option also in a climate-neutral energy system has attracted rising attention. On the other hand, it is not yet decided to what degree the gas sector should (and could) contribute to the energy transition. It raises a number of questions on the optimal future size and kinds of infrastructure, e.g., concerning pressure levels, adaptation needs for certain gases, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Technically natural gas consists of fossil methane, i.e., CH<sub>4</sub>, and one important aspect of defossilization is the degree the gas sector could be supplied with so-called “green” gases, i.e., gases from renewable sources. These gases are hydrogen from RES (e-H<sub>2</sub>) and renewable methane. Since renewable methane, in turn, may be produced in (different) process(es) of methanation from H<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>, the origin of these substances is of importance as well. Under the assumption of using e-H<sub>2</sub>, this paper focuses on the potential of domestic methane from biological origin (bio-CH<sub>4</sub>) until 2030. Due to the technicalities of the production routes, it is necessary to analyze the potential of methane from RES (e-CH<sub>4</sub>) as well. It provides two different methods of analyzing these potentials in order to compare the results and provide consolidated estimates. As Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows, there are two broad categories of methanation, namely biological (left hand side) and catalytic (right hand side). Biological methanation may be divided into a process where CO<sub>2</sub> is extracted from the biogas plant (BG) and together with e-H<sub>2</sub> injected into an external reactor. In the in situ process bio-CH<sub>4</sub> may be obtained from the BP directly where it raises the yield of bio-CH<sub>4</sub> (50–75% of the BP’s biogas consists of CH<sub>4</sub>, see <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">Box</xref> in “Methods”). In catalytic methanantion there are different processes that refer to different types of reactors that are not detailed here. However, in terms of e-CH<sub>4</sub> the availability of CO<sub>2</sub> is a key aspect. By definition above, e-CH<sub>4</sub> is based on e-H<sub>2</sub>. The source of CO<sub>2</sub>, however, may vary as shown on the right-hand side of Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. It could be taken from point sources of industry or power plants via carbon capture (CC) techniques (far right). However, this is still in an early development stage and meant to sequester carbon from fossil fuels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, pp. 67–70]. Secondly, it could be taken from ambient air via direct air capture (DAC). However, estimates about the future commercial availability of DAC technologies cannot yet be made [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, p. 113]. Thirdly, CO<sub>2</sub> may also be provided by BP (25–45% of the biogas consists of CO<sub>2</sub>, see <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">Box</xref> in “Methods”). That is, BP may also play a role in the provision of a climate-neutral CO<sub>2</sub> source for e-CH<sub>4</sub> in catalytic methanation and in estimating its potential in case DAC technologies are not available.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Production routes of bio-CH<sub>4</sub> and e-CH<sub>4</sub></p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13705_2020_276_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par23">In order to find out the adequate role of these technologies from a system perspective it has been searched whether they have been included in greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction scenarios so far. GHG-reduction and energy scenario analysis are commonly applied tools for the long-term development of the energy system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. They have a more strategic approach from the view point of the overall energy system as they try to identify optimal transition paths towards a defossilized energy systems. That is, they try to find optimal combinations of energy inputs, optimal combinations of direct electricity usage vis-à-vis gases usage and the optimal combination of the different gases. In the long-term energy scenarios, renewable gases play an important role [e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. From a systemic point of view, all these options have their merits and pitfalls and they have partly been alluded to above. For instance, e-H<sub>2</sub> beyond a certain concentration requires adaption of the grid (“H<sub>2</sub> readiness”), whereas bio-CH<sub>4</sub> and e-CH<sub>4</sub> do not. However, the latter two require higher RES inputs and they require (carbon neutral) CO<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, they have different applications as, for instance, H<sub>2</sub> may be used in fuel cells and CH<sub>4</sub> may be used in CNG cars, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, p. 150, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Ideally, energy system analysis takes all these aspects into account. Furthermore, energy system analysis may rely on additional options such as energy imports. However, the issue of renewable methane is fairly new and the meta-analysis in this paper may give an overview on the current state-of-the-art with respect to its application in scenario analysis.</p><p id="Par24">Scenario analyses, however, often do not take into account the realities of the German energy transition. With respect to bioenergy, these realities concern the existing German BP capacities and under what circumstances these are able to supply bio-CH<sub>4</sub> to the natural gas grid. That is, in addition to the optimization or greenfield approach of the scenario studies, a complementary brownfield approach needs to estimate the possible bio-CH<sub>4</sub> supply taking the existing BP capacities, adjacent infrastructures and the current regulatory environment into account. Germany has built up a considerable stock of BP within the last 20 years. Almost all of these units have been built and are currently operated under the German Feed-In-Tariff (FIT) scheme. As of 2018 around 10,400 biogas plants with an electrical capacity of 5000 MW where registered under the German FIT scheme. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, Table 1, p. 21]. In sum the German biogas and bio-CH<sub>4</sub> plants (incl. sewage gas and landfill gas) produced 52.8 TWh gaseous fuels in 2018. This corresponds to roughly 6% of the German natural gas consumption or 22% of the German gas storage capacities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, own calculations].</p><p id="Par25">That is, the starting point for the transition is the existing stock of biogas capacities, which is spread all over Germany and the existing gas grid on the one hand and changes in regulation on the other hand. In terms of capacities, only a small share of the capacities are bio-CH<sub>4</sub> plants and most of them are cogeneration plants as laid out above. In terms of regulation, however, the 20-year remuneration period under the FIT will end in the 2020s for almost all of these biogas cogeneration units. These so-called “post-FIT units” are in need of a new business model or will have to go out of business [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Therefore, under the changing condition of he FIT for the biogas plants, new business models for the plants are necessary and bio-CH<sub>4</sub> provision might become one option. That is, the cogeneration plants may be converted into bio-CH<sub>4</sub> plants and connected to the natural gas grid infrastructure if it seems favorable within infrastructural conditions. In parallel, these units may also play a role for e-CH<sub>4</sub> as they may provide a source of CO<sub>2</sub> for e-H<sub>2</sub> as described above (via injection of e-H<sub>2</sub> into the BP, see e.g., the BioCat Project<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par26">Against this background, the question of this paper is, how much bio-CH<sub>4</sub> can be expected for the renewable gas supply in Germany until 2030. To answer this question the paper combines the two methods above and therefore provides a consolidated estimate. The bottom-up method focuses on the technical, infrastructural and regulatory realities of the existing German BP stock. The top-down approach takes into account overall system considerations such as optimality and additional options such as energy imports. Therefore, the meta-analysis is extended to 2050. Furthermore, biogas plants may also provide biogenic CO<sub>2</sub> for e-CH<sub>4</sub> and therefore e-CH<sub>4</sub> is also taken into account in order to derive a better analysis of the potentials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="box"><title>Conversion of energetic values</title><p id="Par27">The different methods apply different units. The scenario studies (top-down) publish the contribution of methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) in TWh and the bottom-up approach uses (norm) m<sup>3</sup> of CH<sub>4</sub>.

The federal states in central Germany (Saarland, Rhineland-Palatinate, North Rhine-Westphalia, Hesse, Thuringia and Saxony) on the other hand show comparably little potential for clustering existing biogas plants with local cogeneration for bio-CH<sub>4</sub> upgrading. Since the radius of the clusters was set to 10 km there are BPs which could theoretically be allocated to more than one feed-in point which causes overlapping of the clusters in certain regions. A final decision which BP should be allocated to which feed-in point cannot be made for each plant individually at the scale of this analysis.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Regional distribution of potential clusters for bio-CH<sub>4</sub> production, classified by the combined installed capacity of biogas plants with a cluster</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13705_2020_276_Fig8_HTML.png" id="MO8"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Top-down analysis: consistency of scenarios</title><p id="Par62">The paper makes different attempts to estimate potentials of renewable methane from top-down as well as from a bottom-up perspective using different methods. For the top-down approach, the meta-analysis of GHG-reduction scenarios has shown that only a few models have taken up the issue of bio-CH<sub>4</sub> and e-CH<sub>4</sub> and that this has only happened quite recently. It may be due to the fact that the more recent studies have integrated the more stringent targets of the Paris agreement and these require green gases for, e.g., defossilizing industry or transport. Furthermore, even in those studies the numbers were not always clearly given and sometimes had to be inferred otherwise. So they were sometimes difficult to retrace.</p><p id="Par63">Generally speaking, the range for e-CH<sub>4</sub> is larger than for bio-CH<sub>4</sub> and going further into the future (i.e., 2050 instead of 2030) the range opens up even more. Furthermore, the numbers for bio-CH<sub>4</sub> sometimes appear to be exogenously set by assumption (without always making this explicit though). This seems to be true for THGND [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] that sets the potential of biogas from waste residues without much further explanation. It also seems to be true for the RESCUE-Study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] by dedicating a certain share of volume of bio-waste and greenery as bio-CH<sub>4</sub>. Similarly, the utilization of e-CH<sub>4</sub> seems to be set exogenously at least in some studies. In the Roadmap-study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] it appears that the assumption of a maximum use of e-CH<sub>4</sub> (and e-H<sub>2</sub>, respectively) lead to a phase out of biogas. The Ways-Study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] does not mention any restriction of bio-CH<sub>4</sub> potential and the range of usage is the broadest in the scenarios. Therefore, in this study bio-CH<sub>4</sub> usage actually appears to be due to model optimization. In most studies analyzed here, however, the number of potential appears to be a bit ad hoc. There is even less information on the usage of (domestic) biogas as a CO<sub>2</sub> source for e-CH<sub>4</sub>. None of the studies explicitly mentions this path. Only the Roadmap-study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] displaying by far the highest amount of e-CH<sub>4</sub> explicitly mentions imports of e-CH<sub>4</sub> and DAC for e-CH<sub>4</sub> rather than using biogenic sources for CO<sub>2</sub>. So taken together, despite a number of methodological disclaimers the amount of bio-CH<sub>4</sub> use appears to stay in a certain range, at least for 2030. The results only start to diverge significantly where the production of methane does not depend on biogenic source any more, in particular with respect to 2050. Here, too, the models appear even more ad hoc. That is, they do not mention the sources at all or they mention imports of e-CH<sub>4</sub> or non-biogenic CO<sub>2</sub> sources (DAC) or both.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Bottom-up: geographic-structural conversion potential</title><p id="Par64">In the bottom-up approach, the starting point of the assessment was rather the existing biogas inventory in Germany. Therefore, a GIS analysis was carried out to estimate the short-term geographic-structural conversion potential of this existing inventory into bio-CH<sub>4</sub> production. Within this, first of all, we ask for economic obstacles that could have an impact on the realization of the core concept of clustering existing BP for retrofitting from cogeneration to bio-CH<sub>4</sub> upgrading. It turns out, that 1681 plants (16%) representing 1.1 GW (22%), respectively, can be retrofitted until 2030. However, a caveat has to be made to the analysis as well: Instead of analyzing the economics of every single cluster, assumptions on the necessary minimum size of the BPs and on costs of retrofit and construction costs of the cluster where made resulting in the minimum size of the cluster in the sense of an economical upper cap. That, in turn, was the basis for the GIS analysis. That is, the analysis is mainly geographical and structural and economic aspects came in only indirectly into the analysis.</p><p id="Par65">Furthermore, another caveat has to be made on a temporal issue: as it was mentioned in the background, this upgrade may provide the necessary business model for the considerable share of “post-FIT”-installations, i.e., those capacities whose FIT-remuneration phases out. However, it has to be kept in mind that in reality the “post-FIT”-phase begins at different points in time for different BP. From an investors point of view it seems to be very ambitious to find the best point in time to build up or extend the central upgrading unit. In a worst case the entire capacity could only be reached after several years. But if the decision is delayed until the last plant of the cluster will drop out of FIT, the plants that reach their remuneration period earlier, would face a temporal gap without a proper business model. As we did not explicitly analyzed the age structure of the clusters, we suggest to look for that issue within subsequent investigations. Furthermore, the e-CH<sub>4</sub> should be analyzed by a bottom-up analysis in a further investigation to underpin these findings. Another issue regarding the "post-FIT"-phase is the question of whether a retrofitting to bio-CH<sub>4</sub> production would be the most profitable choice. Other potential business models, such as heat, could eventually generate comparatively higher revenues and many biogas plants have considerable potential in this segment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In order to identify the plant-specific favorable option the relevant opportunity costs need to be assessed in more detail.</p><p id="Par66">On a spatial scale, we already identified the main issues that would have an impact on hindering optimal grid-layouts for the clusters. Since the real world is much more complex, especially regarding spatial planning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, pp. 32–42], topographic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] or legal issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, pp. 51–52, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], it seems very likely, that we still underestimate the efforts and so the expenses for creating the needed pipe-infrastructure to transport the raw gas to the central upgrading unit. Another technical point, which we did not consider, is the question of how the BP preserve their process heating. In the current setup, plants utilize the raw gas to convert it in a cogeneration heating and power unit (CHPU) and use some of the heat (depending on feedstock and fermenter design 5–50%) for the substrates and fermenters. If all of the raw gas is delivered to the upgrading unit, the question arises, how to maintain the fermenter heating. One but here excluded option would be to use a partial flow of the raw gas to utilize in small CHPU, which is dimensioned to the maximum heat demand of the fermentation process. Another solution could be the use of other renewable heat sources like a biomass boiler or solar thermal energy. One way or another, all of these options will lead to additional costs; either by losing some of the raw gas capacity and additional investments for auxiliary CHPU or for other heat sources.</p><p id="Par67">Last but not least, a number of additional regulations are required to make the conversion of BP capacities as a business model work. These include an economic level playing field, certification on meeting technical requirements of bio-CH<sub>4</sub> as products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Comparing top-down and bottom-up: consolidating results</title><p id="Par68">In order to compare the results of the bottom-up and top-down analysis (for 2030), the result of the former may be converted into TWh: applying the lower heating value of 9.97 kWh/Nm<sup>3</sup> CH<sub>4</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, p. 68] to 2.5 bn Nm<sup>3</sup> bio-CH<sub>4</sub> yields 24.9 TWh.

In a top-down approach a meta-analysis of models with respect to bio-CH<sub>4</sub> and e-CH<sub>4</sub> was performed. From a bottom-up perspective a GIS-based cluster analysis was undertaken to estimate the potential on bio-CH<sub>4</sub> from the existing cogeneration biogas plant (BP) stock. Even with respect to the methodical limitations discussed, the main result may be the consistency of the outcome of the two approaches even though these are methodologically very different. The bottom-up approach yields a potential of 2.5 bn Nm<sup>3</sup> or 24.9 TWh of bio-CH<sub>4</sub> for 2030. That lies well within the range the top-down analysis of 11–54 TWh (average of 32.5 TWh) bio-CH<sub>4</sub> for the same year. These values are also consistent with other values in literature both with “old” values that have been the foundation for model analyses for a long time and with recent bottom-up analysis. The focus of the analysis is on bio-CH<sub>4</sub> from convertible German cogeneration stock until 2030. However, additional questions where how models take into account the need of e-CH<sub>4</sub> for a—possible biogenic—CO<sub>2</sub> source. Furthermore, models aim for 2050 and take into account other options like energy imports, therefore these issues where taken into account as well. It turned out that in some scenarios values for e-CH<sub>4</sub> where considerably higher but in these studies they are either not explained at all or they are due to imports in combination with direct air capture (DAC) rather than biogenic sources of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="Par74">Compared with today’s consumption of natural gas in Germany (2018: 928 TWh) the average amount of bio-CH<sub>4</sub> in 2030 corresponds to 2.7–3.5% of that use. Taken bio-CH<sub>4</sub> and e-CH<sub>4</sub> together it corresponds to 7.2–8.0%. Concerning the regional dispersion, the bottom-up analysis shows that the largest potentials (53% or 905 of the plants) are located in the northern part of Germany, more particular in Lower-Saxony, Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. These represent 54% or 602 MW of the installed capacity of the clusters.</p><p id="Par75">We therefore conclude on the grounds of the improved empirical basis that the technical potential for additional bio-CH<sub>4</sub> from existing BP is significant. Depending on the priorities for the ongoing energy transition existing biogas infrastructure could be used to increase the production of “green” gas, for applications, which are hard to decarbonize, while the use of high calorific fuels is hard to substitute. In particular, bio-methane may be used in applications which should be otherwise powered by synthetic fuels or e-methane. As was shown in the model analysis, these energy carriers often need to be imported as they have the drawback, that they often need disproportionate amounts of renewable electricity, due to efficiency losses, especially if methane is needed instead of hydrogen. So it seems to be worth further investigations, to figure the marginal prize and benefit to mobilize the existing technical potential. We expect, that like for many other bioenergy applications, there is a cost–supply curve, where “low hanging fruits” can be harvested easily and on the long end of that curve some of technical potential is “trapped” by cost driving conditions. Trapping factors would be expected for unfavorably age structures within clusters or multiple infrastructural barriers for the gas grid; both will substantially increase costs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Joint research on this paper has been undertaken by the institutions UFZ, DBFZ, and IZES in the context of the project “Bioenergy—potentials, long-term perspectives and strategies for power generation plants after 2020 (BE20plus)”.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors’ contributions</title><p>BW: review, drafting; DT: review; JP: bottom-up approach (cost estimates, drafting); MD: review, drafting; MS: bottom-up approach (GIS analysis, drafting); PM: overall conceptualization and drafting, top-down approach; YZ: top-down approach.
