Using an in-house designed closed loop, vertical tube photobioreactor, <italic>Scenedesmus acutus</italic> was cultured using flue gas as the CO<sub>2</sub> source. Algae productivity of 39 g/(m<sup>2</sup> day) in June–July was achieved at significant scale (18,000 L), while average daily productivity slightly in excess of 10 g/(m<sup>2</sup> day) was demonstrated in the month of December. A protocol for low-cost algae harvesting and dewatering was developed, and the conversion of algal lipids—extracted from the harvested biomass—to diesel-range hydrocarbons via catalytic deoxygenation was demonstrated. Assuming an amortization period of 10 years, calculations suggest that the current cost of capturing and recycling CO<sub>2</sub> using this approach will fall close to $1,600/ton CO<sub>2</sub>, the main expense corresponding to the capital cost of the photobioreactor system and the associated installation cost. From this it follows that future cost reduction measures should focus on the design of a culturing system which is less expensive to build and install. In even the most optimistic scenario, the cost of algae-based CO<sub>2</sub> capture is unlikely to fall below $225/ton, corresponding to a production cost of ~$400/ton biomass. Hence, the value of the algal biomass produced will be critical in determining the overall economics of CO<sub>2</sub> capture and recycle.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Microalgae</kwd><kwd>Carbon dioxide</kwd><kwd>Flue gas</kwd><kwd>Capture</kwd><kwd>Techno-economic analysis</kwd><kwd>Biofuels</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>13</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2014</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2014</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2014</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/13203_2014_Article_52.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2014</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2014</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Chemistry</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Catalysis</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Industrial Chemistry/Chemical Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Nanochemistry</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy Technology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Nanotechnology and Microengineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Despite concerns surrounding the contribution of fossil fuel combustion to global warming, the need for fossil fuels will remain significant for the foreseeable future. With direct replacement unlikely, strategies to reduce the emitted CO<sub>2</sub> are in high demand. The current array of options encompasses four main areas: (1) modifications to existing power plants to increase the efficiency of combustion, (2) improvements to the efficiency of energy use by consumers, (3) chemical carbon capture with subsequent sequestration, and (4) bio-mitigation with carbon recycling. All of these methods have promise, yet they are beset with significant technical and non-technical challenges. Alterations to the methods of use and production involve issues related to expensive plant modifications or changes to the behavioral patterns of consumers. Despite technological gains for CO<sub>2</sub> capture and sequestration, the costs associated with energy-intensive CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and compression are significant and anticipated to result in a parasitic power plant load on the order of 30–40 %. In addition, the uncertainty surrounding risk and liability issues related to long-term geologic sequestration is potentially strong enough to deter investment and adoption.</p><p>As is frequently stated, microalgae are the fastest growing photosynthetic organisms with growth rates and CO<sub>2</sub> bio-fixation potentials generally in excess of terrestrial plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Depending on growth conditions (light intensity, temperature, and physical nature of the environment), the levels of available CO<sub>2</sub>, and the nutrient needs of the organism, a combination of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids are produced. From these metabolites a range of fuel and chemical feedstocks/resources can be produced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. It is this combination of growth rate and lipid productivity that has led to algae being touted as an ideal source of bio-derived oil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>The use of microalgae-based CO<sub>2</sub> mitigation suffers from two principal disadvantages: (1) in bio-mitigation, CO<sub>2</sub> is captured and subsequently recycled (effectively, the carbon is used twice); in other words, CO<sub>2</sub> is not permanently removed from the carbon cycle; and (2) a range of challenges exist which are primarily related to system complexity and scale-up issues that are driven more by economic constraints than technical issues. However, biological carbon capture and recycling has the potential to generate a revenue stream to offset, at least in part, the overall cost of implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Indeed, the use of algae as a carbon dioxide bio-mitigation strategy and as a potential source of renewable fuels has long been a focus of research and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A primary concern is that the cultivation strategy selected (typically a large shallow open pond) requires vast amounts of water and land. This is further complicated by the need to keep the algae cultivation system close to the carbon dioxide source, where a primary limiting factor becomes the suitability of the available land. To resolve this problem, most studies have inferred that the optimal approach would be to construct a fossil fuel power facility where land availability is not a problem for large-scale cultivation; however, this solution does not resolve the issue of carbon dioxide mitigation from existing fossil fuel energy production facilities, or, for that matter, other types of CO<sub>2</sub> point sources.</p><p>A few recent reports have attempted to address these challenges through the development of closed loop photobioreactors, which on an areal basis are typically more productive than open ponds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Indeed, a study by Doucha et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] employing flue gas from a natural gas fired boiler fed to a thin layer photobioreactor containing <italic>Chlorella</italic> sp. found that up to 50 % CO<sub>2</sub> removal could be attained. A study reported by Vunjak-Novakovic et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] placed this figure as high as 82 % on sunny days for <italic>Dunaliella</italic> strains grown in an airlift reactor, with 50 % CO<sub>2</sub> removal on cloudy days. An older study by Laws and Berning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] performed in Hawaii using the marine chlorophyte <italic>Tetraselmis suecica</italic> (grown in outdoor flumes) indicated that CO<sub>2</sub> emitted from an oil-fired electric plant could be successfully substituted for pure CO<sub>2</sub> for the cultivation of algae. More limited than the number of these studies are the commercially viable microalgae production processes that utilize flue gas from power plants. In fact, only Seambiotic in Israel has produced significant quantities of algae in this manner, using the flue gas from the Israel Electric Corporation’s coal-fired Ashkelon power plant (Seambiotic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]).</p><p>Against this background, we set out to determine the technical and economic feasibility of algae-based carbon capture in Kentucky. This required designing and demonstrating a process capable of utilizing flue gas through operation of a continuous microalgae culture, and evaluating the economics of CO<sub>2</sub> capture using this approach. This paper summarizes the results of our initial work, including the development and scale-up of component technologies, and demonstration of the integrated process at Duke Energy’s East Bend Station, situated in northern Kentucky.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Experimental</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Algae culturing</title><p><italic>Scenedesmus</italic><italic>acutus</italic> was obtained from the University of Texas Culture Collection (UTEX B72) and was used for all experiments.

Initial cultures were grown in 500 mL Erlenmeyer flasks under warm (Philips F32T8/TL741 Alto, 32 Watts) and cool white (Philips F32T8/TL735 Alto, 32 Watts) fluorescent lights [70 μmol/(m<sup>2</sup> s)] in a 16:8 h light:dark illumination period. Flasks were bubbled with 3 % CO<sub>2</sub> (from gas cylinders) and kept at room temperature (22 °C). The flask cultures were eventually transferred to 7.5 L airlift photobioreactors (PBRs). These airlifts also received a constant supply of 3 % CO<sub>2</sub>, but were grown under natural light conditions in a greenhouse. A number of airlift PBRs were used to inoculate a 650 L Varicon BioFence PBR which, in turn, was used to seed a 1,000 L PBR. Both of these large greenhouse reactors were needed to produce enough algae to inoculate the East Bend Station PBR. The larger PBRs were constantly monitored by probes for pH (Hach DPD1R1), dO<sub>2</sub> (Hach 5740DOB), temperature, dCO<sub>2</sub> (Mettler Toledo InPro 5000i), and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, Apogee Instruments SQ-215). The large greenhouse PBRs were fed CO<sub>2</sub> whenever the culture pH rose above a certain set point (usually pH 7.0). The East Bend Station PBR operated the same way using flue gas as its CO<sub>2</sub> source.</p><p>Culture growth was monitored by means of dry mass (g/L) (Crofcheck et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]) and qualitative microscopy analyses. In addition, ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometry (Thermo Scientific Evolution 60) was used to monitor the density of algal cultures, absorbance being measured at 680 nm. Typically, one 50 mL sample was taken daily from the PBRs for analysis. In addition, ion and urea concentrations in the cultures in the large PBRs were monitored on a regular basis by ion chromatography (IC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), respectively. The concentrations of urea and specific nutrient ions were tracked to determine the rate of nutrient consumption.

Extractions were performed according to the Bligh–Dyer method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] with one modification, namely, a biomass to total solvent ratio of 10 g/180 g was used. After removal of solvent, the crude lipid was weighed, re-dissolved in CHCl<sub>3</sub> and filtered through a plug of K10 montmorillonite (Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the chlorophyll present (which remained strongly adsorbed on the clay). Solvent was then removed under vacuum to afford the purified lipid as a colorless waxy solid.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Lipid conversion to fatty acid methyl esters</title><p>Algal lipids were converted to the corresponding methyl esters using a two-step process of esterification (to convert free fatty acids) and transesterification (to convert triacylglycerides) (Canakci and Van Gerpen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]). 1 g of extracted, purified algal lipids was mixed with 1.5 mL anhydrous methanol containing 2 % H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (wt/wt) and refluxed at 65 °C for 2 h. The reaction was then cooled in an ice bath and the contents were mixed with approximately 3 mL of a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of water:cyclohexane. The organic layer was extracted, dried over sodium sulfate and the cyclohexane was removed by a rotary evaporator. The remaining lipid was then reacted with methanol containing potassium methoxide (0.5 wt% of lipid feedstock). This mixture was refluxed at 65 °C for 30 min. The reaction contents were then cooled, mixed with a water:cyclohexane mixture and the organic layer was separated, dried over sodium sulfate and the cyclohexane was removed on a rotary evaporator. FAME analysis was performed using an HP6890 GC equipped with a J&amp;W Scientific HP-88 capillary column (30 m × 250 μm × 0.2 μm). The inlet was set to 250 °C. The split ratio was 20:1 with a constant flow of 1 mL/min. The oven began at 50 °C and was ramped at 20 °C/min to 140 °C and held for 5 min prior to a second ramp of 3 °C/min to 240 °C. The detector was held at 300 °C. The GC was calibrated using a 37-component FAME GC standard (Sigma-Aldrich). Samples were diluted 1,000:1 in cyclohexane and toluene was used as an internal standard.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Lipid conversion to hydrocarbons</title><p>Lipid deoxygenation experiments were performed in a fixed bed stainless steel tubular reactor (1/2 in. o.d.) equipped with an HPLC pump. 0.5 g of Ni–Al LDH catalyst (particle size 150–300 μm) was first reduced under H<sub>2</sub> at 400 °C for 3 h. Details of the catalyst preparation and characterization have been reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. After reduction of the catalyst, the system was taken to the reaction temperature (300 °C) and pressurized with H<sub>2</sub> to 580 psi. A 1.33 wt% solution of the algal lipids dissolved in dodecane was introduced to the system at a rate of 0.1 mL/min along with a flow of H<sub>2</sub> (50 mL/min). Samples were collected from a liquid/gas separator placed downstream from the catalyst bed. The liquid feed and reaction products were analyzed using an Agilent 7890A GC equipped with an Agilent J&amp;W DB-5HT column (30 m × 250 μm × 0.1 μm), an Agilent Multimode inlet, a deactivated open ended helix liner and a flame ionization detector (FID). Data acquired using the GC-FID were processed using SimDis Expert 9 software purchased from Separation Systems, Inc.

The mass cultivation of algae can be realized in either an open culture system (pond), or a closed loop system (photobioreactor). The selection of an open or closed culture system revolves around a number of system parameters: (1) the microalgae to be cultured, (2) the anticipated carbon source, (3) the accessibility to required resources, and (4) the cost of construction, operation, and maintenance of the culture system. Based upon simple mass balance calculations, an algae unit size to reduce the CO<sub>2</sub> output of a power plant would need to be of an enormous scale. Photobioreactors (PBRs) were chosen as the cultivation method in this study on the basis of their higher areal productivities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and limited water loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] due to evaporation. A number of prototype reactors of different configurations were first constructed in an effort to incorporate the lessons learned into larger scale reactors. Specifically, variations in construction materials, tube orientation and spacing, as well as flow patterns, were examined. The most important factor in designing photobioreactors is to allow exposure of the algal culture to sunlight to drive photosynthesis. Given that a vertical system typically enables a higher surface to footprint ratio than other configurations, a design based on a tubular photobioreactor was selected, oriented vertically, and constructed from low-cost, off-the-shelf parts.</p><p>The hydrodynamics of the reactor is another area of specific concern. Having a good understanding of the flow characteristics of the PBR is an important step toward enabling process control. Having a well-mixed system, with even flow and limited dead zones, ensures that measurements taken at a centralized point are descriptive of the entire system. In addition, any stagnant areas or zones with lower flow (with the potential to collect biomass) should be limited. If the biomass remains trapped in the reactor it can degrade and release compounds that affect culture health. Moreover, poor mixing can lead to anaerobic conditions which favor microbial denitrification, resulting in N<sub>2</sub>O emissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Given that N<sub>2</sub>O is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG), this negatively affects the GHG balance of the system.</p><p>Different methods for circulating the algal culture and keeping it well mixed were, therefore, evaluated before developing a series flow, serpentine-style PBR (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This style of reactor most closely resembles a plug flow reactor, and is constructed by connecting multiple tubes in series to provide the algae access to the solar radiation needed to drive growth. Initial concerns over oxygen accumulation and low carbon dioxide levels were set aside due to the relatively low kinetic rate of photosynthesis (Grima et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]). In order for detrimental concentrations of dissolved O<sub>2</sub> to accumulate, the liquid path, and thereby the residence time, would have to be extremely long. If care is taken in overall reactor design and operation, this issue can be resolved.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>CAD image showing PBR design and photograph of the PBR installed in a greenhouse</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13203_2014_52_Article_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>Historically, one of the main challenges in algae cultivation is CO<sub>2</sub> limitation. Carbon constitutes almost 50 % by weight of the elemental composition of algal biomass, with CO<sub>2</sub> representing the most significant nutrient requirement. One of the inherent benefits of working with coal flue gas is the high percentage of CO<sub>2</sub> in the gas (10–15 %) as compared to atmospheric conditions (0.04 %). Introducing CO<sub>2</sub>-rich gas to the system can often be energy intensive, as is the case in systems requiring gas compression and bubbling. To minimize the costs associated with CO<sub>2</sub> entrainment, while maximizing mass transfer, a liquid driven vacuum pump (i.e., venturi or eductor) was employed in this study. An eductor uses the Bernoulli principle to entrain gas in a driven liquid flow. The extremely turbulent nature of the biphasic flow encourages good mixing and mass transfer, thereby facilitating CO<sub>2</sub> dissolution in the growth medium.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Photobioreactor operating strategy</title><p>Daily productivity rates of algal cultures are dependent on multiple factors, including the nature of the organism being cultured, nutrient concentrations, the concentration of dissolved carbon, temperature, light intensity (i.e., photosynthetically active radiation, PAR), and pH. In this study <italic>S. acutus</italic> was cultured, a prior screening study having shown it to be appropriate for CO<sub>2</sub> capture based on its robust growth, tolerance to a wide range of pH values (Crofcheck et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]), as well as ease of harvesting. Combustion flue gases can be a rich source of CO<sub>2</sub> for algae cultivation; however, the addition of excess flue gas must be avoided as this can result in over-acidification of the culture medium. This can be achieved by feeding CO<sub>2</sub> (as flue gas) on demand based upon the pH of the system. As algae grow, consuming CO<sub>2</sub>, the pH of the solution is increased. The introduction of a CO<sub>2</sub>-rich gas increases the concentration of carbonic acid and other dissolved carbon species, thereby lowering the pH. This approach maintains the system pH within an optimum pH range for algal growth while providing enough CO<sub>2</sub> to sustain growth. This is particularly important if other acidic flue gas components such as SOx and NOx are present. The dissolution of SOx in particular, which forms H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, can result in over-acidification of the culture medium, thereby inhibiting growth (Crofcheck et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]). For this reason, it is important that SOx is not added to the cultivation system faster than its dissolution products can be utilized by the algae.</p><p>Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> illustrates the pH control method used to regulate CO<sub>2</sub> flow to the reactor during 6 days of algal cultivation in a 650 L PBR. The horizontal line indicates the pH set point of the reactor, while the trace shows the measured pH of the system.

Elevated levels of dissolved O<sub>2</sub> can inhibit photosynthesis so it is important to have a method to remove excess O<sub>2</sub> from the system (Weissman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]). One method is to periodically sparge the main process tank with an oxygen-lean gas (such as post-combustion flue gas or nitrogen) which will remove dissolved O<sub>2</sub> preferentially over dissolved CO<sub>2</sub>. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows the response of a PBR with N<sub>2</sub> sparging to remove excessive O<sub>2</sub> concentrations (i.e., &gt;100 % atmospheric saturation or ~9 ppm). As anticipated, a high frequency of pH oscillation (corresponding to strong CO<sub>2</sub> consumption) is paired with a strong response in dissolved O<sub>2</sub>. The effects of respiration on the pH and dissolved O<sub>2</sub> concentration during the night are also illustrated.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>O<sub>2</sub> production and system pH.

As a culture increases its number of cells, the increased chlorophyll concentration of the culture attenuates light much more quickly, starving some cells of required levels of solar radiation.

Reactor tubes were arranged in 10 parallel flow paths, each consisting of 51 tubes connected in a serpentine path extending linearly for 18.3 m (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Feed was introduced by a centrifugal pump via a manifold where flow velocity through each tube was maintained at 16 cm/s, providing a residence time of approximately 13 min in the photosynthetically active volume of the clear tubes for each pass through the PBR. At the end of the PBR, the flow from each parallel flow path was combined in a common manifold and returned to the feed tank. As the return volume flowed back to the top of the 19,000 L feed tank, flow was directed to fall through T-pipe fittings to create suction, which was used as a means to introduce flue gas into the system (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> for a schematic of the PBR system).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Photobioreactor installed at East Bend Station</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13203_2014_52_Article_Fig4_HTML.jpg"/></fig><fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic of photobioreactor system at East Bend Station</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13203_2014_52_Article_Fig5_HTML.gif"/></fig></p><p>The suction end of the return piping arrangement was connected to an air manifold with three automated control valves. When slurry pH rose above the desired set point (pH 7.0) the control valve connected to the flue gas would open, allowing flue gas to be introduced to the feed tank. When the pH dropped below the set point, the flue gas control valve would close and another control valve would open, allowing air in the head space to be recirculated, preventing CO<sub>2</sub> in the head space from venting from the system. The third control valve was used as a relief valve to prevent the feed tank from becoming pressurized as flue gas was added to the system. In this manner, as CO<sub>2</sub> was consumed by the algae, additional CO<sub>2</sub> was automatically fed into the system as needed to maintain the desired operating pH.</p><p>The PBR at East Bend Station was seeded on 7 December 2012 and operated continuously until 31 December 2012. During this time, flue gas was added as needed to maintain the pH at 7.0. Summary results (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) show that productivity as high as 23 g/(m<sup>2</sup> day) was achieved during this period. These data also illustrate that productivity is related to available sunlight (i.e., PAR) as growth rate increased following periods of increased available PAR. The fact that the productivity data do not align perfectly with the PAR values requires comment, albeit that a clear trend is evident. This can be explained on the basis that (1) productivity is dependent on a combination of PAR and temperature (indeed, little growth was observed below 10 °C), and (2) the time at which the reactor is sampled during the day (am or pm) can introduce a lag into the data, i.e., samples taken in the early morning reflect growth the previous day (as well as night losses due to respiration), while samples taken in late afternoon reflect growth on the same day. During this time period, average daily temperature ranged from 4 to 20.5 °C. While this particular organism is not known to be particularly well suited for winter growth, reasonable growth rates were achieved, provided that sufficient PAR was available.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Algal productivity and PAR during December growth study</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13203_2014_52_Article_Fig6_HTML.gif"/></fig></p><p>Summer growth studies were conducted during June and July 2013 (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).

Development of a suitable harvesting/dewatering strategy also addressed other system needs such as recycling clarified water to minimize water consumption and recycle unused soluble nutrients. Since the algae culture is very dilute (0.4–1.0 g dry mass/L), a cost effective, high capacity solid/liquid separation strategy was warranted. After considering a number of options, including dissolved air flotation and centrifugation, it was decided to pursue the use of sedimentation, thickening and filtration, an approach commonly used for treatment of industrial waste water.</p><p>Harvesting cycles were conducted as deemed necessary to maintain culture density, typically on a cycle of two to three times per week. A schematic diagram of the process is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>. While the system continued normal operation, approximately 4,000 L of culture was diverted into a cylindrical, cone bottomed harvesting tank. Moderate molecular weight cationic polyacrylamide flocculant was added at a dosage of 3–5 ppm, dependent upon harvest culture density, and mixed using a recirculating centrifugal pump. The flocculated system was allowed to settle for 4–8 h, after which settled biomass (20–30 g/L) was removed from the thickener and clarified water was pumped back into the feed tank to recycle water along with remaining soluble nutrients. As water was recycled, it was passed through a UV sterilizer. The concentrated algae slurry was then transferred to a horizontal gravity filter/solar dryer and allowed to drain on a multifilament filter fabric. Clear filtrate was passed through the UV sterilizer and returned to the feed tank and dewatered biomass cake was removed from the filter/dryer. If adequate sunlight was available, the filter cake was dry (≤3 % moisture) after approximately 24 h. If inadequate sunlight was available, the filter cake typically contained 7.5–25 % solids and was transferred to an oven and dried at 100 °C. After the biomass was thoroughly dried, a representative portion was characterized and the remainder stored in a freezer for utilization studies such as lipid extraction and upgrading.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic diagram of harvesting/dewatering process</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13203_2014_52_Article_Fig8_HTML.gif"/></fig></p><p>Ultimate analyses of algal biomass harvested at East Bend are summarized in Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>.

On a stoichiometric basis, algae consume ~1.76 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> to produce 1 ton of algal biomass, the exact figure depending on the elemental composition of the biomass produced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are based on the average rating of a coal-burning power plant, which relates the BTU content of the coal to the CO<sub>2</sub> emission. Algal productivity is expressed in grams per meters squared per day, a value of 30 g/(m<sup>2</sup> day) being used in this analysis. This number is derived from East Bend Station data (collected in the months of December, June and July) and data collected at the University of Kentucky (UK) over an approximately 12 month period; the East Bend data followed the trends previously observed at UK with respect to algae productivity as a function of the time of year. Relating algal productivity to the carbon emissions of a typical coal-fired power plant results in the total land area required for the cultivation system, i.e., an algae farm big enough to consume the requisite amount of CO<sub>2</sub>. Based on this productivity, a cultivation system equivalent to 26,200 acres (40.9 square miles) would be required for the baseline scenario (30 % CO<sub>2</sub> mitigation for a 1,000 MW capacity plant). The costs associated with this process (capital, operating, dewatering) are then normalized by land area ($/m<sup>2</sup>) to be compared with areal productivity, and thereby CO<sub>2</sub> consumption. As with capital costs, the energy consumption of the PBR system is extrapolated from current system values. The pressure drop associated with adding additional tubes in series is negligible, resulting in a lower energy cost per unit area (Watts/m<sup>2</sup>) of installed and operating PBR. [Note that each tube pair has a calculated pressure drop of 0.00134 psi based on the frictional resistance; a module of 500 tubes as for the East Bend PBR has 25 tube pairs (10 rows) and would, therefore, have a pressure drop of 0.034 psi]. In this way, we are able to estimate the costs associated with consuming a ton of CO<sub>2</sub>.<table-wrap id="Tab6"><label>Table 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Summary of inputs and assumptions used in the techno-economic analysis (base case)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Input</p></th><th align="left"><p>Value</p></th><th align="left"><p>Comment</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Required CO<sub>2</sub> capture efficiency</p></td><td align="left"><p>30 %</p></td><td align="left"><p>Required capture efficiency if CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are to be maintained at 1,990 value</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>PBR cost, $/L (raw materials)</p></td><td align="left"><p>0.55</p></td><td align="left"><p>Custom design, PETG and PVC parts.

In this case, we based our system on a 300 MW slip stream from a 1 GW plant, i.e., a 30 % slipstream. Operating days per year (300) and an amortization period are chosen to calculate the total amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that would be emitted over the lifetime of the algae-based mitigation system. The overall capital costs are estimated based on the current design of the demonstration facility at East Bend Station and are normalized based on the land area that the system would occupy. The most important assumption is areal productivity, which controls the size and thereby cost of the overall system.</p><p>Although significant progress was made in reducing both the capital and recurring operating costs of the PBR employed, according to the analysis in Table <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>, the current cost of capturing CO<sub>2</sub> falls close to $1,600/ton. Moreover, the capital cost and installation of the algae growth facility constitute 98 % of the overall cost of CO<sub>2</sub> capture. Further progress is clearly needed to reduce the overall capital cost of the system and thus reduce the cost of CO<sub>2</sub> capture. In addition, it should be noted that an amortization period of 10 years was used in the analysis. A less conservative approach would involve increasing this 10 year period to longer periods, bearing in mind that the contribution of operations and maintenance should be increased accordingly. Specifically, allowance has to be made for replacement of the PET tubes every 5 years, these comprising 8 % of the total capital cost; other parts are fabricated from PVC and are assumed to have a lifetime of &gt;30 years. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>, extending the operating life of the facility improves the cost per ton of CO<sub>2</sub> mitigated considerably, although further cost reductions would require a decrease in the various cost elements associated with the PBR. A second option would be to increase the areal productivity although the scope for this seems limited given climatic constraints.<fig id="Fig12"><label>Fig. 12</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Effect of amortization period on the cost of CO<sub>2</sub> capture</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13203_2014_52_Article_Fig12_HTML.gif"/></fig></p><p>An important consideration is that this analysis takes no account of the value of the algal biomass produced. From this, it follows that there is a strong incentive to maximize this value, e.g., by conversion of the biomass to valuable products (nutraceuticals, animal food additive, premium organic fertilizer, etc.), to generate a revenue stream which can help to defray the costs of CO<sub>2</sub> capture/recycle. The size of the markets for algae-derived products is inversely related to the product price. Lower value products such as liquid fuels may be less attractive from a profitability perspective, but a utility-scale installation would produce a quantity of algal biomass that would inevitably oversupply lower volume, higher value product markets. However, there is no reason that utility-scale biomass utilization could not focus on developing both markets; lower value markets to utilize significant volumes, along with limited participation in higher value markets to maximize profits. By doing so, higher value market supply, and hence, profitability will be maintained.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Based on our initial work, we conclude that CO<sub>2</sub> capture and recycle using microalgae is feasible from a technical standpoint. By applying PBR technology, that was developed in-house, at East Bend Station, Kentucky, and using flue gas as the CO<sub>2</sub> source, algae productivity of routinely ≥30 g/(m<sup>2</sup> day) in the summer months was achieved at significant scale (18,000 L). These values compare favorably with values reported in the literature for both pond- and PBR-based cultivation studies. Moreover, average daily productivity slightly in excess of 10 g/(m<sup>2</sup> day) was demonstrated in the month of December and 39 g/(m<sup>2</sup> day) in June–July. To harvest and dewater the produced algal biomass, a protocol was developed based on flocculation and sedimentation, followed by filtration. Extraction of lipids from the harvested biomass was also demonstrated, followed by their conversion to diesel-range hydrocarbons via catalytic deoxygenation.</p><p>Conservative estimates suggest that the current cost of capturing and recycling CO<sub>2</sub> using this approach will fall close to $1,600/ton CO<sub>2</sub> (assuming an amortization period of 10 years). The largest sources of cost reside in the algae culturing stage of the process, corresponding mainly to the capital cost of the photobioreactor system and the associated installation cost. From this it follows that future cost reduction measures should focus on the design of a culturing system which is less expensive to build and install. Even in the most optimistic scenario, the cost of algae-based CO<sub>2</sub> capture is unlikely to fall below $225/ton, corresponding to a production cost of ~$400/ton biomass. Clearly, the economics of CO<sub>2</sub> capture and recycle can be significantly improved if the algal biomass produced can be sold. In view of the fact that the markets for algae are in their infancy, the value of algal biomass is at present hard to quantify with the exception of its fuel value. That said, the literature suggests that several large-volume markets do exist, such as animal feed and organic fertilizer, albeit that these applications require the absence of bioaccumulated heavy metals in the biomass. In this regard, the absence of heavy metals in the algae grown at East Bend, at a detection level of 0.1 ppm, is encouraging.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank Dr. Anne Ware, Tonya Morgan, Landon Mills, Wade Bailey and Neil McCarthy for assistance with lipid extraction and upgrading experiments, together with Nick Rhea and many undergraduate students who contributed to the construction of the photobioreactor.
