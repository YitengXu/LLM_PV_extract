Obtaining HLHT tolerant photoautotrophs is laborious and time-consuming, and in most cases the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we increase the mutation rates of cyanobacterium <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> PCC 7942 by three orders of magnitude through combinatory perturbations of the genetic fidelity machinery and cultivation environment. Utilizing the hypermutation system, we isolate <italic>Synechococcus</italic> mutants with improved HLHT tolerance and identify genome mutations contributing to the adaptation process. A specific mutation located in the upstream non-coding region of the gene encoding a shikimate kinase results in enhanced expression of this gene. Overexpression of the shikimate kinase encoding gene in both <italic>Synechococcus</italic> and <italic>Synechocystis</italic> leads to improved HLHT tolerance. Transcriptome analysis indicates that the mutation remodels the photosynthetic chain and metabolism network in <italic>Synechococcus</italic>. Thus, mutations identified by the hypermutation system are useful for engineering cyanobacteria with improved HLHT tolerance.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Cyanobacteria mutants with improved tolerance to combined high light and high temperature (HLHT) are rarely reported.

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Photosynthesis is the most important biochemical process on Earth; through this process, photoautotrophs convert solar energy and carbon dioxide into chemical energy and organic compounds. Photoautotrophs, primarily comprising plants and algae, provide the essential primary productivity for biosphere development and maintenance. Improving the efficiency and stability of photosynthesis has long been an important direction for plant breeding and crop improvement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Photosynthesis is performed by complex and sophisticated biochemical and molecular machineries, and high photosynthetic efficiency could only be achieved within an optimal range of physical and chemical parameters, while extreme and fluctuating environmental conditions would impair photosynthetic efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. During the agriculture-mode cultivation process, plants and algae are required to withstand multiple impairing climate factors, which, individually or in combination, disturb the photosynthesis activities and biomass production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. High light and high temperature are both severe environmental stressors that impair photosynthetic efficiency, and would sometimes act in tandem, causing superimposed effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Excessive exposure to solar energy and the resulting high temperature beyond the acclimation range of photosynthesis machineries would cause the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which further induces photosystem impairments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, impairs the protein synthesis and repair activities, and disrupts intracellular homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Combined high light and high temperature (HLHT) stress poses threats to agriculture and other photosynthesis-derived economic activities and can happen more widely and frequently as the climate changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>; thus, improving the tolerances of photoautotrophs to HLHT is of great significance. However, although the specific responsive or protective mechanisms of plants and algae toward single stress (high light<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> or high temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>) have been explored, understanding of tolerance mechanisms to the combination of the two stresses (HLHT) is still relatively limited.</p><p id="Par4">Cyanobacteria are important model organisms for exploring and engineering photosynthetic mechanisms. Sharing a common ancestor with chloroplasts, cyanobacteria have similar photosynthetic mechanisms with eukaryotic microalgae and higher plants. Besides, cyanobacteria also have the characteristics of short life cycles, rapid growth rates, and simple structures, allowing convenient genotype-phenotype mapping for photosynthetic research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Following a typical forward genetic research paradigm, genetic and phenotypic diversities could be more conveniently introduced or created into rapidly expanding cyanobacteria offspring populations, and the determining mechanisms and mutations for target photosynthesis-related phenotypes could be identified using multiple omics approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. However, the acquisition of mutants with desired phenotypes remains a bottleneck in this research route, especially for the optimization of complex physiological properties, such as HLHT tolerance. The conventional adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) approach, even enhanced with physical and chemical mutagenesis treatments, usually requires weeks or months to obtain cyanobacteria mutants with improved tolerances to high light or high temperature stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Moreover, mutants with improved tolerance to the combined high-light and high-temperature stresses were rarely reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>; thus, the mechanisms of cyanobacterial photosynthesis tolerance to HLHT stress are still not as clearly understood as those for every single stress.</p><p id="Par5">The generation of abundant genetic diversity in cyanobacteria offspring populations is a prerequisite for phenotypic evolution and isolation; however, their highly accurate genome replication machinery poses formidable obstacles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Based on classical models and data, it can be estimated that it would take thousands of cell replication events to form one genetic mutation into the cyanobacteria genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Although the desired mutant could still be obtained from large-sized populations (from the culture with increased cell density or volume), the process for selecting and identifying the mutations would be time and labor consuming.</p><p id="Par6">In this study, we use an artificial hypermutation system to accelerate genome mutagenesis for adapting photosynthesis to HLHT stress in cyanobacteria. We show that we can isolate <italic>Synechococcus</italic> mutants with improved HLHT tolerance within two weeks and identify functional mutations and mechanisms that determine the evolved traits using forward genetic analysis and reverse genetic confirmation. Our study reveals that enhanced expression of shikimate kinase, an essential enzyme in the shikimate pathway, plays an effective role in optimizing the efficiency and stability of photosynthesis in cyanobacteria.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Disrupting the natural DNA replication fidelity mechanism to increase mutation rates</title><p id="Par7">The high fidelity of genome replication processes in biological cells is ensured by multiple levels of proofreading and repair mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, including base selection, 3’-&gt;5’ exonuclease activity, methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR), DNA damage repair, translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), etc. (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

After excluding the mutations that repeatedly occurred in more than one strain, a total of 46 types of genetic mutations were identified from the evolved strains, including 38 SNPs and 8 InDels (three small insertions and five small deletions). All the InDels were located in the CDS regions, resulting in frameshifts of the encoded proteins. Of the 38 SNPs, 30 were located in the CDS regions (23 non-synonymous mutations, six synonymous mutations, and one nonsense mutation) and the other eight were located in five non-coding intergenic regions.

During the assay, plasmids carrying fragments containing specific mutations (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM5">2</xref>) were transformed into <italic>Synechococcus</italic> cells for potential homologous recombination with the chromosomes, and the positive modifications imparting improved tolerance can be screened out by isolating the surviving host cells. Previously, the 0336 (AtpA-C252Y) was introduced into <italic>Synechococcus</italic> chromosome using this strategy; thus, it was used as the positive control in this experiment. Homologous fragments containing some of the other mutations (NC2-1, NC3-1, 0884, 1799, 1977, 1831-1, 0189-1, and 2215-2) were constructed to transform <italic>Synechococcus</italic> cells, followed by selection under lethal light intensities and temperatures for WT. Among the evaluated mutations, only the NC2-1 mutation proved effective in improving the HLHT tolerance in <italic>Synechococcus</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>). In further evaluations, the same effects were confirmed for NC2-2 and NC2-3, indicating that mutations in the NC2 region were highly correlated with the acquisition of HLHT tolerance. In addition, a reverse genetics strategy was also utilized to construct recombinant strains carrying the mutations for evaluation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). Consistent with the results obtained from the survival selection strategy, only the introduction of NC2 mutations could facilitate the survival and growth of recombinant strains (HS190, G905452A, sp<sup>R</sup>; HS191, C905470T, sp<sup>R</sup>; and HS192, C905445T, sp<sup>R</sup>) under lethal conditions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref> and Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref>), while the strains carrying other mutations (e.g., HS177, 1831-1, sp<sup>R</sup>) showed no significant improvements compared to the respective controls (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>).

At the NLNT condition, 14% of the transcripts in HS199 were up-regulated and 15% were down-regulated (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">16</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM6">3</xref>).

Enrichment analysis revealed that the oxidative phosphorylation pathway was upregulated (<italic>p</italic> = 0.01) in HS199 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">18</xref>). A large portion of the genes, such as genes encoding NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH), cytochrome c oxidase, succinate dehydrogenase, and FoF1-ATP synthase, as well as the genes contributing to phosphate metabolism, were upregulated. Similar changes were also found in the PRM results (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM7">4</xref>), in which the protein abundances of 4 subunits in NDH complex and 6 subunits in FoF1-ATP synthase were increased by 2 to 4 folds.

Although transcriptions of some components in PSII and PSI complexes were found downregulated (including D1 and PsaB), the PRM assay revealed no significant changes in protein abundances of PsaA, PsaB, PsaC, and PsaD in PSI, and even an increased (2.86-fold) abundance of D1 (PsbA1, <italic>Synpcc7942_0424</italic>) in PSII. It could be speculated that the photosynthetic chain in <italic>Synechococcus</italic> was remodeled by the NC2-1 mutation to enhance oxidative phosphorylation and cyclic electron transfer activities for adequate ATP synthesis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), which could guarantee accelerated cell growth in HS199.

When treated with HLHT stress (42 °C and 2500 μmol photons/m<sup>2</sup>/s), the PSII activities of both WT and HS199 cells would be reduced (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001 for WT and <italic>p</italic> = 0.0098 for HS199 after 30 min of exposure to HLHT stress) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">23b, c</xref>), which is in consistence with the down-regulated photosystem pathway from RNA-seq analysis (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0004 for HS199 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.0007 for WT). Meanwhile, among the 9 subunits of PSII detected in PRM analysis, abundances of 5 subunits were reduced in HS199 cultured under HLHT, while in WT cells with HLHT treatment, 2 subunits were down-regulated and one was up-regulated; and correspondingly, PSII activities of HS199 were also lower than that of WT during the HLHT treatment. When lincomycin was supplemented to WT and HS199 cells exposed to HLHT stress, the PSII activities of both strains would be decreased (to 19.4% in HS199 and to 14.8% in WT of the initial levels in 30 min, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">23c</xref>), and slight advantages of H199 in PSII stability facing HLHT stress might be related to the high abundance of D1 protein (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM7">4</xref>). In addition, HS199 exhibited higher <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub> than WT under NLNT and after being exposed to HLHT, the <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub> of WT and HS199 both decreased while HS199 showed lower <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub> than WT (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">24</xref>). The above results suggested that HS199 might adopt the strategy to weaken PSII activity for reducing the overall light energy harvesting and avoiding over-reduction stress, and meanwhile to enhance energy transfer and utilization efficiency (through enhanced CEF and respiration), finally to adapt the HLHT environment and realize rapid growth.</p><p id="Par25">When comparing the transcriptome of HS199 under HLHT with that of the WT under NLNT conditions, pathways for ribosome synthesis (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0001) would also be overrepresented from the upregulated transcripts (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">18</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM9">6</xref>), which might be related to cellular tolerance under HLHT conditions, and the whole metabolic network for protein synthesis might be regulated during the adaptation process of <italic>Synechococcus</italic> cells. As mentioned above, the ribosome synthesis pathway was enhanced in HS199 cells under HLHT (26 out of 53 related transcripts were upregulated, Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9a</xref>); meanwhile, 10 out of 25 genes participating in the aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis pathway were also upregulated (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9b</xref>). Moreover, the transcription of translation elongation factors, including EF-G, EF-G2, EF-Tu, and EF-Ts, was also upregulated (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9c</xref>). The transcription of genes encoding ferredoxin-nitrite reductase (EC:1.7.7.1) and glutamine synthetase (EC:6.3.1.2), involved in amino acid metabolism, was also upregulated (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM9">6</xref>). Considering the above changes, it can be speculated that the protein synthesis capacity of HS199 cells might be enhanced under HLHT conditions. This hypothesis can also be corroborated by the physiological data since the intracellular protein content in HS199 under the corresponding conditions was higher than that in the WT (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9d</xref>). Regarding photosynthetic activities under HLHT stress, enhanced protein synthesis capacities might guarantee the renewal of the impaired proteins and maintenance of biomass production.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Changes in transcript abundance of the genes participating in translation machinery of HS199 under HLHT compared to WT under NLNT conditions.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Changes in transcript abundance of the genes encoding ribosome protein in HS199 strain. <bold>b</bold> Changes in transcript abundance of the genes participating in the aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis. <bold>c</bold> Changes in transcript abundance of the four genes encoding translation elongation factors.

The changes were believed to be effective in reducing excessive energy absorption and avoiding photoinhibition. In addition, the scavenging of ROS by antioxidants, such as GSH, might also be enhanced as an effective photoprotection strategy. Compared with WT under NLNT conditions, transcripts for glutathione peroxidase (EC:1.11.1.9; catalyzing the hydrogen peroxide scavenging reactions converting GSH to GSSG) were upregulated by 4.8-fold. Simultaneously, glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase (EC:1.1.1.49) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (EC:1.1.1.44) in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) were upregulated by 9.7- and 6.4-fold, respectively, which could provide sufficient reducing power (NADPH) for the regeneration of GSH (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">26</xref>).</p><p id="Par27">The global remodeling of the <italic>Synechococcus</italic> transcriptome carrying the NC2 mutation may also be caused by disturbances in the transcriptional regulatory hierarchy.

To eliminate the restrictions of cyanobacterial evolution, we aimed to disrupt the genome replication fidelity machinery in cyanobacteria cells to accelerate the diversification process of offspring populations. Through manipulating the putative fidelity-related genetic elements, mutation rates of <italic>Synechococcus</italic> were increased by over 100-fold; and further improvement of in vivo mutagenesis strengths was obtained based on the synergy effects of the fidelity machinery defects with inhibitory light intensities and temperatures, resulting in 1000-fold increased mutation rates. This engineered hypermutation process mimicked the well-known stress-induced-mutagenesis (SIM) phenomenon, which was triggered by environmental stresses and played an important role in bacteria and yeast acquiring fitness and adaptabilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. In the natural SIM process, multiple response mechanisms leading to an error-prone genome replication process are induced by abiotic stresses to increase genetic diversity and relieve selective pressure at the population level in a short period. In this study, the error-prone replication in <italic>Synechococcus</italic> caused by inhibitory illumination and temperature were amplified by artificial manipulations of the genes <italic>mutS</italic> and <italic>recA</italic>, the alleles that naturally participated in the typical SIM model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Such an engineered hypermutation system could be expected to boost the acquisition of <italic>Synechococcus</italic> mutants and may also inspire the development of adaptive laboratory evolution approaches for other microorganisms.</p><p id="Par29">The isolated HLHT-tolerant <italic>Synechococcus</italic> mutants permitted deciphering of the underlying mechanism through simple comparative genomic analysis. It was revealed that the enhanced HLHT tolerance could be endowed by quite limited genome mutations (an average of 3.8 mutations per strain), which, together with some recent findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, show the great plasticity of the cyanobacterial genome. Loci analysis of the mutations revealed that some of the relevant functions could be directly associated with photosynthesis or some typical photoprotective mechanisms. For example, the 0336 (AtpA-C252Y) mutation has been proven effective for improving FoF1-ATP synthase activity in <italic>Synechococcus</italic>, and thus adapts to the enhanced photosynthetic electron transfer chain (ETC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. The enhanced activity of FoF1-ATP synthase was important for relieving the stress from excess photosynthetic electrons and providing abundant energy to support the PSII repair facing photooxidative damage. Being the primary target in PSII damage, the de novo synthesis and repair of D1 protein are guaranteed by an abundant supply of ATP, as well as the derived synthesis of GTP. Genome mutations in two genes involved in the de novo synthesis of GTP (<italic>synpcc7942_1831</italic> and <italic>synpcc7942_0189</italic>) might be beneficial for stable GTP supply under HLHT stress. GTP consumption is high during protein synthesis, and the abundant GTP supply could promote the regeneration of inactivated D1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> and accelerate de novo synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Furthermore, an additional mutation was found in the EF-Tu protein (<italic>synpcc7942_0884</italic>), which plays an essential role in translation machinery, bringing aminoacyl-transfer RNA to the ribosome, and is closely coupled to GTP hydrolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Strong illumination usually causes the oxidative damage of EF-Tu thus inhibiting PSII repair efficiencies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, and the light-inducible elevation of EF-Tu expression is found to be closely correlated with enhanced PSII repair in <italic>Synechocystis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. The overexpression or modification (to rescue the oxidative damage sites) of EF-Tu could enhance protein synthesis and PSII repair while failing to restore growth inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. The EF-Tu-P164L mutation discovered in this work optimized the HLHT tolerance of <italic>Synechococcus</italic> together with NC2-1 mutation, which could be expected to promote a detailed understanding of the oxidative protective mechanisms in cyanobacteria. In addition to the ATP and protein synthesis pathways, some functional mutations have been identified in genes related to NAD(P)H metabolism, such as the NAD(P)H dehydrogenase complex and [NiFe]-hydrogenase, which might contribute to enhancing and stabilize the electron transfer machineries as protective mechanisms against HLHT stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par30">Among all the mutations, 0336 (AtpA-C252Y) and NC2 are identified to be the primary factors, effectively improving cellular HLHT tolerance individually. Unlike the structure-activity regulation effects of C252Y on FoF1-ATP synthase, the NC2 mutations influenced cellular properties by enhancing the shikimate kinase expression. Shikimate kinase catalyzes the conversion of shikimate to 3-phosphoshikimate, which is essential for the synthesis of aromatic amino acids, tryptophan, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and diverse derived metabolites. Based on the improved efficiency and stability of photosynthesis due to the overexpression of shikimate kinase in <italic>Synechococcus</italic> and <italic>Synechocystis</italic>, it could be speculated that the flux of the shikimate pathway might serve as the rate-limiting pathway for photosynthetic activities in cyanobacteria. The enhanced shikimate kinase expression might cause global impacts by synthesizing more regulatory metabolites. In higher plants and eukaryotic microalgae, the shikimate pathway provides precursors for the synthesis of important plant hormones such as salicylic acid and indole-3-acetic acid. Although functional enzymes have not been identified, the synthesis of such hormones has been detected during the cultivation of other <italic>Synechococcus</italic> species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. The potential synthesis of plant hormones and other secondary metabolites could give possible explanations about the transcriptome shifting in the HS199 strain carrying the NC2 mutation leading to the remodeling of the photosynthetic chain and enhanced oxidative phosphorylation activities, e.g., the upregulation of components in FoF1-ATP synthase (subunit alpha, beta, gamma, delta, a, and c) and NDH complex. The enhancement of shikimate pathway could also regulate the photosynthesis activities by influencing the synthesis of plastoquinone (PQ). PQ in cyanobacteria is synthesized utilizing chorismate, the end metabolite of the shikimate pathway, as important precursors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, and widely participates in photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport chain, as well as in many other metabolic processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. In energy metabolism, PQ works as electron carriers, shared by linear electron flow, cyclic electron flow, and other alternative electron flows<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. The availability of PQ has been found to play an important role in photosynthesis acclimation to high-light and high-temperature conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. The up-regulation of the shikimate pathway in the strain carrying NC2 mutation could be expected to enhance PQ synthesis, and support more robust electron transport in HLHT conditions. On a physiological level, the most determining impact of NC2 mutation was the enhanced cyclic electron transport activities, which might be the synergistic results from enhanced PQ supply<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>, up-regulated NDH complex, and reduced PSII activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. CEF plays an essential role in balancing the ATP/NADPH ratio (promoting the supply of additional ATP required by the high-energy consuming process, e.g., protein synthesis and materials transport) and preventing over-reduction damage of PSI and PSII in plants and algae for both short-term acclimation and long-term adaptation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Previously, changes in shikimate pathway genes and related metabolites were observed in photoautotrophs with regulated CEF activities. In an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutant with impaired CEF, levels of shikimate metabolites were significantly reduced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>, while in a <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> strain exhibiting high CEF, two key enzymes in the shikimate pathway were up-regulated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. However, the interactions between the shikimate pathway and the CEF as well as other molecular mechanisms for stress response are unclear. Our work indicates that the enhanced CEF and the optimized photosynthesis stabilities facing HLHT stress in <italic>Synechococcus</italic>, could be a result of the up-regulation of the shikimate pathway. Another possible mechanism of the enhanced shikimate pathway to influence cyanobacterial photosynthesis activities is through directly enhancing aromatic amino acids supply for the requirement of photosystems synthesis. The proportion of diverse aromatic amino acids in 2657 proteins in <italic>Synechococcus</italic> was counted and classified according to the KEGG pathway and solubilities of the proteins (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">27</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">28</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM11">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM14">11</xref>). As shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">28</xref>, the total proportions of the shikimate pathway-derived aromatic amino acids (tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan) in all proteins, soluble proteins, and membrane proteins were 7.7%, 7.3%, and 9.3%, respectively. The proportion in the photosynthesis pathway was the highest (10.2%), especially in photosystem II (14.5%), among all the annotated pathways (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">24</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">25</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM10">7</xref>). Thus, it could be speculated that an enhanced supply of aromatic amino acids might guarantee the synthesis of essential photosystem components. Some other protective mechanisms are also pre-activated by NC2 mutation in <italic>Synechococcus</italic>. Previously, a mutated <italic>ppnK</italic> gene encoding more active PpnK enzymes (NAD<sup>+</sup> kinase, catalyzing the conversion of NAD<sup>+</sup> to NADP<sup>+</sup>) was confirmed to be associated with the growth advantages in a fast-growing <italic>Synechococcus</italic> UTEX 2973 strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Possibly by following similar mechanisms, three genes encoding the NAD(P)<sup>+</sup> transhydrogenase were up-regulated in the strain carrying an NC2 mutation, which might also promote the rapid intra-turnover of NAD(P)H pool and ensure the supply of NADP<sup>+</sup> to accept photosynthetic electron flow. Taken together, the above mechanisms might benefit the efficiency and flexibility of energy transfer and utilization in the NC2 strain and provide explanations for the growth advantages under NLNT conditions. Furthermore, under HLHT stress, several protective mechanisms were activated in the strain carrying the NC2 mutation, including the reduction of energy absorption (decreased amount of chlorophyll and antenna protein, alteration in photosystem I and photosystem II components), enhancement of energy transfer (ferredoxin, H<sup>+</sup> translocating NADPH-NAD<sup>+</sup> to NADH-NADP<sup>+</sup> transhydrogenase, and components of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway), and increased protein synthesis. Some of the protective or responsive mechanisms could also be observed in WT <italic>Synechococcus</italic> cells under HLHT stress, while the introduction of the NC2 mutation might further enhance these protective effects.</p><p id="Par31">Utilizing the engineered hypermutation system, HLHT tolerance of <italic>Synechococcus</italic> photosynthesis was improved and the relative mechanism was deciphered in this study.
