and for liquid biofuels as well. With an increasing share of renewables on the one hand side and a limited availability of biomass on the other hand, the provision of bioenergy has to consider the demands of the future energy system with high shares of fluctuating wind and solar power. This includes new and improved technologies and concepts for biogas, biomethane, and liquid and solid biofuels, which are discussed in the following, while for the electricity sector, the demand for more flexible provision might take place in the years to come; for more flexible heat provision, the transition is expected in a longer time frame. For their market implementation adopted regulatory framework and price signals from electricity markets are necessary.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Biogas</kwd><kwd>Heat Pump</kwd><kwd>Electricity Market</kwd><kwd>Biogas Plant</kwd><kwd>Organic Rankine Cycle</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>37</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>11</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/13705_2015_Article_62.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>ReviewPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Renewable and Green Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Sustainable Development</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy Policy, Economics and Management</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy Policy, Economics and Management</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Review</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The transition of the energy system towards greater use of renewable energy is a precondition for the envisaged reduction of greenhouse gas emission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], for a sustainable use of the finite resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and for macroeconomic benefits as well as for fair access to energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The total use of renewable energy sources has been increased worldwide over the last decade with biomass as the most important source covering 10 % of the total global primary energy demand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Biomass is a renewable carbon source and can be used for provision of a wide range of bioenergy carriers and substitute fossil fuels in the power, heat, and transport sector. Additionally, biomass and the produced bioenergy carriers are storable and can provide energy on demand in principle. This quality is especially relevant in energy systems with high shares of fluctuating renewables like wind and solar power.</p><p id="Par3">In general, the provision of bioenergy is based on different principles and concepts: There are thermochemical, biochemical, and physicochemical conversion systems available to produce solid, liquid, and gaseous fuels from biomass (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In the following steps, these fuel sources are converted—mainly combusted—to generate heat and power in stationary and mobile applications:<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Biomass conversion pathways and related global bioenergy provision in 2012.

Established is heat provision from solid biomass, combined heat and power provision from different bioenergy carriers, such as biogas, solid biofuels, and vegetable oil, and the use as a transport fuel, including biodiesel, bioethanol, and biomethane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. With those different conversion concepts, biomass provides 14 % of the overall primary energy, what is—compared to 5 % other renewables—75 % of renewable energy at global scale in 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">Also in Germany, 61 % of the renewable energy provided is a product of biomass, with the potential to reduce 54 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub>-carbon dioxide equivalents, which represent 37.2 % to the total amount of German greenhouse gas reduction by renewable energies in 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">This review focuses on the technical options to adapt existing bioenergy provision plants to a flexible energy provision. The method is described in “<xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">Method</xref>”. To consider the specific energy market condition as well, we analyzed for Germany exemplarily the expected demand pattern for flexible bioenergy in systems with higher shares of solar and wind energy (“<xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">Demands on bioenergy from the transition of the energy system</xref>”). The review includes biogas provision concepts (“<xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">Electricity from biogas—a wide range of options for balancing fluctuating power supply</xref>”), electricity provision from liquid biofuels (“<xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec">Electricity from liquid fuels—technically promising but in competition with other utilisation pathways</xref>”), electricity from solid biofuels (“<xref rid="Sec16" ref-type="sec">Electricity from solid biomass—moderate chances for heat-driven plants</xref>”), and flexible heat provision (“<xref rid="Sec21" ref-type="sec">Heat from biomass—shrinking but exact controllable installation lead into future</xref>”). Also new concepts of cross-sectoral energy provision is included and discussed with the potential role of biomass in power-to-X concepts (“<xref rid="Sec26" ref-type="sec">Balancing across energy sectors—the role of biomass in power-to-X concepts</xref>”). Finally, we discuss the potential and availability of the different flexible bioenergy provision concepts and conclude the economic frame condition for market implementation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Method</title><p id="Par10">We conducted a literature review to summarize recent knowledge regarding technical adaptation for flexible bioenergy supply in Germany: flexible electricity from biogas, from liquid and solid biofuels, heat from biomass, and power-to-X concepts as well. We reviewed English and German peer-reviewed journals and publications by using the databases and library services of ScienceDirect, (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.sciencedirect.com</ext-link>), Web of Science (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.webofknowledge.com/" ext-link-type="uri">www.webofknowledge.com</ext-link>), and Google Scholar (<ext-link xlink:href="http://scholar.google.com/" ext-link-type="uri">http://scholar.google.com</ext-link>) (time period: 1970 to December 2013). In those fields where adequate literature is not available yet, we conducted some basic demands and options for different kinds of flexible bioenergy provision.</p><p id="Par11">Additionally, we used data available from the DBFZ database to describe the status quo on bioenergy. The data available are based on the evaluation of an annual survey. The survey has been carried out annually since 2007. It is a written survey on the basis of a standardized questionnaire, which has been sent out. Starting with app. 500 in 2007 up to app. 10,000 in 2015, questionnaires have been sent out and usually 10–15 % are returned to us. Selected results of the survey are published as a report “Renewable energy sources act monitoring report.” Within the scope of the survey, operators and owners are asked about data concerning the tariffs, produces energy, operational, and technical parameters and substrates. The database covers about 90 % of the total number of bioenergy plants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Demands on bioenergy from the transition of the energy system</title><p id="Par12">In the past, continuous support instruments have been necessary to introduce renewable power provision. Germany has implemented an active policy for the transition of the energy system towards the use of renewable energy more than a decade ago. The development of the renewable energy sector in Germany actively started to gain momentum in 1991 when the electricity feed-in law came into force, which was renamed as the “EEG”—Renewable Energy Sources Act in 2000 and has since then undergone several amendments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The EEG aims to enforce technological development in order to introduce renewable energy into the electricity market and integrate it into the energy system. Since 2001, the European energy policy has promoted electricity production from renewable energy sources on the domestic electricity market [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">In 2012, 25.3 % of the electricity consumed in Germany is produced from renewable energy that is mainly supported by the EEG, with the fluctuating use of wind and photovoltaic power accounting for 55 %, and electricity from biomass and hydropower accounting for 45 %. Although bioenergy has a relatively small amount of installed capacity (9 %) among the renewable energies compared to wind or solar power, due to its high full load hours (about 7500), it has a relatively high percentage (31 %) of overall renewable power feed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Due to a drastic incentive cut for bioenergy within the amendment of the renewable energy sources act in 2014, market expansion is expected mainly for wind power and photovoltaic.</p><p id="Par14">The transition of power generation towards more renewables also leads to different supply patterns: With the increasing supply from wind and solar power, the supply pattern changed to variable proportions of wind and solar power and a remaining demand to be covered by flexible and controllable power plants—the so-called residual load. Due to the sunlight dependency of solar power, the residual load is at a minimum during midday (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) and could in future also become negative on sunny days, when the demand for power is generally low (i.e., on Sundays or holidays) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Future markets for renewable electricity will therefore have to focus on an efficient supply of system services to balance the fluctuating renewables, including short-time residual load from biomass and other flexible provision options as well as storage technologies. They have to meet the need for compensation of large variation in within short periods for grid stabilization and on the longer term for balancing the given weather condition as well.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Recent electricity mix and variation of residual loads (defined as load less wind and solar generation) in Germany, 11th week 2014, own presentation based on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13705_2015_62_Fig2_HTML.gif" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par15">In the upcoming transformation of electrical power production in Germany and Europe, wind and solar power have also gained special importance. The main reason for this can be said to be a largely absence of marginal costs of production because wind and solar power have no fuel costs at all. As a consequence, electricity from wind and solar has a priority for the feed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. On the other hand, these two types of renewable energies are produced erratically and not always in line with demand patterns, so system services from the other renewables need to provide grid stabilization and residual load in times of disadvantageous weather condition. For this very reason, a range of flexibility options are required, for example, demand-side management, network expansion, energy storage, and flexible power plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. From a short-term perspective, flexible power could be met from fossil and renewable sources, but from a long-term perspective, this task should be transferred exclusively to renewable power plants and other no-fossil options (demand-side management, storage systems, etc.). The changing role of bioenergy in a transforming energy system integrating larger amounts of fluctuating wind and solar energy has been discussed in a few studies only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It is not a question if biomass can cover the whole gap, rather it will contribute to the missing capacities. Additionally, bioenergy will replace most likely a higher portion of fossil fuels within these remaining capacities plus acting in markets with increased prices for electricity.</p><p id="Par16">Additional targets for the transformation of the heat sector have been defined: In line with the European Renewable Energy Directive, Germany’s national renewable action plan aims to increase the renewable energy share for heating from 9.1 % in 2009 to 15.5 % in 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The development of heat provision from biomass does not depend so much on support schemes but on emission control regulation, especially for the small-scale sector. The framework background tightens the emission protection enactment, which stipulates the lowering of emission limits especially for carbon monoxide and particulate matter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">The development of heat provision from biomass is influenced by the improvement in building insulation, emission reduction targets for biomass stoves and boilers, market conditions for combined heat and power installations based on biomass, targets for renewables in the heat sector, and the market development of renewable heat provision from other sources. For the midterm, a strongly shrinking heat demand is presumed (45 % decrease) if ambitious restoration targets can be realized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Under those conditions, also a lower seasonal variety can be expected, with a more constant demand for hot water. Furthermore, mixes with other renewable heat sources such as solar heat, geothermal heat, heat pumps, and the conversion of excess electrical energy from power to heat will all increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Experiences from the past lead to the expectation that the transition in the heat sector will take place much slower than in the electricity sector.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Electricity from biogas—a wide range of options for balancing fluctuating power supply</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Status quo</title><p id="Par18">At the end of 2013 in Germany, the utilization of agricultural substrates as energy crops and manure dominates the biogas sector with app. 7700 plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Flexibilization of the energy provision and in particular the biogas sector has been identified as an important task for the future—in Germany [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and also in other European countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">For the flexibilization of biogas, plants have been offered an incentive within the Renewable Energy Sources Act in 2012 and has been continued in 2014. According to the DBFZ Database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] in March 2015, close to 3000 biogas plants have been registered for the special tariff, which has been established to support flexible plant operation. Technically, the plants have been designed for a constant operation, and consequently, the flexible operation needs adjustment in design and operation. So far, most plants are reluctant to invest in additional infrastructure and use their existing plus simply adding CHP capacity. More sophisticated flexibility concepts, e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], have not been realized yet due to a drastic incentive cut within the amendment of the Renewable Energy Sources Act in 2014 for new plant constructions.</p><p id="Par20">Biogas plants can have profitable access peak power prices under the conditions of the Renewable Energy Sources Act from 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and it can be assumed that this is also the case for the amendment of 2014, since it has very similar conditions. Looking at market conditions, there is financial revenue from flexibilization of the energy output; however, without incentives, the income cost balance is negative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Reasons are the low energy prices and the small price fluctuations at the electricity market [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Technology</title><p id="Par21">Biogas can be produced from several organic substances as solid wastes and waste waters from municipalities and industry, energy crops, sewage sludge, etc. There are plenty of technologies adapted to the characteristics of the different substrate stream [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The main process technology applied is the continuous stirred tank reactor system. The produced gas is collected in rubber domes (one and two layer systems) on top of the digesters, with an approximate storage capacity of 4 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. After a drying process and H<sub>2</sub>S removal, the gas is usually utilized within a combined heat and power unit. At the end of 2013, 154 plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] use an upgrading process to produce biomethane for injection into the natural gas grid.</p><p id="Par22">The options for the flexibilization of the energy provision are first of all limited by the available power provision capacity, which is in most cases a combined heat and power unit (CHP). Consequently, the reaction time of the CHP is a limiting factor. Usually, the CHP can shut down and restart or change to part load operation within several minutes. The risk of a failure of the restart process can be avoided by offering only part load operation. Second, the available plant design and infrastructure is limiting the flexibility. Given the situation, a plant has a nominal load which should be achieved in average during annual operation; any downtime needs to be compensated by an equivalent time of correspondent additional energy output. The larger the available overcapacities in comparison to the nominal load, the more flexibility a plant can provide. However, besides the CHP, the upstream equipment has also to be considered—the CHP needs to be fed with gas when needed.

Minimal changes in the overall plant operation are necessary. The implementation only requires control technology for the CHP units; the CHP needs to be outfitted to sustain frequent start stop operation. The time limit for the shutdown period is the available gas storage. In order to compensate for an average nominal load, a slight overcapacity is required.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par32">Mid-term flexibility (reaction time, &gt;15 min, duration: according to a weekly schedule): The amplitude and the duration of load alternation are greater than within the short-term flexibility. The alteration is triggered within a day or for the following day. In such cases, besides the overcapacity required on the gas utilization side and sufficient gas storage, the flexibility of the plant can be improved by means of a feeding management and a correspondent control system for the biological process. All installations on site have to match the requirements of the load variation, in particular any excess heat utilization might require additional installations.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par33">Long-term flexibility (reaction time: per season, duration: months): In this case, the provision of energy is adjusted in the long term. Reasons for such an operation could include seasonal adjustments (e.g., production is ruled by the heat demand of municipal housing), the utilization of residues from seasonal production processes, or long-term weather conditions (wind, solar). The limit for the amplitude is the CHP overcapacity required, and the installations on site have to match the long-term changes to operations. Consequently, the plant availability of the biogas production process is more secure through a constant operation, a sudden start-up, or an increase in the load has a certain risk of process failure. Therefore, the overall process is not recommended for critical increases in loads (e.g., quick startups as an emergency backup for other critical industrial processes).</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par34">In general, it is possible that the different options are provided at one plant simultaneously.</p><p id="Par35">Within the overall process, the most sensitive and critical part is the biological process of gas production.

The rate limitation of the biological system is determined by the type of fermentation technology and the substrate characteristics. The microorganisms require a stable temperature, constant minimum feeding, and the mechanical parts such as pumps and mixers need to be operated frequently in order to avoid malfunctions. Consequently, the flexibility option of a complete shutdown of the biogas production for a longer period of time cannot be recommended.

For example, even the common combinations of solar thermal and biomass heat generation often have quite low annual efficiencies due to too long operation times of biomass boilers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Also, it is well known that emissions from wood chip boilers increase during load changes and also for part load quite below 50 % of the nominal load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Therefore, to achieve even higher flexibility as now without increasing the air emissions and without significant losses in efficiency, further developments are needed.</p><p id="Par69">According to the above mentioned basic heat from biomass concepts, listed in Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> are some exemplary options for future more smart heating concepts.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Exemplary options for future smart heating concepts, data based on Smart Bioenergy, Ch. 6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>]</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr valign="top"><th><p>State of the art concept</p></th><th><p>Changes in concept</p></th><th><p>Needed research and developments</p></th><th><p>Timeframe</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><p>Small scale log wood and wood pellet furnaces</p></td><td><p>By integration of water pockets, the furnaces will be linked to the central house heating system.

The advantage is the cheap thermal heat from the single room heater especially on the very cold days when the efficiency of the heat pump decreases quite significantly. So the total annual efficiency can increase.</p><p id="Par71">At the moment, no quick changes towards more flexible biomass-fed heating technologies are to be expected as the use of renewable heat is increasing only at a very low level, and the further insulation of buildings is also stagnating in Germany.

If this happens, the surplus energy has to be transmitted, stored, or become curtailed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. If in the future the frequency and duration of these periods increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>], another approach is to transfer the surplus energy into other sectors.</p><p id="Par76">Currently, different concepts are discussed and tested: (i) power to gas, (ii) power to liquid, (iii) power to chemicals, and (iv) power to heat.

In power-to-gas concepts, the integration of biomass is mainly discussed for biogas plants: one approach of integration is use of excess power to increase the methane output, without additional feedstock necessity by converting the CO<sub>2</sub>-fraction of biogas with the addition of electrolysis-hydrogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. These so-called “power to gas” concepts are based on the assumption that fluctuating renewable energy sources such as wind and photovoltaics produce excess electricity which is available for long-term energy storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>].</p><p id="Par78">The hydrogen could be converted to methane by adding carbon dioxide—a major by-product within the biogas production process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>].

For Germany, the expectation is to contribute to the missing capacities and to replace a higher portion of fossil fuels within these remaining capacities and acting in markets with increased prices for electricity. Therefore, the individual technologies and plants need to be adopted towards an optimized contribution of bioenergy technologies to the overall energy system. This requires conversion plants with units that can be controlled with precision and well adapted to short reaction times, with a partial load function of the conversion process and additional storage facilities. The conceptual approaches and the technical potential for developing different biomass provision routes towards more flexibility are manifold.</p><p id="Par86">Power provision from biomass is one application, where increasing flexibility can be expected in the years to come when electricity from wind and photovoltaic will become even more important. Due to the specific frame conditions of power provision, the demand for flexibility in this sector is expected to be very challenging, requiring reaction times of only a few minutes to provide positive or even negative energy to balance grid stability.</p><p id="Par87">Highly flexible heat provision in small scale combustion units is not so much an issue at the moment but is expected prospectively to be due to an increasing supply of heat from solar systems and/or heat from excess energy from wind and photovoltaic (power to heat).</p><p id="Par88">Furthermore, the increased availability of fluctuating wind and solar power will provide excess energy during certain periods. Basically speaking, this excess electrical energy can be converted into thermal or chemical energy and meet some of the demand for heat or fuel consumption. As a result, some of the flexibility needs can be shifted between the different sectors.</p><p id="Par89">Challenges on the road to becoming more flexible do not only occur from the technical options and limitations but also from the elements of the supply chain, including sustainable feedstock provision, the implementation of flexible conversion concepts, and the demand from the renewable energy market. The new technology options might also support the introduction of bioenergy plants in regions of instable grid conditions or locally fluctuating energy supply. Flexible provision of bioenergy is always connected to higher specific provision costs because additional conversion units are needed and/or the plant is providing energy in part load. Especially in the electricity market, price signals are necessary to shift existing bioenergy plants towards flexible provision.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge the financial support of the German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture and of the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy to the Project Electricity Generation from Biomass (03MAP250).</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Grübler</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Ishitani</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Johansson</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Marland</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Moreira</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name><name><surname>Rogner H-H</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group><source>Energy Primer.
