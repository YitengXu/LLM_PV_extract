According to predictions from the United Nations, more than 2.7 billion people will be challenged by water scarcity by the middle of the century. The water industry is increasingly interested in desalination of the sea, ocean, and brackish water. Desalination processes are widely classified as thermal or membrane technologies. In the Middle East, thermal desalination remains the primary technology of choice, but membrane processes, for example reverse osmosis (RO), have evolved rapidly and in many other parts of the world are currently even surpassing thermal processes. The purpose of this paper is to review the renewable energy source, the technology, desalination systems, and their possible integration with renewable energy resources and their cost. This article suggests that the most practical renewable desalination techniques to be used are the solar photovoltaic integrated RO desalination process, the hybrid solar photovoltaic-wind integrated RO desalination process, the hybrid solar photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) integrated RO desalination process, and the hybrid solar photovoltaic-thermal effect distillation (PVT-MED) desalination process. However, intensive research is still required to minimize the cost, reduce the heat loss, enhance the performance, and increase the productivity.</p></abstract><kwd-group

civilisation has been centred around sources of freshwater (Sherbinin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2009</xref>). However, due to the current high living standards and increased industrialisation, there is a large increase in water consumption. As a result, the shortage of freshwater is becoming a significant problem in several parts of the world. The more civilisation and industrialisation grow, the more the freshwater deficiency increases. There are about 1.1 billion people who do not have access to freshwater sources, while 2.4 billion people lack access to sanitized water, and around 2.7 billion people face water scarcity for at least 2 month per year. As a result, many people have no choice but to consume stagnant water or otherwise be completely prohibited from water. This can have major health effects on these people who will become more exposed to diseases such as typhoid fever, cholera and other water-borne illnesses. Water is a major factor in disease prevention and control; in a recent study (Anim and Ofori-Asenso <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2020</xref>), water is reported to have a critical part in the prevention and control of COVID-19 spread especially in Africa due to the importance of water in individuals’ hygiene and sanitisation. Unfortunately, around 300 million people in the sub-Saharan region suffer from water deficiency, which puts them in a very dangerous situation and makes them more vulnerable to COVID-19 (Anim and Ofori-Asenso <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2020</xref>). Two million people, mostly children, die every year from diarrheal diseases alone. Poor sanitation is accepted widely as a major contributor to water-borne diseases, causing more than 1200 deaths per day among children under the age of 5.</p><p id="Par3">It is estimated that for two-thirds of the world population clean water will be hardly accessible by 2025 (unwater.org). Although water covers 75% of the earth’s surface, most of it is salty and brackish water. Freshwater in lakes, rivers and groundwater constitutes only 0.65% of global water, and its availability is not correlated with the population and the use of water in different parts of the world (Meissner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2001</xref>). It is argued that potable water can be extracted from sea, lakes or rivers accessible in water-stressed areas. Brackish water salinity is up to 10,000 parts per million (ppm), and seawater salinity ranges between 35,000 and 45,000 ppm as dissolved salts, resulting in that these waters are not suitable for human consumption. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in some specific cases a salinity of 500 ppm and 1000 ppm is allowed (WHO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">2011</xref>). One of the most promising solutions to overcome water shortcoming is desalination (Alkaisi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2017</xref>). Desalination techniques must be utilized to bring salinity down to the allowed limit. This technology could potentially reduce water poverty in regions with scarce freshwater resources and help developing countries achieve their food security goals (Alhaj and Al-Ghamdi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2019</xref>). Nearly 400 million individuals used desalinated water in 2015, and it is projected that by 2025, about 14% of the world’s population will have to use desalinated water (Chandrashekara and Yadav <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">Seawater desalination consumes huge quantity of energy which is estimated to be tenfold the energy required for river and lake water treatment. This vast amount of energy needed for desalination has serious consequences on the environment and results in high cost of freshwater. A recent study (Hindiyeh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2021</xref>) is expecting the fossil fuels that we use to provide our energy to run out in the current century. They anticipate oil to deplete by 2052, gas to deplete by 2060 and coal to deplete by 2090. Oil supplies approximately 40% of the world’s energy, and 96% is used for transportation, while global oil demand is growing at a fast rate; the global oil demand increased by 1.8% in 2018. Gas totalled 23% of the total energy demand but grew at a 4.6% rate in 2018; gas had the second-highest share of total electricity generation at 23%, or 6091 terawatt-hours (TWh). Global coal demand accounted for 0.7% in 2018. Coal’s share of total electricity generation totalled 10,116 TWh, as it commanded 38% of total generation around the world (Hindiyeh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2021</xref>). The most effective way to mitigate the energy-associated impacts of desalination technologies is to supply the energy needs of the process (either in whole or partially) from clean renewable energy sources, for example solar energy (Alhaj et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2017</xref>). Thus, utilisation of alternative energy sources and implementation of improved desalination technique are important for widespread and sustainable desalination. Desalination technologies based on renewable energies will have no less of an impact on the environment and will be more sustainable, and the cost of producing freshwater is supposed to decrease due to the availability of free energy sources. Many renewable energy-based desalination techniques have not been found in the market because of the occasional intermittent nature of renewable energy sources and also because of the high storage and capital costs.</p><p id="Par5">The focus of the current review is to present recent developments in membrane-based desalination processes using renewable energy techniques and to meet the challenges.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Desalination using thermal and electrical energy</title><p id="Par6">Desalination is growing fast to bridge the gap between the needed and the available freshwater; 67% of the desalinated water is seawater, 19% is brackish water, 8% is river water and 6% is wastewater (Al-karaghouli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2011</xref>). Thermal energy has been historically used for desalination. Thermal desalination is still in use even in current desalination processes as thermal vapor compression (TVC), multi-stage flash (MSF) technology with a 17.6% share and multiple-effect distillation (MED) with a share of 6.9% (Hindiyeh et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2021</xref>). It exists mainly in petroleum-enriched areas such as the Middle East.</p><p id="Par7">In the TVC method (Farbod <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2020</xref>), water vapor is fed to the evaporator and the steam goes to the compressor. The steam is compressed at this point, and its temperature rises to evaporate the sprayed feed water on the heat exchangers. Preheating the feedwater is used to start the process and reach the evaporation temperature. The required heat to evaporate water in this method is provided by thermal vapor compression (TVC) using high-pressure steam. In the TVC method, the required steam is supplied by lateral processes such as power cycles or industrial processes.</p><p id="Par8">The multi‑stage flash MSF (Farbod <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2020</xref>) was invented in the early 1950s. Today, more than 80% of the freshwater produced by the thermal method which is produced at MSF sites. In this method, the water is heated in several stages, and at each stage, the pressure and temperature decrease compared to the previous stage. Typically, MSF includes 15 to 28 levels or stages. The latest MSF technology has reached 45 stages that can compete with RO in terms of capacity and energy consumption. Inlet brine is heated to 90–115 °C in the heater tank, and water vapor is produced. The pressure level in the first stage is slightly lower than the saturation pressure of water vapor (Voutchkov <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">2012</xref>). When a stream of saturated water passes through a pressure convertor, the pressure suddenly decreases, forming the so-called sudden evaporation (flashing) phenomenon. As the water enters each step, some of the water suddenly evaporates and enters the vapor phase as it passes through the pressure reducing nozzle. The vapours formed on the condenser tubes are distilled and then collected in special trays. As the steam phase changes to liquid, some latent heat is released, which is used to preheat the saline water before entering the first stage. The MSF method is performed at each step by lowering the pressure and producing some amount of steam that will be distilled at the same stage. Fortunately, the amount of seawater recovered by this method is approximately 10–30% (Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2016</xref>). The typical energy consumption of MSF units is 250–330 kJ/kg of freshwater, and the amount of electricity required for processing is in the range of 3–5 kWh/m<sup>3</sup>. Generally, the use of the MSF method for desalination due to low efficiency, high costs and high environmental impacts in the future can be ignored compared to MED and RO (Bennett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2014</xref>; Ghafour et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">The multi-effect distillation MED (Farbod <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2020</xref>) process has been used in various industries such as paper production, sugar, dairy industry and desalination. Small MED sites with a total capacity of less than 500 m<sup>3</sup> per day were built in the 1960s. Subsequent improvements have expanded the recovery capacity of this method. In 2006, the capacity of MED sites increased to 36,000 m<sup>3</sup>/day (Al-Othman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2018</xref>). This method also uses several steps or levels where each step takes place in a separate tank, and the pressure in each step is gradually reduced. For multi-stage distillation, 8–16 steps are typically used to minimize energy consumption. The water on the surfaces of the evaporator pipes is spread out as a thin film, which causes the water to evaporate rapidly. The steam produced is distilled on a cool external surface. Here, the latent heat from the distillation water is used to heat the saline water at lower temperatures and pressures, which means that after initial heat in the first stage, there is no need to heat the water in other stages. In summary, the latent heat from the condensation at each stage is used to evaporate the water at a later stage. This reduces the total energy consumption for water desalination. Therefore, the energy costs in the MED method are lower than in the MSF technique (Ortega-Delgado et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2017</xref>). The usual amount of freshwater in this method is about 20–35% of the water that entered into the system (Voutchkov <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">2012</xref>). Throughout the world, membrane techniques utilising electrical energy have recently substituted thermal energy (IRENA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2012</xref>; Gnaneswar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2010</xref>; Do Thi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">2021</xref>). Membrane techniques are using less energy; they have the advantages of high productivity, light weightiness and compactness (Alawaji et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1995</xref>; Headley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">1997</xref>; Kanzari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2005</xref>; Harrison et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">1996</xref>). In spite of improvements achieved, a lot of work is still needed to enhance the performance and lower the cost of membrane desalination.</p><p id="Par10">In reverse osmosis (RO) desalination, seawater is pushed against semipermeable membranes that allow molecules of water to pass through and prevent salt molecules from passing. A high-pressure pump is needed to push seawater against osmotic pressure and pressure loss through the system (Stover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">2007</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">When desalting seawater, a booster pump and energy recovery equipment are needed to reduce the area required for the high-pressure pump and restore the pressure from the concentrate (Stover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">2007</xref>). This is not required in brackish water desalination due to low levels of total dissolved solids (TDS) (Drak and Adato <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2014</xref>). The high cost remains the first drawback for sustainable desalination (Subramani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">2011</xref>); in RO desalination of seawater utilising electricity, energy accounts for 30% of the desalination cost. Consumption of high energy leads to more greenhouse gas emission (Raluy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2005</xref>). Another problem facing the growth of the desalination industry is the issue of using oil fuel, which sparks environmental and sustainability concerns. The current installed desalination systems’ capacity is more than 90 million m<sup>3</sup>/day, which demands over 850 million tons of oil each year (IRENA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2012</xref>). This amount is expected to increase with the development of the desalination sector throughout the world. In addition, sources of fossil fuel are anticipated to be depleted in a few decades. Current global desalination is estimated to consume 75.2 TWh of energy per year (Wakil et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">2017</xref>). Recent global desalination plants are estimated to release 76 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> every year, which is expected to reach 218 million tons by 2040 (GCWDA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2015</xref>). Additionally, changes in oil price and supply will affect water price.</p><p id="Par12">The above information shows the importance of using renewable energy in desalination practices. There is increased dependence on desalination as a reliable source of freshwater in places which are suffering severe water scarcities.</p><p id="Par13">In recent years, desalination has gained more markets and is anticipated to continue gaining more markets in the upcoming years especially in MENA countries (Middle East and North Africa) (GWI 2004; Gorjian and Ghobadian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2015</xref>; Quteishat and Abu-Arabi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">2004</xref>).</p><p id="Par14">In a study conducted by Joyner Eke et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2020</xref>) regarding the latest state of desalination plants around the world, they state that there are about 16,876 desalination plants in operation, 270 plants under construction. There are 14,360 operating RO plants, which means that 85.1% of the current operational plants are accounted for by RO. Additionally, 247 plants out of the 270 plants under construction are RO plants. In 2020, the global installed desalination capacity was 97.2 million m<sup>3</sup>/day of freshwater production from desalination plants.</p><p id="Par15">The cost of energy is still responsible for the high cost of desalination in addition to the environmental impacts associated with using fossil fuels as the main energy source for desalination. Decreasing the cost of energy is essential to reduce the cost of desalination.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Different renewable energy types used for desalination</title><p id="Par16">Different renewable energy sources are available around the world. The main renewable energy sources used for desalination are solar, wind, wave, geothermal and blue energy — otherwise known as osmotic power. Another form of renewable energy that is emission-free is nuclear energy, but it suffers limited applications in the desalination sector due to issues of safety and waste disposal.</p><p id="Par17">The increase in utilising renewable energy in the desalination sector is depending on the progress in renewable energy technologies. The energy produced from renewable resources has increased about 5 times between 2005 and 2015, most of it through solar and wind resources. Solar energy is the most studied, particularly for the Middle East and North America. Among other sources of energy from renewable sources include geothermal, blue energy or salinity gradient power (SGP). Blue energy is extracted by controlled mixing of two saline solutions with different concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Utilisation of solar energy</title><p id="Par18">Among the renewable energies, solar energy is the most popular and widely used around the world. The main reason is that solar energy is available for free in the natural form of heat which can be used directly to desalinate and in even greater quantities. It is the most plentiful source available on the Earth, and also the cleanest. Arid areas often have a lot of potential for solar energy (Chauhan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2021</xref>). Solar energy can be converted to thermal energy or to electricity to run the high-pressure pump (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). One of the most reliable and widely used technologies used to harvest solar energy is photovoltaic (PV) systems. Photovoltaic technology has witnessed an increase in the number of photovoltaic systems being installed and a decrease in the costs of installation. The cumulative global solar photovoltaic capacity has continuously grown since 2000. In 2019, global cumulative solar PV capacity reached 633.7 GW, with 116.9 GW of new PV capacity installed in that same year. One major advantage of photovoltaic systems is that they come in a vast variety of sizes and complexities, from small-scale household systems to solar parks that can generate enough energy to power large facilities or a populated residential area. Photovoltaic (PV) driven reverse osmosis (RO) and thermal solar units have been used in some parts of the world (Esfahani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2016</xref>) with capacity ranging from 1 m<sup>3</sup> per day up to several hundred cubic meters per day. These units have a specific energy consumption (SEC) ranging from 2.4 to 17.9 kWh/m<sup>3</sup> and 0.9 to 29.1 kWh/m<sup>3</sup> for sea and brackish water, respectively (GCWDA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2015</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Reverse osmosis system powered with solar/wind-driven electrical energy (Greenlee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2009</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11356_2022_20480_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par19">In Dubai, a RO desalination project powered by solar energy has recently been launched. It produces about 30 m<sup>3</sup> of desalinated clean water per day and consumes 2.8 kW h/m<sup>3</sup> of the produced freshwater. Most RO units are coupled with photovoltaic modules for desalinating water (Herold and Neskakis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2001</xref>; Hrayshat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2008</xref>; Gocht et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">1998</xref>; Al and Nair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2000</xref>). The high cost of producing energy from renewable resources (especially the cost of photovoltaic cells) compared to conventional sources, in addition to limited operational hours, makes RO desalination. The use of renewable energy is still expensive (Hamed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2005</xref>). However, with the rapid development of renewable energy technologies, the cost is expected to be reduced and the cost of water production will eventually become lower.</p><p id="Par20">Batteries are needed in these units to store electricity and ensure that the power supply is continuous and regular. However, these batteries have the disadvantages of a short lifetime and require replacement; they lose power during charging and discharging, their efficiency declines with time, and their disposal causes environmental problems and, in turn, increases the cost of desalinated water.</p><p id="Par21">To exclude the use of batteries, energy regulation and variable flow should be considered. The energy and water flow can be adjusted accordingly with changes in solar sources. A study by Thomson and Infield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">2005</xref>) and Lee et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2016</xref>) showed the results of applying a change in flow rate to the RO unit.</p><p id="Par22">The authors indicated that the studied system has the advantages of good performance and cost reduction. Another RO prototype system powered by solar energy without batteries and with low energy impact was developed by Soric et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">2012</xref>); an important component is the energy regulator, which maintains enough energy to the RO system.</p><p id="Par23">The Rankin cycle concept has been introduced (Delgado-Torres and García-Rodríguez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2007a</xref>; Manolakos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2005</xref>; Peñate and Rodríguez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2012</xref>), to eliminate energy losses of energy due to conversion of thermal energy into electrical energy and to eliminate the use of storage batteries. The concept is to use solar collectors to evaporate the low-boiling liquid that drives the RO pump shaft. The system has been improved in terms of location, solar collectors and low boiling fluid used (Bruno et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2008</xref>; Nafey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2010</xref>).</p><p id="Par24">Another alternative that has been suggested is the integration of renewable-renewable and renewable conventional energy sources to keep working hours as long as possible or to support the renewable with conventional energy to reach optimum utilisation of RO desalination (Ramin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">2021</xref>, Cherif and Belhadj <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2011</xref>; Mohamed and Papadakis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2004</xref>). It should be said that the costs of the units of water are higher than those produced by RO driven by electrical energy. A recent study indicated that using hybrid photovoltaic batteries and power-to-gas power plants to power RO units will be able to meet the global needs of 2030 at water cost costs ranging from 0.59 to 2.81 €/m<sup>3</sup> (Caldera et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par25">A different technology is the integration of concentrated solar power with desalination (CSP-D). Solar irradiation is concentrated using mirrors onto a linear receiver, i.e. parabolic trough collectors (PTC), or a central receiver, i.e. solar tower (ST). In either case, the absorbed concentrated irradiation is then used to heat a heat transfer fluid (HTF) to drive a power block, usually a Rankine cycle. By design, this power block is relatively standard, so much of the same well-proven technology from fossil fuel power plants can be utilized (Amr et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2019</xref>). Because concentrated solar power (CSP) generates both heat and electricity, either or both can be used to control desalination processes. There is a great opportunity to better utilize the incident solar energy in a CSP plant since 80% of the solar energy harvested by the solar field is “labelled” as losses (Bishoyia and Sudhakara <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2017</xref>; Gandrud <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2017</xref>). The power block of a large-scale CSP plant will dump about 30% of its energy as waste heat into the environment through the steam condensers (Bishoyia and Sudhakara <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2017</xref>; Gandrud <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par26">Using this energy flow, a thermal desalination plant can partially (or even fully) replace the condenser. Electricity generated from the CSP plant can be used to power a pressure-driven desalination process, such as RO. In that case, the desalination process is simply another electrical load supplied by the CSP plant. Nevertheless, the main advantage of this option is that the electricity generated on-site is typically much cheaper, i.e. lower than the wholesale price (and much lower than the retail price) since it does not require transmission (Palenzuela et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2011</xref>). Although most of the studies attempt to drive the desalination system using the CSP’s waste heat, RO systems driven by grid electricity represent a well-developed technology that could readily be integrated with CSP plants. Studies have recently shown that CSP-D plants, if deployed, can bring a significant benefit to the electricity and water demands of arid regions. According to the study by Trieb et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">2002</xref>), a 200-MW CSP plant operating in Dubai was able to deliver 1.5 billion kWh/year of electricity, 60 million m<sup>3</sup>/year of freshwater, sufficient power for 250,000 people and a sufficient amount of freshwater for 50,000 people (Trieb et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">2002</xref>). In comparison to a conventional fossil-fuelled desalination plant, it is about 1.5 million tonnes of oil equivalent energy less to generate an equal amount of water per year (Kalogirou <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2005</xref>). Furthermore, with respect to The Paris Agreement, a CSP-D plant could reduce emissions by &gt; 300,000 t of equivalent CO<sub>2</sub> annually, compared to the conventional fossil-fuelled desalination plant (DEFRA 2005). Even though the technology readiness level of CSP-driven desalination technologies is still quite low, PV-RO systems are highly commercially adopted (Lamei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2008</xref>; Caldera et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2016</xref>; Bilton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2011</xref>; Childs et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1999</xref>; Shalaby <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">2017</xref>; Ali et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2018</xref>; Salcedo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2012</xref>).</p><p id="Par27">In recent years, much attention has been paid to improving large-scale desalination plants, but small desalination plants that are capable of providing freshwater and freshwater in rural areas have been neglected. Monjezi et al. (Manikandan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2020</xref>) presented a new way of combining solar photovoltaic thermal cells (PVT) for the reverse osmosis (RO), where seawater represents a cooling medium that improves the thermal effectiveness of solar energy production and increases the pace of freshwater generation. Adding the battery unit ensures a continual pace of freshwater supply, which leads to minimalisation of often occurring membrane fouling when using desalination units run by renewable energy. The integrative system was imitated in Alexandria, Egypt, for its possessions of seawater and climatic conditions. The results show that the proposed method leads to a depletion of 0.12 kWh/m<sup>3</sup> in the specific electricity consumption rate of RO desalination and also increases the electricity generation capacity of PVT cells, leading to a 6% reduction in the solar panel surface area.</p><p id="Par28">Another study focused on small-scale and portable solar-powered RO desalination plants was conducted by Manikanda et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2020</xref>). In this study, they have designed and modelled a portable desalination plant that uses solar energy for reverse osmosis (RO). Power is provided by a photovoltaic system that includes a storage battery. It is estimated that the entire need for energy anticipates the power supply, capacity of solar panels, storage systems and sizing of the charge controller.</p><p id="Par29">According to the study by Liponi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2020</xref>), fossil fuel usage prevails over solar energy at present, although solar energy utilisation plays a significant role in the desalination process in some dry areas where fuel transportation is more expensive. The practicality of the small-scale distillation plant also lies in the heat waste recovery system, which increases its value. The usage of the small capacity plant might decrease the expenses of the desalination and also increase its efficiency ratio in comparison with the large capacity plant.</p><p id="Par30">Comparative analysis shows that the overall performance of photovoltaic thermal coupled desalination systems is better than that of desalination systems coupled with a separate photovoltaic panel and/or solar thermal collector to meet the energy needs. The additional electricity generated from photovoltaic thermal desalination paves the way for standalone desalination in remote locations even though the initial costs are a little higher (Anand et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>The utilisation of wind energy for water desalination</title><p id="Par31">Wind power has attracted the attention of researchers. The project SDAWES (Seawater Desalination by an Autonomous Wind Energy System) has tested and analysed RO units that operate with wind power (Carta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2004</xref>). Desalination plants operated with wind power should be designed to respond to fast variation in the wind at different locations, which may cause regular shut-down and start-up operations.</p><p id="Par32">The operational analysis of an RO desalination plant that uses wind energy directly without energy storage placed on Canary Islands was provided by Carta et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2003</xref>), which is a wind farm that provides energy requirements to eight module desalination plants. They indicated that the average output and the standard of the generated water were found to be independent of an interrupted operation.</p><p id="Par33">It has been reported by Loutatidou et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2017</xref>) in the United Arab Emirates that wind-driven RO can compete with thermal desalination. The produced water quality, time spent within the safe operating window and the specific energy consumption (SEC) growth when an operational interruption is avoided when using a supercapacitor bank have also been described (Richards et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par34">Several ideas have been suggested to avoid energy interruption in the wind-driven RO units to provide a continuous water supply.

Some desalination units have been designed based on this principle, where the wave energy is absorbed by the converter, which directly transfers it to the RO arrangements. The effectiveness of converting wave energy is greater than the effectiveness of converting other types of renewable energy. The theoretical conversion efficiency for solar energy, as an example and based on best arrangements, does not exceed 87%, whereas for wave energy it is 100%, although the utilisation of wave energy is almost absent compared to solar and wind energies.</p><p id="Par36">Wave energy–based desalination across different parts of the world has been evaluated by Davis (Davies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2005</xref>). His evaluation showed that 1-m-high waves have the ability to operate a desalination plant to satisfy the irrigation requirement of a 0.8-km-width strip along a dry and sunny coastline, and if the wave is 2 m high, then the width of the coastline strip jumps to 5 km. He also indicated that wave-based desalination could reduce water deficiency by 16% in Morocco, 64% in Oman and 100% in Somalia.</p><p id="Par37">Much less attention has been devoted to wave energy compared to other renewable resources. A self-sustaining wave energy desalination plant has been reported by Sharmila et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2004</xref>). It is based on alternating pressurising and depressurising a column of air entrapped above a column of water by the action of waves. The pressurized air is then utilized to run a turbine and extract power. The power extracted is reported to run an RO plant that produces 10 m<sup>3</sup>/day of water.</p><p id="Par38">Folley et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2008</xref>), in a different study, studied the possibility of wave-powered RO desalination plant utilising a pressure exchanger-intensifier to recover energy. The idea is to use wave energy directly to compress the seawater without converting the wave energy to electrical energy. They found that an SEC (specific energy consumption) of less than 2 kW h/m<sup>3</sup> of desalinated water is feasible using their system with different seawaters, showing that it is economically and technically appropriate for desalination of seawater. If the recovery rate is kept at 25–35%, the specific energy consumption (SEC) comes down to 1.85 kW h/m<sup>3</sup> since there will be no need for pretreatment requirements and scaling problems will be reduced to wave-powered. It must be noted that the practical use of wave energy for the desalination process has so far been limited to laboratory cases. The mostly mentioned problem with the wave power is its fluctuation over time (like in the case of wind energy), which is a failure in the sustainability of these desalination units (Foteinis and Tsoutsos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2017</xref>; Burn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2015</xref>; Corsini et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2015</xref>). Wave-powered desalination is expected to receive more attention soon. A desalination pilot plant (DPP) based on wave power is installed on Garden Island, Australia. The device utilized is called CETO. This innovative system uses numerous buoys to exploit wave power to pump seawater into a RO unit to produce freshwater, in which the production capacity is 150 m<sup>3</sup>/day (Viola et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">2016</xref>).

(iv) Finding the associated technologies that match the low-level infrastructures present in most areas with severe water stress is not always possible; in many cases, applying desalination technologies in remote regions failed because of lack of qualified technical support (adapted from Mathioulakis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2007</xref>).</p><p id="Par57">Reverse osmosis (RO) and multistage flash (MSF) desalination account for about 80% of the world’s desalination capacity (Jones et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2019</xref>). In the Middle East (especially in the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia), MSF units are used extensively and account for approximately 40% of the world’s desalination capacity (Ettouney et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1999</xref>).</p><p id="Par58">Technically, RO and ED as well as photovoltaic (PV) technologies are currently commercially available technologies. The possibility of having PV-powered RO or ED desalination units in remote areas has been validated (MEDRC R&amp;D Report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2000</xref>). PV-powered desalination units are commercially available (Espino et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2003</xref>); the main drawbacks of these technologies are availability of the PV cells and the high capital cost. The problem with the early PV-RO desalination systems is the large PV array required mainly due to the poor efficiency of both the storage batteries and the RO units, which would increase the capital and also the maintenance cost, and in turn raised the cost of freshwater produced from such systems. As a result of the stressing water and energy problems today, desalination-based renewable energy appeared as a reasonable and technically mature option. Although there is a large amount of research conducted worldwide, installation of RES-based desalination systems is still low. Skills and expertise have been gained, and there are contentious attempts to install large-scale and effective RES-based desalination plants. This would be very important for developing countries that face water scarcity and do not have the means to conventional energy supply to power desalination plants.</p><p id="Par59">The most mature technologies of RES suitable for desalination are photovoltaic and wind-based membrane desalination and solar distillation.

Using regulating and storing facilities coupled with the wind turbines before passing the energy to the desalination unit is usually coupled with excessive capital and running costs and low efficiency; however, direct coupling of the desalination unit and the wind turbine is a more efficient, economical and simpler approach. The combination of photovoltaic energy with a wind generator was proposed to provide continuous power (Tzen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">2008</xref>) which is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Combination of solar energy with reverse osmosis desalination</title><p id="Par61">A 2012 study by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) indicated that the most predominant desalination technique on the market was reverse osmosis, reaching more than 60% of the total units commissioned (IEA 2013). Today, RO combined with solar energy is the most widely utilized technique to produce freshwater from seawater. This could be due to the fast progress in this technology which is considered one of the most efficient techniques for desalinating water with high salt concentrations (above 35,000 ppm) (Ali et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2018</xref>).

In a recent study, it is shown that thermal desalination is still used largely to produce freshwater, then comes photovoltaic-based membrane desalination (Shahzad et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">2017</xref>). The intermittent nature of the solar energy is the main drawback in its wide range application (Mito et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2019</xref>). Until recently, about 130 renewable power desalination plants supply only 1% of the total desalination capacity of the world.</p><p id="Par66">Photovoltaic arrays (PV) combined with RO membranes are the arrangement which is utilized most in solar energy-based RO desalination. This is probably because photovoltaic arrays were the first commercialized technology for harvesting solar energy. In PV-RO, the electrical current produced by semiconductors of the solar cells is utilized to power the pumps, which produce the required pressure to force the feed water to penetrate the RO membranes. PV-RO systems are used for desalting water at an economical cost and with lower environmental impacts. The modular nature and easy operation of PV-RO systems also result in their suitability for decentralized and decentralized applications (Alhaj and Al-Ghamdi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par67">In spite of the improvements in the PV technology recently, the efficiencies of sun ray conversion of PV units is still low, hardly exceeding 15–16% (Goetzberger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2003</xref>), and the commercial price of PV units is very high, causing the cost to be a limiting factor in the economical evaluation of PV-RO desalination. PV-RO was utilized in many countries for desalinating both brackish and seawater, but the capacity of such units is small (Bouguecha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2005</xref>; Joyce et al. 2001; Richards and Schäfer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">2003</xref>), and in spite of the much-gained experience since 1978 (Petersen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">1979</xref>), no standard design has been achieved, but some components are common to all PV-RO desalination set-ups (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Simple general scheme of a photovoltaic reverse osmosis (PV-RO) desalination plant.

Fixed modules are positioned at a constant angle, while modules with adaptable axes can be positioned according to seasonal variations, or if a drive motor and tracking system are installed, the module will follow the daily path of the sun in the sky automatically. Both multicrystalline and monocrystalline silicon modules were utilized in experimental systems.</p><p id="Par69">In Saudi Arabia, a PV-RO desalination plant increased the yearly permeate flow from 15 to 17 m3 day<sup>−1</sup> when seasonal optimum tilt angle variation was utilized (Alawaji et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1995</xref>).

However, the high cost of tracking systems has limited their wide use in PV-RO systems.

Methods for cost estimation, such as DEEP and WT-Cost software, show similar unit costs $0.99/m<sup>3</sup> and $0.96/m<sup>3</sup>. Capital cost always shows variation between published and estimated due to differences in interest rates, design and local conditions, etc. Unit cost can be reduced by reducing costs of labour and performing the periodic maintenances.

A comparison of different combinations of renewable desalination has been done for a plant capacity of 500 m<sup>3</sup> (Koroneos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2007</xref>).

This was in favour of ROPV and MED-Solar systems with costs of $2.119/m<sup>3</sup> and $2.282/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively. For desalination, the most used source of renewable energy is solar photovoltaic (PV), representing approximately 43% of the total capacity; the following source is solar, thermal and after that wind energy (ADIRA 2008).

Renewable energy–coupled desalination is emerging as a potential solution to oil depletion and environmental concerns; however, the sector is facing two problems, the large amount of energy required and difficulties in storing the energy for off-peak periods. Currently, reverse osmosis is the most favoured and the least energy-consuming desalination technique, mainly combined with solar energy, then we have more problems, mainly high capital cost (especially the cost of the PV panels and the tracking systems), low conversion efficiencies, intermittent nature of the resource and low production of freshwater.
