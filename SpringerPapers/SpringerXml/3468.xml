Deposition of Solution-free perovskite (SFP) layer is a key method for deposition of perovskite layer on the hole or electron transport layers that are strongly sensitive to perovskite precursors. Using deposition of SFP layer in the perovskite solar cells would extend possibility of using many electron and hole transport materials in both normal and invert architectures of perovskite solar cells. In the present work, we synthesized crystalline perovskite powder followed by successful deposition on TiO<sub>2</sub> and cuprous iodide as the non-sensitve and sensitive charge transport layers to PbI<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>I solution in DMF. The post compressing step enhanced the efficiency of the devices by increasing the interface area between perovskite and charge transport layers. The 9.07% and 7.71% cell efficiencies of the device prepared by SFP layer was achieved in respective normal (using TiO<sub>2</sub> as a deposition substrate) and inverted structure (using CuI as deposition substrate) of perovskite solar cell. This method can be efficient in large-scale and low cost fabrication of new generation perovskite solar cells.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>21028</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>9</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>19</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep33649.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>14</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep33649" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep33649</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Organometal halide perovskite solar cells attracted much attention within the last five years because of their interesting photovoltaic properties. Many reports introduced numerous advantages of organometal halide perovskite materials such as broad range of light absorption, covering the visible to near infrared spectrum with high extinction coefficient (~10<sup>4 </sup>cm<sup>−1</sup> at 550 nm) and long diffusion length around 1 μm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. To date, the certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the perovskite solar cells is 20.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. A variety of device architectures and perovskite deposition methods were introduced to enhance the perovskite solar cells properties. Deposition of perovskite layer is among the most important steps to reach high-efficiency solar cells. A large number of attempts have been conducted to reach a uniform and modified perovskite layer to decrease the carriers recombination and lengthy electrons and holes life-time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Generally, deposition of perovskite layer is classified into two one-step<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and two-step<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> chemical and physical sequential methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. As reported, deposition methods of perovskite layers result in various morphologies and thicknesses that strongly affect the cell performance and parameters. It was declared that formation of pinhole-free perovskite layers considerably improves the cell parameters, especially the open circuit voltage and fill factor, because of high recombination rate in the interface of electron and hole transport materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Hence, many attempts were undertaken to reach pinhole-free perovskite layers including solution engineering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, vapor assisted solution process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, two-source vapor deposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, solvent-solvent extraction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, blow-drying process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and a solid state chemistry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Since deposition of perovskite layers by vacuum technique involves high production costs, deposition of perovskite layers by chemical routes attracted much attention because of the ease of fabrication and low costs involved. In this regard, spin coating is considered as the most common deposition method for perovskite layers. However, despite resulting in thin and uniform layers, this method would not be a good candidate for scale-up due to its limitations in large area deposition. As discussed, except physical deposition of perovskite that requires high vacuum condition, almost all reported chemical methods in deposition of perovskite layers including one- and two-step approaches are conducted by dissolving the precursors of metal halides and/or methylammonium halides to form the perovskite layer. In fabrication of normal and invert perovskite solar cells by sensitive electron transfer materials (ETMs) or hole transfer materials (HTMs) such as cuprous iodide, there are some limitations resulting in corrosion during deposition of perovskite on the carrier extraction layers. Hence, removal of the solution base methods would receive much attention in fabrication of sensitive based HTMs and ETMs.</p><p>In this work, we introduced a new perovskite deposition approach that is quite appropriate and noncorrosive on sensitive HTM and ETM layers. Deposition of perovskite layer was conducted in solar cell by spray coating of the as prepared perovskite powder suspension on TiO<sub>2</sub> compact layer followed by hot compressing the spray-coated perovskite. To investigate the corrosive impact of reported method on deposition of perovskite layer, the perovskite powder suspension was sprayed and compressed on the cuprous iodide layer to fabricate the FTO/CuI/SFP/PCBM/Al device. Deposition of the SFP would be suitable for spray coating, spin coating, blade coating and printing. According to the fact that spray coating is a potential deposition method for large area and continuous deposition, we fabricated the perovskite solar cell devices by spray coating of SFP in various spray coating passes for reaching the optimum surface coverage of perovskite layer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Photo-charge Transport and Device Preparation</title><p>Eliminating the need for dissolving perovskite precursors in an appropriate solvent, which is commonly water absorber even at the low moisture ambient atmosphere, would attract much attention in fabrication of perovskite solar cells. Besides, reaching a uniform perovskite layer and a good contact between perovskite and ETM or HTM layers would indicate the great photovoltaic properties in the perovskite solar cells. Hence, these two parameters should be considered in deposition of SFP layer. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref> shows the schematic and band diagram of the prepared device in the normal structure of FTO/TiO<sub>2</sub>/SFP/spiro-OMeTAD/Au.

During the ball milling, simultaneous to grinding the perovskite particles to finer particles, the probable remained lead iodide content in the gross perovskite core is transferred into the perovskite structure. Thus, the total conversion of lead iodide to perovskite structure is completed, while the perovskite particles are ground to smaller particles for better surface coverage and reaching lower thickness during the spray coating.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>SFP Preparation and Deposition</title><p>The optimum grain size distribution was obtained through the preparation of device with various grain size distributions. The various perovskite particles distribution reached in different ball milling times. Several spray passes were performed to reach the optimum device performance. As shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, the prepared perovskite particle suspension shows long-term stability for frequent spray coating. Besides, the spray-coated layers in various spray passes of 10, 20 and 30 present almost good surface coating quality and better surface coverage by increasing the spray passes (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). As previously reported for two-step deposition microstructure enhancement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, hot pressing as a post-treatment process increases the contact area of perovskite and TiO<sub>2</sub> layer and prevents reaching the HTM to ETM layer. Accordingly, the hot pressing was performed in the present work for enhancing the spray coated SFP. In this technique, as-sprayed perovskite particles are compressed by the smooth Teflon sheets, leading to regulating the surface uniformity and squishing the perovskite particles on the TiO<sub>2</sub> substrate by a diffusion mechanism of atoms under hot pressing. This two-step deposition mechanism avoids the need of dissolving the perovskite precursors in the strong solvent that also considerably affect some substrates such as CuI and Cu<sub>2</sub>O.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Prepared SFP suspension (<bold>a</bold>), deposited SFP on the TiO<sub>2</sub> at different spray passes (<bold>b</bold>), conventional one step spin coating of perovskite (route 1) and deposited SFP on CuI at spray passes of 20 (route 2) (<bold>c</bold>) and XRD patterns of bare CuI and CuI/SFP layers (<bold>d</bold>), schematic of synthesizing and deposition process of SFP layer (<bold>e</bold>) and size distribution of the perovskite particles before and after ball milling for 6 hours at 250 rpm monitored by DLS with the number averaged (<bold>f</bold>).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep33649_Fig2_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p><xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref> shows deterioration of the CuI sublayer by spin coating of 1:1 PbI<sub>2</sub>:CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>I solution in DMF (route 1), through which cuprous iodide shows notable corrosion sensitivity, while deposition of SFP on the CuI thin film by spray coating does not affect the CuI microstructure or forming other kinds of interphase structures (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>).

Hence, enhancement in better interface connection between perovskite particles and electron transport layer would improve the carrier transferring and lower charge recombination in the device, which was shown in the J-V study of the device under dark condition (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). The lower recombination of carriers in the compressed perovskite layer can be attributed to the decline of recombination between spiro-OMeTAD and TiO<sub>2</sub> because of decreasing the contacting surface of spiro-OMeTAD and TiO<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> and also the recombination of generated carriers in the perovskite grains through decreasing the thickness of perovskite particles and grains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. As shown in the <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>, the prepared perovskite solar cells by present method still show lower V<sub>oc</sub> and FF than prepared device by spin coating of perovskite layer, probably because of higher recombination in the TiO<sub>2</sub>/SFP and TiO<sub>2</sub>/spiro-OMeTAD interfaces. It is noteworthy that the perovskite thickness in both devices was almost the same. In addition, the lower current density of prepared device by SFP may be justified by higher resistance in the interface of perovskite and TiO<sub>2</sub> layer. The photovoltage decay study of the device confirms the higher charge lifetime in the compressed perovskite solar cells (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>, the transferred electron and holes, show more possibility of recombine in the interface of spiro-OMeTAD and TiO<sub>2</sub> layer, while by compressing the deposited perovskite particles on the TiO<sub>2</sub> layer, because of better surface coverage by squished perovskite particles, there would be a lower possibility in recombination of transferred carriers. To study the adhesion effect, in addition to V<sub>oc</sub> decay and dark J-V analysis, we added the EIS analysis. As shown in the <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>, the as-deposited SFP layer by spray coating shows weaker carrier recombination resistance compare to compressed SFP layer. Compression the SFP layer provides higher charge recombination resistance due to better interface contact between SFP particles and TiO<sub>2</sub> substrates and fewer pinholes in the perovskite layer.</p><p><xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> shows the photovoltaic parameters of perovskite solar cells prepared by various spray coating passes of perovskite solution. As shown in the figure, by increasing the spray coating passes followed by hot compressing up to 20 passes, the current density considerably increases. This behavior can be described by the increase in perovskite content and the better contacting between perovskite particles and TiO<sub>2</sub> compact layer. Moreover, the open circuit voltage and fill factor of the prepared device is improved because of better surface coverage by compressed perovskite particles by which the recombination sites in the interface of spiro-OMeTAD and TiO<sub>2</sub> are reduced. At the higher spray passes, thicker perovskite layers are reached through which due to long diffusion path, higher recombination possibility in the perovskite layer is observed. The statistic data of the prepared devices is shown in Figure S3. As shown in the figure, the prepared devices shows good reproducibility. The present reproducibility of devices would attract much attention in scaling up the perovskite solar cells fabrication.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Spray coating passes dependence of SFP layer on device performance parameters.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep33649_Fig6_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Optimized Hot-pressed SFP Morphology</title><p>As shown in <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a,b</xref>, the 20 passes of perovskite particles spraying provides good surface coverage by which the compressing step unifies the surface of the perovskite to an almost smooth and lower pinholed perovskite layer (<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c,d</xref>).

As shown in the <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8a</xref>, increasing the compression pressure up to 0.5 MPa decreases the thickness of as-sprayed SFP layer to 400 nm while further increase in compression pressure up to 0.7 MPa did not change the thickness of perovskite layer considerably. It is worthy to note that under higher compression pressure of 0.9 MPa, the quartz substrate could not tolerate the pressure because of its brittle characteristic. The PCE of the compressed perovskite layers efficiently raised by increasing the compression pressure which come from improving the perovskite uniformity causing lower charge recombination due to fewer pinholes in perovskite layer and better contacting of perovskite particles with substrate layer. To study the compression time effect on perovskite layer thickness and PCE, compressing the as-sprayed SFP layer under 0.5 MPa pressure for different times of 0 to 5 hours were investigated (<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8b</xref>). Compressing the as-sprayed perovskite layer for 1 hour considerably decreased the perovskite thickness up to 580 nm showing 74% enhancement in PCE. Further compression up to 3 hours dramatically dropped the perovskite thickness to 400 nm showing 9.07% PCE. Compression the perovskite layer up to 4 hours did not affect the perovskite thickness and PCE of the devices. By further compression up to 5 hours, despite no considerable change in thickness of perovskite layer, the PCE and V<sub>oc</sub> of the devices began to decrease probably due to higher generated defects in the interface of perovskite and TiO<sub>2</sub> layers, which would, led to higher recombination.

The lower resistivity of cuprous iodide would potentially incline the current density of fabricated device. As observed in the present work, the devices fabricated by employing cuprous iodide and spiro-OMeTAD as the respective inorganic and organic HTMs with the same perovskite preparation method showed different current densities (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs 5</xref> and <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9a</xref>).

As shown in <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9a</xref>, compressing the perovskite particles on the cuprous iodide layer considerably increases the open circuit voltage and fill factor because of better surface coverage and the drop in a number of recombination sites in the interface of CuI and PCBM layers.

Respective 6.7% and 14.2% difference in PCE of the devices in different scan directions was observed in devices prepared via as-spray deposited SFP and compressed perovskite particles (<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10a,b</xref>). Despite higher efficiency of devices with compressed SFP layers, the observed hysteresis is larger in comparison to as-sprayed SFP layers. In the compressed PSCs despite the uniform perovskite layer and lower pinhole structure than as-sprayed SFP layer, the hysteresis is much considerable which may come from other reasons than pinholes. According to the fact that one of probable reason in the hysteresis effect is trapping and detrapping the transporting carriers, we studied the defects effect in the perovskite solar cells. Compressing is a mechanical treatment, which may cause too many structural defects in the compressed layers. Hence, declining the generated defects in the compressed perovskite layer can enhance the carrier transportation behavior. Heat treatment is one of well-known method in decreasing the defects. Accordingly, a set of heat treatment processes was designed to study the hysteresis of device. After hot pressing which was conducted at 0.5 MPa and 120 °C for 3 h, the compressed SFP layers were annealed at 130 °C in nitrogen atmosphere for 10 and 20 minutes under no compression pressure. As shown in the <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10c</xref>, heat treatment of SFP layers for 10 minutes decreases the hysteresis of devices up to 48%. This means, under no pressing, by heat treatment of the layers, the generated defects in the perovskite structure and in the perovskite/TiO<sub>2</sub> interface decreases, which results in declining the hysteresis in perovskite solar cells. Further annealing up to 20 minutes slightly decreases the cell efficiency in both backward and forward scan directions probably because of slight degradation of perovskite layer in the TiO<sub>2</sub> and perovskite interface.<fig id="Fig10"><label>Figure 10</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>J-V curves of devices prepared with SFP before (<bold>a</bold>) and after (<bold>b</bold>) compression in normal devise structure of FTO/TiO<sub>2</sub>/SFP/spiro-OMeTAD/Au for the scan directions of forward bias to short circuit (FB-SC) and short circuit to forward bias (SC-FB) and effect of different post annealing times of 0, 10 and 20 minutes at 130 °C on device hysteresis (<bold>c</bold>).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep33649_Fig10_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Optical Study</title><p>To investigate the optical properties of perovskite layer deposited by spray coating followed by hot pressing, UV-vis spectroscopy of deposited layers on the glass substrate was conducted and compared to the spin coated perovskite by 1:1 molar ratio of PbI<sub>2</sub>:MA in DMF. The perovskite prepared by both methods was adjusted to yield the same thickness of 400 nm. As shown in <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11a</xref>, by compressing the inhomogeneous spray coated perovskite particles to a smoother and thinner perovskite layer, the absorption of perovskite layers increased because of the higher absorbed portion of light by compressed perovskite layer. As shown in the schematic of charge transferring and recombination states in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>, by compression of perovskite particles and spreading on the substrate surface, which results in decreasing the thickness and increasing the grain size of perovskite layer, a higher portion of substrate will be covered by perovskite materials, leading to absorption of a higher portion of light. Hence, as depicted in <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11a</xref>, the particle coverage would play a considerable role in increasing the light absorption in perovskite with thickness above 400 nm. The spin coating of the perovskite layer through the one-step deposition shows almost same optical properties but lower absorbance probably due to the different perovskite morphologies than two-step deposition of perovskite in the present work. Thus, using spray coating of perovskite particles followed by hot pressing would be an appropriate method in deposition of perovskite layer with better surface coverage as it is proposed as a key method in deposition of perovskite layer on the sensitive substrate such as CuI and Cu<sub>2</sub>O.<fig id="Fig11"><label>Figure 11</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Absorbance spectra of SFP with and without compression compared to spin coated perovskite layer (<bold>a</bold>) and photoluminescence study of SFP with and without compression on glass, TiO<sub>2</sub> and spiro-OMeTAD on SFP.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep33649_Fig11_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>Perovskite layer on an inert substrate shows a strong luminescence at 773 nm, depicting a narrow band gap of 1.5 eV.

The produced layers then were compressed to reach a better surface coverage and contacting to sublayer. Therefore, presence of no solvent in dissolution of the perovskite precursors removes the possibility of perovskite hydration or decomposition and opens a new approach to deposition of perovskite layers on the sensitive sublayers, which may be affected by perovskite solutions. Besides, this technique may receive much attention in fabrication of commercial perovskite solar cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Preparation substrate and compact layer</title><p>FTO-coated glass substrates were patterned by Zn powder and 2M HCl solution etching.
