</title><sec><p id="Par1">This review gives concise information on green technology (GT) and Industrial Revolution 4.0 (IR 4.0). Climate change has begun showing its impacts on the environment, and the change is real. The devastating COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected lives and the world from the deadly consequences at a social, economic, and environmental level. In order to balance this crisis, there is a need to transition toward green, sustainable forms of living and practices. We need green innovative technologies (GTI) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to develop green, durable, biodegradable, and eco-friendly products for a sustainable future. GTI encompasses all innovations that contribute to developing significant products, services, or processes that lower environmental harm, impact, and worsening while augmenting natural resource utilization. Sensors are typically used in IoT environmental monitoring applications to aid ecological safety by nursing air or water quality, atmospheric or soil conditions, and even monitoring species’ movements and habitats. The industries and the governments are working together, have come up with solutions—the Green New Deal, carbon pricing, use of bio-based products as biopesticides, in biopharmaceuticals, green building materials, bio-based membrane filters for removing pollutants, bioenergy, biofuels and are essential for the green recovery of world economies. Environmental biotechnology, Green Chemical Engineering, more bio-based materials to separate pollutants, and product engineering of advanced materials and environmental economies are discussed here to pave the way toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the UN and achieve the much-needed IR 4.0 for a greener-balanced environment and a sustainable future.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"

climate change and amid the COVID-19 pandemic, a realization has dawned upon the world to protect the planet and people’s health. The pandemic has affected many social, economic, political, and environmental challenges (McNeely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2021</xref>). There is a clear awareness about global environmental issues like global warming, acid rain, ozone layer depletion, the increasing list of endangered species, and incidences of forest fires in the Amazon. There have also been several protocols and agreements signed by the world’s governments, like the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement. However, even till now, proper actions have not been taken, and the governments have also not been able to engage people to follow and practice environmentally friendly habits daily.</p><p id="Par4">Nevertheless, scientists have been relentlessly working to find solutions to create a sustainable future for the coming generations and save and conserve the environment. They are coming up with the latest innovations in GT, which can help industries find alternative and sustainable ways of disposing of waste and use more bio-based advanced materials for cheap, safe, and eco-friendly products. GT is a broad word that applies science and technology to lessen human impacts on the environment. Energy, atmospheric science, agriculture, material science, and hydrology are all areas of scientific inquiry covered by GT (Fu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2021a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">b</xref>). Several GTs strive to combat climate change by minimizing carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and other greenhouse gas emissions. Solar power is one of the most effective GTs. In many countries, it is currently cheaper to install than fossil fuels. GT can be supported by investing in stocks, mutual funds, and bonds that support ecologically friendly technology (Hou and Wang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">The world has already witnessed three industrial revolutions (IRs), having significant impacts (Dogaru <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2020</xref>). The 1st IR dealt with mechanical processes using water and steam for the mass production of textiles and metals. The 2nd IR dealt with the concept of industries, and here, the use of electricity, oil, and gas took place; the steel and synthetic industries became established with new communication and transport systems. The 3rd IR dealt with new nuclear energy and automation (Dogaru <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2020</xref>). However, most of these revolutions had enormous consequences on the environment. They caused much damage and harm to the planet and human lives. Hence, the IR 4.0 is a viable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly approach to manufacturing, using renewable resources and recyclable bio-based materials (Carvalho et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2018</xref>; Dogaru <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2020</xref>). This revolution is necessary for the green recovery post-COVID-19 in terms of the green economy. Governments have taken steps to reduce carbon and other greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, price the carbon externalities, and increase renewable energy resources like solar and wind energy (McNeely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2021</xref>). Nanotechnology has also been a significant contributor to GT, helping alleviate problems related to the agricultural, medical, food sectors, etc. (Bahrulolum et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2021</xref>). Nanoparticles can help develop biopesticides to improve crop production and enhance organic, eco-friendly farming methods (Bahrulolum et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2021</xref>). Nanomaterials, which are bio-based like nanocrystalline starch, lignin, and cellulose, can help improve the bioavailability of drugs and other nutrient supplements (Kou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">This review paper provides an opportunity to understand how to formulate and execute sustainable, eco-friendly goals at a social, economic, and environmental level. This includes—(i) a brief introduction to the global environmental concerns; (ii) in depth detail of environmental biotechnology, genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and their applications in bioremediation, biopesticides and more; (iii) methods of proper management of waste and polluted air treatment using renewable and nonrenewable energy resources with more focus on bioenergy and biofuels; (iv) study of renewable biomass-derived carbonaceous materials like cellulose, nanocellulose, chitosan, lignocellulosic residues and how using chemical engineering techniques can make sustainable, highly useful and eco-friendly products; (v) understanding the interaction of pollutants with the environment during separation processes using bio-based adsorbents, hydrogels, and membrane filters; (vi) in-depth information on production engineering and the types of bio-based advanced materials and processes; (vii) understanding process system engineering, the goals and the current research on IR 4.0 and how it can be made into a reality, and lastly; (viii) detailed understanding of environmental/green economies, how the post COVID-19 pandemic has led to more research and paved the way toward the green transition, the Green New Deal for a sustainable world, how can the governments price carbon externalities, how can an individual, community, industry, country, and the world shift toward sustainable transitions in their lifestyle, practices like green entrepreneurship, green housing, green chemistry, and understanding the critical concepts of ecological modernization, de-growth, and more. Understanding why people adopt GTs in different ways is crucial. Regardless of what we know about the elements that influence adoption, the willingness to accept new GT remains low. Cognitive, goal-oriented hope can help people adopt GTs sooner. Unlike socioeconomic variables, which are difficult to modify, legislation and education can influence levels of hope and motivation (Bukchin and Kerret <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Environmental biotechnology</title><p id="Par7">Climate is a mind-boggling combination of physical and natural environmental elements, including ecological issues like global warming, ozone layer depletion, biodiversity loss, exhaustion of regular assets, overpopulation. Presently, natural issues make us defenseless against tragedies and catastrophes. Biotechnology combines engineering design to utilize cells and molecular analogs for substances and their administrations. Carbon emission efficiency is essential for tracking progress toward carbon emission reduction goals. The link between GT innovation and carbon emission efficiency has not been well investigated, and the transmission mechanism is unknown (Dong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2022</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">Environmental biotechnology is an arising innovation regarding ecological insurance since quick industrialization, urbanization, and advancements have undermined clean climate and exhausted standard assets (Gavrilescu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2010</xref>). It tends to be considered the main thrust for coordinated environmental conservation, prompting a maintainable turn of events. Sustainable development characterizes progress in human prosperity that can be broadened or delayed over time. It requires a system for coordinating ecological arrangements and advancement procedures worldwide (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) (Singh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">2017</xref>) (Gavrilescu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2010</xref>). Green supply chains are logistical frameworks that ensure the environmentally friendly manufacturing and delivery of items worldwide. Companies must engage in the design and planning optimization of their logistic systems to reach this aim while considering the trade-off between earnings and environmental implications (Pinto-Varela et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2011</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Green supply chain management (GSCM) refers to incorporating environmental considerations into supply chain management, including product design, material sourcing and selection, manufacturing, final product delivery, and product end-of-life management.

The generated wastes should be dealt with appropriately before arranging the climate. Biotechnology’s devices and strategies have given a new impulse and opened new vistas in contamination control. Biosensors assume a fundamental part in distinguishing the toxins even at exceptionally low focuses on evaluating the danger level. The industry is the primary source of pollution in the environment. Industrialists must become aware of their environmental responsibilities in the new era. They should be ecologically conscious even if they are chief manufacturers (Mondejar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2021</xref>; Lamba et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par10">Modern handling commonly elaborates adversities like pH, temperature, and high pressure requiring high energy input, while microorganisms and catalysts ordinarily catalyze a similar cycle in mild conditions (Sharma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2017</xref>). A broader and clear idea can be obtained by understanding the correlation between GT types with IR 4.0. Understanding the exact mechanisms of technologies like sunlight transport, plastic roads, plant walls, milk textiles, plant-based packaging, building-integrated photovoltaics can display their relation to IR 4.0 (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The correlation between types of GT with IR 4.0 including Sunlight Transport, plastic roads, plant walls, milk textiles, plant-based packaging, and building-integrated photovoltaics

Biosorption is the physiochemical process in which the liquid phase (solvent) and solid phase (biosorbent) are involved in separating dissolved species by adsorption, precipitation, absorption, ion exchange, and surface complexation method. Biosorption is mainly used to eliminate heavy metals and is considered 1/10 times cheaper than the ion-exchange process. The merits of the biosorption strategy to get rid of pollutants are cost efficiency, process selectiveness, easy regeneration of biosorbent, no sludge formation, easy recovery of metals, efficient performance, feasible operational conditions, no additional nutrients required, inexpensive technology, and flexibility of operation is used to remove many pollutants (Senthil Kumar and Grace Pavithra <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">2018</xref>). The use of both living and dead biomasses of bacteria, fungi, and algae is beneficial for biosorption. Agro-waste materials are also used as biosorbents because of their excellent surface characteristics, widespread availability, and low cost.

The main components of this field include designing and developing a particular product, this can either be a software-related, electronic, or mechanical development of the product, doing quality and reliable testing along with deciding the cost, features, and intended lifespan of the product and transitioning the product to manufacturing level by ramping up the production to volumes, for the market. However, nowadays, more and more engineers are focusing on the sustainable production of devices and products to shift the mindset from carbon-associated growth and clean up after pollution caused to ways in tackling the by-products by either recycling them or destroying them in sustainable processes before starting the manufacturing again. They are more interested in harnessing natural and renewable resources and increasing their usage in the production areas, especially in packaging and using advanced materials that are not toxic to the environment and are biodegradable. The SDGs given by the United Nations can be a very effective manner for engineers and scientists to develop green chemistry technology and use them to create eco-friendly and recyclable advanced materials. These materials can either be derived from nature, such as cellulose, lignin, and sugarcane, or can be developed from waste materials recycled in wastewater, food, and other bio-based industries (Kobayashi and Nakajima <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2021</xref>). Following is the list of advanced materials and processes that can be utilized sustainably to create a better human life and a balanced and safe environment.</p><sec id="Sec26"><title>Advanced oxidation processes (AOP)</title><p id="Par49">The AOP is a chemical technique for removing organic pollutants such as dyes, antibiotics, and other toxic pollutants from the wastewater. The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, superoxide, and hydroxyl group radicals will help oxidize the toxic pollutants to less toxic or nonhazardous substances like CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, and mineral acids (Theerthagiri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">2021</xref>). Many processes can be used here—Ozonation, photocatalysis, sonolysis, photolysis, Fenton reaction, electrochemical reactions, and more. These help in the efficient removal of organic pollutants, but it has certain limitations in developing the semiconductor catalysts and lengthy procedures, especially in the case of photocatalysis. Many 2D semiconductor materials are of great interest to scientists. They play a significant role in efficient bioremediation and have exceptional properties. The materials include graphene, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>), transition metal chalcogenides, carbides, phosphines, and metal oxides such as TiO<sub>2</sub>, ZnO, composites, and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). Some of their properties include a large surface area, high conductivity, excellent mechanical properties, which help make the material surface more durable and stable and reduce electron and photon recombination, thereby helping ineffective separation of the free radicals (Theerthagiri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par50">The best practical method of removing toxic organic products, like azo dyes chemical solvents (Azimi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2021</xref>), is by using sonophotocatalysis. This is a hybrid of 2 AOPs, i.e., sonolysis and photocatalysis. This combination can efficiently degrade these pollutants using ultrasound waves to produce cavity bubbles, activate the semiconductor material catalysts, and remove the toxic contaminants. These waves of about 20 kHz to 2 MHz led to cavitation. They helped continuously clean the material surface and helped to degrade both hydrophobic and hydrophilic organic pollutants. This is one of the very effective techniques in reusing the process repetitively with less maintenance and help in wastewater treatments (Theerthagiri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Cellulose and nanocellulose</title><p id="Par51">Cellulose is a polysaccharide of <inline-formula id="IEq1"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq1_Math"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq1_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Cellulose is high environmental-friendly material; there is wide availability, low cost, biodegradable, and renewable (Tu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">2021</xref>; Yang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">2021b</xref>). They are a perfect substitute for petroleum-synthesized plastics and can replace plastics in the long run since there is already an industry present and matured over the past 100 years and currently used to produce viscose, cuprammonium rayon, and more, which make use of certain toxic chemicals for its effective use (Tu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">2021</xref>). However, these chemicals can be replaced by specific cellulose properties and fiber structures. Yang et al. explained this with the concept of how tall trees stay upright. The wood from within consists of cellulose elementary fibrils or microfibrils, which strongly reinforce the cellulose nanofibrils to keep the upright structure of the tree and prevent it from falling. Cellulose nanofibers are formed by highly crystalline nanoscale fibrils (nanofibrils) and combine to form cellulose nanocrystals. These have a high aspect ratio and are flexible (Yang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">2021b</xref>). These nanocellulose materials are seven times stronger but five times lighter than steel. The hydroxyl grouping on the surface of cellulose can help combine with hydrogen bonding to form much nanocellulosic material interaction and increase the material performance and durability. Based on the number of hydroxyl groups on the surface, the mechanical and physical properties must be changed via many surfaces and intersurface engineering methods, both chemical and nonchemical. This can lead to novel functionalities and have various practical applications in structural, optical/electronic, phototonic, textiles, energy storage, and medical applications (Tu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">2021</xref>; Yang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">2021b</xref>). Studies are also being conducted to develop green cellulose solvents and regenerated cellulose materials of high strength through the bottom-up route (Tu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">2021</xref>). Nanocellulose-based aerogels form porous templates and are suitable for packaging applications instead of polystyrene-based packaging foams. They also have good water absorption, selective separation ability, CO<sub>2</sub> capture, and conductivity. Another one is nanocellulose films, which have very high water vapor absorption capacity and low oxygen permeability and can be used instead of plastic cling wraps for day-to-day food packaging.

</p><p id="Par53">Li-CO<sub>2</sub> batteries (LIBs) came into existence after agreements and protocols like the Kyoto Protocol, the United Nations SDGs, and the Paris Agreement. This led to many countries finding alternative ways to curb CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and create a more carbon-low or carbon–neutral society. These clean storage technologies help electric power sectors decarbonize along with GT like electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage systems (Tabelin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">2021</xref>). Compared to other rechargeable batteries, LIBs store more energy per unit mass. Lithium is known as white gold. It has varied applications from the manufacturing industry like lubricants, polymers, rechargeable batteries, and medicine to treat mental disorders (Tabelin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">2021</xref>). LIBs were costly earlier but are now made by lithium-intercalation using graphite anodes.

However, they were not studied in that much detail compared to Li-ion batteries. However, scientists are now looking for an appropriate anode material and find hard carbon (HC) to be a promising material since it has an excellent sodium-storage capacity, good recycling stability, and is a naturally available material (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">2021c</xref>). With such anode materials, Na-ion batteries (SIBs) can slowly be used as an alternative to lithium-ion batteries despite having less energy than LIBs but a safer and better battery than lead-acid batteries (Palaniselvam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Biodegradable materials</title><p id="Par55">Nonbiodegradable plastic waste has become a significant pollutant in our water bodies like the rivers and seas.

Scientists have entirely focused on the use of biodegradable materials like starch, cellulose, chitosan, biomass, resins, gums, jute, gelatin, pectin, waxes, and inorganic compounds like TiO<sub>2</sub>, ZnO, chalcogenides, and ways to incorporate eco-friendly and sustainable habits from using jute or cloth bags for daily grocery shopping to high-production packaging using biodegradable films made of cornstarch and chitosan in industries. Electronic devices made of renewable or biodegradable materials that disintegrate into harmless by-products are becoming increasingly popular. Low-energy, low-cost procedures including low/nontoxic functional materials or solvents are required to construct such “green” electronic devices on an industrial scale (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par56">Biodegradable films made of cornstarch and chitosan with poloxamer F127 are very durable films with good moisture barrier properties.

In the USA, officials had to stop all recycling activities due to the fear of spreading the virus among the workers (Irfan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2021</xref>). A significant change was observed during the lockdown time in the CO<sub>2</sub> emission and GHG levels (Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2022</xref>). This made the governments and scientists realize how the closure of certain activities led the planet to heal itself and post-pandemic scenario, how the GHG and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions can be controlled (Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2022</xref>). There was also a sharp reduction in water pollution, the surface, coastal, and groundwater quality significantly improved. However, excessive soil pollution occurred due to a huge increase in medical and household waste (Yang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">2021a</xref>). Post-pandemic, practical action plans and policies need to be implemented to control these emissions sustainably through green economic activities (Irfan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2021</xref>; Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2022</xref>). As per Irfan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2021</xref>), the more we move toward a green economy, the better global sustainability can be achieved. The following parts will explain in detail the lessons learned from the lockdowns; the Green New Deal, which is being initiated; how the governments are providing green economic stimulus packages; and how to fix the prices for carbon emissions, using concepts of externality and if a common fixed price will be feasible for the world.</p><sec id="Sec40"><title>Lockdown lessons to diminish carbon emission</title><p id="Par79">As the pandemic raged across the world, all movements were restricted to prevent the spread of COVID-19—from the ban on airline travel, closure of schools, offices, factories, industries to the complete stoppage of transportation of oil, gas, and other goods. The regular amount of pollution from transportation highly reduced the release of fumes from factories, powerplants, oil refineries, and coal mining resulted in reducing CO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and other GHGs emissions (Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2022</xref>; McNeely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2021</xref>). During pre-pandemic days, industrialization and specific automobile industries, which mainly were utilizing fossil fuels for energy, resulted in an upsurge in GHG emissions. At least one-fifth of the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions came from transportation, with 75% from road transport (Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2022</xref>). Moreover, this was significantly reduced during the lockdowns to a global 7.8% decline in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 2020 compared to 2019 (Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2022</xref>). However, as per Irfan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2021</xref>), this reduction in GHG emissions was not sustainable when considering the normal functioning of global businesses. Post-pandemic, there has to be a series of long-term mitigation strategies to maintain this reduced level of GHG emissions (Irfan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2021</xref>). As per Kumar et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2022</xref>), in 2021, there can be a 6% upsurge in the GHG levels to stabilize the economy in the USA. There was also a decrease in GHG levels due to less aviation traffic, at least 40% less than the average in 2020 (Priya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2021</xref>). The positive impact of COVID-19 was that CO, NO<sub>2</sub>, PM2.5, and PM10 were reduced significantly in the atmosphere. In contrast, the SO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> levels were either constant or slightly increased in Lyon, Kolkata, Peru, and Spain (Yang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">2021a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>The Green New Deal</title><p id="Par80">As per McNeely, the governments of all countries are adopting a Green New Deal, especially for renewable resources—wind, solar, and water. The aim is to reduce 80% of the energy dependency on fossil fuels by 2030 and undergo a complete transition of energy dependency on renewable resources by 2050 (McNeely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2021</xref>). This should be a joint effort by the governments, academic institutions, scientists, NGOs, healthcare workers, and the public. Scholars in environmental science must advise policymakers on formulating scientific methods, understanding the risks involved, and creating public awareness. This can result in inadequate policies that can help reduce GHG emissions (Irfan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2021</xref>). The deal includes hydrogen economy—for low carbon energy systems because hydrogen can be utilized as an energy carrier with a similar role as carbon. Next is the transition to renewable energy through bioenergy with carbon capture (Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2022</xref>). Recycling institutions can significantly reduce the amount of waste discarded and reused again. Green innovation can be increased by creating electric vehicles. Also, green’s low-carbon circular economy can be created by using biodegradable, advanced materials (Priya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2021</xref>). Energy efficiency (EE) investments are a good clean energy transition practiced by the European Union (EU) for green economic recovery. This can be done using innovative decision support (DS) tools and standardized methodology tools like the Triple-A Horizon. As per the International Energy Agency (IEA), this can help in boosting the economy by creating jobs, reducing air pollution and GHG emissions, low energy bills, and efficient energy systems. Governments worldwide can apply this in 3 essential sectors—infrastructure, construction of buildings, and technology replacement using GT (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) (Karakosta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2021</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The Green New Deal, goals, and strategies for sustainable and eco-friendly transition. It includes bioenergy, biodefence, bio-cities, biodiversity, bioeconomy, green housing, agriculture, and bio-based materials</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11356_2022_20024_Fig3_HTML.png" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p id="Par81">Due to the pandemic, the EE investments were significantly reduced, especially in the oil sector. However, as the situation improves, these investments shall continue. The Green Deal also includes the “One Health” policy, which focuses on human, animal, economic, and environmental health and maintaining a good balance and improving the interaction between humans and animals by creating more dedicated areas for national parks and sanctuaries. The animals can live in their wild environments and support biodiversity. In agriculture, healthier approaches can be created to grow food in sustainable ways, for example, hydroponics and aquaponics. In the food industry, more investments are to be made in plant-based proteins and meats to reduce dependency on livestock and create healthier alternatives for a high-protein diet (McNeely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec42"><title>Government-financed stimuli</title><p id="Par82">Governments worldwide have planned to develop a stimulus for maintaining a good balance between economic recovery and climate issues. A good example to explain this is upgrading the street lights in India with LED lights, which reduced the GHG levels by about 5 million tons in 9 years and created 13,000 jobs (Abhinandan Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2022</xref>). The governments can come up with bio-cities in the urban settlements where they can build GT and green material-based buildings (EE investments can be included), promote bio-based public transportation for traveling instead of using individual cars, and promote green spaces by growing trees and urban forestry to engage people in recreational activities and protecting nature around cities (Galanakis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2022</xref>). Governments can provide transportation stimulus packages for sustainable mobility. These are low-carbon policies to reduce GHG levels due to vehicles, significantly individual cars (Griffiths et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2021</xref>). The concept of MaaS (mobility-as-a-service) can also be created—like public transport and Uber, where the public can book seats online and contribute to reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (Kanda and Kivimaa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2020</xref>). The government can directly buy EVs for the public, which are contactless and can be used as taxis for the public, as delivery vehicles, and buses (Griffiths et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par83">The countries should also focus on green housing to enhance sustainable living. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the public spending more time at their homes—working and for leisure time. Residential complexes must be developed to improve indoor environment quality, using sustainable and durable materials using the green housing topic model (Kaklauskas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2021</xref>). The United Nations have provided the SDGs to set specific policies to follow them and maintain the 3 pillars of sustainability—social, economic, and environmental sustainability, post COVID-19 pandemic (Ranjbari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec43"><title>Pricing the carbon externality</title><p id="Par84">The externality is a concept of economics that involves an industry or institution that is not charged or punished for the harm it provides to another, i.e., the environment. As far as industries are concerned, it is essential to keep a check on the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions released into the environment, having dangerous consequences. Hence, it is very crucial to charge them for this. This pricing can help them act on negative externalities carbon emissions and correct the spatial associations of environmental pollution (Shen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">2021</xref>). Carbon neutrality is another case where the externalities are internalized to create a carbon-double input level to innovate green technologies to produce low-carbon goods (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">2021a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">c</xref>). Generally, three policies would address climate change as an externality—command and control regulation, carbon taxes, and cap and trade (Mintz‐Woo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2022</xref>). Both carbon taxes and cap and trade are quantitative instruments for carbon pricing. Suppose we increase the price of GHG emissions, in that case, the producers themselves will reduce their polluting activities and find alternate ways of disposal (Mintz‐Woo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2022</xref>). In the USA, most of the earlier policies dealt with the cap-and-trade policies and carbon taxes, which considered GHG emissions an externality leading to climate change. However, it had been insufficient to significantly reduce the emission levels (Boyle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2021</xref>). As per Mintz‐Woo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2022</xref>), the USA prefers the command-and-control regulation since it either prohibits or sets specific limits regarding the emission levels. However, overall, carbon pricing is the most effective way to price the externalities. This is because carbon pricing is flexible, highly efficient, and comprehensive. Here, it rewards the companies who reduce their emissions, which can recycle their revenues (Mintz‐Woo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2022</xref>). Carbon pricing can be done either through carbon taxes or cap and trade and could be a point of discussion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec44"><title>Green stimulus and production capabilities</title><p id="Par85">GT has become a significant factor in economic growth with sustainability. Various fields are now being utilized to reduce GHG emissions and hazardous waste production. This includes bio-based sustainability, green nanotechnology, green chemistry, green IT industry—cloud computing and data mining (Nazir <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2021</xref>; Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">2021a</xref>). Many countries in Europe are coming up with an economic stimulus that aims to produce in a climate-friendly manner and increase the sorting and recycling of basic materials like aluminum, cement, and plastic (Chiappinelli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2021</xref>). The production of green electricity is possible by the government creating partnerships (public or private) to provide the necessary infrastructure using basic-recycled materials. By 2025, the aim is to get 20% of basic materials in recycled form in Europe via low-emission and recycling processes (Chiappinelli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2021</xref>). In order to increase green consumption among the public, it is essential to develop green products like green detergents, ecological paper products, energy-saving laptops and mobile phones, and electric vehicles. So here, the quality and the design of the product produced are very important. More and more industries can enhance their greener production and packaging capabilities using recycled materials to give a greener finish and label to the product while having minimal economic value. The focus must be to motivate the customers to buy more and more green products (Testa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">2021</xref>). According to Kansara et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2021</xref>), developing countries like China focus more on the knowledge-intensive industries that utilize GTI.</p><p id="Par86">In some cases, the companies may focus on R&amp;D to create innovations by taking certain risks due to more industrial competition, leading to reduced considerations toward GTI. So, it will be better to reduce their risk-taking tendencies and increase GTI activity (Yan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">2021</xref>). If GT is effectively used, the GT Innovation Efficiency (GTIE) will increase, leading the global value chain in a positive direction, one of the ways to increase sustainable economic growth (Kansara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par87">Next, it is very important to mention supply chain sustainability. Here the interest in green investment is always more from the retailer side than the supplier. For example, suppose we observe the case of battery suppliers. In that case, the electric car manufacturing companies will tell them to produce innovative green batteries, leading to reduced production costs and green battery technology. This will pressure suppliers to invest more in the production cost. Eventually, the manufacturing companies take the benefits. This later demotivates suppliers toward green investment (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">2021a</xref>). Hence, it is necessary to maintain a good balance between the retailer and the supplier at the time of green investment (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">2021a</xref>). The GT transfer and foreign investments significantly affect countries’ economic growth with green technological innovation for developing countries. There must be a good distribution of this technology to regional areas. Also, the crowding-out effect can create investments in science, technology, and education, improving regional competitiveness (Shen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">2021</xref>). Lastly, governments can work on increasing green nanoparticle (GNP) technologies. Nanoparticles have many applications and extensive usage in pharmaceuticals, biomedical, bioengineering, electronics, nuclear energy, etc. These green nanoparticles can be synthesized from plants, fungi, bacteria, and food waste products like rice husk to develop many green products—from medicines to developing nanomaterials for solar cells and electric batteries. Nanoremediation can be a good area for green investments and enhancing green technological innovations (Dutta and Das <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec45"><title>Sustainability transitions and space</title><p id="Par88">The changes in lifestyle and technology toward a greener, eco-friendly, and safe direction have motivated individuals, communities, governments, and the world to effectively transition toward a sustainable way of life. Following are some areas where a transition has been observed. Green housing is a significant way to enhance sustainable living. Using scientometrics and the green housing topic model, sustainable housing could be made into reality! These homes could be built using green materials, which are eco-friendly and durable. A ventilation system, sunlight, indoor greenery, and spacious rooms create an ideal sustainable and safe home (Kaklauskas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2021</xref>). Another transition criterion can be green consumption. This entirely depends on an individual’s altruistic and biospheric values, concern for the environment, and green lifestyle orientation (Berman Caggiano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par89">In this case, the tendency of an individual to buy sustainable products and appliances is observed. If they care for the environment, they would prefer to buy eco-friendly appliances. For example, the individual prefers to buy LED lights instead of energy-consuming yellow lightbulbs. Here, the government and the industries developing these products must be entirely responsible for providing the correct green technologies to the consumers (Berman Caggiano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2021</xref>). Another sustainable transition can be made at the industrial level, i.e., green composites; as research continued to create strong polymers, many improvements have been observed through cultivating different practices. Physical, chemical, biological, and chemical treatments make these materials/composites stable and durable. The two standout polymers are made from biomass and plant fibers. These both help increase the mechanical properties, facilitate degradability, and are antimicrobial. Plant fibers can be used to make ropes, textiles, mats, curtains, etc., which are eco-friendly and safe products (Vazquez-Nunez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">2021</xref>). Microalgae biomass is another highly effective and eco-friendly material with a fast growth rate, the ability to produce high oil yield, and is the most effective way for heavy metal pollution (Yap et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">2021</xref>). It is a form of advanced GT with applications in the biopharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries (Yap et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par90">GT can be effectively incorporated in manufacturing industries by operating milling, grinding, and other mechanical processes at green parameter settings, as Jibhakate et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2021</xref>) said. In India, for example, production lines are created while producing goods; this is said to be one of the GT manufacturing practices and is known as a flow shop. By following these green parameters and practices, energy savings can significantly increase (Jibhakate et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2021</xref>). The extraction of rare earth metals like bastnaesite was done using HCl leaching, calcification roasting, and gravity separation. This led to a cleaner alternative to extracting rare metals. Other countries can utilize this sustainable method for fluorites, chlorites, and more (Cen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2021</xref>). This shows how our economy is being shaped by knowledge capital and green innovation. Clean investments increase climate economics and create a resilient, zero emissions, and sustainable economy (Zenghelis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">2021</xref>). Lastly, green entrepreneurship is the new transition toward a greener business model. It considers three pillars: technology, entrepreneurship, and ecological environment. Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> gives a glimpse of the 12 model archetypes of green entrepreneurship that can be followed for the sustainable development of greentech businesses. These archetypes can provide a basis for many GT start-up companies to follow each model’s policies and put them into good practice. This can help create efficient and sustainable economies (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) (Trapp and Kanbach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">2021</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The model archetypes for a GT business.

We need to get back to the drawing board and formulate a new concept of growth, which is eco-friendly, green innovative, and sustainable. The points above have given us detailed information on the steps taken by the governments, industries, businesses, and individuals to save the environment since everybody has felt climate change and experienced it. Following are the practical transitions that will come into play like the green-based active packaging of goods, urban resilience, rhizoremediation, the new concepts of analyzing the sustainable, circular economy, and how it can be improved. Some of the concepts included here are emergy analysis, industrial ecology, ecological modernization, and green artificial intelligence (GAI). As mentioned earlier, many industries focus on biodegradable packaging of goods, where green-based active packaging arises. After the COVID-19 pandemic, there has come a renewed opportunity to develop biodegradable packaging for food applications and help maintain a circular economy (Barone et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2021</xref>). These packages provide antioxidant, antimicrobial, and aromatic properties, which improve food quality and give a hygienic and safe food delivery, benefitting the customers. Green technological advancements have helped create these biodegradable packages using flexible biopolymers like plant fibers, biomass (starch and cellulose), and polyphenols (Barone et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2021</xref>). Urban resilience is the ability of a particular urban area to maintain its socio-ecological and socio-technical aspects across temporal or spatial considerations (Moglia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2021</xref>). Here, the urban economy can be recovered by following the three urban missions—to attain urban mobility change, regenerative development, and create green infrastructure. A pathway series can create a process to build resilience and a green recovery in cities (Moglia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2021</xref>). Next, rhizoremediation is a green and sustainable technique to treat or remediate contaminated soils using the symbiotic relationship between the plants and soil microorganisms. As per Hoang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2021</xref>), this physiochemical technique is ineffective in treating soils contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH). It requires biostimulation and bioaugmentation, i.e., mobilizing the soil microbes or rhizosphere microorganisms and increasing their catabolic activities, which helps in the effective removal of contaminants (Hoang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par92">When it comes to the concepts, the first one is emergy analysis. It is a measuring tool for economic, social, and environmental performance. It can help analyze sustainable supply chain management and circular economy (Alkhuzaim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2021</xref>). This consists of a donor-side evaluation by considering the life cycle, sustainable performance assessments, and material flow analysis, i.e., how a particular institution does waste management and cost analysis. This can be a handy tool for researchers who wish to understand how sustainable production, performance, and consumption of GT are done by an institution (Alkhuzaim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2021</xref>). The second concept, industry ecology (IE), is a bottom-up research approach that analyzes ecological, environmental, economic, and system dynamics. It solves industrial problems (Han et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2021</xref>). The third concept, ecological modernization (EM), is a European concept based on the top–bottom approach, which begins from the national level to results in environmental and social challenges. Sociologists mostly do this research (Han et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2021</xref>). Most of the published research papers focus on IE studies rather than EM since IE gives the scenario an overall image. At the same time, the EM still needs proper implementation. However, integrating IE and EM can clearly understand the ecological transition toward sustainable development and research (Han et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2021</xref>). Lastly, GAI provides holistic views on how AI can be used for smart cities in the fourth concept. Green sensing can help solve current urbanization issues and enable Industry 4.0 and smart cities toward sustainable solutions (Yigitcanlar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">2021</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec47" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par93">The review discusses the connection between IR 4.0, conventional green processes, and the green economy. In the present scenario, GTs are an extraordinary challenge and lead toward the chance for new industries and provide competition among industries in the niche of the environment. Regarding the effect of the manufacturing and industrial endeavors on the environment, the green innovations and cycles are connected to Industry 4.0. They are a significant wellspring of sustainability for the future, as they bring together the social, economic, and environmental elements.</p><p id="Par94">The vital commitment of this work for information and exploration is the arrangement that gives a characterization and structure to supportability the results of green cycles in the Industry 4.0 period. The sustainable outcomes of various GTs in the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution have been brought into focus in this article while discussing global warming issues, the application of environmental biotechnology for a sustainable future, green chemical engineering, interactions of pollutants in the environment, product engineering to develop advanced biodegradable materials such as nanocellulose, biochar, starch, circular economy, and last but not the least the main goals of IR 4.0. There is also in-depth detailed information on the environmental economies that can help the governments to undergo green recovery most efficiently post COVID-19 and help maintain the reduced emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> and GHG. The vital enterprise processes should be advancing green design and manufacturing and the green supply chain and logistics. It is the proper and hypothetical groundwork for the experimental check of the interconnection between these ideas. The world’s governments can use the Green New Deal goals and strategies to create an eco-friendly transition using bio-based materials, hydroponics, and sustainable forest management. Technological developments that merged the Fourth Industrial Revolution and sustainability emphasized GTI and the IoT. It is in great demand today because of its multiplier effects that are beneficial in revolutionizing chemical engineering, product engineering, and the environmental industry. More products from advanced biodegradable materials need to be developed to attain a sustainable environment for further headings of future studies. Fundamentally, the impediments of this study are considered in the ensuing investigations of the adverse consequence of the sustainability results. As inventors should know, green inventions and clean technologies are beneficial for business. These are profitable markets that are rapidly expanding. Green technologies can help consumers save money on energy expenses and are frequently safer and healthier than their non-green equivalents.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the VIT, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India, for supporting this work.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contribution</title><p>Conceptualization: K.R., B.V., and A.V.G.; resources and data curation: P.B., A.B., C.N., S.S., M.P., S.K., U.R.W., and A.G.M.; writing—original draft preparation: P.B., A.B., C.N., S.S., M.P., S.K., A.G.M., and U.R.W.; writing—review and editing: K.R., A.G.M., and U.R.W.; visualization: A.V.G. and K.R.; supervision: A.V.G. and K.R.; project administration: A.V.G., K.R., and B.V.
