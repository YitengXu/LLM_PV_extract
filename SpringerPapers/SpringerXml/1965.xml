It is unknown, however, whether this is typical of HIV per se or it is due to the adverse metabolic effects of antiretroviral treatment and specifically of protease inhibitors, possibly through alterations of metabolic variables.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> To measure common carotid intima-media thickness by a standard echocolorDoppler in HIV patients with and without protease inhibitors treatment, and characterize carotid wall composition by a dedicated software (HP technologies) based on the integrated backscatter analysis (IBS) of the native signals from the wall tissues, marker of fibrosis.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We studied 44 HIV patients (38 males) with a mean age 45.9 ± 8.4 years (mean ± SD) and a mean duration of the disease of 47.7 ± 33.2 months.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> All patients were normotensive and had no history or evidence of cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Their total cholesterol was 161.3 ± 46.3 mg/dL and serum triglycerides value was 165.7 ± 117.0 mg/dL. The average IMT was 0.64 ± 0.22 mm (RCCA) and 0.68 ± 0.26 mm (LCCA) which was similar to the value of age, sex and blood pressure matched controls. There was no significant difference between the IMT value in HIV patients treated (n = 29) or not treated (n = 15) with protease inhibitors. In HIV patients there was a significant correlation between the duration of the disease and the IMT value (r = 0.36, p &lt; 0.01). Also carotid artery wall composition evaluated by IBS significantly correlated with the duration of the disease (r = 0.29, p &lt; 0.05).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our study shows in patients with HIV a relationship between carotid artery IMT and IBS and the duration of the disease, even in the absence of a pathological increase of the IMT. This correlation suggests an association between the disease and wall structural abnormalities, in term of fibrosis, independently from the type of the antiretroviral therapy. Thus, the increased cardiovascular mortality in HIV patients may be explained by arterial structural changes favouring atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>1.2 Resistance Artery Mechanics and Composition in Angiotensin II-Infused Mice: Effects of Cyclo-Oxygenase-1 Inhibition</title><p><italic>A.

Male mice received vehicle or Ang II (400 ng/kg/min, s.c.) ±SC-560 (COX-1 inhibitor, 10 mg/Kg/day i.p.) or celecoxib (cele, COX-2 inhibitor, 400 mg/Kg/day, food) (2 weeks, n = 7 each). Mesenteric vessels, studied on pressurized myograph, were exposed to intraluminal pressures (3–140 mmHg). Media thickness and lumen diameter were measured to determine mechanical properties. Collagen type I was evaluated by immunohistochemistry.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Systolic blood pressure (SBP), increased by Ang II, was unmodified by COX-1 or COX-2 treatment (table). Media/lumen ratio (M/L) and media cross-sectional area (CSA), increased by Ang II, were partially reduced by COX-1 and not modified by COX-2 inhibition (table). Ang II-treated group showed stiffer vessels, with leftward shift of the stress-strain relationship and a raised slope of the incremental elastic modulus-stress relationship as compared to controls (p &lt; 0.01). This was attenuated (p &lt; 0.05) by COX-1 inhibitor and unchanged by COX-2 blockade. The enhanced collagen deposition induced by Ang II was prevented by COX-1 and only slightly reduced by COX-2 inhibitor (table).

Marche, Ancona, Italy</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> LRP6 is a co-receptor in the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway and has recently been involved in vascular development and remodeling. LRP6 is expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells and in rat carotid arteries but it is unknown whether it is expressed in human carotid atherosclerotic plaques and if a common 1062V LRP6 variant with reduced function can be related to carotid artery atherosclerosis (CAA) in hypertensive patients.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> This study verified the LRP6 gene expression in human carotid atherosclerotic plaques analyzing also the relationship between LRP6 variants and CAA in hypertensive patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Human carotid plaque samples were obtained from 24 hypertensive patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy for carotid artery stenosis ≥70% of the lumen. Expression was evaluated by Real Time PCR. Electronic records of 334 hypertensive patients (&lt;65 years-old) who underwent carotid artery ultrasonography were retrospectively reviewed: presence of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, glomerular filtration rate, and smoking habit was evaluated. CAA was defined by the presence of atherosclerotic plaques (focal intima-media thickness ≥1.3 mm). Logistic regression models were used to estimate the independent effect of 1062V allele.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> LRP6 transcripts were present in carotid artery plaques. Significantly lower LRP6 expression levels (p &lt; 0.0001) were present in 1062V carriers compared with I1062I homozygous subjects. In the association study, no difference was observed between genotypes in clinic variables except for a slightly higher fasting glucose in 1062V carriers. The 1062V LRP6 variant was an independent risk factor for CAA in both unadjusted (OR 2.08, 95%CI 1.27, 3.41, p = 0.003) and adjusted models (OR 1.92, 95%CI 1.09, 3.39, p = 0.02).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> LRP6 1062V variant is strongly linked to carotid artery atherosclerosis in hypertensive patients beyond the role of established risk factors for atherosclerosis. Different LRP6 expression levels in human atherosclerotic plaques in vivo suggest that LRP6 may have a key functional role in the plaque-development process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>1.4 Association of a Prothrombotic State with Carotid Intima-Media Thickness in Hypertensive Patients</title><p><italic>C.

No definite data on humans are available confirming this hypothesis.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> To compare the effect of high dose vs low dose of atorvastatin vs non-statin based treatment (cholestyearsamine plus sistosterol) on carotid plaque composition.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We studied 60 hypercholesterolemic patients (total cholesterol, TC, 225–295 mg/dL) eligible for carotid endarterectomy. Three months prior surgery patients were randomized into 3 groups (n = 20) receiving atorvastatin 10 mg/day (AT-10), or atorvastatin 80 mg/day (AT-80), or cholestyearsamine 8 g/day plus sitosterol 2.5 g/day (C-S). Blood samples were collected to assess lipid profile and inflammatory markers levels. Analysis of carotid plaque cell composition and lipid content was performed on endarterectomy specimens.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The AT-80 group showed the highest reduction in TC and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. A similar level in TC and LDL-C was achieved in the AT-10 and C-S groups. The three regimens did not significantly influence the levels of inflammatory markers (including hs-PCR). A lower content in macrophages was observed in the AT-10 group plaques compared to the C-S group (AT-10: 11.0% vs C-S: 20.9% of plaque area). The macrophage content was further on reduced in the AT-80 group plaques (5.9% of plaque area). No difference in lymphocyte number was observed among treatments while the content of smooth muscle cells was higher in the AT-80 group. The plaque lipid content was similar in the 3 groups.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Despite a comparable reduction in cholesterol levels, atorvastatin treatment was superior to a non statin-based regimen in blunting macrophage accumulation inside carotid atherosclerotic plaque.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>1.7 Pattern of Expression of Inflammatory Markers in Adipose Tissue of Untreated Patients with Essential Hypertension</title><p><italic>A.

Among them, Apolipoprotein A-I amyloidosis (Leu75Pro) is a rare, autosomal dominant condition in which renal, hepatic, and testicular involvement has been demonstrated. No data are available on carotid artery structural changes in this condition, although other mutations of APO-AI lipoprotein have different (protective or favouring) effect on atherosclerosis.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> To evaluate carotid artery structural alterations, as assessed by ultrasound, in patients with Apolipoprotein A-I amyloidosis (APO A-I amyloidosis).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In 104 patients with Apolipoprotein A-I amyloidosis (Leu75Pro) [mean age 52 ± 16 years, 56 F, 57% hypertensive patients] and in 104 subjects matched for age, sex, body mass index (BMI) and clinic blood pressure (BP), carotid artery intima media thickness (IMT) was measured by B-Mode ultrasound.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> By definition no differences were observed for age, sex, BMI, BP and heart rate. Mean common (CC), bifurcation (Bif) and internal carotid artery (ICA) IMT were comparable in the two groups (0.87 ± 0.21 vs 0.88 ± 0.17; 1.23 ± 0.41 vs 1.25 ± 0.38 and 0.95 ± 0.33 vs 0.95 ± 0.28 respectively for APO A-I amyloidosis vs controls, p = ns). Similar results were obtained for MeanMax IMT and T Max (1.02 ± 0.29 vs 1.03 ± 0.26 and 1.60 ± 0.69 vs 1.56 ± 0.58 p = ns).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our data demonstrate that in patients with Apolipoprotein A-I amyloidosis (Leu75Pro) carotid artery intima media thickness is comparable to that of matched control subjects. These results, obtained in a wide sample of patients, may add significant information to the clinic features of this rare genetic disorder, possibly suggesting a protective effect on carotid atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>1.9 Does Low Salt Intake Influence Inflammation in Essential Hypertension?</title><p><italic>D. Leonardis, S. Cutrupi, G. Tripepi, R. Tripepi, C. Zoccali</italic> and <italic>F. Mallamaci</italic></p><p>CNR-IBIM &amp; UO di Nefrologia, Reggio Calabria, Italy</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Salt is one of the main environmental ‘toxin’ involved in atherogenesis and in the high cardiovascular (CV) risk in atherogenesis-related diseases. Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory process and population based studies suggest that blood pressure is associated to inflammatory cytokines. The relationship between salt and inflammation is still controversial. In fact, observational studies showed a direct relationship between inflammation biomarkers and salt intake while interventional, not randomised studies did not show such an association.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> Therefore, we analysed the relationship between salt intake and cytokines (pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alfa and IL-6 and the two main cytokines produced in the adipose tissue, Leptin and Adiponectin) in 32 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (mean age: 48 ± 8 years).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> All patients underwent a high (200 mMol/d) or low (20 mMol/L) sodium diet in a randomized cross over design. Each diet lasted 1 week.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Systolic (135 ± 9 mmHg vs 128 ± 9 mmHg) and diastolic pressure (86 ± 7 mmHg vs 84 ± 7 mmHg) decreased during the low salt diet (p &lt; 0.005). As expected, there was an activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system during the low salt diet (PRA, median: 2.5 ng/mL/h vs 0.9 ng/mL/h; aldosterone, median: 119 pg/mL vs 49 pg/mL). Plasma ADPN significantly reduced (−16%) in low-sodium diet (48 ± 24 mg/mL) as compared to high sodium diet (57 ± 29 mg/mL) (p &lt; 0.001). Changes in salt intake significantly reduced plasma TNFα (p = 0.003) but the reduction in circulating levels of this cytokine was clinically meaningless (low sodium: 2.5 ± 1.0 pg/mL vs high sodium: 2.3 ± 1.0 pg/mL). Changes in salt intake had no influence both on IL-6 (low sodium: 2.6 ± 2.2 pg/mL vs high sodium: 2.6 ± 1.9 pg/mL) and Leptin levels (7.7 ± 5.1 ng/mL vs 7.4 ± 5.2 ng/mL). Multiple regression analysis (data adjusted for age and sex) showed that ADPN changes were largely independent of concomitant blood pressure variations.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In the mid term, independently from blood pressure variations, low sodium diet decreases plasma adiponectin levels, a cytokine with important anti-inflammatory properties, and seems to have very little effect on pro-inflammatory cytokines. These findings indicate that in essential hypertensive patients the beneficial effect of low sodium diet on CV risk does not seem to be dependent on the attenuation of systemic inflammation and would suggest that reduced levels of adiponectin observed at low salt intake, could decrease the beneficial effect of this not pharmacological treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>1.10 Cigarette Smoking and Inflammation: Gene-Environment Interaction in the Development of Vascular Damage</title><p><italic>M.

Agabiti Rosei</italic></p><p>Clinica Medica-Università di Brescia, Brescia, Italy</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Cigarette smoking is an independent cardiovascular risk factor and although its pathogenic mechanisms are not well understood, inflammatory pathway seems to play a pivotal role. In this context, it is possible that genetic variability of genes involved in leukotrienes synthesis may modulate the effects of smoking on the development of subclinic atherosclerotic damage.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We have examined about 600 individuals (Vobarno Study population), who have been characterized for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, including cigarette smoking. Vascular damage has been assessed as intima-media thickness (CB<sub>max</sub> = mean maximum IMT of the 4 far walls in the distal common carotids and carotid bifurcations, bilaterally) and as the number of sites carrying atheromatic plaques, according to Mannheim criteria (AP-score). We have analyzed a 5-lipoxygenase promoter (5-ALOX) tandem-repeat polymorphism and 7 SNPs (SG13S25, S377, S114, S89, S32, S41 and S35) of the 5- lipoxygenase-activating protein (5-ALOX-AP); the 5-ALOX-AP haplotypes have been reconstructed by a Bayesian algorithm (software Phase 2.1). The association between atherosclerosis indexes and predictive variables, including genetic polymorphisms, has been assessed by univariate and multivariate analysis (SPSS 13.0).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Among traditional risk factors, cigarette smoking is an important predictor of CBmax, particularly in men, but it is not significantly associated to AP-score, whose main predictor is age. At the univariate analysis, only 5-ALOX-AP S35 polymorphism revealed a statistically significant association with Cbmax (GG = 0.99 ± 0.01,GA = 0.92 ± 0.02,AA = 0.65 ± 0.08; p = 0.005) but it was not associated with AP (GG = 0.47 ± 0.04, GA = 0.46 ± 0.09, AA = 0.25 ± 0.25; NS). At the multivariate analysis S35 remained significantly associated with CB<sub>max</sub>, and the pro-atherometous effect of the G allele was more evident in smokers than in non smokers (p = 0.05); after data correction for possible confounding factors, also haplotype A (G, T, G e A in S25, S114, S89 and S32 respectively) showed a statistically significant association with CBmax in smokers (p = 0.05). At multivariate analysis, homozygotes for the 5-repeat allele of the 5-ALOX promoter showed significantly lower CBmax values, both in smokers and in non smokers.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study suggests that the pro-inflammatory action of cigarette smoke on vascular walls may be mediated, at least in part, by interaction with genetic variability in the leukotrienes synthesis pathway.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Blood Pressure Monitoring</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>2.1 Support to the General Practitioners Using an Integrated Platform of Telemedicine® for the Analysis of Ambulatory Blood Pressure Records</title><p><italic>J.A.

However, its use is time consuming and requires trained personnel for a proper interpretation of results. It is also known that the care of the majority of hypertensive patients is assigned to general practitioners (GPs), working generally in ambulatories located far from the specialized centers. The alternative of transmission of records by phone or internet is gaining interest in many countries.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A web-based integrated platform of telemedicine (PIT®) has been developed and used by our group for 2 years, initially for the transmission of ECGs. In the last year, it was introduced in the PIT® a software for analysis of ABPM, which allows to return in the next hours the interpreted ABPM to the ambulatory centers. As the ABPM records arrive to a web page, the specialists can analyze the results from wherever they can have access to internet. For this practice, we have employed standards ABPM devices (Mobil-O-Graph®) connected to internet by means of a devote software, from where the trained GPs sends the study and all relevant information of the patients (Name, age, sex weight, height) and the blood pressure record (time of awaking and sleep, quality of sleep). The GPs can also inform about drugs taking by patients, pathological data etc.).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Until now, we have used this approach in 20 public and private centers in the countries convolved in this project. In this period, we have received more than 15.000 ABPM records. The studies are interpreted and returned to the GPs the same day or at least the next day. Exceptionally (less than 0.5% of cases) the studies had been rejected by the specialized center because of poor quality of records and had been repeated. Since the software of interpretation calculates all the values relevant to the ABPM study, and allows electronically chose the different diagnostic possibilities, the interpretation by the specialist take only 2 or 3 minutes. The GPs receive the report with all the relevant tables, graphics and conclusions, signed by the specialist.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The use of PIT® allows the rapid interpretation of ABPMs in order to support the General Practitioner practice. Moreover, since with the same approach the GPs also obtain ECGs and recently in our centers, spirometric studies, the PIT® is providing an important database of the population and of individual patients included in this novel integrated platform.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>2.2 Relationship of Morning Blood Pressure Surge with Cardiovascular Events and Total Mortality in a General Population</title><p><italic>M.

However, direct evidence is limited.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In 2011 subjects of the PAMELA (Pressioni Arteriose Monitorate e Loro Associazioni) study randomly selected to be representative of the general population of Monza (MI, Italy) for gender and age decades (25–74 ys), we performed 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure (24 h BP) by a validated oscillometric device, set to obtain automatic measurements every 20 minutes. The morning BP surge (MBPS) was calculated as the average of the systolic (S) BP readings of the 2 hours after awake minus the average of the lowest SBP readings, the SBP reading immediately preceding and the one immediately following, during the night time. Spectral analysis of BP profile was performed to identify the main cyclic components of SBP variability (1° and 2° cyclic components of variability, respectively day night and post prandial variability), and residual, non-cyclic variability. Subjects were followed for an average of 148 months, during which CV events (fatal and non fatal) and all-cause deaths were recorded.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> MBPS was significantly correlated (p &lt; 0.0001) with several other 24 h BP variables, i.e. 24 h mean SBP, day-night SBP difference and other cyclic and non-cyclic components of SBP variability, the correlation coefficients ranging from 0.24 to 0.47 (r values). During the follow up there were 231 all cause deaths and 178 CV events. MBPS showed a significant predictive relationship with the incidence of all cause death (p &lt; 0.001), and with the incidence of CV events (p &lt; 0.01). The significant relationship with all cause death and CV events, however, disappeared after adjustment for potential confounders such as age and other 24 h BP variables. Similar findings were obtained when another method to calculate the morning BP surge, such as the post and preawake BP difference, was used.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In the PAMELA population, MBPS reflects overall BP variability phenomena and does not appear to be an independent predictor of CV or all cause death risk.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>2.3 Evaluation of the Blood Pressure and of the Cardiovascular Risk with Ambulatory Monitoring: Criteria Proposal</title><p><italic>G.

Patients have been split into two groups: A. Normotensive patients with 24 hours average pressure values lower than or equal to 130/80 mmHg; B. Hypertensive patients with 24 hours average pressure values higher than 130/80 mmHg. The following measures have been calculated: the mean, the standard deviation, the confidence interval to 99%(CI) of the following data: 24-hour mean arterial pressure (MAP), 24-hour mean hearth rate (mHR), the relationship between MAP and mHR, which has been called Normalization Quotient (NQ), the relationship between the systolic blood pressure and the diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The main findings of our study are shown in the table.

All devices record BP using the oscillometric method with a BP range of 30–260 mmHg and heart rate range of 40–199 beats/min. Among the three devices, the PIC-indolor Comfort check uses a pre-formed cuff designed to improve the compliance of the patient, it is easier to be wrapped around the arm because of a special preformed shape.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The International validation Protocol is divided into 2 phases: the phase one (15 subjects and 45 pairs of BP measurements) and the phase 2 (18 supplementary subjects and 54 pairs of BP measurements) making a total number of 33 subjects (99 pairs of BP measurements) on which the final validation is performed. The same methodology was applied for the 3 studies. In each study and for each subject, 4 BP measurements were performed simultaneously by 2 trained observers using mercury sphygmomanometers alternately with 3 measurements by the tested device. The difference between the BP value given by the device and that obtained by the 2 observers (mean of the 2 observers) was calculated for each measure. The 99 pairs BP differences were classified into 3 categories (≤5, ≤10, ≤15 mmHg). The number of differences in each category was compared to the number required by the ESH Protocol.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The 3 tested devices passed the first and the second phase of the validation protocol. The average differences between the device and mercury sphygmomanometer readings were for Systolic BP and Diastolic BP respectively: 0.1 ± 2.9 and −0.1 ± 3.8 mmHg for the PIC-indolor Personal check, −1.0 ± 3.7 and 0.2 ± 3.2 mmHg for the PIC-indolor Comfort check; −0.6 ± 4.5 and −1.5 ± 4.3 mmHg for the PIC-indolor My check. For the 3 devices, readings differing by less than 5, 10 and 15 mmHg for SBP and DBP values fulfil the recommendation criteria of the ESH Protocol.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The PIC-indolor Personal check, the PIC-indolor Comfort check and the PIC-indolor My check (Artsana, Italy) devices for self-measurement of brachial BP fulfilled the validation protocol of the ESH.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>2.9 Effect of Lactotri-Peptides Extracted from Lactobacillus helveticum on Ambulatory and 24-Hour Blood Pressure in Subjects with Normal or Normal-High Blood Pressure: a Cross-Over, Double-Blind, Randomized, Clinic Trial</title><p><italic>A.F.G.

A major problem in LRS is unavailability of reliable, durable and affordable BP measuring devices, in particular facing withdrawal of mercury sphygmomanometers (M). A WHO expert committee defined the features of BP measuring devices suitable to LRS. One device (OMRON M1 Plus, OM1) fulfilling these criteria (including low cost) was recently validated using the ESH Protocol.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> To assess the usability, acceptability and accuracy of OM1 under field conditions in LRS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The study was conducted in three centers in two African countries (Uganda: Benedict Medical Center in Kampala and Lacor Hospital; and Zambia: Mtendere Hospital, Chirundu). A total of 716 subjects (aged 15–75 years), consecutively attending these centres for various medical problems, were recruited after obtaining informed consent. In each subject BP measurements were performed 4 times within 8 min: twice with OM1 and twice with M, according to ESH guidelines in a randomized sequential order. At each centre two trained physicians or nurses performed device evaluation, BP measurement, clinic and demographic data collection.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 700 subjects with no violations in data collection protocol were included in this study (35 ± 14 years old, 58% female, 97% being of African race, BMI 24.6 ± 5 kg/m2). Average waist circumference and heart rate were 86.7 ± 12.6 cm and 74.6 ± 11.6 b/min, respectively. As compared to M, OM1 was rated as ‘good’ in 82% and as ‘preferred’ in 95.1% of cases, mainly because of its easy use and the availability of automated measures (84.6%) and solar power (79.1%). OM1 was also found more comfortable to use (69.3%), while M was subjectively felt as more durable in 29.6% of cases. Concerning OM1 performance, the display was found clearly legible in 98%, the cuff appropriately inflating and deflating in 96.7% and the on/off switch correctly working in 98.3% of cases. Average systolic (S)/diastolic(D) BP were 120.5 ± 21.6/74.6 ± 13.8 and 122.3 ± 21.8/71.2 ± 14.0 mmHg with M and OM1, respectively (NS). 20% of subjects were classified as hypertensive with M and 18.9% with OM1, the between-device agreement in defining subjects’ BP status being 93.7%, as confirmed by Bland-Altman plots, mainly for SBP.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The results of our field testing confirm in a LRS the accuracy of OM1, previously shown in laboratory conditions. The field test demonstrates, moreover, that OM1 was well accepted by health care givers and patients and was found easy and practical to use. Considering its low cost, the new OM1 is likely to prove a suitable and reliable device to improve the diagnosis and management of hypertension in LRS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>2.15 Sleep Efficacy, but not Supposed Sleep Duration, is Associated to Microvascular Damage in Mild Hypertensive Patients</title><p><italic>P.

After a period of 10 minutes of relaxation, in all patients it was measured the clinic BP in a sitting position (3 measurements at a distance of 2 minutes), and it was personal and pharmacological case; no patient reported associated symptoms.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In the control group we obtained a reduction in average blood pressure to 148/90 mmHg in 62% of patients, while in the remaining 38% (54 patients) the values of PA were &gt;160/120 mmHg. In the experimental group, instead 88% of patients had a reduction in average blood pressure to 144/84 mmHg, while only 12% (17 patients) did not present significant reduction.

HIV infection has been linked with atherosclerotic cardiovascular complications, irrespective of antiretroviral therapy. It is unclear whether patients with HIV infection have an attenuated nocturnal BP reduction.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Fifty-two consecutive patients with untreated HIV infection (85% men, age 39 ± 11 years, 50% smokers, BP 125/78 ± 11/10 mmHg) were individually matched with 104 healthy control in a case-control study (cases : controls ratio 1 : 2). Matching criteria were age ( ± 10 years), sex (same sex), smoking habits (smoker or non-smoker) and office systolic BP ( ± 10 mmHg). All participants underwent 24-hour BP monitoring with a validated oscillometric device (SpaceLabs 90207, 1 reading/15 min). Hypertension (BP ≥140/90 mmHg or antihypertensive treatment), diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, treatment with cardiovascular drugs and concomitant important disease were exclusion criteria. Day and night were defined on the basis of wide fixed clock intervals (06–22 and 22–06, respectively). Subjects with a nocturnal reduction of systolic and diastolic BP &lt;10% were defined ‘non-dippers’.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> As expected on the basis of selection criteria, age, office BP and proportion of smokers were identical in the 2 groups. Average daytime BP did not differ in HIV and control subjects (124/80 ± 11/9 vs 124/80 ± 9/7 mmHg, p = n.s.). Night time BP was higher in HIV-infected subjects (113/69 ± 11/9 vs 109/67 ± 8/6 mmHg, p = 0.02/0.09). Nocturnal systolic/diastolic BP reduction was 8.8/11.7% in cases and 11.7/15.8% in controls (p = 0.003/0.043). The proportion of ‘non-dippers’ was 33% in cases and 16% in controls (p = 0.018). In a multiple linear regression, nocturnal BP fall was predicted by cigarette smoking (b = 0.22, p = 0.028) and HIV infection (b = −0.24, p = 0.003).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> HIV infection is accompanied by a significantly reduced day-night BP change. These findings, obtained in subjects without major cardiovascular risk factors and not receiving antiretroviral treatment, suggest that day-night BP changes may play a role in HIV-related increase in cardiovascular risk.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Epidemiology</title><sec id="Sec34"><title>3.1 The BP-Care Study: Blood Pressure Control and Cardiovascular Risk Profile of Hypertensive Patients in Central and East European Countries</title><p><italic>G.

For group C 16.7% reduced and 33.3% increased drug therapy, while for 50% drug therapy remained unchanged. The reduction of BP values in group I was due to an increased adherence to recommendations given by physicians while in group C was especially due to an increase of drug therapy. As a consequence group I patients saved 3.15 euros per capita per month and groupC patients spent 1.8 euros more per capita per month. We found a significant improvement of lifestyle modification after 12 months of follow-up concerning some aspects in both groups, while SF-36 showed better results for the majority of the items in group I.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our findings show that this approach is a powerful tool for reaching better blood pressure control and underline the essential role of patients involvement in the management of their care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>3.8 “Dieci Anni Di Vita In Più” (A Life Ten Years Longer), a Therapeutic Patient Education Project for Hypertensive Patients: from the Hospital to the Community</title><p><italic>D.

Major side-effects of this drug are fatigue, diarrhoea, anorexia, hand and foot skin reactions and arterial hypertension development, that might be related to its inhibitory effect on Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor receptor.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> To establish the incidence of arterial hypertension in 45 patients receiving Sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma and to evaluate the best clinic management of treated subjects.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively reviewed 45 subjects with hepatocellular carcinoma arisen on hepatic cirrhosis treated with Sorafenib 800 mg/day (37 males, 8 females, mean age 69.8 years, range 48–88). According to guidelines, the diagnosis of arterial hypertension was defined as the threefold presence of arterial blood pressure &gt;140/90 mmHg.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Nine of 45 patients (20%) developed arterial hypertension during Sorafenib treatment. Eight of them were hypertensive well controlled with antihypertensive drugs before Sorafenib therapy. In all patients hypertension occurred early in the course of treatment (two weeks). In 8 patients the dose of antihypertensive medication was increased and in 6 new antihypertensive drugs were added. In the remaining subject antihypertensive treatment was started. In 3/9 patients (33%) Sorafenib treatment was interrupted, considering also others side effects presentation.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Arterial hypertension development is a frequent side-effect during Sorafenib treatment. Patients given Sorafenib need to be closely monitored, especially when they start therapy, to an early hypertension detection and an effective treatment, allowing prevention of cardiovascular complications. In case of persistent hypertension, additionally to antihypertensive treatment, temporary or permanent Sorafenib discontinuation should be considered.</p></sec><sec id="Sec43"><title>3.10 Obesity is a Risk Factor for Gastroesophageal Disease and Influences the Choice of Antihypertensive Therapy</title><p><italic>A.

In particular, arterial hypertension stand out with an estimated prevalence around 20–30% of the population over 18 years. A serious complication of arterial hypertension are hypertensive crises, characterized by a rapid, inappropriate, strong and often symptomatic elevation in blood pressure levels, with or without the risk of rapid deterioration of target organs, (TOD), which may represent an immediate or potential life threat. A hypertensive crisis may be manifested as a hypertensive emergency or urgency. The real epidemiologic extent of the hypertensive emergency and urgency has been not clearly assessed.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> To evaluate the prevalence of hypertensive crisis (emergency, urgency), of their clinic presentation and of the type of organ damage.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We collected the case files of all the patients admitted to the Emergency Department of the 9 centers involved in the Study between the first of January and 31 December 2008. Hypertensive crisis was defined as systolic blood pressure &gt;220 and diastolic &gt;120 mmHg. Hypertensive urgency was defined as symptomatic increase of blood pressure in absence of TOD; hypertensive emergency was defined as symptomatic increase of blood pressure in presence of acute or progressive TOD.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 192294 clinic files, of the first six months, were screened. Prevalence of hypertensive crisis was 0.43% (804 cases). The hypertensive emergencies were 37.6% and urgencies were 62.4%. 12% of the patients was unaware of their hypertension. Patients with hypertensive emergencies were more frequently male (66.3%; p &lt; 0.002), older (60.1 ± 14.2 years, p &lt; 0.001) and with higher diastolic blood pressure (128.1 ± 12 vs 125.6 ± 14 mmHg, p &lt; 0.05) compared with patients with hypertensive urgencies. The emergencies clinic presentation was more frequently ischemic stroke and pulmonary oedema.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Hypertensive crisis represent the 0.43% of all the Emergency Department admission in this wide population. Hypertensive urgencies were more frequent than emergencies.

We measured blood pressure (BP), weight (W), height (H), waist and hip circumference (WC, HC); then, we calculated waist to hip ratio (WHR), body mass index (BMI), BMI to WHR ratio (BMI/WHR), waist to height ratio (WHtR) and a new index waist circumference for weight to height ratio (WCW/H). Anthropometric indices were grouped into quintiles and we calculated, with the chi-quadrate test, the association with hypertension, with the cut-off at 25 for BMI and at the third quintile for the other parameters. Hypertension was defined by a blood pressure measurement ≥140/90 mmHg or the use of blood pressure lowering drugs. All data were adjusted for age, cholesterolaemia and diabetes.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> All anthropometric parameters (BMI,BMI/WHR,WHtR,WCW/H) have a predict power to develop hypertension in all the subjects of 30–64 years and in the female &gt;64 years; for male &gt;64 years there is a significant correlation only between BMI/WHR and hypertension (table).

Criteria for inclusion were: population studies with assessment of salt intake as baseline exposure and either stroke or total CVD determined prospectively as outcome. For each study several characteristics were recorded, relative risks and 95% C.I. were extracted and pooled using a random effect model, weighting for the inverse of the variance. Sensitivity analysis was performed, heterogeneity and publication bias were also assessed.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Overall, 11 studies were identified providing 16 cohort samples. They included 156 697 male and female participants (follow-up range 3.5–19 years), 5 183 stroke and 4 129 CVD events. Salt intake was assed by 24-hour dietary recall (n = 3), FFQ (n = 3), urine excretion (n = 4) and questionnaire (n = 1). In the pooled analysis, higher salt intake was associated with greater risk of stroke (RR: 1.26; 95% CI 1.07, 1.48; p = 0.004) and CVD (1.20; 0.95, 1.50; p = 0.12), with no evidence of publication bias but significant heterogeneity between studies (p &lt; 0.001 for both endpoints). For stroke the pooled estimate did not vary substantially with the exclusion of individual studies. However, for CVD the exclusion of a single outlier led to a pooled estimate of 1.28 (1.03–1.58); p &lt; 0.01.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> High salt intake is associated with significantly greater risk of both stroke and total CVD.

For this study, we take the level of 160 mg/dL such as cut-off for n-HDL-c and we selected 1099 adult subjects representative of the Brisighella population, consecutively visited during the BHS surveys 1988–1992, with no important modification of their lipid profile.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Among the 1099 subjects that didn’t change their lipid profile during the follow up, 43% had n-hdl-c levels &lt;160 mg/dL (41% males, 45.1% women) and 57% had n-HDL-c levels &gt;160 mg/dL (59% males, 54.9% females).

Blood pressure was measured by standardised methods and hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg and/or a diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg and/or current use of anti-hypertensive drugs.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Fat mass was similar in both sexes (32.2 ± 9.5 kg in M and 32.3 ± 10.4 kg in F; p = ns) while FFM was higher in males than in females (68 ± 10 kg vs. 49 ± 6 kg; p = 0.0001). Mean BP was related to FM in females (r = 0.27; p = 0.0001) but not in males (r = 0.06; p = ns); while, on the contrary, FFM was significantly related to BP in males (r = 0.27; p = 0.004), and only weakly in females (r = 0.12; p = 0.03). These results were moreover confirmed after adjusting for age. Finally the relative risk of arterial hypertension significantly increased by 6% for each 1 kg increase of FFM in males (OR = 1.06 [95% CI: 1.011, 1.17]) and respectively by about 4% for each 1 kg increase of FM in women (OR = 1.039 [1.010–1.039]), after adjusting for possible confounders. These same results were obtained after substituting FM with waist circumference, with good reason considered as a proxy of FM.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These preliminary data suggest that gender affects the relationship between BP and body composition in obese people, indicating that BP is in some ways more FM-dependent in women and more FFM-dependent in males. In conclusion these findings can, altogether, hypothetically suggest that any decrease of body weight in obese people could lead to different BP reduction between sexes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec52"><title>3.19 Blood Pressure Control and Variability in Diabetic Patients Undergoing Ambulatory Blood Pressure</title><p><italic>A.M.

This may be related to several factors, including national health care systems’ rules, physicians’ behaviours and attitudes and patients’ preferences among European Countries, including Italy. In this view, the Evaluation of Final Feasible Effect of Control Training and Ultra Sensitisation (EFFECTUS) study, an observational, multicenter, educational program, has recently evaluated the global CV risk management in different clinic settings in Italy.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> To evaluate similarities and differences in the global CV risk management in patients included in the EFFECTUS study, stratified in different macro-areas (north, middle and south) throughout the Italian territory.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The EFFECTUS study involved physicians who agreed to participate in an educational project, aimed at implementing the knowledge and management of global CV risk. Physicians were asked to report in a dedicated case report form data already available in their medical records from 10 consecutive adult outpatients, during the month of May 2006. Data collection included patients’ medical history, drug treatment, physical examination, laboratory results or diagnostic tests. Data were then centrally analyzed for the assessment of global CV risk in the overall population.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The EFFECTUS study involved a total of 1078 physicians (27% female, mean age 50.3 ± 7.6 years), who collected data from 9904 outpatients (46.5% females, mean age 67 ± 9 years), of which 3219 (32.5%) residents in the north, 3652 (36.9%) in the center and 3003 (30.3%) in the south areas of our country. Overall, a high prevalence of major CV risk factors was recorded. In particular, “southern patients” have shown a higher prevalence of family history of CV disease, smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes and coronary artery disease. With the exception of triglycerides, the absolute values of blood pressure, cholesterolaemia (total and LDL), blood glucose and creatinine were significantly higher in the middle as compared to those recorded in the north and south Italy. Significant differences were also recorded in relation to requested diagnostic tests and therapeutic strategies used to manage global CV risk across the Italian territory.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This analysis of the EFFECTUS study confirms the high prevalence of CV risk factors in Italy, particularly in southern Italian regions, and some differences in the clinic management of global CV risk, which may have relevance for planning future preventive strategies aimed at reducing the global burden of CV disease in our Country.</p></sec><sec id="Sec54"><title>3.21 Cognitive Impairment and Comorbidity in Elderly Patients with Hypertension</title><p><italic>Alessandro Grippa</italic> and <italic>Ferdinando D’Amico</italic></p><p>UOC Geriatria PO Patti-AUSL n. 5 Messina, Patti-Messina, Italy</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Epidemiological studies showed that elderly people with cognitive impairment have a higher risk of death. Cognitive impairment can come up in different ways. The most common cognitive impairment can be mnesic, or can affect just one non-mnesic area, or it can involve more than one area. Each aspect can have different causes. A demential syndrome with mnesic impairment can be the result of a neurodegenerative process, an ischaemic damage, a trauma or a metabolic disorder. According to this theory other causes can be responsible such as psychiatric disorders (burn out, depression), organ damage like cardiovascular diseases.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> This study evaluated the prevalence of cognitive impairment and the incidence of comorbidity in elderly people affected by hypertension.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 157 elderly hypertensive patients (74 Males, 83 Females, mean age 78 + 9 years) were included.

MMSE score were inversely related to the Pulse pressure [PP] (p &lt; 0.001) and to the history of hypertension (p &lt; 0.001). Cognitive impairment was strongly related to age &gt;80. Through CIRS we detected a stronger severity in associating cognitive decline to: stroke, Parkinson disease, cardiovascular disease and depression. In detail we detected depression in 32.4% elderly hypertensive subjects, prevalently in women (p &lt; 0.05). In male elderly hypertensive and depressed patients we detected a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk compared to the non-depressed ones (12.40% vs 7.3%, p &lt; 0.05). In female elderly depressed subjects there was a slighter difference.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Prevalence of cognitive impairment was 28.7% in elderly hypertensive patients. If we consider that just 39.6% had controlled BP we assessed that an appropriate BP control was related to a higher MMSE score. Cognitive impairment was strongly related to older age and geriatric diseases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec55"><title>3.22 Metabolic and Cardiovascular Characteristics of Diabetes in Adolescents and Young Adults: the Strong Heart Study</title><p><italic>M.

All MS patients with normal adrenergic function displayed a C/C genotype, with no presence of C/T or T/T. In contrast MS patients with sympathetic overactivity displayed a C/C, C/T or T/T genotype frequency in 55, 14 and 1 respectively. The homozygotic and heterozygotic status of the T allele was more represented in people with a sustained sympathetic activation, i.e. with all 3 the above mentioned adrenergic markers increased. MS patients with C/T or T/T genotype did not differ from the C/C genotype group for age, gender, body mass index, waist circumference, waist/hip ratio, blood pressure, HOMA index or leptin values.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These findings provide evidence that in MS sympathetic activation shows a trend towards the presence of CT or T allele of rs17055869ADRA1A.

Moreover, these compounds have diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. The soluble Epoxide Hydrolase (gene name EPHX2) is responsible for metabolism of EETs to their correspondent inactive diols. Two functional polymorphisms of the EPHX2 gene, K55R and R287Q, showed respectively augmented and diminished metabolic activity in vitro and were associated with coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke in previous studies.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> To evaluate the effect of these polymorphisms on blood pressure (BP) levels, hypertension prevalence, and risk of incident cardiovascular events in more than 6000 middle-aged Swedes.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The polymorphisms were genotyped in the cardiovascular cohort of the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study. The incidence of cardiovascular events (coronary events, n = 274; ischemic stroke, n = 197) was monitored over 10 years of follow-up. The analysis of BP levels was performed twice: either excluding or including subjects under antihypertensive treatment.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In the whole population, both polymorphisms had no effect on the studied parameters but a positive interaction between male and K55R was evident: male, but not female, EPHX2 gene R55R homozygotes had significantly higher crude and adjusted systolic BP and higher hypertension prevalence with respect to K-carriers. Kaplan-Meier curves showed higher incidence of ischemic strokes in male R55R homozygotes with respect to K-carriers (p = 0.015 by log rank test). After adjustment for major cardiovascular risk factors, the hazard ratio for incident ischemic stroke in male R55R homozygotes remained significantly higher (hazard ratio: 4.8; 95% CI: 1.2, 19.9) even when baseline BP levels and hypertension prevalence were included in the Cox proportional hazard model. These polymorphisms were not associated with other metabolic syndrome related phenotypes.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> A common K55R polymorphism of the EPHX2 gene confers a higher risk of hypertension prevalence and increases the risk of incident ischemic stroke in male homozygotes.

Plasma levels of NPY are increased in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) and are independently related to left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and incident CV events in these patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Since Mendelian randomization studies are better than purely associative studies for assessing causality, we investigated the relationship between a polymorphism of NPY2R gene (T585C) and the severity of LVH at echocardiography in 239 ESRD patients (age: 60 ± 15 years; M: 135; F: 104). Furthermore, we analysed the association between NPY2R polymorphism and atherosclerosis in a representative subgroup of 133 ESRD patients who underwent the Eco-Colour Doppler study of the carotid arteries.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The distribution of NPY2R polymorphism (TT genotype: 23%; TC genotype: 46%; CC genotype: 31%) did not deviate from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. Overall, LVMI was directly related to plasma NPY concentration (r = 0.29, p &lt; 0.001). In a fully adjusted analysis, the presence of the C allele (CC and CG genotypes) was a clear-cut modifier for the effect of NPY on LVMI (highly significant interaction term in the multiple regression analysis, p = 0.008). Furthermore, the total number of atherosclerotic plaques was significantly higher (p = 0.008) in patients with the C allele (median: 4 plaques, inter-quartile range: 1–6 plaques) than in those without this allele (median: 1 plaque, inter-quartile 0–3 plaques) and this relationship remained statistically significant (α = 0.21, p = 0.01) in multiple linear regression analysis. No interaction was found between the presence of C allele and plasma levels of NPY for predicting the total number of atherosclerotic plaques.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The C allele of the NPY2R polymorphism is a modifier for the relationship between circulating levels of NPY and the severity of LVH in ESRD patients and it is independently related to the severity of carotid atherosclerosis in these patients. These results offer a genetic basis to the hypothesis that NPY is causally implicated in the high CV risk in ESRD patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec62"><title>Heart</title><sec id="Sec63"><title>5.1 Pre-Clinic Cardiac Damage in Uncomplicated Sclerodermic Patients</title><p><italic>A.C.M.

However it is not known at which stage of the disease cardiac fibrosis is detectable by ultrasonography.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> To investigate by ultrasonography if cardiac fibrosis is already detectable at an early stage in sclerodermic patients, without clinic cardiopathy and no respiratory or muscle involvement.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We studied 27 patients (22 females, 5 males, age 60.7 ± 1.7 years, means ± SE) affected by systemic sclerosis without clinically relevant cardiac, pulmonary and skeletal muscle impairment (carbon dioxide lung diffusibility DLCO, 6 min walking test, echocardiography).

It has not established, however, if these alterations can be modified by myocardial revascularization.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We investigated 39 patients (age 59 ± 3.2 years, SBP/DBP 127/72 ± 3/7 mmHg HR 66 ± 3.3, means ± SE) admitted to hospital to undergo coronary angiography because of stable ischemic cardiopathy. In 21 patients coronary angiography led to a diagnosis of significant coronary stenosis which implied a treatment by PTCA and stenting or by-pass surgery (group A). The remaining 18 patients were not treated because of the absence of significant coronary stenosis (group B). All patients were on antihypertensive, lipid lowering and antiplatelet drugs. In each patient we performed a standard echocardiogram to evaluate LV diameters, systolic and diastolic function (EF and E/A respectively) plus tissue doppler (TDI) analysis (lateral and septal mitral annulus E/Am). Moreover we assessed vascular function by means of pulse wave velocity (as index of arterial distensibility) and flow mediated dilatation (as index of endothelial function). Measurements were obtained at baseline (B) and six months later.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> At B, there was no difference in the two group as far as BP, standard systolic and diastolic function, c-f PWV (12.3 ± 0.7 vs 12.1 ± 0.7 m/s), and percentage of radial FMD increase (+11 vs 10%) were concerned, LVMI was increased and E/Am decreased in the group with severe coronary stenosis (LVMI 130.3 ± 5.3 vs 100.4 ± 7.2 gr/mq, p &lt; 0.002), (E/Am 0.6 ± 0.01 vs 0.8 ± 0.01, p &lt; 0.05). After six months the two groups A and B showed no significant change in the measured variables, except for LVMI which showed a reduction (from 130.3 ± 5.3 to 115.6 ± 8.7 gr/mq, NS.) and diastolic function evaluated by TDI which was significantly increased (septal E/Am 0.9 ± 0.01 vs 0.6 ± 0.09, p &lt; 0.03) in the group who underwent cardiac revascularization.

No changes in antihypertensive drugs were made during study time.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Mean length of CPAP treatment was 23 + 7 months. After CPAP we found: significant (p &lt; 0.001) improvement of all the respiratory parameters, significant decrease of weight, BMI, waist circumference, 24 h, day-time, night-time heart rate and diastolic BP, night-time systolic BP and LV mass index (59.7 + 2.2 to 56.4 + 1.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>,7, p = 0,04); mild increase of transmitral E/A ratio (0.94 + 0.04 to 1.03 + 0.04, p = 0.04). We subdivided patients on the basis of weight changes: in 20 patients weight was decreased &gt;2kg (W−), in 21 patients weight was unchanged or increased &gt;2kg (W+). Mean length of CPAP treatment and the extent of respiratory improvement was similar between the two groups. In W− we found a significant reduction in heart rate, 24 h BP and LV mass index (64.7 + 3.3 to 56.6 + 3.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>,7 p &lt; 0.001) and a significant increase (p &lt; 0.02) of LV diastolic indices.

No differences about LV diameters were observed. The difference of prevalence of LVH (59.6% in group with DM and 47.6% in patients without DM) did not reach statistical significance. (p = 0.85). However, the prevalence of the different patterns of LVH was significantly different between the two groups: in the group with DM, 55.35% of patients had concentric LVH, 30.35% had eccentric LVH, and 14.3% had mixed LVH [characterized by LVMI &gt;125 g/m<sup>2</sup> in men and &gt;110 g/m<sup>2</sup> in women, RWT &gt;0.45, and LV end-diastolic diameter indexed by body surface area (LVEDD/m<sup>2</sup>) &gt;3.2 in men and &gt;3.1 in women]. In the group without DM, 44.3% of patients had concentric, 48.1% had eccentric and 7.6% had mixed LVH (p = 0.026 vs group with DM).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our data show that diabetes is associated with an increase of LV mass and wall thicknesses in hypertensive patients with CKD. In our sample the prevalence of LVH was similar in patients with and without, but DM was found to be associated with higher prevalence of concentric and mixed LVH. It is likely that such influence on LV geometry may contribute to explain the unfavourable prognosis of hypertensive patients who have CKD and diabetes. In these patients a global and aggressive therapeutic approach is necessary to reduce cardiac damage and improve the prognosis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec73"><title>5.11 Determining Factors of Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) in Hypertensive Patients</title><p><italic>A.

We classified these subjects into two groups based on RWT, normal or high, using Ganau’s classification, which stratifies this echocardiographic index according to age. We considered anthropometric parameters, such as BMI, waist circumference (WC), glucose and insulin plasma concentrations at time 0’ and 120’ (G0, G120, Ins0 and Ins120), insulin-resistance index (HOMAIR), insulin-sensitivity index (EISI), aldosterone (Ald) and chromogranine-A (ChromoA).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Hypertensive subjects with elevated RWT (n. 197) have BMI, WC, Ins0, HOMAIR, Ald and ChromoA significantly higher than those with normal RWT. Male subjects with elevated RWT (n. 98) exhibit levels of Ald higher than those with normal RWT, while BMI, WC, HOMAIR and EISI are not different between the two groups. This same analysis in female subjects demonstrates that BMI, WC and chromoA are higher when RWT is increased (n. 99). Male and female subjects with increased RWT show no difference in hormonal factors with respect to normals, except for Ins120 which is higher in females.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We conclude that hormonal factors play a role in the worsening cardiac geometry of hypertension: aldosterone is important in males, chromogranine-A in females.

It is unclear whether the presence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) affects BP and echocardiographic parameters in overweight/obese hypertensive patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We studied 365 overweight/obese hypertensive patients (age ≤65 years) presenting to our Centre for BP control-related problems. Patients who underwent recent changes of antihypertensive therapy were excluded. MetS was defined according to NCEP III/ATP with AHA modifications. Left atrium diameter (LAD), ejection fraction (EF), relative wall thickness (RWT) and LVM, indexed by either body surface area (LVMi) or height 2.7 (LVM/h 2.7) were evaluated by echocardiography. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was defined as LVMi ≥125 g/m<sup>2</sup> for males and ≥110 g/m<sup>2</sup> for females and LVM/h2.7 ≥49.2 g/m2.7 for males and ≥46.7 g/m2.7 for females. Concentric remodeling was defined as RWT ≥0.42.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Two hundred and forty patients (65.8%) had MetS. Hypertensive patients with MetS had significantly higher systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP) and mean BP (MBP) and BMI than those without MetS. No difference in LVMi was found between patients with or without MetS. Hypertensive patients with MetS had higher LAD (40.3 ± 5.8 vs 38.9 ± 6 cm; p = 0.033) and LVM/h2.7 (58.6 ± 15.5 vs 53.7 ± 14.3 g/m2.7; p = 0.012), as well as reduced EF than those without MetS. Hypertensive patients with MetS have a near 2-fold higher risk to have LVH/h2.7 (unadjusted OR 1.77; 95% CI 1.12, 2.81; p = 0.01). The OR changed to 1.6 when the model was adjusted by age and MBP (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.01, 2.56; p = 0.05). Similarly, patients with MetS had a 2-fold higher risk to have concentric remodeling (OR 1.95 95% CI 1.16, 3.29, p = 0.01) also when the model was adjusted by age, sex, and MBP (OR 1.89; 95% CI 1.11, 3.22; p = 0.02). MetS lost its independent effect when BMI was included in the model.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> MetS influences BP levels, LVM and cardiac dimensions and remodeling. MetS maintains its role of risk factor for LVH and concentric LV remodeling independently of age, sex and MBP, making it a useful predictor of target organ damage in clinic practice. However, MetS loses its independent effect when BMI or obesity are taken into account, suggesting that BP and cardiac remodeling are mainly driven by the degree of adiposity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec77"><title>5.15 Early Left Ventricular Remodeling in Normotensive Male Offspring of Essential Hypertensive Parents Independent of Blood Pressure</title><p><italic>G.

Since EH+ subjects also show consistently a slightly higher blood pressure (BP), the relative contribution to such LV abnormalities of BP levels and of other BP-independent LV primary changes developing early in the prehypertensive age remains unknown.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Twenty-three normotensive sedentary male EH+ (age 25 ± 3 years) and 20 age-matched male EH− participated in the study. All of them underwent clinic BP measurement, 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM), measurements of the frequency-domain parameters of autonomic heart rate control and conventional and Doppler Tissue Echocardiographic study of both ventricles. LV Relative Wall Thickness (RWT, i.e. the ratio between the sum of inter-ventricular septum and posterior wall thickness to LV diameter) was used as a measure of LV remodeling. EH+ subjects had higher office systolic and diastolic (p &lt; 0.05), average 24-hour systolic (p &lt; 0.001), diastolic (p &lt; 0.01) and mean (p &lt; 0.05) BP.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> No between-group differences were detected for heart rate variability, systolic and diastolic function in both ventricles and left ventricular mass. A greater LV RWT (0.38 + 0.05 vs 0.34 + 0.03 SD; p &lt; 0.01) was observed in EH+. At the univariate statistical analysis, RWT showed a highly significant correlation to the condition of EH+ (p &lt; 0.004), but also it was related to: clinic systolic BP (p &lt; 0.05), average 24-hour systolic (p &lt; 0.01), diastolic (p &lt; 0.0) and mean (p &lt; 0.0) BP. Stepwise multiple regression analysis, performed assuming RWT as the dependent variable and all other variables, including age, BMI, clinic systolic and diastolic BP, ABPM-derived BP levels, HR variability and type of subjects (EH+ or EH−) as the independent variables, showed that only the condition of EH+ was independently associated with RWT (p&lt;0.006). Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves analysis showed that RWT, with a cut-off point of 0.369, predicted the condition of EH+ with a 90% specificity and a 65% sensitivity (AUC = 0.759, 95% CI = 0.61, 0.91).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our data show that a trend towards LV concentric remodeling, as indicated by a higher RWT, may be detected in EH+. Since RWT was independently associated only with the condition of EH+, and not with BP, EH+ condition is a strong predictor of early changes in LV geometry in such subjects independent of BP. This suggests that early changes in LV geometry in the prehypertensive age are paralleled, but not caused by a slightly higher BP. In addition, RWT measurement may be a quite specific tool to detect early LV alterations due to the condition of EH+.</p></sec><sec id="Sec78"><title>5.16 Left Ventricular Myocardial Performance in Normotensive Offspring of Hypertensive Parents</title><p><italic>P.

They were compared to 10 aged-matched normotensive subjects without any family history of hypertension (EH−). All subjects were sedentary and no-smoker. None of them received any pharmacological treatment. Each subject underwent office blood pressure (BP) measurement and a conventional Doppler Echocardiography including the assessment of MPI defined as the sum of LV isovolumic contraction time and isovolumic relaxation time, divided by LV ejection time. Doppler Tissue Echocardiography (DTE) also was performed at the mitral and tricuspidal anulus, at the lateral site, to evaluate the systolic and diastolic function of both ventricles. LV Relative Wall Thickness (RWT, i.e. the ratio between the sum of interventricular septum and posterior wall thickness to LV diameter) was used as a measure of LV remodeling.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Office BP was higher in EH+ than in EH−, with a statistical significance for diastolic BP (85 ± 9.2 SD vs 71.7 ± 2.9 mmHg; p &lt; 0.02). A trend towards an increase in the LV relative wall thickness (RWT) was observed in EH+ compared to EH− (0.37 ± 0.04 vs 0.31 ± 0.02; p = 0.05), whilst LV mass was unchanged (84.3 ± 13.8 vs 80.1 ± 6.6 gr/m<sup>2</sup>; p = NS). Systolic and diastolic function of both ventricles were the same in the two groups. MPI was higher in EH+ than in EH− subjects, although with no statistical significance (0.48 ± 0.10 vs 0.41 ± 0.04; p = NS), mainly due to a statistically significant prolongation of isovolumic contraction time (61.9 ± 9.2 msecs vs 51.0 ± 10.0; p &lt; 0.04).

However, at given level of EF and assuming normal mitral valve closure, LV pump performance (stroke volume [SV]) may differ, depending on Starling reserve and LV diastolic volume. Symptoms of heart failure (HF) may depend more on SV than on EF. Evaluation of low SV as a prognostic marker might be difficult because of its strong biological co-linearity with high LV mass (LVM).</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> We prognostically compared and assessed the interaction among EF, SV and LVM in a large population free of cardiovascular disease.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We analyzed 8-year survival curves of quintiles of EF, SV (z-derived method) and LV mass (LVM) in 2323 participants of the Strong Heart Study (58 ± 7 years; 62% women, 39% hypertensive patients, 45% diabetics and 54% obese) without valvular heart diseases or prevalent coronary heart diseases, stroke or heart failure.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Risk of composite fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular (CV) events progressively increased from the highest to the lowest quintiles of EF (log rank = 21.7; p = 0.0002) and from the lowest to the highest quintiles of LVM (log rank = 40.8; p &lt; 0.00001). In contrast, SV did not show significant predictive value. LVM was negatively related to EF (r = −0.37), but was positively correlated with SV (r = 0.66), (both p &lt; 0.0001). Thus, the level of LVM, could confound evaluation of the association of SV with subsequent CV events. Thus, we evaluated LV pump performance per gram of LVM (SV/LVM). Kaplan Meier curves revealed a progressively higher rate of CV events from the highest to the lowest quintiles of SV/LVM (log rank = 36.3; p &lt; 0.0001). Cox regression, adjusting for age and sex and including EF, SV and LVM showed that hazard of incident CV events increased with higher LVM (HR = 1.1/10 g, CI = 1.05, 1.12, p &lt; 0.0001) and lower SV (HR = 0.90/10 mL, CI = 0.80, 0.98; p &lt; 0.01), with no independent effect of EF (HR = 0.90/10%, CI = 0.70, 1.03, p = 0.11).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Evaluation of LV pump performance is influenced by the amount of myocardial muscle pumping blood into the arterial tree.

We evaluate hazard of incident HF (defined by the SHS Mortality and Morbidity Committee), adjusting for covariates, and also after censoring incident myocardial infarction as a competing risk event.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Diabetes was present in 1278 participants (46%, 69% women) and was associated with higher prevalence of obesity (63% vs. 46% in ND), central fat distribution (87% vs. 69%) and hypertension (53% vs. 34%, all p &lt; 0.0001).

After adjusting for age, gender, body mass index (BMI) and presence of hypertension, DM had LV mass index (LVMi) similar to ND, higher relative wall thickness, lower LV stroke index (SVi) and lower end-systolic stress, but greater cardiac output (due to higher heart rate) and pulse pressure/stroke index ratio (PP/SVi; all p from &lt;0.04 to &lt;0.001).No differences between DM and ND were found in endocardial and midwall shortening, also when controlling for end-systolic stress. Doppler transmitral E/A ratio and isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT), were lower in DM then ND (both p &lt; 0.001), also after normalization for heart rate. After adjusting for the competing risk of incident myocardial infarction, HF was predicted by LVMi and greater atrial dimensions, lower systolic shortening, longer Doppler transmitral e deceleration time, lower IVRT and greater PP/SVi (from p &lt; 0.02 to p &lt; 0.0001), independent of effect of age, gender, BMI, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and C-reactive protein. However presence of diabetes was still associated with more then two-times higher risk of HF, compared to ND, independent of all echocardiographic variables considered in the Cox model (p &lt; 0.0001). Lower IVRT and higher PP/SVi were main characteristics associated with development of HF in DM participants.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The broad spectrum of echocardiographic abnormalities associated with incident HF not due to coronary artery disease do not completely explain the greater risk of HF associated with DM. LV delayed relaxation and greater arterial stiffness are important predictors of HF in DM, but other reasons of the residual association between DM and HF remain to be clarified.</p></sec><sec id="Sec93"><title>5.31 Reproducibility of Doppler Indices of Left Ventricular Diastolic Function: the Red Trial</title><p><italic>M.

Myocardial early diastolic velocity (Em) of septal and lateral mitral annulus were measured and averaged. The ratio between transmitral e velocity and septal Em or lateral Em or average Em were calculated as estimate of LV filling pressure. The two tracings were read by two observers in each centre. The variability of test-retest measurements were assessed in both readers by computing single measurements intra-class correlations and Bland-Altman tests. Several percentiles of absolute and percent differences were also computed.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The 90% of the interval of agreement was −10.4–+13.7% for systolic blood pressure, −14.4–17.7% for diastolic blood pressure and −20–+16.5% for heart rate. For day-to-day test-retest intra-observer variability (average of three cardiac cycles), the 90% interval of agreement for the main diastolic parameters were the following: e velocity deceleration time = −39.4–+40.2 msec (−18–+25%), atrial filling fraction = −9.34–8.17% (−41–25.8%), transmitral e velocity = −0.16–+0.22 cm/sec (−28–+25%), average Em = −3.5–+3.13 cm/sec(−32–+25%), Vp = −19.4–24 cm/sec (−72–42%), E/septal Em = −2.45–2.62 (−46–27%), E/lateral Em = 2.72–2.82 (−37–+38%), E/average Em = −2.89–2.18 (−39–27%).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The test-retest variability of indices of diastolic function is substantially greater than, and can be only partially explained by, the variability of blood pressure and heart rate. Among different diastolic parameters transmitral e velocity, Tissue Doppler derived Em velocity (average of septal and lateral annulus) and E/average Em ratio show a lower day-to-day variability in comparison with colour M-mode flow propagation velocity. Based on these results E/Em ratio appears as a more stable, and possibly reliable, index of LV filling pressure than Vp.</p></sec><sec id="Sec94"><title>5.32 Hypertension is the Parameter that Explains the Association Between Metabolic Syndrome and Left Ventricular Mass in a Population of Obese Women</title><p><italic>G.

In these patients GH replacement is followed by only partial correction of this sympathetic alteration. In acromegaly old data obtained with indirect measurement of adrenergic tone have shown a normal sympathetic outflow while more recently power spectral analysis of heart rate documented a sympatho-vagal imbalance due to parasympathetic hyperactivity.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> To assess the adrenergic tone in a homogeneous group of acromegalic patients through direct measurement of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We studied three groups of subjects: (a) 12 patients (5 men; age 52.6 ± 13.6 years, mean ± SD) with untreated active acromegaly (mean baseline serum GH 10.8 ± 11.86 mg/L, mean serum IGF-I 691.2 ± 207.95 mg/L, normal serum prolactin), all characterized by short disease duration; (b) 8 healthy normotensive subjects matched for age, sex and body mass index (BMI); (c) 7 acromegalic patients controlled by somatostatin analogue (SSA) treatment. In all subjects a M- and B-mode echocardiography, an anthropometric evaluation, a study of glucose and lipid metabolism and calculation of HOMA index were performed. MSNA was recorded via the microneurographic technique, together with continuous recording of blood pressure (BP, Finapres), respiratory rate (RR, Respitrace) and heart rate (HR,EKG).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, waist circumference and lipid profile were superimposable in the three groups. The HOMA index was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased in untreated acromegalic patients. No echocardiographic signs of left ventricular hypertrophy were detected in patients, presumably because of the short duration of the disease. For superimposable mean BP, RR and HR values, mean MSNA was significantly lower in untreated patients than in controls (17.9 ± 9.4 vs 39.5 ± 8.9 bs/min, p &lt; 0.05) while in the group of SSA-controlled patients mean MSNA (31.1 ± 4.9 bs/min) shows the tendency toward a normalization of these values.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our study demonstrates that recently diagnosed acromegalic patients display a central sympathetic inhibition which is detectable despite the presence of hyperinsulinemia and insulin-resistance. This finding, together with the tendency to normalization of adrenergic tone in medically-controlled acromegalic patients and with the sympathetic hyperactivity reported in GHDA, suggests that GH/IGF-I axis has a relevant action on sympathetic neural function.</p></sec><sec id="Sec97"><title>6.2 Correlation among Cardiac and Vascular Structural Alterations and A/R Ratio in Hyperaldosteronism</title><p><italic>A.C.M.

Each subject underwent an echocardiogram to measure LV structure, LVMI, LV diastolic function (E/A ratio) and an echoDoppler to measure the carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) both at baseline (B), and in PH also 6 months after surgical intervention or initiation of medical therapy (T).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> At B, in PH vs EH BP was 142/85 ± 4.0/2.0 vs 146/92 ± 4.9/2.0 mmHg, LV mass index was 123 ± 12 vs 103 ± 5.3 g/mq, IMT was 0.62 ± 0.06 vs 0.55 ± 0.02 and E/A 1.0 ± 0.1 vs 1.2 ± 0.08. Moreover in PH, LVMI and IMT showed a highly significant positive correlation with A/R ratio (r = 0.74 and r = 0.73 respectively, p &lt; 0.01). After T, BP was significantly reduced (134/80 ± 5.3/4.0 mmHg, p &lt; 0.05 vs B) and the same thing was observed in the EH group, while other variables did not change.

Pessina</italic></p><p>Università di Padova, Padova, Italy</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Angiotensin II (Ang II) signaling via type 1 receptor (AT1R) has been extensively characterized, while Ang II signaling via type 2 receptors (AT2R), although counteracts actions mediated by AT1R, remains incompletely understood. Bartter’s/Gitelman’s patients (BS/GS) have intrinsically blunted AT1R signaling making them a good model to examine Ang II signaling via AT2R with particular emphasis on mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) that interacts with the Ang II stimulated ERK pathway of cell signaling.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> BS/GS and healthy controls fibroblasts AT1R and AT2R level and the time course were of Ang II’s effect on MKP-1 levels and ERK1/2 phosphorylation over 1 hour time course were assessed by western blot. The time course of Ang II’s effect on MKP-1 levels and ERK1/2 phosphorylation alone or in the presence of either PD123319, an AT2R blocker, or Losartan, an AT1R blocker or in combination was characterized.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> AT1R and AT2R levels did not differ between BS/GS and healthy controls. Ang II induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in BS/GS fibroblasts but peak ERK1/2 phosphorylation declined more rapidly than control and BS/GS fibroblasts also exhibited increased MKP-1 levels at 30 minutes incubation. PD123319, an AT2R blocker in BSGS fibroblasts abolished the increased MKP-1 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation time course became the same as control. Losartan, an AT1R blocker alone altered the time course of control fibroblast MKP-1 to mimic the increase seen in BS/GS fibroblasts while ERK1/2 declined concomitantly. Treatment with Losartan plus PD123319 in controls reduced MKP-1 and elevated ERK1/2 phosphorylation to those observed in BS/GS plus PD123319.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> ERK1/2 phosphorylation time course found in BS/GS fibroblasts tracked changes in MKP-1 levels and incubation with an AT2R blocker, PD123319 abrogated those responses. Losartan, an AT1R blocker, reproduced these changes in healthy controls while the presence in controls of both AT1R and AT2R inhibitors abolished these changes. These data strongly suggest that MKP-1 is a major effector in altering ERK1/2 phosphorylation status. Moreover the results explain the blunted responses in BS/GS reported for Ang II short and long term effects, provide insight into the mechanisms responsible and thereby yield additional support for the role of AT2R signaling in the proposed effects of Ang II AT1R blockers beyond AT1R blockade.</p></sec><sec id="Sec99"><title>6.4 ACE2 and Angiotensin 1-7 are Increased in a Human Model of Cardiovascular Hyporeactivity: Pathophysiological Implications</title><p><italic>L.A. Calò, S. Schiavo, E. Pagnin</italic> and <italic>A.C.

In addition, while Ang 1–7 has antiarrhythmic properties, at higher concentration it may induce ventricular tachycardia and sudden death. ACE2, therefore, may play essential role in blood pressure homeostasis, hypertension long term complications (cardiovascular remodeling) and in the induction of cardiac electric abnormalities.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> This study evaluated in Bartter’s/Gitelman’s patients (BS/GS), who have elevated Ang II level and endogeneous blockade of Ang II type 1 receptor signaling, the levels of ACE2 and Ang 1–7 compared with healthy subjects and essential hypertensive patients. BS/GS were also considered given their not completely clarified predisposition to cardiac arrhythmias.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Mononuclear cell ACE2 and Ang 1–7 were evaluated using western blot.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Both ACE2 (1.59 ± 0.63) and Ang 1–7 (2.26 ± 1.18) were significantly elevated in BS/GS compared with either normotensive controls (0.98 ± 0.45; p = 0.021; 1.12 ± 0.48, p = 0.018 respectively) and hypertensive patients (1.06 ± 0.24; p = 0.022; 0.72 ± 0.28; p = 0.005, respectively). ACE2 and Ang 1–7 directly correlated only in BS/GS (r = 0.914, p = 0.001).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The increases of ACE2 and Ang 1–7 in BS/GS mirror those in hypertensive patients and are in line with the clinic, haemodynamic and pathophysiological characteristics of BS/GS patients, likely contributing to them and further strengthen the importance of ACE2/Ang 1–7 system in cardiovascular biology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec100"><title>6.5 Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System and Erythrocyte Tyr-Phosphorylation of 3 Band Endometriosis</title><p><italic>S.

The prooxidative action of aldosterone has been associated both to genomic and non genomic effects. We have recently showed that the inflammatory process can also be evaluated in erythrocytes analyzing biochemical parameters of the erythrocyte membranes, as in the case of Tyr-phosphorylation of 3 band. Moreover, the analysis of this protein could provide further material for evaluating the inflammatory status associated with endometriosis, a gynaecological situation associated with inflammatory status and cardiovascular complications.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> To evaluate the renin aldosterone axis in these patients and to evaluate the non genomic oxidative status in erythrocytes of these patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 15 patients affected by ovarian endometriosis and 15 healthy controls matched for BMI and age were studied. Diagnosis was made by the usual exams and laparoscopy. The following plasma parameters were measured: A, PRA, sodium, potassium. Erythrocytes were isolated to measure total glutathione, oxidized glutathione, the analysis of the Tyr-phosphorylation levels in band 3 of the erythrocyte membranes and of its modifications/alterations at the membrane level.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Plasma aldosterone in sitting position was significantly higher in endometriosis (509 ± 198 pmol/L) than control group (206.83 ± 129.04 pmol/L), p &lt; 0.05. In all patients, after surgery A levels were lower (315 ± 81.5 pmol/L, p &lt; 0.05). PRA and electrolytes did not change after surgery while aldosterone/PRA ratio was normal. The in vitro data of the erythrocytes isolated from the patients showed an increase of the Tyr-phosphorylation of the band 3 of the erythrocyte membrane and a minor concentration of glutathione reduced in oxidative stress conditions.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Endometriosis is associated with an increase of aldosterone and with Tyr-phosphorylation at the level of erythrocyte membrane and all these abnormalities are reversed after surgery. We hypothesize that aldosterone plays an important role in the inflammatory state of endometriosis. The analysis of the Tyr-phosphorylation of band 3 of this protein could be related to a non genomic effect of aldosterone on plasma membrane as reported by other studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec101"><title>6.6 Effects of Female Sex Hormones and Contraceptive Pill on the Diagnostic Work-Up for Primary Aldosteronism</title><p><italic>F.

The screening test was considered to be positive when plasma aldosterone concentration was &gt;150 pg/mL and orthostatic ARR was &gt;32 pg/mL (ratio of aldosterone, expressed as pg/mLl-1, to direct active renin, expressed as pg/mL-1). We enrolled also 33 healthy fertile women, and analyzed ARR during free menstrual cycle (in the mid-cycle and luteal phase) and after two months of oral contraceptive (OC) therapy.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In 46 out of 85 hypertensive patients diagnosis of PA was confirmed by iv SL test. Patients with positive SLT and patients with negative SLT differed only for gender distribution and ARR values: 85.2% of males with an elevated ARR at the initial screening had the PA diagnosis confirmed, compared with only 39.7% of females. In the healthy women population, an increase of renin and aldosterone concentrations occurred in the first to the second phase of menstrual period, with a substantially unchanged ARR. By contrast, after OC therapy renin values were nearly halved, aldosterone only slightly decreased and ARR doubled with mean values over the cut-off for PA screening.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> ARR screening fails to predict the diagnosis of PA in the majority (60.3%) of hypertensive women as compared with 14.8% of hypertensive men. Variations of ARR during menstrual phases and after oral contraceptives may contribute to such diagnostic inaccuracy in females.</p></sec><sec id="Sec102"><title>6.7 Nitric Oxide and Aldosterone Secretion in Human Hypertension</title><p><italic>C.

Experimental hypertension induced by chronic NO-synthase inhibition is associated with increased plasma Aldo and interstitial fibrosis, which is reversed by spironolactone. In order to investigate the relationship between NO and Aldo secretion in human hypertension, we examined whether platelet cGMP, as a marker of NO activity, is related to plasma Aldo in essential hypertensive patients (EH).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In 103 untreated EH males (age 43.4 ± 1.4 yr, K + 4.2 ± 0.04 mEq/L), systolic, diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP, sphygmo) and heart rate (HR, pulse rate) were measured after a 60 min supine rest and venous blood was sampled for determination of plasma Aldo, renin activity (PRA), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and platelet cGMP (PLTcGMP; RIA on acid extracts of washed platelets).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The main findings of our study are shown in the table (mean ± S.E). In a univariate analysis, Aldo was directly related to PRA (r = 0.57, p &lt; 0.01) and inversely to ANP (r = −0.20, p &lt; 0.05) and PLT cGMP (r = −0.22, p &lt; 0.05); this last parameter was unrelated to PRA (r = −0.11, ns) and to ANP (r = −0.12, ns). In a multiple regression analysis, plasma Aldo was predicted by PRA (beta = 0.53, p &lt; 0.001), by PLT cGMP (beta = −0.17, p &lt; 0.05) and not by ANP (beta = −0.13, p = 0.12).

Several evidence have suggested tha there is a functional link between ETs and aldosterone. ETs have been show to act via ET(A and ET(B) receptors as aldosterone secretagogues in vitro and in vivo and may promote activation and proliferation of adrenal cells. Recent studies have also shown that aldosterone can, in turn, up-regulate ET-1 expression.

We also examined the mRNA expression of the ET system in tissue samples from aldosterone-producing adenomas (APAs, n = 9) and control normal adrenal (n = 3).Tissue mRNA expression of the ET system was assayed with Affymetrix microarrays.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> ET-1 levels did not differ between inferior vena cava and adrenal vein blood in both bilateral adrenal hyperplasia and APA patients. Even after normalization for local cortisol levels (to account for sampling variability related to adrenal vein cannulation), normalize adrenal blood ET-1 levels did not differ ipsilaterally and contralaterally to the APA (4.3 ± 2.5 vs 7.2 ± 3.4 pg ET-1/μg cortisol). Through gene expression profiling with microarray, n significant difference was observed between ET-1 mRNA levels in APAs and in normal adrenal samples (fold change −1.06, p = 0.84). Similarly, ECE-1, ECE-2, ET(A) and ET(B were all similarly expressed in APA samples as compared with normal adrenals (p &gt; 0.05) Microarray findings were further confirmed by quantitative real time PCR.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The present data argue against the hypothesis that adrenal gland ET-1 secretion is enhanced in PA and do not support a general role for adrenal ETs in the vascula pathophysiology of PA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec104"><title>6.9 Impact of Accessory Hepatic Veins on the Selectivity Index during Adrenal Vein Sampling for Identification of Surgically Curable Primary Aldosteronism</title><p><italic>G.P.

Nevertheless, 15% of AVS are not selective at the right side, presumably because of the blood dilution from accessory vein blood.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> To investigate the impact of accessory veins on the assessment of AVS selectivity.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In 73 consecutive PA patients undergoing AVS we prospectively determined at phlebography the presence of accessory veins draining into adrenal veins. The selectivity index (SI) was calculated as the ratio between plasma cortisol concentration (PCC) in the right or left adrenal vein and the infrarenal inferior vena cava (IVC). The diagnosis of APA was based on the ‘four corner’ approach.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> On the right side the venous anatomic pattern could be conclusively determined in 93% of the cases: we detected hepatic accessory veins in 12.1%, no accessory veins in 42.4%, and capsular veins in 45.5%. On the left side the anatomic venous pattern entailed phrenic veins in 89.1% of the cases and capsular accessory veins in the remaining 10.9%. On either side we found no effect of capsular and phrenic accessory veins on the SI. By contrast, on the right side the presence of hepatic accessory veins was associated with SI values about ten-fold lower as compared to the absence of such accessory veins (12.72 ± 2.41 vs 1.26 ± 0.32, p = 0.01), even when adrenal catheterization was judged to be selective at phlebography. Superselective adrenal catherization resulted into high values of the SI (34.2 ± 18.76, range 4.8–84.2) in these cases.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Hepatic accessory veins sharing common egress into the inferior vena cava with the right adrenal vein occur in about 12% of the patients and imply a low SI, likely because of adrenal blood dilution by hepatic blood carrying a low cortisol concentration. Super-selective catheterization of the right adrenal vein is necessary in these conditions, as bilaterally selective AVS data are required to accurately attribute lateralization of aldosterone secretion to the APA side.</p></sec><sec id="Sec105"><title>6.10 Within-Patient Reproducibility of the ARR for the Screening of Primary Aldosteronism</title><p><italic>G.P.

However, scant data on its reproducibility exist.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> To investigate the within-patient reproducibility of the ARR using the PAPY study dataset.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In the PAPY study, a large prospective multicenter study that enrolled 1125 consecutive hypertensive patients referred to specialized centers for Hypertension in Italy, the ARR was determined at the baseline screening in all patients, and repeated before the saline infusion test, after on average 4 weeks, in the patients with an ARR &gt;40 and in one every four of those with an ARR &lt;40 according to a predefined protocol. The patients were carefully prepared from the pharmacologic standpoint, as previously described. The diagnosis of aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA), based on the ‘four corner criteria’, was used as referent. The Bland-Altman plot and coefficient of repeatability were used to determine the reproducibility of the ARR.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Data for within-patients comparison of the ARR were available in 262 patients, of which 43 were conclusively diagnosed as APA. The ARR showed a highly significant within—patient correlation (r = 0.51, p &lt; 0.0001) and repeatability. By Bland &amp; Altman plot we found no evidence for proportional, magnitude- related, and absolute systematic error between the two ARR; moreover, only 4.3% of the values, e.g. the proportion that was predicted by chance, fell out of the 95% confidence interval for the between test difference. Finally, the overall concordance rate of the two ARR for pinpointing APA patients was 85%. Most discordant or false negative results could be accounted for by obvious protocol violations.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Albeit being performed under different conditions in a large multicenter study, the ARR showed a good within-patient repeatability.

Lenzini, T.M. Seccia, B. Caroccia</italic> and <italic>G.P. Rossi</italic></p><p>Clinica Medica 4, Padova, Italy</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Primary aldosteronism is the most common endocrine cause of hypertension but its underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Aldosterone Producing Adenomas (APAs) were found to be heterogeneous at both the clinic and the molecular level. They respond differently in vivo to stimuli as ACTH and angiotensin II and despite featuring aldosterone overproduction they exhibited a heterogeneous expression of the steroidogenic enzymes when assessed with a whole transcriptome approach. Thus, the mechanisms leading to hyperaldosteronism and APA development are by far more complex than increased aldosterone synthase gene expression.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> To disentangle this complexity we investigated the expression profile of microRNAs (miR), a number of short nucleotide RNA molecules that regulate gene expression for which no data in APAs are currently available.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The miR expression profile was measured by an oligomicroarray technique in APAs (N = 20) for which whole transcriptome data were already available, using the normal adrenal cortex (N = 3) as referent. Seven hundred twenty-three human and seventy six human viral miR sequences were quantified, using the Human miRNA Microarrays platform (Agilent Technologies). Results were analyzed using the Rosetta Resolver™ statistical software. Significant differences of miR expression were validated by real time RT-PCR, using RNU48 as housekeeping sequence.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Overall there were no significant changes of miR sequences across APAs. However, as compared to the normal adrenal cortex a significant under-expression of miR199b and miR199a, which was validated by real time PCR was found. MiR 199b (mean expression fold change = −6.5 ± 5.0) and miR199a (−4.8 ± 13.9) were under-expressed in 95% and 75% of the APAs, respectively. A search of miR199a and miR199b targets by bioinformatics tools and its matching to the whole transcriptome data revealed some unexpected pathways that are currently investigated by functional experiments.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This homogeneous miR199b and miR199a under-expression contrasts markedly with the heterogeneous transcriptome profile in APAs; moreover, by involving these miR sequences in the physiopathology of APA, these findings mandate experiments aimed at defining the functional pathways associated with miR199 under-expression.</p></sec><sec id="Sec107"><title>6.12 ‘Ether-À-Go-Go Like’ (ELK)-1 Expression in he Aldosterone Producing Adenoma (APA)</title><p><italic>T.M.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this divergent responsiveness to ACTH are unknown.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> To investigate if: (1) ACTH-R and ACTH-NR APA are characterized by different gene profiles, and (2) cultured cells isolated from ACTH-R or ACTH-NR APA maintain the responsiveness to ACTH in vitro and therefore can be useful to explore the mechanisms of the responsiveness to ACTH.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> APA were diagnosed by the ‘four corner’ criteria developed in the PAPY Study (JACC 2006;48:2293). RNA from APA (n = 16) and pooled control RNAs from normal adrenocortical tissues (n = 8) were hybridized to Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray. The microarray results were analysed with Feature Extraction and Rosetta Resolver and results were confirmed with quantitative real time RT-PCR (Q RT-PCR). Cells isolated from APA were incubated with 10–8 M ACTH and aldosterone secretion in the medium (RIA) and CYP11B2 gene expression was analyzed (Q RT-PCR). APA cells were also cultured and examined with electron microscopy (EM) at day 2, 4, and 6.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> We identified 24 genes that differed between ACTH-R and ACTH-NR APA, of which four code for K+ channel subunits. The 24 gene subset allowed correct classification of APA as ACTH-R or ACTH-NR with an overall accuracy greater than 80%, when applied retrospectively. KCNH8, which encodes for the ‘ether-à-go-go like’K+ channel (elk)-1, exhibited the most marked expression differences between ACTH-R and ACTH-NR APAs. Q-RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis confirmed the elk-1 gene expression in APAs. EM showed that the cultured cells maintained their original features only up to day 4. Noteworthy, after ACTH stimulation aldosterone production and CYP11B2 mRNA expression in the isolated and cultured cells at day 4 did not differ between ACTH-R and ACTH-NR.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study evidences (1) different molecular signatures of ACTH-R and ACTH-NR APAs; (2) the presence of elk-1 in adrenocortical and APA cells. Elk-1, being differently expressed in ACTH-R and ACTH-NR APAs,might account for their divergent ACTH responsiveness. The dissociation between the <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> responsiveness to ACTH of APA cells indicates that freshly isolated or cultured APA cells cannot be a useful tool for investigating the mechanisms underlying the in vivo responsiveness to ACTH.</p></sec><sec id="Sec108"><title>6.13 Expression of HE Adipokine CTRP-1 in the Human Adrenal Gland and The Arterial Wall: a Link Between Hyperaldosteronism and Vascular Remodelling?</title><p><italic>G.

Since it was found to stimulate aldosterone production in the adrenocarcinoma- derived cell line H295R, we hypothesize that CTRP-1 may represent a patho-physiologic link between hyperaldosteronism and arterial hypertension in overweight-obese patients.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> (1) To investigate whether CTRP-1 is expressed in the human adrenal gland and/or the arterial wall, and (2) to identify the cell type that synthesizes CTRP-1.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> CTRP-1 gene expression was measured with quantitative real-time RT-PCR (Light-Cycler 480, Roche). RNA was extracted following a standard protocol (RNAeasy kit, Qiagen) from human adrenal tissue (incidentaloma, n = 2, pheochromocitoma, n = 5, aldosterone producing adenoma (APA), n = 8), omental and periadrenal adipose tissue (n = 4), and fibroblasts, vascular muscle cells (VSMCs), endothelial cells and H295. Expression levels were calculated with ΔΔCt method. CTRP-1 protein expression was investigated with immunohistochemistry (IHC) in paraffin-included sections from adrenal tissue, adipose tissue, aorta, and pulmonary, tibial, and mammary arteries. The presence of CTRP-1 protein was then confirmed with immunoblot.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> CTRP-1 gene was found to be expressed in the adipose tissue (expression level: 181 ± 105) and all adrenal tissues examined. Higher expression levels were found in pheocromocitomas (50 ± 22) as compared to both APA (30 ± 10) and incidentalomas (33 ± 23). All the examined cell types express CTRP-1, with higher expression levels in VSMCs than in endothelial cells and fibroblasts. IHC showed CTRP-1 protein expression in the adrenal gland and the adipose tissue. Immunoreactivity was markedly positive in the media layer of the small periadrenal arteries, less intense in the mammary, pulmonary and tibial arteries, and barely detectable in the aorta.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> CTRP-1 expression is not restricted to the adipose tissue, but occurs also in the adrenal tissue and the arterial wall. The high CTRP-1 expression levels in the APA and pheochromocitoma suggest that CTRP-1 may modulate the aldosterone synthesis in the zona glomerulosa by autocrine/paracrine effects. The marked CTRP-1 expression in the media of the small arteries and the VSMCs suggest a role of CTRP-1 in the vascular remodelling associated with hyperaldosteronism.</p></sec><sec id="Sec109"><title>6.14 Anti-Inflammatory Anti-Fibrotic Effect of Angiotensin AT2 Receptor Stimulation or AT1 Receptor Blockade in Scleroderma</title><p><italic>F.

Animals were randomised in 4 treatment groups (n = 6 each): (i) control group, (ii) Bleomycin; (iii) Bleomycin + AT1R blocker, Candesartan (0.1 mg/kg bw, s.c. every day); (iv) Bleomycin + AT2R agonist, Compound21 (0.3 mg/kg bw, s.c. every day). Subsequently, tissue samples were collected and analysed for markers of inflammation and fibrosis by real time RT-PCR, Western Blotting and conventional histological staining (HE).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> After 4 weeks of Bleomycin injection, histological analysis showed an increased in extracellular matrix primarily within the subdermal layers. This fibrotic reaction was ameliorated both by Compound21 and Candesartan treatment. Histological reduction of fibrosis as a result of Compound21 or Candesartan treatment coincided with a reduced expression of precollagen IáI and TGFα as estimated by Western Blot. Furthermore, Bleomycin elicited an increase in IL-6 and MCP-1 mRNA expression, which could be significantly reduced by Compound21 and Candesartan. Experiments in vitro on human fibroblasts show results similar to our murine model.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our data indicate that pharmacological interference with the cutaneous RAS by AT1R blockade or by AT2R stimulation could be a potential therapeutic approach to reduce inflammation and fibrosis in scleroderma and, potentially, in other pathological settings with similar pathomechanism.</p></sec><sec id="Sec110"><title>6.15 Adrenal Gland Surgery in Hypertensive Patients: a Follow-Up Evaluation</title><p><italic>A.

The hypertensive group had patients with recent onset of hypertension or old diagnosis of the disease, but with recently developed resistance to drug therapy. Only 10 of hypertensive patients them had not family history of hypertension. All of patients had performed a adrenal gland MRI or TC before surgery, with the aim of defining the volume of the tumors. Spongiocytic adenomas (n = 9) had a volume of 1.0–7.0 cm, micronodular hyperplasias (n = 4) were 0.5–3.0 cm, pheochromocytomas (Pheo) (n = 8) were 3–5 cm, 1 haemorrhagic lesion had a volume of 12 cm, 1 mielolipoma 5 cm, 1 mixoid liposarcoma 17 cm, and 1 adenocarcinoma 6 cm.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Concerning hormone evaluation, 1 adenocarcinoma, 2 of 4 cases of micronodular hyperplasia, and 8 of 9 cases of spongiocytic adenomas were characterized by high 24-hour urine cortisol. Only 2 of 8 cases of Pheo had high 24-hour urine catecholamines. Plasma aldosterone/PRA ratio was high in all cases of micronodular hyperplasias and in 6 of 9 cases of spongiocytic adenomas. Plasma DHEAS was high only in the patient with adenocarcinoma. High blood pressure (BP) was normalized after 1 month of adrenal gland removal in all patients with Pheo, in all subjects with micronodular hyperplasias, and in 7 of 9 cases of spongiocytic adenomas. After 6 months from surgery, BP had increased in 2 of 8 patients with Pheo, in 2 of 4 subjects with micronodular hyperplasias, and in 5 of 9 cases of spongiocytic adenomas.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Hypertensive patients who underwent adrenal gland removal have not actually solved their problem of hypertension. Whether this result is due to a pre-existing essential hypertension, it is difficult to explain by the BP changes after 6 months from surgery.We would like to suggest that it is very important the clinic evaluation in patients with adrenal gland alterations, to decide whether and when to address the patient to the surgeon and what to wait for after adrenal gland removal.</p></sec><sec id="Sec111"><title>6.16 Assessment of Various Forms of Organ Damage in Patients with Primary Aldosteronism</title><p><italic>M.L.

Cardiac Output was increased in LP (Δ + 30%; p = 0.03) mainly due to the combined increase in Stroke Volume and Heart Rate (HR). Furthermore, LV mass was increased in LP (Δ + 23%; p = 0.04) with a high prevalence of LV hypertrophy (n = 3; 43%), classified as EH in 2 cases, and as CH in 1 case.

In a small number of patients (n = 3 cases reported in literature) blood pressure decline spontaneously.</p><p><bold>Clinic Case:</bold> In May 2007 our patients with idiopathic hyperaldosteronism expressed the willing to get pregnant. She was referred to our clinic for the first time in 2005, when she is 28 years old, with palpitation and severe hypertension. After hormonal evaluation, CT scan of adrenal glands and the adrenal venous sampling, PA due to bilateral aldosterone oversecretion was diagnosed. She started treatment with MR antagonist (potassium canrenoate, 100 mg/day) and calcium channel antagonist (amlodipine 10 mg/day) with good control of high blood pressure (130/80 mmHg) and maintenance of normokalemia. Planning a pregnancy, the MR antagonist was withdrawn due to the concern of causing possible feminization of male infant, while calcium channel blocker was continued and oral potassium supplementation was started (40–48 mEq/day). In July 2007 she got pregnant. During pregnancy, despite higher aldosterone levels (219 pg/mLat 11a week, 561 pg/mL at 24a week and 860 pg/mL at 36a week) with arising in progesterone (42.5 ng/mL at 11a week, 95 ng/mL at 24a week and 232 ng/mL at 36a week), blood pressure decline to normal values so that she gradually discontinued antihypertensive treatment and continued only potassium supplementation. The patient was tightly followed by clinic and biochemical evaluations during pregnancy which course was uncomplicated. She had a vaginal delivery at term (38 weeks of gestation), and gave birth to a healthy boy. Pathological examination of the placenta showed a normal vascular structure without signs of damage due to aldosterone excess. 24 hour after the delivery, supine plasma aldosterone levels were 299 pg/mL while plasma progesterone values were 31 ng/mL. The post-delivery course was characterized by normotension until 4 days after delivery, then blood pressure began to rise again and she had to reintroduce antihypertensive treatment, while the aldosterone levels started to decreased.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We conclude that a previous planning of pregnancy, an early and appropriate medical therapy and vigilance regarding the occurrence of possible complications are recommended in the not rare condition of PA in pregnancy, in order to reduce both the maternal and fetal risks associated with this disease.</p></sec><sec id="Sec115"><title>7.3 Pregnancy in Women with Chronic Hypertension: Outcome and Complications</title><p><italic>Francesca Vettore</italic>,<sup>1</sup><italic>Grazia Guzzetta</italic>,<sup>1</sup><italic>Anna Realdi</italic>,<sup>1</sup><italic>Giulia Inverso</italic>,<sup>1</sup><italic>Luisa Macchini</italic>,<sup>1</sup><italic>Paola Caielli</italic>,<sup>1</sup><italic>Giacomo Strapazzon</italic>,<sup>1</sup><italic>Martino Pengo</italic>,<sup>1</sup><italic>C.

The choice of antihypertensive drugs in women who want to conceive must be prudent as some antihypertensive drugs are not safe for the infant and the pharmacological treatment of hypertension during pregnancy only limits progression to severe hypertension.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> To correlate pregnancy outcome, complications with antihypertensive treatment and blood pressure control in patients with chronic hypertension.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We identified 49 pregnant hypertensive patients attending the hypertension outpatient clinic of Padua between 1983 and 2008 with 54 pregnancies. Aetiology of hypertension, antihypertensive treatment before, during and after pregnancy, number and type of drugs, office blood pressure control during pregnancy, risk factors for pre-eclampsia, laboratory findings suggestive of pre-eclampsia, course and outcome of pregnancy were assessed.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Forty five patients (92%) had essential hypertension and 38 (73%) had been taking antihypertensive drugs before pregnancy. During pregnancy, 30 patients were treated with two or more antihypertensive drugs. Blood pressure control was good in 31 patients (59%). Twenty nine patients (56%) had maternal or foetal complications with 10 terminations of pregnancy and 84% caesarean section delivery. Risk factors for pre-eclampsia were not different between pregnant women with or without complications. Twenty eight out of 29 (97%) pregnant women with complications had been taking antihypertensive drugs. The incidence of complications was higher in treated (28/48, 58%) than in untreated patients (1/4, 25%), but the difference was not statistically significant. Beta blockers, alone or in combination, were significantly associated with complications. Upon multivariate linear regression analysis, low birth weight was independently associated with beta blocker treatment (beta = −0.218, p &lt; 0.05) and duration of pregnancy (beta = 0.791, p &lt; 0.001), but duration of pregnancy did not differ in patients treated with or without beta-blockers.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Women with chronic hypertension who begin a pregnancy are at high risk of maternal and foetal complications, and above all those with severe hypertension. Antihypertensive treatment and blood pressure control during pregnancy do not reduce the risk of complications, with beta-blocker administration linked to the largest incidence, especially low birth weight. Hypertensive women need a close follow-up, before, during and after pregnancy to plan the best diagnostic and therapeutic work up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec116"><title>7.4 Left Ventricular Structure and Function and Blood Pressure Values in Women with Previous Pre-Eclampsia</title><p><italic>M.

Most studies analysed the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors or the occurrence of CV events in the long term (9–14 years after delivery). Very few data are available on the time course of blood pressure (BP) increase and of cardiovascular target organ damage development in these patients.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> To evaluate arterial blood pressure and cardiovascular structural changes in patients with a previous first pregnancy complicated by pre-eclampsia as compared to subjects with a previous first uncomplicated pregnancy, 2 years after delivery.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 15 women with previous PE (defined as SAP ≥ 140 and/or DAP ≥ 90 mmHg and proteinuria &gt;0.3 gr/24-hour) and 15 women with a previous uncomplicated pregnancy, matched for demographic and anthropometric variables, underwent a follow up visit 30 ≥ 7 months after delivery. In all patients echocardiography (Mono-bidimensional+conventional and tissue Doppler analysis) was performed for the evaluation of left ventricular structure and function.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The two groups were comparable for age, weight, BMI and duration of follow up. Mean age was 36 ± 10 years, gestational age at diagnosis of PE was 29.6 ± 2.6 W. Systolic BP was similar in the two groups, while diastolic BP was significantly higher in patients with previous pre-eclampsia (114 ± 10 vs 112 ± 7 mmHg, p n.s and 67 ± 8 vs 72 ± 6 mmHg, p &lt; 0.05). Left ventricular (LV) mass index and relative wall thickness were not different in the two groups (24.5 ± 7 vs 26 ± 5 gr/h2.7 and 0.27 ± 0.03 vs 0.26 ± 0.03, respectively, p = NS), as were indices of LV systolic function. Left atrial diameter was significantly greater in patients with previous PE (3.3 ± 0.3 vs 3.0 ± 0.3, p &lt; 0.05). The ratio of mitral annular e velocity (Em) to annular A velocity (Am) was significantly lower in PE (1.7 ± 0.5 vs 2.1 ± 0.5 respectively, p &lt; 0.05) and the ratio of transmitral e velocity (E) to annular e velocity (Em), a reliable marker of LV filling pressures, was significantly higher in patients with previous PE in comparison to controls (7.01 ± 1.3 vs 6.2 ± 1.0 respectively, p &lt; 0.05).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our findings suggest that, in patients with previous PE, an early increase in BP values may be observed associated with structural and functional changes of diastolic filling and relaxation indexes.

Experimental data indicate that P-450 (CYP)-derived metabolites of arachidonic acid, implicated in the control blood pressure and renal excretion of sodium, may have a role in altered placental vascularization, as well as the development of hypertension and renal dysfunction in pre-eclamptic women.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We set up a cross-sectional study in which women with pre-eclampsia (hypertension after the 20th week of pregnancy plus proteinuria &gt;300 mg/day) were compared with normotensive pregnant women of the same gestational age (30–39 weeks) and non-pregnant women. The three groups were pair-matched for age (22–38 years), pre-gravidic BMI (below 26 in all the pre-eclamptic women) and the absence of metabolic risk factors (obesity, diabetes, pre-existing arterial hypertension). Plasma concentrations of epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EETs) and their metabolites (DHETs, also measured in urine), together with plasma concentration and urinary excretion of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) were measured by mass-spectrometry.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A preliminary analysis of the data showed that EETs are significantly higher in normotensive pregnant (median 11.5 ng/mL; range: 5.9–25.2; n = 11) and pre-eclamptic women (13.7 ng/mL; 6.8–48.0; n = 8), compared to non-pregnant controls (7.4 ng/mL; 3.7–10.3; n = 8, p &lt; 0.05), with no significant differences in DHETs, data indicating a possible reduction in epoxide hydrolase activity in late pregnancy. Similarly to what observed in other hypertensive conditions, the urinary excretion of 20-HETE was lower in pre-eclamptic women (1.3 ng/h; 0.2–2.6, n = 8, p &lt; 0.05), compared to normotensive pregnant (3.1 ng/h; 0.5–30.8; n = 11) and non-pregnant women (3.3 ng/h; 0.8–28.3; n = 11). In pre-eclamptic women blood pressure was higher, although treated, as was arterial stiffness, measured by means of a pulse wave analyzer (Stiffness Index 8.3; 6.8–10.7; non-pregnant women: 6.8; 4.4–7.3; p &lt; 0.05).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our data indicate that CYP-dependent arachidonic acid metabolism is altered during pregnancy and suggest a role for CYP-derived metabolites of arachidonic acid in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia, independently of any pre-existing risk factor.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec118"><title>Imaging Techniques</title><sec id="Sec119"><title>8.1 Evaluation of the Relationship between Carotid Arterial Stiffness, Assessed with E-Tracking, and Left Ventricular Diastolic Function in Diabetics and Hypertensive Patients with Coronary Microcirculation Disease</title><p><italic>F.

Subjects with increased arterial stiffness PWV is high, and the backward waves from the periphery return earlier to the ascending aorta. Since this backward waves coming from the periphery arrive during the LV ejection, they raise the central systolic blood pressure and the LV afterload and decrease the central diastolic pressure and the coronary perfusion pressure. These changes may cause ischaemia particularly in the subendocardium, which if chronic is associated with left ventricular interstitial fibrosis.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> We assessed the arterial stiffness by a non-invasive new tool known as ‘e-tracking, Aloka, Japan’ and the diastolic function with tissue Doppler imaging in patients with coronary micro-circulation disease proved by typical anginous synthomatology, negative coronary angiography, positive myocardial scintigraphy stress test.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We have observed 40 consecutive patients with angina, proved by typical clinic history, positive myocardial scintigraphy stress test and negative coronary angiography.

Whether this is the case in mild renal failure is unknown, however. It is also unknown which of the two alterations has an earlier appearance in the clinic course of the disease.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In 22 mild-to-moderate renal failure patients belonging to stage 2–3 of the National Kidney Foundation Classification, due to nephrosclerosis or chronic interstitial nephritis (15 males, 7 females; age: 61.7 ± 2.1 years; creatinine clearance: 46.6 ± 3.3 mL/min, mean ± SEM), we measured beat-to-beat blood pressure (Finapres), heart rate (EKG), plasma norepinephrine (HPLC) and muscle sympathetic nerve traffic during a 30 min resting period (MSNA, microneurography, peroneal nerve). Measurements, which included ADMA and symmetric dimethylarginine SDMA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay), were performed also in 12 age-matched healthy control subjects.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In renal failure patients MSNA values were significant increased as compared to controls (68.4 ± 3.3 vs 36.8 ± 5.7 bursts/100 hb, p &lt; 0.01), this being the case for plasma norepinephrine (323.3 ± 73 vs 210.8 ± 29, p &lt; 0.05) and, although to a lesser extent, for heart rate (73.1 ± 2.8 vs 68.6 ± 1.9 beats/min, p = 0.07). In contrast, both ADMA and SDMA were still in the normal range with values similar to controls (0.72 ± 0.03 vs. 0.68 ± 0.08 and 1.03 ± 0.1 vs 0.94 ± 0.2 μmol/L, p = NS). No significant relationship was found between ADMA, SDMA and direct (MSNA) or indirect (heart rate, norepinephrine) indices of adrenergic cardiovascular tone.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These findings provide evidence that in mild to moderate renal failure two markers of adrenergic drive such as plasma NE and MSNA display a substantial increase well before any significant raise in ADMA and SDMA. This suggests that sympathetic activation (1) precedes methylarginines accumulation in the development and progression of the renal disease and (2) may be responsible for the more advanced appearance of the endothelial alteration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec124"><title>9.2 Frequency and Co-Frequency of Cardiac, Renal and Vascular Damage in a Group of Treated Hypertensive Patients</title><p><italic>L.

Organ damage was assessed in the kidney by the presence of microalbuminuria (spot urine), a glomerular filtration rate &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (MDRD) or a creatinine clearance &lt;60 mL/min (CrCl-Cockroft-Gault equation) in the hearth by the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH, echocardiography) and left ventricular mass index (LVM, M ≥ 125 g/m<sup>2</sup>; W ≥ 110 g/m<sup>2</sup>) and in large arteries by the presence of a common carotid intima-media thickness &gt; 0.9 mm (ecocolordoppler, IMT).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Average (±SD) blood pressure was 142.1 ± 18.6 (SBP) and 86.4 ± 10.3(DBP) mmHg in the wall population. LVH was present in 241 (48%) of the patients, the prevalence was 5%, 14% and 10% for reduced GFR, reduced CrCl and increased IMT, respectively. There was a highly significantly correlation (p &lt; 0.01) between all measure of organ damage although their values were never high (between 0.15 and 0.36). The relation of CrCl with LVH survived in a multiple regression model considering all risk factors measured. Organ damage in one organ was present in 39% of patients, the prevalence of two and three organ damage was 13% and 3% respectively.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In essential hypertension organ damage is common even when blood pressure is close to or near normal values. Multiorgan damage is more rarely. CrCl seems to be the most sensible predictor of the cardiovascular target organ; CrCl is also the most related one to LVMI which is the most frequent organ damage in Hypertensive patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec125"><title>9.3 Intrarenal Resistance Indices are Related to Arterial Stiffness and Other Subclinic CV Risk Factors</title><p><italic>A.

Total Cardiovascular risk was determined by the Framingham risk score and by SCORE. Renal resistance index was calculated by echoDoppler as the average of peak systolic velocity minus diastolic velocity/peak systolic velocity at nine representative locations of the renal artery.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The mRI was always &lt;0.7 and the average value was 0.59 ± 0.09. As expected, the mRI was significantly related with age (r = 0.41, p &lt; 0.001) and SBP (r = 0.31, p = 0.01).

In addition, CRI is a major contributing factor to the progression of CHF as it is associated with chronic volume overload, accelerated atherosclerosis and hypertension (HTN).</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> The first aim of the current study was to evaluate the prevalence of CRI in an adult general population. The second aim was to address whether calculated glomerular filtration rate (cGFR) adds value to the cardiac biomarkers BNP and NT-proBNP in detecting early cardiac structural and functional impairments in the general population.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> From 1997 to 1999 medical history, physical examination, echocardiography, BNP (Biosite) and NT-proBNP (Roche) and serum creatinine (SCr) were obtained in 1982 randomly selected residents of Olmsted County, MN ≥45 years (range 45–96 years). GFR was calculated using the Cockroft Gault equation adjusting for age, gender, body weight and surface area in which CRI was defined as a GFR &lt;60 mL/min. Cardiac structure and function were evaluated by in- depth echocardiographic examination.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In this random adult cohort, the prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities was coronary atherosclerosis 12%, HTN 29.5% and diabetes mellitus 7.5%. The prevalence of CRI was 22.8% when cGFR was used for its detection. Importantly, cGFR significantly increased the ability of BNP in detecting left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) (p = 0.0044), increased relative wall thickness (RWT) (p = 0.0036), diastolic dysfunction (DDF) (p = 0.0001) and HTN (p = 0.0002). Similarly, when combined with NT-proBNP, cGFR increased the predictive power of detecting DDF (p = 0.0001) and HTN (p = 0.0366).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study reports a higher than predicted prevalence of CRI in this general adult US population equal to 23% and closely associated with the prevalence of HTN (29.5%). Importantly, this study also demonstrates that cGFR has additive predictive power when used in combination with two important cardiac biomarkers of cardiac dysfunction and remodeling which are BNP and NT-proBNP. These studies underscore the increasing burden of CRI in the general population and the utility of assessing cardiorenal function by combining renal and cardiac biomarkers in assessment of cardiac structure and function.</p></sec><sec id="Sec127"><title>9.5 Microalbuminuria is a Predictor of Chronic Renal Insufficiency in Non-Diabetic Hypertensive Patients: the Magic Study</title><p><italic>F.

Control rats (n = 12) underwent only buffer injection. Out of 26 diabetic rats, 12 were chronically treated with insulin. Two months after the onset of diabetes, Ac-SDKP (1 mg/kg/die s.c.) was administered for 8 weeks to 5 control rats, 7 diabetic rats, and 6 insulin treated diabetic rats by osmotic mini-pumps. To evaluate the effect of chronic Ac-SDKP administration on whole kidney protein expression profile, we performed a multiple comparative proteomic analysis using 2-DE combined with MALDI-TOF.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Main findings of our study are shown in the table. At the end of the experimental period, diabetic rats had a significant increase in blood glucose level, that was absent in those treated with insulin. Albumin excretion rate and renal fibrosis were significantly increased in diabetic rats, but not in insulin treated diabetic rats. Ac-SDKP administration in diabetic rats prevented the increase in albumin excretion rate and significantly reduced renal fibrosis. A total of 19 proteins, differently modulated by Ac-SDKP in the kidney of diabetic rats, were identified by PMF analysis. Eight proteins were detectable only in diabetic rats and, conversely, 11 proteins were absent.

Animals were randomized to receive the following treatment: vehicle (control group) high salt diet at 1% (NaCl-1%) and 8% (NaCl-8%), Aldo at the doses of 40 (Aldo 40) and 72 μg/kg/die (Aldo 72), Aldo in association with high salt diet at 1 or 8% and Aldo 72 plus saline at 8% in association with eplerenone (E) at the dose of 100 mg/kg/die. At 2-week intervals, body weight and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were measured. At the end of the study glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria (Alb-U) were evaluated. The rats have been then decapitated, the blood collected for determination of Aldo, creatininemia and azotemia, their abdomen opened and the left kidney rapidly excised and weighed. In each group the kidneys from half of the animals have been used for determination of glomerular area (GA), glomerular sclerotic area (SGA) and glomerular albumin permeabilitry (P-alb) determination. The kidneys from the other half of the animals have been employed for gene expression studies.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In the NaCl-8% and in the Aldo 72 groups there were a significant and comparable increase in the SBP, kidney weight, GA and SGA. These changes were further increased in the animal treated with Aldo 72 and high salt diet both at 1 and 8%. A significant increase in Alb-U and Palb was present both in the group treated with high salt diet and in group receiving Aldo 72 and high salt diet. In these groups were also evident a gene hyperexpression of CTGF (Connective tissue growth factor) and MCP-1 (Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1). The increase in SBP, GA, SGA and the alteration in Alb-U and P-alb were prevented by treatment with E.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Aldo may induce an alteration of glomerular function only when it is administered together with a high salt diet which can independently affect glomerular function.

RI was obtained by duplex ultrasound, with three consecutive samples for each kidney, at baseline, 5’ after GTN and during SNP when target BP was reached. Heart rate (HR), non invasive beat-to-beat BP (Portapres) and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA, microneurography) were recorded at baseline and during drug administration. Total peripheral resistance (TPR) were derived by Portapres BP waveforms through Modelflow algorithm.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> RI was similar at baseline in the two kidneys (right 0.60 ± 0.07, left 0.60 ± 0.05) and was similarly reduced after SNP (0.54 ± 0.07, p &lt; 0.001 vs baseline, −10.5%) or GTN (0.53 ± 0.08, p &lt; 0.001 vs baseline, −10.1%). Mean BP decrease was −9.9% after SNP infusion (from 110.7 ± 10.5 to 99.8 ± 12.8 mmHg, p &lt; 0.001 vs baseline) and −3.2% after GTN sublingual administration (from 111.5 ± 9.5 to 107.9 ± 8.6 mmHg, p &lt; 0.01 vs baseline). SNP caused a +11.4% increase in HR (from 67.8 ± 10.3 to 74.9 ± 10.9, p &lt; 0.001 vs baseline), while GTN did not affect HR (from 63.8 ± 6.9 to 63.0 ± 7.2, p = ns vs baseline).

Frequently, however, the presence of conditions that “per se” exert sympathoexcitation, such as hypertension and obesity, did act as confounders, preventing definite conclusions to be drawn.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> In the present study we thought to overcome the above limitations by studying a selected group of hemochRometosis patients as a model of iron-induced alteration of insulin sensitivity and/or secretion.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In 12 untreated male hemochRometosis patients without metabolic confounders (age 45.5 ± 3.2 years), we measured during a 30-minute resting period beat-to-beat blood pressure (Finapres), heart rate (EKG), and postganglionic muscle sympathetic nerve traffic (MSNA) via microneurography at a peroneal nerve. Data, which also included HOMA index, were compared with those obtained in 8 age-matched healthy controls. In 4 patients with hemochRometosis, measurements were repeated after phlebotomy-induced iron depletion.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Patients with hemochRometosis had blood pressure, heart rate, waist circumference and body mass index values in the normal range and superimposable to those seen in controls. HOMA index was significantly higher than in controls (2.1 ± 0.2 vs 0.9 ± 0.2 a.u., p &lt; 0.01). This was the case also for MSNA, whose values were substantially increased in patients with iron overload (62.2 ± 2.4 vs 47.8 ± 4.2 bursts/100 heart beats, p &lt; 0.02). Iron depletion was associated with an improvement in insulin sensitivity with an average HOMA reduction of about 20%. This was accompanied by a sustained reduction in MSNA, amounting on average to 30%.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These data demonstrate that a reduced insulin sensitivity insulin resistance, even when blood pressure is normal and no overweight or obese state is present, is associated with a sympathetic activation.

The muscle and skin nerve traffic measurements were made in randomized sequence and included evaluation of skin sympathetic responses to arousal (acoustic stimulus).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The four groups of subjects had superimposable ages (49.4 ± 2.8, mean ± SEM). Compared with controls muscle sympathetic nerve traffic values were significantly higher in subjects with hypertension and in those with obesity (37.2 ± 3.3 vs 51.2 ± 2.8 and 52.0 ± 3.0 bursts/100 heart beats, respectively, p &lt; 0.01), a further significant increase being detected in subjects with the metabolic syndrome (61.0 ± 3.2 bursts/100 heart beats, p &lt; 0.05). In contrast, skin sympathetic nerve traffic was not significantly different in the four groups (15.4 ± 1.0 vs 13.0 ± 0.7, 14.3 ± 1.3 and 12.5 ± 0.8 bursts/minute, respectively, p = NS), this being the case also for the skin sympathetic responses to the acoustic stimulus. In the population as a whole, resting MSNA, but not SSNA, significantly and directly correlated with mean finger arterial pressure (MSNA: r = 0.30, p &lt; 0.05 and SSNA: r = 0.04, p = NS) and body mass index values (MSNA: r = 0.53, p &lt; 0.001; SSNA: r = 0.05, p = NS). Plasma norepinephrine was also directly and significantly related to MSNA (r = 0.37, p &lt; 0.02), but not to SSNA (r = 0.07, p = NS).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The present data provide the first direct evidence that in the metabolic syndrome the sympathetic activation is not uniformly distributed over the cardiovascular system. The different behaviour of skin and muscle sympathetic neural drive is likely to depend on the different impact of the metabolic syndrome components on the reflex and non-reflex mechanisms modulating muscle and skin adrenergic neural drive.</p></sec><sec id="Sec139"><title>10.4 Relationship between Obesity and Plasma Aldosterone in Essential Hypertension: Influence of Gender</title><p><italic>Giuseppe Mule’, Santina Cottone, Raffaella Riccobene, Paola Cusimano, Anna Carol Foraci, Emilio Nardi, Alessandro Palermo, Tania Bellavia, Giuseppe Andronico</italic> and <italic>Giovanni Cerasola</italic></p><p>Università di Palermo, Palermo, Italy</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Increased adiposity has been associated with an augmented secretion of aldosterone, independently of angiotensin II, in several experimental investigations. However, clinic studies exploring the relationship between obesity and plasma aldosterone (PAC) yielded conflicting results. Moreover, little is known about the potential influence of gender on this relationship.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> To evaluate the relationships between PAC, body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC), in a wide group of non diabetic essential hypertensive subjects, attending our Hypertension Centre, initially in the overall population and subsequently separately by sex.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We enrolled 590 hypertensive patients (mean age: 43.8 ± 12.5 years; 61% males), with a PAC/plasma renin activity ratio &lt;400 and free from renal and cardiovascular complications. In all patients, 24-h urinary sodium and potassium excretion, serum sodium and potassium levels, PAC, and plasma renin activity ratio (PRA) were determined, with the subjects kept in the supine position for one hour. All the subjects underwent also a 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In the overall population we observed direct and statistically significant correlations of PAC (logarithmically transformed) with both BMI (r = 0.13; p = 0.002) and WC (r = 0.14; p = 0.001). These associations held (p &lt; 0.01) in stepwise multiple regression models, in which PAC was considered dependent variable, and age, sex, urinary sodium, clinic or 24-h, BP values, (log) PRA, and BMI (or WC) were included as explanatory variables. Even if the interaction factor “BMI (o W) x gender” was not statistically significant when added to the multivariate models ran in the overall population, the multiple regression analyses separately performed in men and women, showed that the relationships of BMI and of WC with PAC remained significant only in men (beta = 0.11; p = 0.02 and beta = 0.10; p = 0.03, respectively). Moreover, when we grouped the study population in normal weight, overweight and obese subjects, PAC disclosed a stepwise significant increase in men, but not in women.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results seems to suggest that obesity is positively associated with PAC, even if this association seems to be significant only in men.</p></sec><sec id="Sec140"><title>10.5 Comparison of the Relationships among Different Definitions of Metabolic Syndrome and Left Ventricular Hypertrophy in Essential Hypertension</title><p><italic>Giuseppe Mule’, Emilio Nardi, Paola Cusimano, Giovanna Bonanno, Alessandro Palermo, Calogero Geraci, Miriam Costanzo, Anna Carol Foraci, Santina Cottone</italic> and <italic>Giovanni Cerasola</italic></p><p>Università di Palermo, Palermo, Italy</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Several studies documented that metabolic syndrome (MetS), defined according to the ATPIII or IDF criteria, is associated with an increased left ventricular (LV) mass in essential hypertension. Limited information is available about the different ability of these two diagnostic criteria to identify LV hypertrophy (LVH). Moreover, one of the potential limitations of the MetS concept is the dichotomous nature of the current definitions of MetS, that would limit the power to correctly assess the cardiovascular risk in every patient.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> To compare the ability of different definitions of the MetS to identify LVH in a wide group of patients with essential hypertension.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We recruited 724 non diabetic hypertensive subjects (mean age 45.3 ± 11.7 years; 63% males), free from cardiovascular complications. In all subjects, routine blood chemistry, echocardiographic examination and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring were performed. We adopted 4 definitions of MetS, two dichotomous (ATPIII e IDF) and two ‘quantitative’. Of these latter, one was defined on the basis of the mean value of the sex-specific Z score for every component (MetS Z score) and the other as the average of the percent deviation from the cut-off values used in the ATPIII criteria (‘MetS D %’).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The areas under the ROC curves for every definition of the MetS, with respect to the diagnosis of LVH (= LVMH2.7 &gt; 51 g/m2.7), were higher when we used the quantitative definitions (MetS Z score: 0.645 ± 0.023; MetS D %: 0.636 ± 0.023), in comparison to the ATPIII definition (0.597 ± 0.023; p = 0.008 and p = 0.02, respectively) and to the IDF definition (0.574 ± 0.023; p = 0.001 and p = 0.008, respectively). In stepwise logistic multiple regression models, taking into account various confounding factors, LVH was more closely associated with quantitative definitions of Mets (MetS Z score, p &lt; 0.0001; MetS D %, p = 0.007) than it was with the categorical definitions (ATPIII, p = 0.01 and IDF, p = 0.03).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results seem to suggest that in hypertensive patients the adoption of ‘quantitative’ definitions of MetS allows to better identify subjects with left ventricular hypertrophy than the traditional dichotomous definitions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec141"><title>10.6 Impact of Hypertension and Role of Fibrinogen in the Metabolic Syndrome</title><p><italic>F.

Maggiore della Carità — Clinica Medica Generale, Novara, Italy</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The diagnosis of the Metabolic Syndrome (MS), according to ATP III, requires three out of five of the following criteria: elevated blood pressure (EP); abdominal circumference (AV) ≥102 cm in males (M) and 88 in females (F); triglycerides (TG) ≥150 mg/dL; high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL) &lt;40 mg/dL inM(&lt;50 in F); fasting blood glucose (G) ≥100 mg/dL. The present study examines the impact of each of these factors on the cardiovascular risk of outpatients affected by MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We studied 482 subjects (197 M), with a median age of 54.2 years, performing OGTT with measurement of blood glucose and insulin concentrations at time 0 ‘and after two hours (G, G-2h, Ins and Ins-2h). We calculated BMI, AV and as, indexes of insulin resistance and sensitivity, HOMAIR and EISI respectively. We evaluated, as cardiovascular risk factors (CRF), total cholesterol (CT), TG, HDL, LDL and fibrinogen (Fb).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The prevalence was 92.3% for EP, 60.2% for TG, 61.1% for HDL, 62.1% for G and 80.7% for AV. Normotensive subjects (n = 37) exhibited significantly lower values for HDL e Fb, while TG was increased compared to hypertensive patients (n = 445). In subjects with normal AV (n = 93), BMI, Ins, Ins-2h, HOMAIR, HDL and FB were significant lower while EISI e TG were higher compared to subjects with increased AV (n = 389). In subjects with normal TG (n = 192), CT and LDL were significant lower, while BMI, AV and HDL were increased as compared to subjects with increased TG (n = 290). In subjects with normal HDL (n = 188), G, CT and LDL were significant increased compared with subjects with low HDL (n = 294). In subjects with normal G (n = 183), G-2 h, HOMAIR and HDL were significant reduced, while EISI was increased compared with subjects with G ≥100 mg/dL (n = 299).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These results confirm that the combination of criteria is the major determinant of the overall CVR. This overwhelms the risk contributed by individual criteria. It is very important the high prevalence of EP in the subjects with MS (92.3%). Fibrinogen, significantly higher in hypertensive patients and in subjects with increased AV, seems particularly relevant to account for the increased thrombogenic risk.</p></sec><sec id="Sec142"><title>10.7 Newly Diagnosed Arterial Hypertension in Male and Female Subjects</title><p><italic>C.

Maggiore della Carità-Clinica Medica Generale, Novara, Italy</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Arterial hypertension (AH) leads to metabolic alterations which cause an increased cardiovascular risk (RCV). In this study we examined the risk connected to AH at its onset in both sexes.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We recruited 382 subjects (172 males) aged 44.1 ± 14.3 years, 163 of whom with a newly diagnosed AH. The inclusion condition was normal glucose tolerance at OGTT. None of the subjects studied was affected by hypercolesterolemia and/or familiar hypertrigliceridemia. In each subject, in addition to anthropometric indices, as waist circumference (WC) and BMI, we measured glycaemia and insulin concentration at time 0 f and 120 f (G0,G120,Ins0 and Ins120) of OGTT, cholesterol (CT), triglicerids (TG), HDLcholesterol (HDL), LDLcholesterol (LDL) and fibrinogen (Fb). We also calculated the HOMAIR and the EISI as insulin-resistance and insulin-sensibility indices, respectively. Three independent comparisons were made: two between hypertensive and normotensive subjects in both sexes, the third one between male and female hypertensive subjects.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The comparison between the male groups disclosed a significant rise in BMI, CV, G0, Ins0, HOMAIR and Fb, and a significant reduction of EISI in hypertensive (n = 82) compared to normotensive subjects. We obtained similar results in the comparison between females, where, in addition, Ins120, CT and LDL were also found to be significantly increased (n = 81). When comparing male to female hypertensive subjects we found a significant increase in Fb and HDL, with concomitant reduction of TG in females.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our study confirms that AH confers an unfavourable metabolic profile in both sexes. These alterations are more evident in females: when a woman becomes hypertensive, she discloses profound alterations of her blood lipids together with increased fibrinogen, and she exhibits insulin-resistance if compared to non hypertensive females. Furthermore, it is very significant that fibrinogen is more elevated than in hypertensive males, who, in turn, show values higher than normotensive subjects. These findings contribute to the increased RCV associated to arterial hypertension. Females exhibit an overall risk significantly more pronounced than males.</p></sec><sec id="Sec143"><title>10.8 Evaluation of Candesartan Compared to Olmesartan on Insulin Sensitivity-Related Parameters in Type 2 Diabetic Hypertensive Patients</title><p><italic>G.

Nebivolol (a racemic mixture of D- and L-enantiomers) is a third-generation β1 blocker with vasodilatatory activity mediated through the β3 adrenergic receptor (ADRB3) because of ADRB3 agonist activity of the L-enantiomer. Available clinic data suggest that nebivolol lacks the adverse metabolic side effects of other β1 blockers.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> In this study we examined whether nebivolol was able to induce ADRB3-mediated lipolysis and UCP1 expression, key steps in the use of fatty acids for thermogenesis.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Human visceral mature adipocytes were isolated from omental adipose tissue obtained during elective abdominal surgery. Gene expression of ADRB1, ADRB2, ADRB3, UCP1 receptors, and adipocyte markers were analysed by RealTime PCR-TaqMan assay. ADRB3 were also investigated by western blotting. The effects of isoproterenol, ADRB3 agonists (CL316243, BRL37344), nebivolol (D and L mixture as well as both pure enantiomers), atenolol, and metoprolol on lipolysis (free glycerol production) and UCP1 expression (evaluated by Real Time PCR-TaqMan assay) were studied <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Isolated unilocular adipocytes expressed all ADRB receptors, hormone sensitive lipase, and adipocyte markers (adiponectin and leptin). ADRB3 mRNA and protein were expressed in variable amounts in human omental adipose tissue and in isolated adipocytes (n = 10). As expected, isoproterenol and ADRB3 agonists induced frank lipolysis whereas non-vasodilating β1 blockers did not. Nebivolol induced significant lipolysis (about 2.8-fold, p = 0.026) that was mediated by the L-enantiomer (about 50% of the isoproterenol-induced lipolysis at same concentrations). Only nebivolol was able to induce UCP1 gene expression (about 3-fold, p = 0.032).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Nebivolol activates ADRB3-mediated lipolysis and induces UCP1 gene expression in human visceral adipocytes, a pathway known to lead to thermogenesis and weight loss. Treatment of hypertensive-overweight patients with nebivolol induced blood pressure control but also could be induced positive metabolic effect acting on visceral adipose tissue.</p></sec><sec id="Sec146"><title>10.11 Human Endocannabinoid CB1 Receptor 3813a/G Variant in Obese-Hypertensive Patients and Adipose CB1 Gene Expression in Relation to Fat Depots, Endocannabinoid Levels and Microvascular Damage</title><p><italic>R.

Endocannabinoid CB1 receptor gene (Cnr1) 3813A/G alleles may influence CB1-mediated ECS activities.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> Obese-hypertensive patients (OH), who are at higher risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS), were studied to evaluate the frequency of the 3813A/G SNP and its correlation with clinic parameters. We also analyzed Cnr1 alleles in relation to different levels of CB1 expression in VAT. Moreover, we studied VAT endocannabinoid (EC) levels and CB1 receptor expression in relation to anthropometry, VAT area, plasma adiponectin, and microvascular damage (MVD) in human kidney.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Cnr1 3813A/G alleles were evaluated in 280 OH (age &lt;=65 years) excluding diabetics in drug therapy. Perirenal VAT and kidney samples were obtained from 30 patients undergoing renal surgery. In these subjects we determined total VAT and perirenal VAT areas, quantitative CB1 expression and EC levels in perirenal VAT, and total and high molecular weight (HMW) circulating adiponectin. MVD was evaluated in healthy portions of kidney cortex.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> OH with the 3813G allele had lower prevalence of MetS in both unadjusted (OR.0.385, 95% IC 0.2, 0.7, p = 0.003) and adjusted models (OR. 0.398, 95% IC 0.2, 0.9, p = 0.032). A significant lower (about 40%) CB1 expression in perirenal VAT was found in patients with the 3813G allele in comparison with 3813A carriers. A positive correlation was found between CB1 mRNA levels in perirenal VAT and the perirenal and total VAT areas. Anandamide levels in the perirenal VAT correlated with CB1 expression (r = 0.750, p = 0.008). A near 2-fold higher CB1 expression was found in patients with more advanced (arteriolar sclerosis) MVD (p = 0.047). HMW adiponectin was negatively correlated with glomerular sclerosis.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Genetics (Cnr1 3813A/G alleles) influence perirenal VAT CB1 expression and the prevalence of MetS in OH. Increased visceral adiposity is associated with increased perirenal VAT CB1 expression, which is accompanied by elevated anandamide levels. CB1 overexpression is also related to MVD, which instead is negatively correlated with adiponectin levels. CB1-mediated ECS overactivity appears to be involved in human visceral obesity and its complications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec147"><title>10.12 Serum Uric Acid Levels and Incidence of Hypertension in a Sample of Adult Male Population with Normal Blood Pressure</title><p><italic>L.

Non-HDL-C was obtained as the difference between TC and HDL-C. Successively, the following lipid ratios were calculated: non-HDL-C/HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C, TG/HDL-C. All patients underwent trans-thoracic echocardiogram and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was defined as left ventricular mass indexed to height2,7 (LVM/h2,7) &gt;47 g/m<sup>2</sup> in women and &gt;50 g/m<sup>2</sup> in men. Ultrasound Doppler evaluation of carotid arteries for the measurement of intima-media thickness (IMT) and urinary spot microalbuminuria (MAU) were also performed.

Conversely, no differences were found regarding statin treatment among patients with and without TOD (23.4% vs 24.4%,p = 0.53). After performing logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, gender, systolic and diastolic BP and the presence of MS, non-HDL-C and TG/HDL-C resulted to be independently associated with TOD [respectively, adjusted OR 1.97 (95% IC 1.08, 2.24); 1.71 (95% IC 1.19, 2.29); p &lt; 0.01]. Interestingly, non-HDL/HDL-C was independently and more strongly associated with the extension of TOD (defined as the coexistence of MAU, LVH and increased IMT): adjusted OR non-HDL-C vs TG/HDL, respectively: 2.4 (95% IC 1.23, 3.90, p &lt; 0.01) and 2,02 (95% IC 1.66, 2.98, p &lt; 0.01).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In a population of hypertensive patients, non-HDL-C/HDL-C ratio resulted to be strongly associated the presence and the extension of TOD, as compared with LDL-C/HDL-C and TG/HDL-C, independently from TG levels and the presence of MS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec149"><title>10.14 Olivetti Heart Study: Circulating Leptin Levels Predict the Decrease of Renal Function in a Sample of Adult Men</title><p><italic>F.

Schillaci</italic></p><p>Università di Perugia, Perugia, Italy</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) is considered an emerging risk factor for chronic kidney disease. However, its relationship with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the early phases is controversial. On the one hand, MetSyn predicts the future occurrence of low GFR on the other hand, an association has been described between MetSyn and glomerular hyperfiltration.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The relation between MetSyn and renal function was examined in 669 patients with newly diagnosed, never treated essential hypertension (men 57%, age 49 ± 10 years, blood pressure 151/93 ± 16/10 mmHg). We excluded from the study all subjects with overt cardiovascular disease or serum creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dL. MetSyn was defined according to the AHA-NHLBI modification of the NCEP-ATPIII criteria. Creatinine clearance was estimate according to the Cockcroft-Gault (CG) formula. GFR was calculated on the basis of the quadratic Mayo equation and the 4-variable Modified Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The prevalence of MetSyn in the examined population was 30% (n = 198). According to the CG formula, the patients with the MetSyn had a higher estimated creatinine clearance than those without MetSyn (108 ± 23 vs 95 ± 21 mL/min, p &lt; 0.001). Estimated GFR was not different in the groups with vs without the MetSyn (81 ± 10 vs 80 ± 11 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> according to the MDRD equation, p = n.s.; 103 ± 13 vs 104 ± 13 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> according to the Mayo formula, p = n.s.). We also tested the association between GFR and single MetSyn components. After adjusting for the effects of age and sex, eGFR was higher in the subjects with low HDL-cholesterol (MDRD equation, 83 ± 10 vs 80 ± 10 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, p = 0.009).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In untreated hypertensive subjects, glomerular hyperfiltration, estimated through methods which do not produce overestimation of GFR in obese subjects, is not associated with the diagnosis of MetSyn. However, an association was found between hyperfiltration and some of the components of MetSyn (low HDL-cholesterol), possibly reflecting the relation between insulin resistance and glomerular filtration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec153"><title>10.18 Gene Expression in Subcutaneous and Visceral Adipose Tissue of Obese Women with or without Metabolic Syndrome</title><p><italic>R.

Quantitative mRNA expression of forty-four genes was measured by RT-PCR on VAT and SAT samples obtained from the same subject at the time of bariatric surgery (restrictive or malabsorptive).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> When considering groups of genes related to specific pathways, such as inflammation (14 genes) and insulin resistance (5 genes), a multivariate analysis showed significant difference (p &lt; 0.05, at least) in relation to the different depots and the presence of MS. Moreover, considering the whole group of patients, we found increased expression of TNF-alpha (+2.4 fold change), JUN (+2.1), ERN1 (+2.0), PRKCϴ (+2.7), angiotensinogen (+2.4), methallothionein-3 (+5.3) and decreased expression of WISP2 (−3.7) and leptin (−2.4) in VAT as compared to SAT. As compared to MS−, MS+ patients had lower expression of IRS1, both in VAT and SAT, coupled to increased plasma insulin). MS+ patients also showed higher expression of PRKCϴ in VAT vs. SAT, whereas C reactive protein (CRP) gene expression was more increased in SAT as compared to VAT, with concomitantly higher plasma CRP levels.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The results of our study (higher activation of adipogenesis in VAT, as highlighted by decreased WISP2 expression, and insulin resistance related to increased PRKC and IRS1 expression levels, more evident in MS+) support the hypothesis than VAT and/or the metabolic syndrome play an important role in the pathogenesis of metabolic and cardiovascular complications associated to obesity. Furthermore, the increased CRP gene expression in SAT, but not in VAT of MS+ subjects, suggest that also subcutaneous depot may be involved in the activation of inflammatory processes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec154"><title>Nervous System</title><sec id="Sec155"><title>11.1 Role of Heart Rate as Marker of Sympathetic Activity in Metabolic Syndrome</title><p><italic>F.

Whether and to what extent, however, cardiac sympathetic drive is also increased is unknown. It is also unknown (1) whether in this condition heart rate represents a faithful marker of the adrenergic overdrive and (2) which MS definition is the one more sensitive in detecting the adrenergic overdrive.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In 79 patients with MS (ATPIII criteria, 66 males and 13 females) aged 56.5 ± 1.3 years (mean ± SEM) we assessed mean arterial pressure (Finapres), heart rate (HR, EKG), venous plasma norepinephrine (NE, high-performance liquid chromatography) and MSNA (microneurography at a peroneal nerve) during a 30-minute resting period. The same measurements were made in a age-and gender-matched group of 28 healthy controls.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Both male and female MS subjects displayed MSNA and NE values which were, as expected, significantly greater than those found in controls (59.6 ± 1.7 vs 39.8 ± 2.9 bs/100 hb, p &lt; 0.01). This was the case for plasma NE (315.2 ± 15 vs 220.5 ± 28 pg/mL, p &lt; 0.05) and HR (78.2 ± 1.4 vs 69.8 ± 2.4 b/min). In the MS group as a whole HR was significantly correlated with both plasma NE (r = 0.22, p &lt; 0.05) and MSNA (r = 0.33, p &lt; 0.01). The correlation was (1) detectable in both genders and (2) independent on the central or peripheral type of the obese state. MSNA was significantly related to HOMA index (r = 0.56, p &lt; 0.01), plasma insulin levels (r = 0.42, p &lt; 0.01), body mass index (r = 0.42, p &lt; 0.01) as well as waist circumference (r = 0.33, p &lt; 0.01). No significant correlation was found between NE or HR and the above mentioned metabolic and anthropometric indices. ATPIII, AHA and IDF definition displayed a similar sensitivity in detecting the MS-dependent sympathetic activation, independently on the direct or indirect approach used to assess adrenergic function.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These data provide evidence that in MS not only peripheral but also cardiac sympathetic drive is enhanced and that the adrenergic overdrive is similarly detectable when different MS definitions are employed. They also show that HR can be regarded as a sensitive marker of the inter-individual difference in sympathetic drive. The sensitivity of the approach is limited, however, because HR was unable to reflect the main metabolic and anthropometric abnormalities of the disease.</p></sec><sec id="Sec156"><title>11.2 Reduced Heart Rate Variability and Prolonged QT Interval in Patients with Uncomplicated Essential Hypertension</title><p><italic>S.

An abnormal HRV, characterised by a sympathetic predominance, has been shown in patients with essential hypertension, even in the early stages of the disease and in association with left ventricular hypertrophy. QT interval prolongation has been associated with an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death in the general population and in several medical conditions. An abnormal ventricular repolarisation has been described in patients with hypertensive heart disease and a prolonged QT interval is a risk factor for ischemic heart disease in hypertensive subjects.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> To evaluate the relation between autonomic nervous system function, measured with heart rate variability (HRV), and QT interval in patients with untreated uncomplicated essential hypertension.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 215 untreated patients with essential hypertension underwent an ECG Holter recording with a software dedicated to HRV and QT analyses.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 9% of the patients showed a corrected QT (QTc) &gt;440 ms. HRV indexes in time-domain (SDNN, SDNN index, RMSSD, and pNN50) were significantly reduced in patients with prolonged QTc compared to normal QTc (SDNN 24h: 126.4 ± 29.9 vs 143.9 ± 35.4 ms, p = 0.02; SDNN index night-time: 85.9 ± 32.4 vs 115.5 ± 36.7 ms, p = 0.0006; RMSSD 24h: 22.2 ± 7.7 vs 31.2 ± 13.0 ms, p = 0.0007; pNN50 24h: 4.4 ± 4.9 vs 9.7 ± 8.4%, p = 0.0006). Linear correlation analysis between QTc length and HRV parameters showed a significant negative correlation with all time-domain indexes.

Upon logistic regression, worse performance in executive tests was predicted by higher IMT and worse attention, but not by blood pressure. IMT increased at follow up and it was predicted by diabetes and blood pressure, while attention and executive functions improved (from −0.36 ± 1.7 to 0.18±1.1, p &lt; 0.05 and from −1.63 ± 3.4 to −0.27 ± 4.1, p &lt; 0.05) and memory declined (from 0.25 ± 2.7 to −0.45 ± 2.5, p &lt; 0.05).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Undemented patients with long-standing hypertension have cognitive decline involving the executive functions. Cognitive impairment is related to IMT and attention and unrelated to blood pressure control, at baseline. Better attention is related to higher blood pressure. Both attention and executive functions improve at follow up, despite IMT increase. Short term blood pressure lowering has a negative effect on attention that worsens cognitive performance and masks any correlation between blood pressure control and executive functions. Long-term antihypertensive treatment improves cognitive functions despite IMT progression through adaptation to lower blood pressure levels. Gradual blood pressure lowering and steady blood pressure control are required to prevent hypertension induced cognitive decline.</p></sec><sec id="Sec159"><title>11.5 Effect of Sympathetic Inhibition on Renal Resistive Index in Essential Hypertensive Patients</title><p><italic>R.M.

Plasma NE was significantly reduced by clonidine,(from 304 ± 99 to 232 ± 81, p = 0.002 vs baseline), while MSNA (from 33.3 ± 9.2 to 31.0 ± 9.3 bursts/min, p = 0.09 vs baseline, −6.7%; from 48.9 ± 12.7 to 46.5 ± 12.9 bursts/100 heart beats, p = 0.08 vs baseline, −4.6%) and heart rate (from 68.3 ± 10.4 to 66.8 ± 10.4 bpm, p = 0.12 vs baseline) only tended to decrease. PRA and E were unchanged. RI changes were directly related to NE changes (r = 0.865, p &lt; 0.001), but not to MSNA (r = 0.256, p = ns).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Low dose clonidine significantly reduced intrarenal vascular resistances and circulating NE without affecting MSNA.

This respiratory pattern may be influenced also by sex hormones. In fact estrogens and progesterone have been suggested to protect from sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD) at sea level. Aim of our study was to explore whether a different ventilatory pattern during night sleep might characterize women and men during acute exposure at high and very high altitude hypoxia.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In 27 healthy subjects, 23 male (mean age 40 years) and 14 female (mean age 36 years) participating in the HIGH altitude Cardiovascular Research project (HIGHCARE), we performed nocturnal portable polysomnography with a new wearable system (MAGIC vest) and with a standard portable system (Embletta) in the following conditions: (1) at sea level (SL), (2) during the first or second night at Namche Bazaar (3500 m above SL) and (3) during first or second night at Mt Everest Base Camp (5400 mt slm). During the recording we monitored (1) air flow, (2) thoraco-abdominal movements; (3) finger pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>), (4) body position, (5) ECG, (6) snoring. Mean and minimum SpO<sub>2</sub> during night, number of central and obstructive apneas, oxygen desaturation index (ODI), apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) were measured.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> During night at Namche Bazar (3500 slm) AHI was 57.7 ± 33.4 in male and 4.68 ± 2.7 in female (p &lt; 0.05) the difference being due to a strikingly higher number of central sleep apneas and hypopneas in male than in female subjects (central AHI: 54.1 ± 33 vs 4.68 ± 2.7, p &lt; 0.01), leading to a corresponding difference in oxygen desaturation index (ODI, 49.14 ± 25 vs 9.1 ± 7 respectively, p &lt; 0.01). At Base Camp AHI was 92 ± 41 in male and 53.6 ± 45 in female. The difference was still referred to central sleep apneas.

Females started to present a significant number of central sleep apnea only at the highest hypobaric hypoxia level achieved. This data highlight the presence of a gender-related difference in respiratory center stimulation by hypoxia, which leads to trigger periodic breathing in males earlier and more frequently than in females. This data may also have important implications for pathogenesis and cardiovascular consequences of SRBD at sea level which are reported to be significantly more frequent in males than in females.</p></sec><sec id="Sec161"><title>11.7 Emotional (Dys)regulation and Blood Pressure Levels</title><p><italic>A.

The Emotional Regulation (ER) consist of the synergetic integration of these domains. As many recent studies pointed out, a deficit in the cognitive processing of the emotion (alexithymia) could lead to a dysregulation of the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS), that can be considered as one of the causes explaining the relationship between alexithymia and Hypertension. In order to make clear this link, two different models have been proposed: a hypoarousal and a hyperarousal model. Authors have suggested an Autonomic Nervous System hypoactivation, as a reaction to emotional situations, in the alexithymic subjects. On the other hand they proposed an hyperactivation during the physiologic parameter recovery.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> On the basis of this model we can hypothesize that alexythymic subjects, compared to non alexythymic subjects, present blood pressure levels: (a) higher on a baseline condition, (b) lower during the report of an emotional story (c) higher during a recovery phase.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Fifty subjects (Man/Women = 22/28; mean age = 23.54 ± 2.38), selected from a larger sample of 300 university students (18–30 age), participated in this study. They were selected on the basis of extreme scores obtained on the 20 items of the Toronto Alexithymia Scale. After a baseline phase of 14 minutes, the researcher asked subjects to think, imagine and verbally report an event, coming from the own life and characterized by either positive, negative, or neutral emotional valence. The three verbal reports were generated in three different moment of the experimental setting, in a counter-balanced order. Each stage of narration was followed by a (physiologic) recovery phase, in which the subject rested quietly without speak. Blood pressure was measured through the experiment every 90 seconds.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Alexithynic subjects compared to controls showed higher level of Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (p &lt; 0.05) in the baseline condition and higher level of both Systolic blood pressure (SBP) (p &lt; 0.05) and DBP (p &lt; 0.04) in the experimental conditions. Furthermore an ER × Event (neutral, positive, negative) × Modality (imagination, narration, recovery) interaction was observed, which showed higher blood pressure levels in alexithymic subjects, compared to controls, during the narration of emotional events (p &lt; 0.03). Moreover alexithymic, compared to non alexithymic subjects, presented higher DBP levels (p &lt; 0.02) in the recovery stage, which were not extended to SBP (p &lt; 0.09).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results showed that alexithymic subjects presents higher blood pressure levels in each experimental condition (baseline, emotional, physiological recovery), supporting the Hyperarousal model and suggesting that a deficit in the ER can be a risk factor, also for young people.</p></sec><sec id="Sec162"><title>11.8 Promoting the Ability of Emotional Self-Regulation in People Affected by Hypertension</title><p><italic>A.

Five Groups of 12 people were part of the PERS groups and 30 people were included in a waiting list, that formed the control groups. The two types of groups were homogeneous for the consumption of hypertensive drugs and balanced for gender and alexithymia level. The medical and psychological history has been assessed after an evaluation of psychological (Alexithymia e Locus of control health) and physiological (Measuring of high blood pressure) characteristics before and after the treatment and upon a follow up at three months. The PERS groups participated to 12 sessions of 2 hours each on a weekly basis. Within the PERS groups, game activities took place, focused on some emotional aspects and on the elaboration of emotional experiences of the day life.

Some studies showed that Hypertensive people have higher alexithymic level compared to normal people. However, this relation should seem to be evident only in people who present levels of blood pressure so high to require a Pharmacological Antihypertensive Treatment (PAT). Some Neuropsychological studies have proved that subcortical areas (such as the amygdala) are involved in the perception of the emotions, while cortical regions are involved in the cognitive elaboration of the emotions. The most utilized questionnaire for evaluating the alexithymia is the Toronto Alexithymia Scale. The last version of this instrument, including 20 items (TAS-20), presents a good psychometric properties, but it lost in part his sensibility for evaluating the emotional perception. Recently, the Bermond-Vorst Alexithymia Questionnaire (BVAQ) was developed in order to evaluate two big-factors: an affective dimension of emotions, related to the emotional perception, and a cognitive dimension of emotions, related to the emotional elaboration.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> To evaluate if Hypertensive people following a PAT have higher deficit in both affective and cognitive dimensions of emotions compared to Hypertensive people who do not follow a PAT.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In this study 97 patients participated (Man/Woman = 44/53; mean age = 54.46 ± 12.76) affected by Essential Hypertension, who completed the Italian version of the BVAQ.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> An ANCOVA, considering as independent factor the PAT (yes/no), the age as covariate, and the BVAQ scores as dependent variables, indicated higher alexithymic levels in patients undergoing PAT compared to controls (p &lt; 0.001). Both the affective and the cognitive dimensions of emotions are involved in this result (p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, within the cognitive elaboration’s dimensions, both analyzing (p &lt; 0.02) and verbalizing (p &lt; 0.01) were also significant.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These results confirmed that hypertensive patients who underwent to a PAT, compared to controls, present higher levels of alexithymia, which appears specifically characterized by difficulties in the cognitive elaboration of emotions. These results have important clinic implications for planning interventions, aimed to ameliorate the abilities to elaborate and communicate the emotions in people with essential Hypertension.</p></sec><sec id="Sec164"><title>11.10 Blood Pressure and Risk of Haemorrhagic Transformation and Cerebral Edema after Intravenous Thrombolysis in Ischaemic Stroke</title><p><italic>L.

Brain CT scan was performed before treatment, 24–36h after rt-PA administration and later when needed according to the clinic course. Stroke severity was assessed with NIHSS score at baseline; neurological status was then reassessed 2h, 24h and 7 days after rt-PA administration. The modified Rankin Scale was used to evaluate outcome three months after acute stroke. HT was categorized according to the criteria published by Fiorelli et al for the ECASS I cohort and distinguished in early (&lt;36 hours from thrombolysis) or late HT.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> HT occurred in 18 (30%) patients within 36h. Control CT scan after 36h revealed worsening of HT in 4 (10%) and new HT in 10 (25%). The only variables associated with risk of HT were the medical history of hypertension (p = 0.002) and high platelet count on admission (p = 0.008). HT was not associated with worse clinic outcome at 7 days and 3 months after acute stroke. Cerebral edema (CE) was reported in 20 (33%) patients at 24–36h and in 16 (40%) patients at the follow up CT scan and associated with hypotension at onset (p = 0.04). Odds of a favorable 3-month outcome were lower in patients who presented late cerebral edema (p = 0.001). At baseline, 24 (39,3%) patients showed hyperdense middle cerebral artery sign (HMCAS); MCA occlusion resolved in 12 (50%) patients after intravenous thrombolysis. NIHSS score was lower at 24h in recanalized vs nonrecanalized patients (5.8 ± 4.3 vs 12.2 ± 5.0; p = 0.003).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> HT is associated with a history of hypertension, and doesn’t affect outcome neither in terms of disability, nor of mortality. CE after 36h is associated with low blood pressure at stroke onset. CE and failure of arterial recanalization emerge as the most important predictors of disability in patients with ischemic stroke treated with intravenous thrombolysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec165"><title>11.11 Changes in Neuropsychological and Psychological Performance at High Altitude: Data from the HIGHCARE2008 Project</title><p><italic>B.

Cognitive alterations following high altitude exposure have been variously described in literature for both ecological and simulated conditions. Neuropsychological performance modifications during high altitude exposure include quantitative and qualitative changes, positively correlated with altitude conditions.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> To analyze neuropsychological and psychological profiles of normal subjects at sea level and when exposed to high and very high altitude (3500 and 5400 m), the latter conditions being considered as a model of cognition functioning in clinic conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or cerebrovascular diseases complicating hypertension, all characterized by poor brain oxygen supply.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Forty-five normal subjects participating in the Himalaya’s HIGHCARE expedition underwent an extensive neuropsychological and psicodiagnostic assessment in normoxia condition, at 3500 m, at 5400 m and 3 month after expedition end. Different cognitive domains had been investigated with both paper and pencil tools as well as computerized tests. This battery included: computerized measures of reaction time and eye-movements (PVA test — Visuo-Attentional Performance Evaluation), Digit span test, Corsi’s Test, Tapping Test, Stroop Colour-Word Test, Symbol digit modalities test, Trail Making Test, Verbal Fluency Test, Visual cancellation tasks, Wechsler Memory Scale. Eye movements were measured using an × 50 eye-tracker. Clinic tools for assessing psychological and emotional were administered.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Our data show quantitative and qualitative differences in cognitive performances between study conditions, with higher scores in normoxia and at 3500 m than at 5400 m. Significant differences and paradigmatic patterns of data emerge on different eye-movements/reaction times measures, while a general cognitive slowliness occurred at 5500 m condition. Subjects differed significantly for the presence of depressive/anxious symptoms. Neuropsychological and psychological data were correlated with cardiovascular and respiratory parameters.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> High altitude exposure induces specific cognitive and psychological patterns, as well as peculiar alterations of eye-movements patterns. Computerized neuropsychological assessment seems more sensitive than usual tests to minimal changes observed in cognitive functions under hypoxia conditions. This assessment seem to be ideal in detecting small cognitive changes frequently observed in hypertensive patients affected by mild vascular cognitive impairment (mVCI). These findings have clinic implications for the neuropsychological management of patients affected by diseases associated with hypoxemia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec166"><title>11.12 Patients with Coronary Artery Disease Have a Marked Impairment of the Baroreflex Function Even in the Absence of a Myocardial Infarction</title><p><italic>A.

While the effects of acute baroreceptors removal on heart rate and blood pressure are well known, the effects of chronic baroreceptor deafferentation are still not clear.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Seven conscious unanesthetized WKY rats (11–12 week old) were studied three days (acute, A) and 7 months (chronic, C) after surgical sino aortic denervation. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and pulse interval (PI) were continuously monitored for 10 minutes. Data were analyzed to calculate mean value and standard deviation (SD) of PI and MAP, and their coherence. Differences between groups were assessed by Wilcoxon test.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> MAP was significantly lower in C than in A (88 ± 8 vs 109 ± 5 mmHg, M ± SEM, p &lt; 0.04), PI was significantly longer in C than in A (196 ± 4 vs 150 ± 3 ms, p &lt; 0.01).

Coherence between PI and SBP was similarly low in A and in C.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> With respect to the acute phase, 7 months after sino-aortic denervation: (1) blood pressure decreases while blood pressure variability remains constant; (2) PI and PI variability increase. In absence of the baroreflex other mechanisms act to reduce blood pressure and to increase vagal outflow or decrease cardiac sympathetic outflow to the heart.

The etiology of FMD is not well understood and several mechanisms have been proposed. Pathophysiology and molecular biology of FMD are unknown, and this disease has been listed by the National Organization of Rare Diseases. Angiographic classification includes multiple stenoses and the string-of-beads pattern. There are no treatment protocols for FMD and it may be managed conservatively by antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy as prophylaxis against complications. In this clinic case on a young hypertensive woman with FMD the olmesartan-based treatment improved arterial stenoses of the celiac tripod (CLT) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) after 14 months of therapy (figure). The improvement of the endothelial dysfunction due to selective blockade of the angiotensin II subtype 1 receptors (AT1) and the effect of the AT1-blockers on the transforming growth factor-beta pathway, are the possible mechanisms explaining this finding. We hope that this case can be of help to stimulate further investigations about FMD, a disease that has been reported to be the cause of sudden deaths in young people.

Several studies have demonstrated that physical exercise reduces blood pressure (BP) levels in hypertensive subjects and improves controls of several well-known risk factors for atherosclerosis such as diabetes mellitus, blood lipid profile and obesity.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> To evaluate if an exercise program based on periodic controlled fast walking sessions would reduce blood pressure levels in hypertensive subjects already in therapy with antihypertensive drugs, evaluating BP variations through 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 189 hypertensive subjects were enrolled (101 men and 88 women, mean age 55.7 ± 10.8 years) already under pharmacological therapy, not suffering from obesity (Body Mass Index &lt;30) and without any pathological condition resulting in reduced mobility. A main inclusion criterion was the evidence of stage I hypertension, according to the Guidelines for Hypertension Treatment of the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), as an average value obtained with a 24-hour ABPM performed on admission. These subjects underwent to a six weeks program of exercise, based on fast walking, supervised by experienced physiotherapists. The walking velocity was set on the “self-selected” speed, that is the walking speed considered comfortable for every subject, added to a mean of 40%, to obtain a value comparable to fast walking for every subject. 168 patients of 189 completed the training period.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Mean 24h systolic blood pressure (SBP) changed from 143.1 to 135.5 mmHg (p &lt; 0.001), mean 24h diastolic blood pressure (DBP) changed from 91.1 to 84.8 mmHg (p &lt; 0.001).

Several trials have demonstrated significant benefits of fast walking on the risk factors of cardiovascular disease, particularly for hypertension. Importance of circadian rhythm of blood pressure (BP) in the management of hypertension is well established. In our knowledge only a few studies have assessed the response of hypertensive subjects to regular physical exercise in relation to the nocturnal dip of BP, and none of these has used fast walking protocols in addiction to antihypertensive therapy.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> To assess whether physical activity obtained through fast walking might lead to a different reduction of BP levels in hypertensive patients in relation to different circadian profile of BP.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We have enrolled 84 hypertensive patients, with evidence of stage I hypertension and presence of non-dipper nocturnal profile as an average value obtained by two 24-hour ABPM performed at time of admission and after three weeks. All subjects underwent a six weeks physical intervention based on fast walking, three sessions a week. Data obtained have been compared with other collected by our group in a similar analysis already performed in dipper subjects. The two groups resulted matched for age, sex, BMI, mean BP diurnal values before becoming of physical exercise program, antihypertensive therapy.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The dipper vs non-dipper analysis shows that there is a significant lower response of non-dipper in both SBP (135.5 ± 6.4 vs 141.0 ± 4.4) and DBP (84.8 ± 8.2 vs 90.1 ± 2.5) 24-hour data. The lower response of non-dipper hypertensive to exercise therapy can also be seen comparing ABPM data obtained during the three period of day-time. No differences in heart rate have been found between the two groups before and after physical activity. Analyzing ABPM data related to nighttime, after exercise therapy is maintained the difference of BP values between the two groups yet evident on admission due to the different nocturnal profile: neither dipper nor non-dipper show a significant response of nocturnal BP do not resulting in a reduction of both SBP and DBP mean values. At intra-group analysis regarding non-dipper hypertensive patients no significant change was found in 24-hour SBP and DBP values.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In non-dipper hypertensive patients physical activity is less effective in provide a hypotensive effect if compared with dipper ones. This the consequence, probably, of the different pathophysiologic background on which exercise operate, first of all the level of the systemic vascular resistance, in which a difference degree of the sympathetic nervous system and of the renin-angiotensin system activity appear to be involved.</p></sec><sec id="Sec175"><title>12.6 New Onset Diabetes Mellitus in Randomized Clinic Trials Performed with ACE Inhibitors or Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers: an Updated Meta-Analysis versus Placebo</title><p><italic>G.

Obese hypertensive patients frequently have a resistant form of hypertension, due to both difficulty in losing weight and inadequate therapeutic approach. In this field, a clinic follow-up may be useful in improving blood pressure (BP) control and understanding underlying clinic factors.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> One hundred thirty nine patients aged less than 65 years with essential hypertension and body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> underwent basal examination and follow-up visit after 6–12 months. Anthropometric parameters [height, weight, BMI, and waist circumference], BP, labs (renal function, albuminuria, lipids profile; plasma renin and aldosterone), anti-hypertensive therapy (as therapy index and number of drug classes) were evaluated.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Systolic BP fell from 145.8 ± 18.5 to 140.2 ± 17.8 mmHg (p = 0.001) and diastolic BP from 90.3 ± 12.1 to 87.8 ± 10.3 mmHg (p = 0.037), despite substantially unchanged BMI (p = 0.091) but in line with increased therapy (therapy index from 1.22 ± 0.94 to 1.67 ± 0.97; number of drug classes from 1.63 ± 1.19 to 2.08 ± 1.04). The percentage of subjects obtaining BP control (defined as BP &lt;140/90 mmHg) raised from 24% to 31.7% at follow-up. It was easier to obtain BP control in overweight (51.4%) than obese patients (27.4%), although subjects who became controlled doubled among overweight and triplicate among obese patients. Indeed, anti-hypertensive therapy was increased more consistently in obese than overweight subjects (D therapy index 0.57 ± 1 vs 0.18 ± 0.73, p = 0.01; D drug classes 0.58 ± 1.2 vs 0.17 ± 0.91, p = 0.027).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In a non-elderly overweight/obese hypertensive population BP control appears strictly related to obesity degree but also to an appropriate therapeutic approach aimed to increase dosage and number of prescribed anti-hypertensive drugs. Actually, a better BP control is possible independently of weight loss.

Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is recommended in unilateral PA (APA or UHA), while medical treatment based on mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) is indicated in patients with bilateral adrenal (idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia, bilateral APA, GRA) or those unable or unwilling to undergo surgery. MRA treatment appears to be effective for blood pressure lowering and seem to provide blood-independent target organ protection. The most used drugs are Spironolactone, Potassium nate or Canrenone, Eplerenone or less frequently Amiloride. We present here our recent experience in patients with PA.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> To evaluate short and middle-term effects of medical and surgical treatment hypertensive state, hormonal parameters and cardiac function in 45 patients with PA referred to tre between 2005 and 2008.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In all patients after confirmation of PA, ECG and radiography were performed at baseline and after treatment with adrenalectomy (n = 22 or n = 23) every 12 months with a median follow-up of 36 months.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> At baseline 82% ed moderate or severe hypertension, 66% hypokalemia, 15.5% renal damage with buminuria and 22% presented atrial fibrillation. Echocardiography measurement shows left ventricular hypertrophy in 69% of patients, 93% with concentric geometry; 40% presents reduced c function and 4% reduced systolic function. After treatment both groups presented various s of blood pressure reduction (60% normalization after adrenalectomy, 82% on medical nt) and 100% normokaliemia. In adrenalectomized patients there was a significant reduction ma aldosterone concentration (PAC) and normalization of ARR ratio. In medically treated s we observed significant normalization of plasma renin activity (PRA) and consequently zation of ARR. In both there was a significant reduction of LVMI, greater in the 1 year in adrenalectomized patients, subsequently greater in medically treated patients. A ant reduction of RWT was seen only in adrenalectomized patients. Prevalence of ophy decreased in both treated groups, whereas diastolic parameters had only mild and no ant improvement. Changes of LVMI were significantly correlated with changes in diastolic pressure in both and with PAC reduction only in adrenalectomized patients.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In the short-middle term, both adrenalectomy and treatment with MRA are effective in zation of plasma potassium, reduction of BP, ARR and left ventricular mass in patients with ile they are less effective in improving systolic and diastolic function.</p></sec><sec id="Sec180"><title>12.11 Age-Related Response to Antihypertensive Drug Therapy</title><p><italic>F.

Similar results were shown in hypertensive patient not in wash out at their first visit, to whom physicians prescribed a different drug. At the same time, the percentage of patients younger than 50 achieving BP control was significantly higher in those treated with aR drug (42.1% vs 23.9%) and the rate of BP control doubled after correction of the BMI and the basal systolic and diastolic BP values.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Also in older people the BP control tended to be more frequent when they were treated with a R drug, even if not significantly. On the one hand, this study supports the idea that R drugs give better results in hypertensive patients younger than 50, which is in accordance with the recommendations of the British Hypertension Society Guidelines and the evidence collected from preview studies. On the other hand, our research doesn’t highlight a greater efficacy of V drugs in older people, aswas expected. Also in this patients, in fact, drugs that inhibit renin angiotensin system are more effective as first line agents.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec181"><title>Vessels and Endothelium</title><sec id="Sec182"><title>13.1 Intimal Medium Thickness, Fetuin A, Endothelial Activation and Oxidative Stress in Hypertensive Patients with Different Grade of Chronic Renal Failure</title><p><italic>S.

De Rome, R. Ria</italic> and <italic>G. Ranieri</italic></p><p>DIMO- Sezione di Medicina Interna, Bari, Italy</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Several studies indicate that inflammation plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of essential hypertension. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is currently discussed as a possible mediator of inflammation. VEGF is one of the most potent angiogenic factors known and is thought to function as a endogenous regulator of endothelial integrity. Animal studies have revealed that VEGF promotes endothelial regeneration and induces migration and activation of monocyte through induction of chemokines such as monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1. However, there is still a debate over the vascuoloprotective vs pro-inflammatory effect of VEGF.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We performed this study to investigate the hypothesis that VEGF and MCP-1 play a role as inflammatory mediators in essential hypertension. Twenty never treated patients with mild hypertension and 20 healthy controls were examined; serum levels of VEGF and MCP-1 were measured via commercially available enzyme linked immunoassay (R &amp; D System).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Hypertensive patients showed increased plasma levels of VEGF (p &lt; 0.05) and MCP-1 (p &lt; 0.05).VEGF positively correlated with mean arterial pressure/r = 0.48, p &lt; 0.05); multivariate analysis demonstrated VEGF to be an independent predictors of MCP-1 levels.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study suggests that in mild hypertension, inflammatory pathway have already been activated. We observed increased plasma levels of VEGF and MCP-1; stepwise multivariate analysis suggests that elevated VEGF levels contribute to the elevated MCP-1 levels. In conclusion, the present study seems to suggest new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms in essential hypertension linking inflammation and abnormal angiogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec185"><title>13.4 Small Arteries from Visceral Fat of Obese Patients are Characterized by a Reduced Nitric Oxide Availability due to Oxidative Stress: Role of Inflammation</title><p><italic>A.

Moreover, a cross-talk between inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide (NO) has been described, but whether this relationship is also detectable at the level of visceral small vessels is still unknown. Therefore, we assessed the NO-derived endothelium-dependent VD in small resistance arteries taken from the visceral fat of patients with severe obesity (Ob) and non obese controls (Ctrl).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 8 Ob patients (age 38.4 ± 14, BMI: 46.1 ± 6.7, waist to hip ratio (WHR) 0.98 ± 0.08) and 8 Ctrl (age 43.2 ± 6, BMI: 24.9 ± 2, WHR: 0.93 ± 0.03) were investigated. Each subject underwent a biopsy of the visceral fat during a surgical laparoscopic procedure. Small arteries were dissected and investigated on a pressurized micromyograph. Endothelium-dependent VD was assessed by acetylcholine (ACh, 0.001–100 μM)-induced relaxation. NO availability and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were assessed by repeating Ach in the presence of the endothelial NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME (100 μM) or the superoxide dismutase mimetic tempol (1 mM), respectively. Inflammation was investigated by testing ACh under infliximab (100 μM), a monoclonal anti-TNF antibody.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> All individuals had normal lipid and glucose plasma values and normal blood pressure levels. Ob showed higher (p &lt; 0.05) plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines as compared to Ctrl (TNF-α, 14.7 ± 6.2 vs 8.6 ± 6.5 pg/mL; IL-6, 8.8±4.4 vs 2.4 ± 3.8 pg/mL). In Ctrl, maximal VD to ACh (96.1 ± 0.7%) was blunted by L-NAME (57.9 ± 3.8%; inhibitory effect: 39 ± 4.7%; p &lt; 0.001), and unmodified by tempol (97.3 ± 0.6%) or by infliximab (97.1 ± 0.6%). In Ob, VD to ACh was blunted (59.4 ± 2.1%; p&lt; 0.001 vs Ctrl), less sensitive to L-NAME (51.6 ± 2.9%; 7.8 ± 1.4% inhibition; p &lt; 0.001 vs Ctrl), and normalized by tempol (95.9 ± 1.4%; p&lt; 0.001) or infliximab (96.6 ± 1.6%; p &lt; 0.001). In Ob, under tempol administration, the inhibitory effect of L-NAME on Ach was restored (59.2 ± 1.6%; 36.1 ± 3.2% inhibition; p &lt; 0.001 vs L-NAME + ACh alone). Similarly, during infliximab co-infusion the inhibition of L-NAME on ACh was restored (60.1 ± 2.1%; 36.5 ± 3.1% inhibition; p &lt; 0.001 vs L-NAME + ACh alone). Response to sodium nitroprusside was similar in both groups.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Small resistance vessels from visceral fat of obese patients are characterized by a reduced NO availability due to ROS excess.

Endocrinologia, Torino, Italy</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Preliminary data of the Literature suggest that the prevalence of primary aldosteronism (PAL), 5–10% in hypertensive subjects, is even higher than in subjects affected by resistant hypertension (lack of pressure normalization during therapy with three full-dose drugs, included a diuretic). Moreover, although aldosterone is recognized to have an important role in the pathogenesis of the cardiovascular damage, few controlled clinic trials have addressed this topic.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> To determine the prevalence of PAL in patients with resistant hypertension, admitted in our Hypertension Unit, and define the possible association with early cardiovascular damage.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Here we report the data on the first 57 patient recruited. Cardiovascular risk and indexes of early vascular damage (microalbuminuria and intima-media thickness of common carotid arteries) were assessed being blind for the ultimate diagnosis of PAL (plasma aldosterone (pg/mL)/PRA (ng/mL/h) ratio &gt;400 AND plasma aldosterone &gt;200 basally AND &gt;100 pg/mL after acute NaCl infusion) performed after adequate pharmacological wash-out).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> PAL was diagnosed in 20 out of 57 subjects (35.1%, aged 55.1 ± 12.6), the remaining 37 were considered affected by essential hypertension (EI, 64.9%, aged 57.4 ± 9.5). Further diagnostic investigation (adrenal CT and selected sampling from adrenal veins) was considered in patients with PAL, aiming to differentiate subtypes: histological diagnosis of aldosterone-producing adenoma was obtained in 4 out of 20 subjects with PAL. The two groups did not differ for BMI, smoking habit, glycemia, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels, family history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, premature CHD. Arterial pressure levels did not differ in the two groups (PAL vs. EI: SBP 175.0 ± 24.8 vs. 169.9 ± 23.7 mmHg; DBP 104.5 ± 10.9 vs. 98.0 ± 11.7 mmHg). 10 out of 20 patients with PAL (50%) and 2 out of 37 (5.4%) patients with EI showed hypokalemia (&lt; 3.5 mEq/l). Potassium levels were significantly lower in PAL (3.5 ± 0.5 vs. 4.0 ± 0.5 mEq/L, p = 0.0005).The presence of microalbuminuria was statistically more frequent in the group with PAL (52.6% vs. 21%, p = 0.02); furthermore we found an intima-media thickness &gt;0.9 mm more often in subjects with PAL (43.7% vs 20.7%), although this data was not statistically significant (p = 0.09).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The results of the present study suggest that primary aldosteronism is very frequent in the hypertensive subjects resistant to the pharmacological therapy. Resistant hypertensive patients with primary aldosteronism are more often connoted with early vascular damage than resistant hypertensive patients with normal mineralcorticoid function.</p></sec><sec id="Sec187"><title>13.6 Allopurinol Improves Endothelial Resistance to Oxidative Stress in Patients with Peripheral Arterial Disease</title><p><italic>S.

Allopurinol 600 mg was administered after the treadmill test and 600 mg the day after, 6 hours before the second treadmill test. Lactate was dosed to confirm the patients reached anaerobic phase.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Maximal treadmill acutely reduced EDD (0.406 ± 0.06 vs 0.442 ± 0.06 cm; p &lt; 0.005). Allopurinol improved EDD at rest (12.1 ± 2.3 vs 7.3 ± 1.2%; p&lt; 0.05) and counteracted the reduction of EDD after maximal treadmill test (−0.92 ± 0.14 vs −2.5 ± 0.23%; p&lt; 0.05). Femoral artery flux increased after base exercise (0.702 ± 0.012 vs 0.675 ± 0.102 L/min; p &lt; 0.05); a further increment in femoral artery flux after exercise was measured during treatment with allopurinol (0.714 ± 0.011 vs 0.702 ± 0.012 L/min; p &lt; 0.05). Absolute walking distance after treatment increased (342 ± 101 vs 228 ± 98 m; p &lt; 0.05). Uric acid was normal at baseline and reduced after treatment (3.55 ± 1.22 vs 5.34 ± 0.66 mg/dL; p &lt; 0.005). Lactate increased after treadmill test, before and after allopurinol (baseline: 3.5 ± 0.8 vs 1.3 ± 0.3 mmol/L; p &lt; 0.05—allopurinol: 3.4 ± 1.1 vs 1.5 ± 0.5 mmol/L; p &lt; 0.05).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Maximal treadmill test in PAD patients causes acutely endothelial dysfunction, it can be partially counteracted by administration of allopurinol. This drug can reduce the generation of reactive oxygen species through inhibition of xanthine oxidase, as a consequence it improves EDD. Furthermore our study shows that allopurinol can increase femoral flux during exercise and walking distance; these effect cannot be attributed to reduction of uric acid. In conclusion our study demonstrates that xanthine oxidase increases oxidative stress during maximal claudication and its inhibition improves peripheral haemodynamics, endothelial dysfunction and relieves symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec188"><title>13.7 Angiotensin II-Induced AT1 Receptor Stimulation Increases Transglutaminase 2 Expression in Rat Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells</title><p><italic>C.

Endothelial function was evaluated by Flow Mediated Dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery and compared to endothelial-independent dilation obtained with sublingual administration of 25 mcg of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN). FMD and response to GTN were calculated as % diameter change in diameter by a computerized system (FMD Studio, Institute of Clinic Physiology, CNR, Pisa). Aortic and peripheral arterial stiffness were measured as carotid-femoral and carotid-radial Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV), respectively.

IMT can be assessed by standard ultrasonography. Local indices of carotid stiffness can be evaluated by measuring the diameter (D) and the stroke change in diameter (ΔD) from ultrasound data in conjunction with the local pulse pressure.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> To compare a new system (Carotid Studio, Institute of Clinic Physiology, CNR, Pisa, Italy) for automatic evaluation of D, ΔD ed IMT on images from longitudinal B-mode scan of carotid arteries with the ArtLab (ESAOTE, Maastricht, NL), a referral radio-frequency (RF) based eco-tracking system.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A total of 90 scans of the right/left common carotid artery from 21 patients with various cardiovascular risk factors and 12 healthy volunteers were analysed. All measurements were performed in real-time by using the two systems sequentially. Different regions-of-interest (ROI) width were adopted on 60 scans for best performances (1 cm for Carotid Studio and 4 cm for Artlab). The remaining 30 scans were analyzed using the same ROI width for the two systems. Moreover, on the healthy volunteers the analysis was repeated twice with each device in order to evaluate the intra-observer variability. The agreement between the two systems was evaluated by Bland-Altman analysis. The variability for each device was presented as the coefficient of variation.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The bias and the standard deviation of the data obtained with different ROI width were: 0.120 ± 0.220 mm for D, 0.008 ± 0.063 mm for IMT and −0.014 ± 0.044 mm for DΔ, respectively. Moreover, when the same ROI width was adopted the bias and the standard deviation were: 0.060 ± 0.110 mm for D, −0.006 ± 0.039 mm for IMT and −0.016 ± 0.039 mm for DΔ, respectively. The coefficients of variation of intra-observer measurements were: 2 ± 2% for D, 5 ± 5% for IMT and 6 ± 6% for ΔD with the ArtLab and 2 ± 1% for D, 6 ± 6% for IMT and 8 ± 6% for ΔD with the Carotid Studio.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Measurement obtained with the Carotid Studio showed good agreement with those by the ArtLab and a similar reproducibility. Hence, although it is common opinion that B-mode based devices have lower precision than the RF based ones, these data suggest that the Carotid Studio, measuring from standard ultrasound scans, can be a suitable device for the measurement of IMT and arterial stiffness parameters in clinic studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec200"><title>13.19 A Multicentre Study to AssessVariability of Endothelial Function in Brachial Artery</title><p><italic>L.

A reduced FMD is associated with major cardiovascular risk factors and is an independent predictor of events. Despite the large effort to standardize the methodology, FMD evaluation is still characterized by problems of reproducibility and reliability.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> To standardize the procedure for FMD assessment in different Units and evaluate FMD variability over time in healthy volunteers.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 101 healthy volunteers (age 20–60 years) were recruited in 6 Italyn Hypertension Units. FMD was assessed as dilation of the brachial artery secondary to 5 minutes forearm ischemia by trained operators using a clamp to held the ultrasound probe. Sequences of B-mode images of the brachial artery were VCR recorded for baseline FMD (time 0) and repeated 1 hour after baseline maintaining the probe in the same position (time 1) and 1 month apart (time 2). Endothelium independent vasodilation to glyceryl trinitrate (25 mcg, sublingual) was also evaluated at time 0 and 2. FMD and response to GTN were measured blindly as percentage brachial artery diameter changes by an automatic edge detection system (FMD Studio, Institute of Clinic Physiology, CNR, Pisa) in the coordinating Centre. The intra- (time 0 vs 1) and inter-session (time 0 vs 2) coefficients of variation were calculated for the 6 different research units and overall to assess FMD and GTN variability over time.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> All recordings were suitable for analysis. FMD was 7.4 ± 3.1% at time 0, 7.2 ± 3.3% at time 1 and 7.4 ± 2.9% at time 2. Overall, the intra-session FMD variability was 9.3 ± 10.1% ranging from 6.6% to 10.1% in the different Centres. Inter-session FMD variability was 13.9 ± 11.8%, ranging from 11.0% to 16.1% in the different Centres. GTN response was 12.8 ± 4.8% at time 0 and 12.6 ± 4.2% at time 2. Overall inter-session variability of GTN response was 15.9 ± 9.8%, ranging from 10.1% to 22.3%.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This multicenter study shows a similar variability in measuring FMD 1 month apart as compared 1 hour apart, an reliable index of intrinsic variability of endothelial response.

In DM+, PWV was related to BMI (r = 0.47, p = 0.002), fasting blood glucose (r = 0.39, p = 0.01), triglycerides (r = 0.41, p = 0.015), brachial (r = 0.59, p &lt; 0.0001) and central SBP (r = 0.62, p&lt;0.0001). Noteworthy, FMD was significantly and inversely correlated only with PWV (r = −0.456; p = 0.001).

We evaluated by B-mode ultrasound the carotid intima media thickness (IMT). Measurements were expressed as mean-IMT (cumulative mean of mean IMT measured in each carotid segment, common, bulb, and internal carotid artery, bilaterally) and as M-MAX (cumulative mean of maximum IMT). Endothelial function was evaluated by post-occlusion flow mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery using high-sensitivity brachial ultrasonography. NO-independent vasodilation was evaluated by the response to sublingual glyceryl trinitrate (GTN).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> PsA had a higher mean-IMT compared to N-C (normotensives PsA 0.69 mm, hypertensive patients PsA 0.71 mm vs N-C 0.60 cm, p = 0.005). Hypertensive PsA displayed higher M-MAX (0.91 mm) versus both HT-C (NC 0.71 mm and HT-C 0.77 mm, p = 0.007) and normotensive PsA (0.81 mm, p = 0.026). FMD was lower in PsA than in N-C (normotensives PsA 5.7%, hypertensive patients PsA 6.1% vs NC 8.9%, p &lt; 0.0005), whereas there was no difference between hypertensive PsA, normotensive PsA, and HT-C. GTN response was similar in all groups.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our data show that subclinic atherosclerosis is enhanced in PsA compared to N-C. In PsA, the hypertensive status proved to exert an additional effect on M-MAX, a parameter of advanced pro-atherogenic remodelling. FMD was reduced in PsA irrespective of hypertensive patients status. Thus, PsA per se implies a pro-atherogenic remodelling which is enhanced by the hypertensive status.</p></sec><sec id="Sec204"><title>13.23 Blood Pressure Variability per se May Induce an Impaired Glomerular Filtration and a Microcirculatory Damage</title><p><italic>P.

We have previously demonstrated that the higher risk of plaque complication reported in patients with diabetes and hypercholesterolemia may be due to a specific pattern of strain gradient between plaque and adjacent common carotid artery (CCA) (inward bending stress). In addition, previous studies have suggested that plaque echogenicity is related to the histological components of carotid plaques and that carotid plaque echolucency (low echogenicity) is associated with the development of neurological events.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> To determine the difference in plaque composition according to the presence of an outward or an inward bending stress (ArtLab system).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We have used an <italic>in vivo</italic> noninvasive approach with a software for videodensitometry analysis, the MIP system (Medical Image Processing, CNR Pisa), which yields the gray levels distribution and second order parameters of a region of interest (ROI). The study included 24 patients with a recent cerebrovascular ischemic event and a plaque on the far wall of CCA. We divided the patients into two groups according to strain behaviour: pattern A (larger strain at the level of plaque than at the level of CCA, outward bending strain) and pattern B (plaque strain smaller than CCA strain, inward bending strain). In all patients digital images of plaques were analyzed offline with MIP.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In 16 patients a pattern A and in 8 patients a pattern B strain behaviour were observed. Demographic and hemodynamic characteristics were similar in the two groups. The prevalence of hypercholesterolemia and diabetes were significantly higher in patients with a pattern B strain behaviour (respectively, 100% vs 56.3%, p = 0.03 and 62.5% vs 12.5%, p = 0.04). Mean gray levels were significantly lower in patients with an inward bending strain as compared to patients with an outward bending strain (65 ± 20 vs 95 ± 30, p = 0.018). As for strain gradient, in the whole group of patients, the mean gray level significantly decreased in parallel with the presence of dyslipidemia and/or type 2 diabetes (127 ± 20 vs 80 ± 21 and 59 ± 18, in the presence of none of them, one of them and both, respectively, p &lt; 0.01).

Ferri</italic></p><p>Università di L’Aquila, L’Aquila, Italy</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Ingestion of catechin-rich foods (tea, cocoa, red wine), results in low plasmatic concentration of catechin-derivatives (0.1–7 μM) associated with transient arterial vasodilatation. This effect is considered to be endothelium-dependent and mainly nitric oxide (NO) mediated. Conversely, experimental studies on isolated arteries, low concentrations of catechins induced conflicting results. Equivocal responses have sometime been associated to different catechin molecular structure, such as the presence of epigallol moiety (epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate), confering contractile activity or cathecol group (epicatechin), eliciting relaxing response.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> We investigated the effect of a low concentration of two structurally different catechins, (—)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and (—)-epicatechin (EC), on rat aortic rings in different experimental conditions. We hypothesised that effect of catechins could critically depend on basal muscular tone, and thus on the functional state of endothelial cells.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The isometric force recording technique was used to examine the response of endothelial intact or denuded aorta rings to cumulative concentrations of EGCG and EC (1 × 10−7 M to 1 × 10−5 M), on resting tension or phenylephrine (PE) submaximally precontracted preparations. The contractile responses were expressed as a percentage of the amplitude of contraction induced by PE in each preparation, and the relaxant responses as a percent decrease in the tension existing at the time of drug administration.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> On resting tension of endothelium- denuded preparations, EGCG and EC (1 × 10−7 M to 1 × 10−5 M) induced dose-dependent phasic contractions that were significantly larger than those induced in endothelium-intact tissues (p &lt; 0.05). The contractile effect of EGCG was stronger than that induced by EC, in endothelium-denuded preparations (p &lt; 0.05). On sustained active tension induced by PE in intact preparations, EGCG and EP induced a dose-dependent relaxation that was significantly larger than in endothelium-denuded tissues (p &lt; 0.05); EGCG was still significantly stronger in potency than EC (p &lt; 0.05). The vasorelaxant responses induced by EGCG and EC in PE contracted intact-aortic rings were significantly inhibited when tissues were preincubated with NwNitro-L-Arginine (L-NNA) (1 × 10−4 M), an inhibitor of endothelial NO-synthase (NOS) activity (p &lt; 0.05). EGCG and EC on resting tension aortic rings induced a prevalent contraction through direct action on smooth muscle, which was significantly decreased by endothelial-mediated mechanisms. On precontracted tissues, they induced largely endothelium-dependent NO mediated relaxation. EGCG appeared to be more potent than EC in eliciting both effects.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Cumulatively, the present results indicate that catechin effects are critically dependent on smooth muscle tone, and consequently on the endothelial functional state.

However, 24-hour AASI is intrinsically dependent on day-night diastolic BP changes; moreover, AASI obtained from daytime hours could theoretically be more closely related to office-based measures of arterial stiffness than 24-hour values.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> We tested the relation between AASI calculated on the basis of daytime hours, after the exclusion of nocturnal readings, and aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A total of 647 untreated hypertensive patients (58% men, age 48 ± 10 years) underwent 24-hour BP monitoring and determination of carotid-femoral PWV, a direct measure of aortic stiffness. 24-hour AASI (0.31 ± 0.17) was on average lower than either daytime AASI (0.48 ± 0.28, p &lt; 0.001) or nighttime AASI (0.38 ± 0.26, p = 0.009). As expected, 24-hour AASI was inversely related with nocturnal systolic and diastolic BP reduction (r = −0.24 and −0.43, respectively; both p &lt; 0.001). In contrast, daytime and nighttime AASI had no relation with nocturnal systolic/diastolic BP reduction (r = −0.04/−0.05 for daytime AASI; r = −0.04/−0.08 for nighttime AASI; all p = n.s.).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Aortic PWV had a direct relationship with daytime AASI (r = 0.12, p = 0.008), but not with nighttime AASI (r = 0.05, p = n.s.). After adjustment for the effects of age, no significant association was found between aortic PWV and the different measures of AASI (r = 0.01 for daytime AASI; r = 0.00 for nighttime AASI; r = 0.00 for 24-hour AASI; all p = n.s.).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The relation between daytime AASI and a widely accepted measure of aortic stiffness, such as pulse wave velocity, is weak, and explained by age. These data suggest that AASI and aortic PWV might explore different physiological phenomena.</p></sec><sec id="Sec213"><title>13.32 Reactive Oxygen Species Mediate Late Ischaemic Preconditioning-Induced Cell Protection against Hypoxia</title><p><italic>A. Bellis, D. Castaldo, B. Trimarco</italic> and <italic>C. Morisco</italic></p><p>Università Federico II, Napoli, Italy</p><p><bold>Introduction:</bold> We have recently demonstrated that ischaemic preconditioning (PC) protects bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) from hypoxia(12 hours)-induced apoptosis through the crosstalk between protein-kinase A (PKA) and Akt. However, the trigger event of this phenomenon is still unclear. Because both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) have been demonstrated to mimic PC-induced cell protection in some experimental models, we have hypothesized that ROS and NO production could be implicated in PC-mediated BAECs protection.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> To evaluate ROS and NO role in ischemic PC of BAECs.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> PC has been induced by exposing BAECs to 15 min of hypoxia (incubation in hypoxic chamber) followed by 15 min of reperfusion. First, we evaluated ROS and NO production during PC. ROS production has been measured through nitrated proteins quantization in cellular lysates obtained at different times since PC application. Early and late PC increased nitrated protein content in BAECs (3.2 vs control). Consistently, PC evoked NO production with two-peaks, detectable immediately and after 24 hours since PC-application through arginine-citrulline conversion assay (1.5 and 1.9 fold increase of citrulline in early and late PC vs control, respectively). Evaluation of PC-induced NO-production through GRIESS reaction showed the same biphasic trend. Then, we focused our attention on late PC and asked whether ROS and NO are needed for BAECs protection against apoptosis in this phase.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The late PC-mediated inhibition of caspase-3-cleavage induced by 12 hours of hypoxia was abolished by cells pretreatment with a ROS scavenger (N-acetyl-cysteine), whereas it was unaffected by inhibition of NO- production (L-NAME+1400W). BAECs pretreatment with NOC-12 (a long term NO- donor) did not prevent the caspase-3-cleavage induced by 12 hours of hypoxia. To further exclude a role of iNOS and eNOS in late PC-induced cell protection, we assessed caspase-3-cleavage in late PC after pretreatment with 1400 W and silencing of eNOS expression. Both treatments did not affect late PC cytoprotective effect.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our data show that late PC-induced cytoprotection in BAECs is mediated by ROS production, but not by NO synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec214"><title>13.33 Platelet and Endothelial Activation and Progression of Cognitive Impairment in Vascular Dementia</title><p><italic>G.

Vascular dementia is caused by different mechanisms all resulting in vascular lesions in the brain. In this regard, current concept on atherogenesis identify in the proatherogenic activation of vascular endothelial cells and platelets a fundamental step in the onset and progression of atherosclerotic vascular damage.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> Starting from these evidence we aimed to evaluate the role of patherogenic vascular inflammation in the progression of cognitive impairment in patients with vascular dementia.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We assessed circulating levels of soluble (s) CD40L and P-selectin, as indices of platelet activation, and of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, as indices of endothelial activation in 78 patients (73.2 ± 4.2 years) with newly diagnosed vascular dementia (NINDS-AIREN criteria) and in 56 healthy sex and age-matched control subjects (75.2 ± 4.1 years). After baseline evaluations patients with vascular dementia were re-evaluated every six months up to 2 years.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> At baseline, circulating biomarkers of endothelial (sICAM-1: 345.5 ± 112.5 vs 188.2 ± 65.0 ng/mL, p &lt; 0.0001; sVCAM-1: 634.2 ± 132.3 vs 443.2 ± 125.3 ng/mL, p &lt; 0.002) and platelet activation (sCD40L: 7.2 ± 2.4 vs 2.9 ± 0.9 ng/L, p&lt; 0.0001; sP-selectin: 67.3 ± 22.2 vs 54.1 ± 8.1 ng/mL, p&lt; 0.003) were higher in demented patients than in controls. At the end of follow-up period, a progression of cognitive impairment was observed in demented patients with a mean decrement of MMSE score of 3.2 ± 1.0 (range 0.4–4.7). Spearman non-parametric correlation found significant relationships between changes of MMSE score at the end follow-up and baseline circulating levels of sCD40L (r= 0.452, p &lt; 0.002) and sICAM-1 (r = 0.533, p&lt; 0.001). In addition, by multivariate regression analysis baseline sCD40L and sICAM-1 levels were found to be independent predictors of MMSE score decrement after adjustment for potential confounders, explaining about 10% and 12% of MMSE score changes, respectively. In conclusion, our data demonstrated the existence of a tight relationship between the degree of proatherogenic activation of vascular endothelial cells and platelets and the progression of cognitive impairment in patients with vascular dementia.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These results, if confirmed in larger study population, could provide a useful tool to identify demented patients at high risk for disease progression and to evaluate the potential efficacy of intervention strategy aiming to least slow down the progression of dementia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec215"><title>13.34 Role of CD40/CD40L System in the Pathophysiology of Cognitive Impairment in Old Hypertensive Patients with Non-Dipper Blood Pressure Profile</title><p><italic>G.

The evidence of a tight relationship between blood pressure and cognitive impairment which is already evident starting from high-normal blood pressure values, suggest the existence of a continuum of cognitive damage in hypertensive patients. According to this, a relationship between cognitive impairment and target organ damage has been described in hypertension.</p><p><bold>Aim:</bold> To evaluate whether or not non-dipping blood pressure profile could be associated with impaired cognitive impairment in hypertensive patients. Furthermore, starting from previous evidence from our group of an involvement of CD40/CD40L in the pathophysiology of vascular damage in hypertensive patients and in cognitive impairment progression in Alzheimer disease, we also assessed the potential involvement of this system in the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in non-dipper hypertensive patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We studied 2 groups or 25 never-treated old hypertensive patients (age &gt;75 years), without additional cardiovascular risk factors, clinically evident cerebrovascular disease or overt dementia, differentiated on the basis of a nocturnal decrease of BP either of &gt;10% (dippers) or &lt;10% (non dippers) of daytime values, and in 25 matched normotensives. Cognitive function was assessed in all participants by MMSE, Trail Making Test A and B, Verbal Fluency Test. The result of these tests were logarithmically transformed and used to calculate a composite cognitive score.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Circulating levels of soluble CD40L and the lipid peroxidation product 8-iso- prostaglandin( PG)F2alfa were also assessed. Cognitive performance were found to be worse in hypertensive patients in comparison to normotensive subjects (−0.26 ± 0.06 vs −0.13 ± 0.06, p &lt; 0.001) especially in those with blunted nocturnal blood pressure fall (non-dipper: −0.30 ± 0.04, dipper: −0.23 ± 0.05, p &lt; 0.001). Circulating levels of soluble CD40L (non-dipper: 4.7 ± 1.5 ng/mL; dipper: 4.0 + 1.3 ng/mL; controls: 3.0 ± 1.5 ng/mL) and 8-iso-PGF2alfa (non-dipper: 387 ± 123 pg/L; dipper: 314 ± 110 pg/L; controls: 271 ± 53 pg/L) were significantly higher in non-dipper than in dipper hypertensive patients and controls (p &lt; 0.01). In the whole study population significant relationships between circulating soluble CD40L levels, cognitive score (r : 0.369, p&lt; 0.001) and plasma levels of lipid peroxidation products (r : 0.557, p &lt; 0.0001) were found. In a multivariate regression analysis sCD40L was found to be an independent determinant of cognitive impairment in the study population.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The results of our study suggest that non-dipping blood pressure profile is associated with cognitive dysfunction in hypertensive patients probably due to an overactivation of CD40/CD40L system.</p></sec></sec></body></article></records><facets><facet name="subject"><facet-value count="1">Cardiology</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Medicine &amp; Public Health</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Pharmacotherapy</facet-value></facet><facet name="keyword"><facet-value count="1">Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Nebivolol</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Primary Aldosteronism</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Pulse Wave Velocity</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Visceral Adipose Tissue</facet-value></facet><facet name="pub"><facet-value count="1">High Blood Pressure &amp; Cardiovascular Prevention</facet-value></facet><facet name="year"><facet-value count="1">2009</facet-value></facet><facet name="country"/><facet name="type"><facet-value count="1">Journal</facet-value></facet></facets></response>
