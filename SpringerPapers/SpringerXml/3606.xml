In additive manufacturing, objects are built from the bottom up in layers. The layers are created in slicing software from a three-dimensional computational model of the object to be printed. These computational models are typically developed in computer-aided design (CAD) software and exported as .stl or .obj files for 3D printing. The description of the 3D printing process is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">2.1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 2.1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Process of 3D printing.

However, individual use of 3D printing technology may lead to unemployment among workers in the sub-production stages of manufacturing. Despite this, 3D printing technology offers overwhelming possibilities for innovation<index-term id="ITerm9"><term>Innovations</term></index-term> and efficient manufacturing.</p><p id="Par4">3D printing technology has evolved since the first 3D printer was established in 1984, and printers have gotten more functional as their price points have decreased. Rapid prototyping is used in a variety of industries, including research, engineering, the medical industry, the military, construction, architecture, fashion, education and the computer industry, among many others. The plastic extrusion technology most widely associated with the term “3D printing” was invented by the name “fused deposition modelling” (FDM) in 1990. The sale of 3D printing machines has increased significantly in the twenty-first century, and their cost has steadily decreased. By the early 2010s, 3D printing and additive manufacturing had evolved into alternate umbrella terms for AM technologies, one being used in popular vernacular by consumer-maker communities and the media and the other one being used officially by industrial AM end-use part producers, AM machine manufacturers and global technical standards organizations.</p><p id="Par5">There are several 3D printing technologies, including stereolithography (SLA), digital light processing (DLP), fused deposition modelling (FDM) and selective laser sintering (SLS). However, the most commonly used techniques are FDM and SLA (Kamran and Saxena <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR525">2016</xref>). Scott Crump developed FDM in the late 1980s. Its wide use is due to its ease of manufacturing, relatively low cost and variety of applications. The FDM process has been applied in many areas such as biomedical, aerospace, automobile, pharmaceutical, textile and energy fields (Singh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR430">2020</xref>). FDM uses a stock material fed into a liquefier to shape the material in a liquid form easily. The material is heated to its melting temperature through various temperature treatment methods within the liquefier.</p><p id="Par6">The melted material is then pushed through a nozzle to be extruded onto a Cartesian space (Campbell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2011</xref>). While some printers allow the nozzle to move around in the Cartesian space, other printers build layers by moving the print bed under a stationary nozzle. The print bed spans the x and y axes, and the layers of the object which are to be printed are added towards the z-axis. Other 3D manufacturing processes use fundamentally different methods to create the different layers which are needed to give form to the final object. One such process is stereolithography, where the object is “printed” by hardening layers in a pool of photosensitive polymer using an ultraviolet laser (Campbell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2011</xref>). In this method, the energy of the laser is transferred to certain regions of the liquid polymer to harden it. When all the desired regions are hardened, the printed object can be taken out of the pool of polymer. A type of stereolithography is DLP invented by Larry Hornbeck in 1987. The difference between SLA and DLP is that DLP uses UV light to harden the shape of the object at once rather than hardening different selective sections of the resin over time. Another method called selective laser sintering, also developed in the late 1980s, uses lasers to melt layers of polymeric powder to obtain the final shape. The melted section hardens in time, and it can be removed from the powder once the hardening is complete (Campbell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2011</xref>). Many other methods are in use or the phases of development.</p><p id="Par7">3D printing simplifies the process of transforming ideas into products. The technology allows rapid and accurate production from various materials. 3D printing also streamlines the prototyping process by providing faster production, allowing businesses to stay one step ahead of the competition. The technology uses a simple interface, allowing more equitable and widespread use. 3D printing also helps product developers to produce low-cost prototypes early in the development process, resulting in better goods and fewer dead-ends. Materials science as a field is affected largely by the 3D printing applications, as the number of materials created by 3D printing has risen considerably in recent years. The possibility of 3D printing various materials has also allowed the technology to be used in different fields. Metals, polymers, ceramics, composites and smart materials have all been successfully used in 3D printing applications with varying costs. Different materials require customisations of the 3D printers due to different material properties such as melting temperature (Shahrubudin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR417">2019</xref>). An innovative material used in 3D printing applications is smart materials, which sense variations in their external environment and provide an effective reaction to fluctuations by modifying their material characteristics or geometries. In particular, energy connection or conversion between different physical fields, such as thermal energy conversion into mechanical work, is shown as a product of smart materials. Due to the potential of smart materials, 3D-printed components of such materials might change over time in a specified way. This leads to a new phenomenon known as 4D printing. 4D printing innovations<index-term id="ITerm10"><term>Innovations</term></index-term> are primarily accessible by recent progress that has been achieved in multi-material printing. 3D printing of multi-smart materials or a mix of smart materials and conventional materials requires understanding the design and manufacturing processes (Khoo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR239">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">Benefits of 3D Printing:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par9">AM dramatically shortens the production period and process and provides great flexibility for the continuously changing market demand.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par10">Production run size can be maintained at low levels on a unit basis while manufacturing costs are not considered.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par11">AM reduces assembly mistakes and related expenses because pre-assembled components can be obtained through one subsequent operation, which is the quality control inspection.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par12">Tools are not included in the additive production process.

In this situation, it can provide a combination of additive production methods with traditional methods to make advantages offered by both.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par14">Optimum usage of materials can be provided, and it is possible to recycle any waste material through AM (Jiménez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR217">2019</xref>).</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par15">Studies attempt to predict the impacts of 3D printing on manufacturing, supply chains, business models<index-term id="ITerm11"><term>Business models</term></index-term>, competition and intellectual property. A study by Jiang et al. makes economic and societal predictions for 2030 (2017). The study results predict a trend of decentralisation in supply chains across many fields since AM will allow cheaper and more accessible localised production capabilities. This is expected to decrease the environmental impact of manufacturing due to reduced transportation emissions. The study also predicts that more than 25% of applicable, final products will be sold digitally as files to be 3D printed instead of physical products. A distinction is made between complex and less complex parts where complex parts are made centrally in specialised manufacturing locations, and fewer complex parts are distributed digitally and produced locally (Jiang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR215">2017</xref>). The study makes additional predictions about consumer markets and business models<index-term id="ITerm12"><term>Business models</term></index-term> changes by 2030. Businesses’ competitive advantage will no longer depend on the efficiency of their production operations but their network of users and creators. Companies will seek employees with skills related to AM, and many jobs will be replaced in the manufacturing industry. This change is reportedly due to the expectation that more than 10% of all gains from manufactured products will be from 3D-printed products by 2030. These products are predicted to be made up of many materials and electronics since enhanced AM methods will allow for such products to be 3D printed at lower costs. The affordability of 3D printers will also induce a significant increase in 3D printer ownership of individuals, especially in industrialised countries. Thus, websites that feature 3D designs will gain more popularity and will allow designs to be sold or downloaded as open-source projects. This is expected to make it harder to detect violations of intellectual property rights (Jiang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR215">2017</xref>). It is expected that 3D printing will become more affordable, refined, purposeful and widespread in the future. The words “create it” may soon become as ubiquitous as “print it”. Examples include raw commodities, satellite networks, machinery, ships and factories. When the cost of manufacturing is reduced, as it is with 3D printers, to the point that virtually anybody can purchase the “means of production”, everyone will say “make it.” So, the future of 3D printing technology is promising. As the applications of this technology, shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2.2</xref>, surge in various areas while potential future applications arise. It is expected that the 3D printing manufacturing industry will grow by 18% each year and reach 8.4 billion dollars by 2025. Especially in the automobile and aerospace industries, the usage of 3D-printed parts will increase significantly in the upcoming years (Mpofu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR318">2014</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2.2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>3D Printing applications.

The quest for 5G stems from the rapidly developing desire to build a highly connected and globalised world in which information and data are easily and equitably accessible to everyone around the globe. Technologies that enhance access to information and data have gone through significant improvements, with new technologies constantly developing to address the shortcomings of previous iterations. 5G is expected to address the shortcomings of 4G technology and improve upon the promises of 4G. 5G technology promises higher capacity and data rate, lower latency, larger device connectivity, lower costs and more consistent quality compared to 4G (Gupta and Jha <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">2015</xref>). 5G can simultaneously connect more wireless technology users with smarter, faster predecessors. 5G technology allows for network connections using Internet technology that is specified to power, battery life, size and cost in the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. 5G technology provides for a revised technological solution in terms of tonnes of wireless technologies, and it opens up new possibilities for mobile connectivity that go well beyond what is now possible, allowing new applications to be utilised in a variety of different situations (Painuly et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR344">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par17">From 1G to 5G, communication technology has evolved over time. Mobile connectivity technology began in 1979 with the first generation of mobile networks, also known as 1G. 1G was a fully analogue technology. Analogue technology and frequency division multiple access (FDMA) were used in 1G, as well as Nordic mobile systems (NMT) and advanced mobile phone system (AMPS) switching. The average speed of a 1G connection was 2.4Kbps. 2G was introduced in 1991 with more services and features, including enhanced coverage and capacity and superior voice quality to 1G. The speed of the 2G network was enhanced to 64 kbps, and the first digital protocols, such as code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA) and global system of mobile (GSM), were used. 2G technology was used for voice and data packet switching. When 3G was introduced in 2003, it represented a new mobile technology and services age. Using 3G technology, the speed was upgraded to 2000 kbps, and the first mobile broadband service was launched. A new age of mobile capabilities began with the rapid growth of smartphone Internet services after introducing 3G technology. Digital voice and web data are used separately in 3G, email and SMS. 4G was introduced in 2011 and is currently in use alongside 2G and 3G. 4G speed can reach 100,000 kbps. High-speed Internet and the next generation of transportation networks are required to meet this massive demand (Saqlain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR526">2018</xref>). By the early 2000s, developers had realised that even the most advanced 4G networks would not be able to handle the demand. An academic team has begun work on 5G since 4G has a 40–60 ms latency, which is too high for real-time responses. NASA aided in developing the Machine-to-Machine Intelligence (M2Mi) Corp, which is tasked with developing M2M and IoT like the 5G infrastructure required to encourage it in 2008. In the same year, South Korea established a 5G Research and Development program, while New York University established the 5G-focused NYU WIRELESS in 2012 (ReinhardtHaverans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR527">2021</xref>). Historical development of the 5G is represented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">2.3</xref>.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 2.3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Historical development of network technology.

The spine of the network must be connected to each cell, either wirelessly or through a landline. With two different frequency bands below and above 6 GHz, 5G uses higher frequencies than 4G (Pisarov and Mester <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR358">2020</xref>). 5G’s improved connection was expected to revolutionise everything from finance to healthcare. 5G opens the door to life-saving technologies like remote operations, education, medicine and more. Additionally, 5G technology creates opportunities for new capabilities and enterprises. Despite the power of 4G wireless network technology, fast speed, rapid response, high reliability and power efficiency, mobile services are not enough to sustain growing demand.

Devices will require 5G capabilities to maintain continuous wireless connection and improve their speed and security. 5G offers significantly faster data rates compared to 4G networks. Furthermore, 5G has ultra-low latency (latency refers to the amount of time it takes for one device to deliver a data packet to another device). The latency rate in 4G is approximately 50 ms, while in 5G, it will be under one millisecond. This is a critical rate for industrial usage and self-driving automobiles. 5G uses significantly less energy than previous technologies. Lower energy use facilitates the construction of battery-free IoT nodes, allowing IoT to operate as battery-free and maintenance-free endpoints.</p><p id="Par22">Moreover, 5G consumes nearly five times less energy while being five times more cost-effective (Painuly et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR344">2020</xref>). Also, 5G will allow a more connected world. Over the next 10 years, IoT is anticipated to develop tremendously, necessitating a network capable of supporting billions of connected objects. The capacity and bandwidth of 5G will be tailored to the user’s demands (Lopa and Vora <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR274">2015</xref>). The vast majority of household devices in use, from routers to televisions, are powered by a single chip. With the advent of 2G and 3G technology, the world changed dramatically, and after the arrival of 4G technology, the world has changed even more. 5G technology is a major step forward, not only for the technology industry but for the entire globe. 5G is expected to create $12.3 trillion in world economic output and provide 22 million occupations by 2035. Moreover, it is estimated that 5G’s overall contribution to the world’s real gross domestic product (GDP) from 2020 to 2035 will reach the same size as India’s economy (Campbell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2017</xref>). As mentioned, 5G will be used mainly in three areas: eMBB, massive Internet of Things (MIoT) and mission critical services (MCS) (Campbell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2017</xref>). eMBB indicates extending cellular service and increasing capacity to include more structures, such as offices, industrial areas, shopping malls and major venues, and accommodating a much larger number of devices with high data volumes (Kavanagh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR229">2021</xref>). This will allow for more cost-effective data transmission. Secondly, the costs associated with MIoT will be significantly reduced by the energy efficiency of 5G and its ability to function in both licensed and unlicensed spectrums and the potential to supply deeper and more flexible coverage. Lastly, the adoption of 5G will fulfil the application’s high reliability and ultra-low latency connectivity needs. Thus, this technology will be frequently used in the operation of complex systems to eliminate the risk of failure. When all of 5G’s components are fully deployed and functioning, no wire or cable will be required to supply communications. 5G has the potential to be the ultimate answer to the old “last mile” challenge of delivering a comprehensive digital connection from the carrier network’s edge to the consumer without having to drill another hole through the wall.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Advanced Materials</title><sec><p id="Par23">The materials that developed and continue to evolve recently can be defined as advanced materials.

It is used in many fields, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) (Küfeoğlu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR248">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par64">Artificial intelligence (AI) is an important technology that facilitates, accelerates and even saves human life from time to time. It was invented to be useful in daily life. For example, AI devices doing housework are easier than doing it manually, and it takes more time. AI shortens the information processing process and increases efficiency (Küfeoğlu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR248">2021</xref>). For example, in the field of medicine, early detection of diseases has become easier. As a result of the data provided by AI, which performs morphological evaluation, it reduces the workload of healthcare professionals and facilitates the diagnosis of the disease (Mintz and Brodie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR305">2019</xref>). Furthermore, thanks to the use of AI, the patients’ medical data are stored and analysed to improve the healthcare system (Hamet and Tremblay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180">2017</xref>). Thus, the workflow accelerates, and patients can get the necessary treatment faster and easier.</p><p id="Par65">People use many examples from daily life and do not even know that they are using AI technology. Machine translations are vastly used on the Internet and social networks, improving day by day. The computer has learned to recognise both spoken and written speech. The other example is computer games. AI is used to create a game universe that controls bots – characters that people do not play. AI is used to create game strategies. Also, AI technologies are used to create smart houses. A special program controls everything that happens in the house – electricity, heating, ventilation and household appliances. Robot vacuums scan their surroundings to determine if they need to get started. Another example of the usage of artificial intelligence is in agriculture. It is imperative to use artificial intelligence in agriculture because it is difficult to achieve quality food in the modern world (Küfeoğlu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR248">2021</xref>). With the use of AI, farmers can achieve a better harvest by providing their crops with more optimal conditions (Sharma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR419">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par66">As can be seen from the examples given, nowadays, people are surrounded by AI technologies, and it is in every sphere. Thus, the main goal of these technologies is to make life easier and faster. The next thing related to the previous is that these technologies save time to spend on other things they want to do. Therefore, this is the marketing approach too. There can be an example of social media like Facebook and Instagram, where users tag their friends on the pictures, and now AI can do it automatically for them. So, the users save their time by using the media more in other ways.</p><p id="Par67">There are some reasons for using AI technologies. Firstly, AI can store and process huge amounts of data. With deep learning, new data is added to the previous data, so people reach more accurate data every time artificial intelligence is used. In addition, humans are constantly affected by their emotions when making decisions. A machine with AI is not influenced by its emotions when making decisions, as it has no emotions. Therefore, the decisions taken are more objective and logical (Khanzode and Sarode <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR238">2020</xref>). As a result, AI makes the device to which it is added faster, smarter and more efficient. According to the research, artificial intelligence technology has improved data science by 9.6%, health services by 6.3%, defence systems by 5.3% and natural language processing by 5.1% (Shabbir and Anwer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR416">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par68">If emerging technologies<index-term id="ITerm14"><term>Emerging technologies</term></index-term> are considered, predicting the future is essential too. AI has been a popular, prominent research and application area recently, but the question is, will artificial intelligence evolve more in the future? AI technology can reach a wide number of applications because of the ability of machines to work with humans, collaborate digitally without any limits, make sensible decisions with the results it analyses from the data at critical points, bring various ideas together and integrate them to produce physical or digital prototype properties. These abilities make AI a perfect technology that can continue to grow in the future. The most up-and-coming sectors that will use AI in the future are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">2.9</xref>.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 2.9</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Usage of artificial intelligence</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/532255_1_En_2_Fig9_HTML.png" id="MO9"><caption><p id="Par669">An illustration comprises a heptagon labeled usage of artificial intelligence.

With the astounding growing speed of technological developments, significant improvements have been made in the development of autonomous vehicles. The automotive industry, especially, has achieved significant advances in the mechanical and electrical characteristics of vehicles since the 1920s. Autonomous vehicles have also been envisaged as the most popular objective in this respect. Various automotive firms and universities made numerous attempts to pioneer autonomous cars between 1920 and 1980. In the 1920s, a radio-controlled driverless automobile was one of the earliest demonstrations (Davidson and Spinoulas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2015</xref>). The fact that there was a lot of development in the field of science and technology in this time period was the most important factor affecting the situation of autonomous vehicles from the 1980s to nowadays. Although the dream of autonomous vehicles dates back to old times, it took the 2010s to meet the technical requirements and take realistic steps.</p><p id="Par80">In the working mechanism of autonomous vehicles, many components are widely used, such as complicated artificial intelligence algorithms and devices with high processing power, sensors and actuators (Gowda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">2019</xref>). GPS (global positioning system), LIDAR (light detection and ranging), RADAR (radio detection and ranging) and video camera technologies are also integrated with these components (Ondruš et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR338">2020</xref>). In the context of GPS, the users of vehicles, municipalities and technology-driven businesses get help in the field of transportation planning from the mapping and power of data functions of GPS (Bayyou <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2019</xref>). Therefore, the inclusion of GPS inside of autonomous vehicles can increase the efficiency of vehicles by applying smart route optimisation plans and gathering information about the environment. Secondly, lidar is defined as a remote sensing technology that detects the distance between a target by making it visible with light particles and works by detecting the returning light (Ondruš et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR338">2020</xref>). Radar and lidar have similar properties in terms of working principles, except for the transmission source used, such as light and what it is intended to measure. In radar, which works with the principle of signal give and take, a change in the frequency of the signal occurs during the return phase from the receiver while measuring and this change is used to determine the speed of the vehicle (Sarkan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR400">2017</xref>). Lastly, detecting randomised human factors and physical elements that cannot be identified in the system but are present in the traffic is not easy with radio waves and light without the contribution of video cameras (Yun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR514">2019</xref>). All of these technologies and technical components are the factors that developed the performance level of autonomy in the vehicles to provide users with a well-prepared and safe experience while driving. In this direction, it has been claimed that AVs permit “drivers” to free up the time customarily spent checking the roadways, empowering them to utilise their time more successfully by resting, eating, unwinding or working during the time customarily spent driving (Haboucha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR176">2017</xref>). Figure <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">2.10</xref> shows how AVs work briefly.<fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig. 2.10</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>How automated vehicles work</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/532255_1_En_2_Fig10_HTML.png" id="MO10"><caption><p id="Par670">An aerial view of the car has 2 triangles and a rectangle on the hood.

According to Beiker and Calo, by eliminating the driver from the equation and relying on cars to manoeuvre themselves through traffic, this technology has the potential to enhance safety significantly, efficiency and mobility for humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2010</xref>). Over the years, via the increase in connection speed with technologies such as 5G, advances in the Internet of Things and the strengthening of the interconnectivity of mobile devices, feasible and applicable solutions have emerged in autonomous technologies. These advancements have prepared the path for autonomous vehicle (AV) technology, which promises to minimise collisions, energy consumption, pollution and traffic congestion while also boosting transportation accessibility (Bagloee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2016</xref>). Consequently, it can be said that the use of autonomous technologies on vehicles, such as collective, individual and scientific research, has been helping the processes become more streamlined, adaptable and efficient for the user due to advancements in emerging technologies<index-term id="ITerm15"><term>Emerging technologies</term></index-term>.</p><p id="Par82">As has been stated earlier, autonomous vehicles have become significant for a large number of areas in life. Chan highlighted autonomous cars’ beneficial contributions and impacts on several levels, including users, infrastructure and sustainable cities and societies (Chan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2017</xref>). Firstly, for individual users, crashes occurring with vehicles due to lack of attention can be prevented by providing a more reliable driving experience by software and hardware components included in autonomous vehicles. It would not be unfeasible to have more secure and quicker transportation in cities, which save time with the help of self-driving cars. Such junctions are expected to have an important impact on the road system of each city. The travel and waiting times will be considerably shorter (Zohdy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR522">2013</xref>). Additionally, it is thought to have an effect that can prevent 9 out of 10 accidents that occur under normal conditions (Chehri and Mouftah <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2019</xref>). To sum the relationships between autonomous technology and citizens, it is possible to have a more comfortable transportation experience and fewer worries about the journeys with the integration of those vehicles into the daily life of humans.</p><p id="Par83">On the other hand, in city road planning, the problems which are faced under normal circumstances can be decreased by autonomous technologies. More controllable vehicles provide a clear structure of roads, low cost of building parking lots and roads and more accessible public transportation services which can help urban planning, easier public and mobility services, an incentive for private investors on their business models<index-term id="ITerm16"><term>Business models</term></index-term>. This emerging technology<index-term id="ITerm17"><term>Emerging technologies</term></index-term> conserves resources for infrastructure in the city, such as parking and road development, while vehicle technology also decreases traffic and eliminates possible parking problems. The use of advanced and real-time GPS allows for a more efficient navigation experience, resulting in more accessible, dependable and adaptable routes. Besides, the sensors implanted nowadays within the autonomous vehicle are “intelligent” since they do not as it gave an information estimation but are sent with a coordinated computer program brick competent to perform, to begin with, a stage of preparing this data (Chehri and Mouftah <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2019</xref>). Consequently, more efficient infrastructure due to improved vehicle control is provided by GPS and sensors.</p><p id="Par84">The last promise of autonomous vehicles, sustainable cities and high-level comfort of societies can be achieved. Most governments used to develop additional roads and streets to address the rising urban environment demands. Due to a lack of public funding and physical space, the transportation network, which has a lower capacity than the population, has been overburdened, causing additional congestion, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and significant disruptions to people (Dameri <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2014</xref>). The previously mentioned developments regarding autonomous vehicles offer impressive solutions for sustainable cities in response to these problems. Autonomous vehicles play an important role in reducing physical and environmental noise pollution, reaching the desired level of city traffic flow, eliminating the security concerns of the city’s people, speeding up regional procurement processes and reducing procurement costs (Seuwou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR415">2020</xref>). As a result, it is not impossible to reach smart, sustainable, green and information cities with the integration of AVs into urban life. Figure <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">2.11</xref> summarises potential use areas of AVs.<fig id="Fig11"><label>Fig. 2.11</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Potential use areas of autonomous vehicles</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/532255_1_En_2_Fig11_HTML.png" id="MO11"><caption><p id="Par671">A chart with the heading potential of autonomous vehicles.

To clarify the unique function of each vehicle, defining its capabilities and complexities with their autonomy level is a must. Building a classification analysis of AVs is significant in terms of their capability to make tasks autonomously (Ilková and Ilka <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR203">2017</xref>). According to the model created by SAE International, it presents a taxonomy with precise definitions for six levels of driving automation, ranging from no driving automation (level 0) to complete driving automation (level 5), in the context of motor vehicles and their operation on routes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR209">2018</xref>). The classification system is based on how steering and braking are managed, how much human control is required when driving and whether the AV can operate without it in all scenarios (Alawadhi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020</xref>). For each level, elements represent the low processing capabilities. The difference between levels 2 and 3, where the human driver does part of the dynamic driving task and level 3 when the automated driving system performs the full dynamic driving work, is important (Ilková and Ilka <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR203">2017</xref>). Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">2.12</xref> explains the automation levels in detail.<fig id="Fig12"><label>Fig. 2.12</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Six levels of autonomy</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/532255_1_En_2_Fig12_HTML.png" id="MO12"><caption><p id="Par672">An illustration of six levels of autonomy.

Levels 0 to 5 are mentioned from top to bottom to the right of each label.</p></caption></graphic></fig></p><p id="Par86">When everything is taken into consideration, it would not be an exaggeration to claim that autonomous vehicles will be very influential for the future trends of the technology world and automotive industry. When the future situation is examined, it is obvious that minor and major developments in autonomous vehicles are in interaction with each other. For user-oriented improvements, research states that the adaptation of users into autonomous vehicles will be possible with the modified after-sales mechanism, easy solutions to technical problems and flexible supply chain systems (Bertoncello and Wee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2015</xref>). Furthermore, the most used ways of transportation will be AVs by saving drivers more than half an hour per day, making quite a lot of parking space suitable for use and providing life and property safety by offering a lower error rate in driving experiences by 2050 (Bertoncello and Wee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2015</xref>). When considering the future state of autonomous vehicles, there is no significant obstacle to the increase in usage rates. Up to 15% of new automobiles produced in 2030 might be fully driverless after technology, and regulatory concerns are overcome (Gao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">2016</xref>). There are serious studies of many research companies related to this subject. BCG predicted that worldwide sales would level at about 100 million per year by 2030 and that by 2035, 30% of the fleet would be electric, and 25% would be autonomous (Jones and Bishop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR221">2020</xref>). Additionally, according to KPMG, by 2030, linked cars will account for 75% of the UK motor-park (used vehicles), with about 40% being partially automated and fewer than 10% being totally autonomous (Jones and Bishop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR221">2020</xref>). A great deal of work falls on manufacturers and technology decision-makers to make these predictions feasible and to truly feel the impact of autonomous vehicles in the future. Considering the cumulative progress of technology, it is obvious that the development of autonomous vehicles will gain momentum with the production of prototype projects. Millions of lines of code are already embedded in the latest vehicles rolling off European manufacturing floors; the next phase of autonomous driving plainly requires both engineering acumen and digital smarts to develop, build and distribute successful automobiles (Gupta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Big Data</title><p id="Par87">Big data research is at the forefront of modern business and science. It mainly includes data from online transactions, videos, images, audios, emails, logs, clickstreams, postings, social networking interactions, science data, health records, sensors, search queries, mobile phones and associated apps. These data are stored in databases, which became highly complicated to capture, store, form, distribute, manage, analyse and visualise using standard database software (Sagiroglu and Sinanc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR392">2013</xref>). At the end of 2016, it was stated that 90% of the world’s data had been produced in just 2 years, at a rate of 2.5 quintillion bytes per day. Furthermore, data is growing at an exponential pace, with estimates of more than 16 zettabytes (16 trillion GB) of useful data by 2020. The advent of the Internet of Things, as well as the global proliferation of mobile devices – technologies, not just humans, are producing data – and the growth of social media, which has transformed everyone into a broadcaster and hence a data producer, is also adding to the quickly growing volume of data. The vast bulk of the information is no longer numerical and poorly organised. As a result, the majority of data is in the form of unstructured data, such as text, video, audio and images, which are becoming increasingly widespread (Suoniemi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR446">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par88">To put it simply, big data refers to massive volumes of information. However, size is not the only factor to consider (Oliveira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR337">2019</xref>). Although there is no singular definition for big data, there are some relevant definitions in the literature. Big data comprises structured data found in organisational databases and unstructured data created by new communication technologies (e.g. Internet of Things), such as images, videos and audio (Sestino et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR414">2020</xref>). Big data also refers to a collection of enormous, complicated datasets that are too vast for traditional data processing tools and other relational database management technologies to analyse, manage and record in the timescale required. Big data also implies the diversity and velocity of data and its volume. The three Vs of big data are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">2.13</xref>.<fig id="Fig13"><label>Fig. 2.13</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Three Vs of big data</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/532255_1_En_2_Fig13_HTML.png" id="MO13"><caption><p id="Par673">A cyclic diagram has 3 circles on top, bottom-left, and bottom-right.

The structural variability of a dataset, which might be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured, is referred to as variety. Data that has been arranged in a way that makes it easier to analyse is known as structured data. On the other hand, unstructured data is data that is difficult to analyse and includes movies, photos and audio files. Although semi-structured data is not subject to as stringent standards as tabular data, it can be saved in XML (extensible markup language) format. Finally, velocity refers to how quickly data is produced and processed from various sources such as social media and the Internet (Oliveira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR337">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par90">According to the TDWI (transforming data with intelligence) Big Data Analytics survey, the benefits of using big data include better-targeted marketing, more direct business insights, automated decision-making, client segmentation, sales and market potential recognition, risk quantification and market trends, more lucrative investments, understanding of company transformation, better planning and forecasting (Sagiroglu and Sinanc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR392">2013</xref>). According to current research, big data facilitates corporate decision-making through technology, systems, techniques, practices and applications related to gathering, storage, analysis, integration and deployment of large amounts of structured and unstructured data. From $3.2 billion in 2010 to $16.9 billion in 2015, the vendor market for big data technology has grown over 40% annually (Suoniemi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR446">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par91">Non-expert staff, cost, the difficulty of designing analytical systems, poverty of database software, scalability issues, inability to make big data usable for end-users, incompetence in reaching enough data load speed in current database software and lack of compelling business case are some of the disadvantages of big data mentioned by TDWI (Sagiroglu and Sinanc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR392">2013</xref>). According to McKinsey Global Institute’s Report, the value potential of big data is mostly unexplored and underused by businesses today (McKinsey Global Institute <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR300">2011</xref>). Three key problems that are preventing businesses from getting larger benefits from big data are (1) organisational structure and procedures; (2) strategy, leadership and talent; and (3) information technology (IT) infrastructure. Many businesses are unclear on how to integrate big data and afraid to spend on new information technology, or they just consider big data analytics to be arduous.</p><p id="Par92">We live in a big data era, defined by the rapid accumulation of omnipresent information. Big data contains an infinite amount of information. It is expanding in various industries, giving a method to enhance and simplify operations (Lv et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR280">2017</xref>). By becoming a necessity of our age, big data is almost everywhere. Any industry that accumulates a large amount of data, such as e-commerce, geography and transportation, research and technology, health, manufacturing and agriculture, can benefit from big data analytics. According to Andreas Weigend, professor at Stanford University and Amazon’s former chief scientist, “Big Data is when your datasets become so large that you have to start innovating how to collect, store, organize, analyse and share it” (Backaitis 2012, cited in Gobble <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">2013</xref>). This large amount of data collected by companies and institutions is processed, providing them with an opportunity to evaluate their performance and gain insights by creating “information”, which has now become a valuable resource like money (Vassakis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR480">2018</xref>). Some of the key application areas of “big data” in different sectors are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">2.14</xref>, and those areas can be summarised as follows (Zellner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR529">2016</xref>; Memon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR304">2017</xref>)<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par93">Agriculture: With the latest developments in agriculture, the use of big data has increased gradually with a better understanding of its importance.

The increased usage of online and mobile channels has resulted in fewer face-to-face contacts between consumers and banks while boosting virtual interactions and the volume of client data. Banks now have far more data about their clients than ever before regarding both volume and variety. However, only a small part of them is used to achieve successful commercial outcomes. Like most e-commerce firms, big data technology can make efficient use of consumer data, assisting in the development of customised products and services. Main application areas of big data within the banking sector include credit scoring and risk management. Automated procedures based on big data technology, such as machine learning algorithms, make loan and credit decisions in seconds. Moreover, the need for better risk monitoring, risk coverage and increased predictive capability in risk models has never been greater. Big data technology, along with hundreds of risk indicators, can help banks, asset managers and insurance companies detect possible hazards earlier, respond more quickly and make more informed choices.

In parallel with these developments, organisations are also undergoing a systemic transformation in the knowledge-based economy. Information management and big data analysis are concerned with strategies for maintaining a shared foundation of corporate knowledge, allowing different organisational units and functions to coordinate their efforts, exchange knowledge to support decisions and generate competitive advantages. In this sense, businesses effectively leverage big data to streamline processes, create efficiencies and improve services provided to customers, especially online shopping platforms such as Amazon (Madden 2012, cited in Gobble <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">2013</xref>). Through big data applications, corporate knowledge may spread globally and be kept in several formats, including skills and expertise in the minds of researchers and workers and organised information in databases and other big data corporate resources (de Vasconcelos and Rocha <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2019</xref>), which offers opportunities for fostering innovation<index-term id="ITerm18"><term>Innovations</term></index-term>.</p><p id="Par102">Economics, management and business data analytics are all changing in the age of big data. The emphasis on economic and management science has shifted to empirical studies and the systematic use of information technology and computer systems. The digital revolution and the global big data phenomenon are anticipated to have more impact in economic research. Researchers and corporate executives and consultants are increasingly relying on large-scale business data obtained through partnerships and corporate networking. Thanks to the Internet, corporate intranets have grown into sociability and knowledge sharing centres. There is a higher reliance on making sense of big data in today’s highly connected organisational environment. This implies the need for software solutions that enable the efficient and methodical assessment of massive amounts of company data. This cause-and-effect connection leads to predictive analysis in knowledge-intensive enterprises, such as data mining methods based on machine learning and artificial intelligence. Making sense of often unstructured data may be a time-consuming effort. To successfully solve technological, skill-based and organisational difficulties, businesses must acquire a diverse assortment of big data-related IT resources (Suoniemi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR446">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par103">Today, in parallel with the increase in the number of users and devices connected to the Internet, a large amount of data has been collected in the databases of companies and technologies that will enable this data to turn into commercial value have come to the fore. With the increasing importance of data, many companies have transferred a significant amount of workload to the departments of these companies. To survive and compete, businesses must integrate industry 4.0 techniques into their activities. They must modify their management, organisation and production practices to achieve that. The best way to achieve this aim is by “reengineering”: Its origins in the realm of information technology have now broadened to include the wide process of revamping key business operations to improve organisational performance. Reengineering methods give conceptual references targeted at rethinking and rebuilding corporate processes through digitalisation. The industry 4.0 revolution has stressed a collaborative link between business process digitalisation and IT since it began to develop more flexible, coordinated, group-oriented and real-time communication capabilities (Sestino et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR414">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par104">Nowadays, big data is at the first stage of its evolution. Most of the businesses in different sectors still have not implemented the big data concept. However, many of them continue to work in this direction, as described before. Even in this early stage, the positive effects on the enterprises cannot be ignored. Many individuals envision big data as the planet’s core nervous system, with individuals serving as its sensors. However, it is obvious that the concept of big data will lead to another revolution in the concept of business shortly, based on the competency it offers to interpret and analyse even the most variable and unrelated data (Chauhan and Sood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par105">To put it shortly, current tools and approaches perform data processing inefficiently. The objective of all present analytical techniques and data processing technology is to process a small amount of data. Existing technologies for large data processing reduce efficiency and generate a slew of complications. As a result, present technologies cannot entirely resolve large data challenges. Cloud computing, artificial intelligence, parallel computing, grid computing, stream computing, bio-inspired computing, quantum computing, semantic web and software-defined storage are critical research issues that need to be studied for the big data concept to be understood and applied properly (Yaqoob et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR509">2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Biometrics</title><p id="Par106">Globalisation has allowed humanity to become more interconnected, with communication between individuals increasingly mediated through technological platforms and transactions increasingly frequently conducted remotely (Fairhurst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">2019</xref>). The term biometrics is derived from the Greek term <italic>bio</italic>, meaning “life”, and <italic>metric</italic>, meaning “measurement” (Gillis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">b</xref>). Biometrics refers to the authentication of a person’s identity through chemical, physical and behavioural characteristics. Biometric technology offers a safe and convenient identification system; users do not have to remember complex passwords or carry identification documents, easily lost or stolen. Biometric identity verification systems compare an individual’s live-captured unique characteristics to a biometric template stored in a database to determine their resemblance. The system authenticates the information acquired in real-time against the reference model of biometric data to verify an individual’s identity. Biometric verification has a high industrial acceptance rate worldwide due to the introduction of digitalisation and computerised databases, which ensure security through fast personal identification.

In the case of fingerprint and iris recognition systems, such as scanners or cameras, and voice and signature recognition systems, movement acquisition devices like microphones are used (National Biometric Security Project <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR326">2008</xref>). An individual must be enrolled in the system before a biometric system can be used to determine identity, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">2.15</xref>. The registration process involves the collection of measurement of the individual’s characteristic(s) and the storage of this data as a biometric template within the system. The template is matched to live-captured biometric data in subsequent usage. Biometric systems typically work in one of two modes after the enrolment process: biometric authentication or a one-to-many comparison. The technique of matching gathered biometric data to an individual’s biometric template to confirm identification is known as biometric authentication. Rather, to identify an unknown individual using biometric identification. The individual is acknowledged if the system can match the biometric sample to a stored template within an acceptable threshold.</p><p id="Par108">Biometrics have a long history, with the first examples present in the ancient Mesopotamian civilisation of Babylon. The first descriptions of biometrics are from the Babylonian civilisation around 500 BC, while the first record of a biometric identifying system dates from the 1800s. Biometrics has been around as today’s technology since the 1960s. Biometric technology has continued to evolve over the years and has developed into many forms by 2021. Contemporary biometric devices collect a variety of identifying information and use it for diverse purposes across sectors. Some devices can authenticate identity without any interference or direct contact with the person whose information is being collected; this includes voice recognition, walking gait and other specific behaviours. These are considered behavioural biometrics, which detects unique distinguishing features depending on how individuals interact with their systems. Behavioural biometric systems are especially useful for cybersecurity and online fraud protection. Many behavioural biometrics applications, unlike physiological solutions, do not require an apparatus for data gathering.</p><p id="Par109">Unlike behavioural biometrics, physical biometrics are based on an individual’s unique and quantifiable physical characteristics. Fingerprints, retinae and DNA sequences collected from blood, saliva and other bodily fluids are key in biometric technology widely used in forensics, medicine and criminal justice cases. These biometrics require a device that links these unique properties to an existing database. The objective is to match the individual’s unique characteristics to an existing record or file to identify them. Biometric travel documents are required to cross most international borders, and they provide an elevated level of security to the countries attempting to regulate who comes in and out and secure their borders. Biometric voting documents could also provide a new level of security in elections (DHS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">2021</xref>).

In the late 1960s, the Shearson-Hamill investment bank on Wall Street applied Indentimat, one of the earliest automated biometric systems. It utilised hand geometry for nearly two decades. Some systems are capable of taking simple two-dimensional measurements of the hand’s palm.

Computer systems developed for this identification method can now be as successful as an expert at detecting distinctive features in signatures. In addition, signature identification systems do not only focus on the shape of the signature but also can detect the “speed of using the pen” of the signer or the “pressure applied to the surface” while signing (Phadke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR355">2013</xref>).</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par118">These different forms of biometrics have applications across a variety of sectors and applications which are rapidly increasing as the technology develops. As a result, biometric technology has progressed substantially in recent years, with increasing performance, faster transaction rates and lower costs (Xiao <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR503">2007</xref>). Some experts believe that new biometric technologies and applications, such as brainwave biometrics, vascular pattern recognition, body salinity identification, infrared fingertip imaging and pattern recognition, may emerge soon (Asha and Chellappan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2012</xref>). Because a biometric sensor will never capture the same data twice, comparing biometric characteristics is an inaccurate comparison; computational intelligence-based techniques may be able to solve this problem in the future. In recent years, various approaches, such as neural networks, fuzzy logic and the evolutionary algorithm, have increasingly addressed complicated biometric authentication and identification issues. Due to rising security demands, technological advancements and decreasing prices, we can expect the development of more biometric applications in the future (Xiao <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR503">2007</xref>). Although convenient and widely applicable, biometrics may also come with numerous challenges. Therefore, the following requirements should be fulfilled to execute the technology on large scales: high levels of accuracy and performance under varied operating conditions and user composition; sensor compatibility; a fast collection of biometric data in difficult operation settings; low failure-to-enrol rate, high degrees of privacy and template protection; and protecting and securing supporting information systems (Jain and Kumar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR212">2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Bioplastics</title><p id="Par119">Plastics constitute a huge part of people’s lives because they are used everywhere.

While they are useful, they pose a threat to the environment. Unfortunately, 34 million tonnes of plastic waste were produced per year, and 93% of the material was dumped into oceans and landfills (Mekonnen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR303">2013</xref>). Plastics dissolve in nature extremely slowly. This causes the products to pollute the environment throughout the years. Biobased plastics, which is organic material from animals or plants, is a better alternative than petroleum-based plastics. Biobased plastics can dissolve in nature faster when suitable conditions are provided. Its process depends on environmental conditions such as temperature, materials and application. Biodegradation is when microorganisms found in nature convert materials into natural substances with a chemical reaction (Kerry and Butler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR234">2008</xref>).

Bioplastic is described as a plastic substance that is either biobased or biodegradable or has both qualities (European Bioplastics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">2020</xref>). Bioplastics can derive from biomass such as sugar cane or cellulose; this process is called biobased (Gill <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">2014</xref>). Renewable biomass resources derived from natural biopolymers (e.g. carbohydrates, proteins and recovered food waste) are used to manufacture bioplastics (Brodin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2017</xref>; Yamada et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR507">2020</xref>). Besides the biopolymers, microalgae is a strong biomass source to produce bioplastic. <italic>Chlorella</italic> and <italic>Spirulina</italic> were the most common algae species used in manufacturing biopolymers and plastic blends.

According to 2019 data, bioplastics constitute approximately 1% of the 360 million tonnes of plastic produced annually. But as more complicated materials, applications and products emerge, the demand for bioplastics is increasing and the market is growing rapidly. The bioplastic industry has become a young and innovative sector, both economically and ecologically, in the name of a sustainable bio-economy, as it uses its existing resources more efficiently and produces lower carbon emissions (European Bioplastics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">2020</xref>).

It should be emphasised that the carbon footprint of a bioplastic is highly reliant on the plastic’s ability to permanently store the carbon that the growing plant extracts from the air.

This sequestration is reversed if the resultant bioplastic degrades back to CO<sub>2</sub> and water. However, a permanent bioplastic that is meant to be like polyethene or other common polymers permanently retains CO<sub>2</sub>.

New developments may lead to increased productivity in production and new opportunities in the field of bioplastics in the future. In addition, since microorganism biology can be applied and commercialised in different sectors such as agriculture, medicine and pharmacy, it also provides an opportunity for bioplastic production.

In addition, labelling laws might be modified depending on a product’s raw material usage, energy consumption, manufacturing and use emissions (Bezirhan Arikan and Ozsoy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing</title><p id="Par136">In the most general sense, biotechnology can be defined as the synthesis of modern technology and naturally existing biological processes. Biotechnology, or biotech, uses biological systems and/or living organisms to develop new technological instruments, products and machines across a wide range of fields and disciplines. There are three main branches of biotechnology: genetic engineering, protein engineering and metabolic engineering (Gavrilescu and Chisti <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">2005</xref>). Biomanufacturing is a type of manufacturing that uses biological systems (such as living microorganisms, resting cells, animal cells, plant cells, tissues, enzymes or in vitro synthetic – enzymatic – systems) to make commercially feasible biomolecules for use in the agricultural, food, material, energy and pharmaceutical industries (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR517">2017</xref>). Despite its connotation as some of the most advanced technology in the contemporary world, biotechnology has existed for centuries and even millennia, albeit in simpler forms than those we know today. Two often-cited examples of early biotechnology are bread baking and beer fermentation. Both of these processes combine the naturally occurring biological properties of wheat and yeast and use human intervention and technology to create the desired product. As scientific knowledge expanded, so did humanity’s ability to understand more complex biological processes and eventually intervene in them to create new technologies.</p><p id="Par137">Modern biotechnology and biomanufacturing began with the discovery of proteins in 1830. In the twentieth century, revolutionary knowledge on the structure and process of DNA allowed for rapid advancement in biotechnology. The discovery of DNA’s structure helped to understand human genetic code while contributing to the foundation of genetic engineering and recombinant DNA technology (Khan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR235">2011</xref>). By 1976, scientists developed the first working synthetic gene. This development was followed by recombinant human insulin and human growth hormone production in the late 1970s. By 1994, the susceptibility gene for breast cancer was discovered. The year 1997 marked another significant milestone when the first clone of a mammal, a sheep named Dolly, was created. Additionally, a remarkable development was achieved in 2008 when a blue rose was developed through genetic modification. Over the past few decades, there have been several other discoveries in biotechnology that could be classified as milestones, such as the invention of antibiotics and the application of selective breeding in plants and animals, which led to better crop and livestock production (Khan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR235">2011</xref>).

For instance, preventative therapies are executed using medical biotechnology, which generally refers to harnessing living cells to develop pharmaceutical treatments and cures for a range of diseases and conditions. These types of technologies have been transformative in the prevention and treatment of several types of cancer (Pham <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR356">2018</xref>). Medical biotech has also played a significant role in reducing the impact of infectious diseases. The mRNA vaccines developed in 2020 to protect humans against the COVID-19 virus provide an excellent example of biotechnology developed in response to a threatening infectious disease (Jackson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR530">2020</xref>). Biotechnology has also allowed for earlier and more accurate diagnoses of diseases that are caused by genetic factors as technology now allows for genomics to analyse patients’ genetic sequencing and look for risk factors and/or existing conditions based on DNA (Pham <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR356">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par148">Another revolutionising biotechnological development is genetically modified crops. Many of these genetic interventions were developed to increase food production and profits for the companies developing them.

Medical biotechnology is already serving more than 350 million patients around the world through the treatment and prevention of everyday and chronic ailments. New fields of study emerge as technology and knowledge develop, including nanobiotechnology, bioinformatics, pharmacogenomics, regenerative medicine and therapeutic proteins (Khan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR235">2011</xref>). Additionally, the use of recombinant organisms will have a wide range of applications, including new vaccines, solvents and chemicals. Another area that will gain importance is biochips, which are relatively more energy efficient compared to silicon chips. These products could have an impact on hormone secretion and heart rate. Gene therapy is another field that will have a rapidly increasing demand. With the help of this application, genetic diseases or disorders can be prevented by implementing a healthy, mutated gene (Khan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR235">2011</xref>). Furthermore, with their environmental enhancement impacts, biotechnology and biomanufacturing will have key roles in the adoption of sustainability<index-term id="ITerm21"><term>Sustainabilities</term></index-term> on a long-term scale. In this context, biological production systems, as one of the applications of biomanufacturing, are appealing because they employ fundamental renewable resources to generate a wide range of compounds using low-energy processes (Gavrilescu and Chisti <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">2005</xref>). Instead of finite and volatile fossil fuels, industrial biotech can assist in the fight against climate change by providing an alternative and safer source of global energy. It has resulted in significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and aims to reduce 2.5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per year by 2030 (<italic>Report on Industrial Biotechnology and Climate Change: Opportunities and Challenges – OECD</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR378">2011</xref>).

The effective integration of food science and synthetic biology is a key technology for addressing current food safety and nutrition issues and a key approach for overcoming the sustainability<index-term id="ITerm22"><term>Sustainabilities</term></index-term> concerns associated with traditional food technology. It may be possible to eliminate the disadvantages of traditional agriculture while boosting resource conversion efficiency by incorporating synthetic biological technologies into future food. In general, the synthetic biology-driven food sector has the potential to address future food supply issues. A future food revolution powered by synthetic biology is possible in three stages. Firstly, synthetic biology can enhance traditional food production and processing. Secondly, synthetic biology can improve food nutrition or provide new functions. Thirdly, using created microbial communities in synthetic biology can change the conventional fermentation food production method (Lv et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR281">2021</xref>).

Therefore, it works not like traditional databases but as a digital ledger where transactions are listed one after the other.

Because each block is cryptically linked to the previous one, changing any of them changes all subsequent blocks.</p><p id="Par166">Within the global and fast-paced system, it is seen that both companies and countries are trying to catch up with digital transformation with their efforts to expand their field of activity. The most important feature that ensures its reliability is that a saved database cannot be changed or corrected again; with this aspect, it would not be wrong to say that blockchain is not a database but a data recording system. In this way, users can connect to the network, perform new transactions, verify transactions and create new blocks without intermediaries.

The decentralised aspect of blockchain provides superior security because it is combined with encryption. Blockchain is a decentralised and cyberattack-resistant database. It is not possible to change the history of the ledger or send the same transaction twice (i.e. double-spend) as every transaction ever made on the network is recorded and stored permanently. This certainty creates mutual trust. Congestion management using electric vehicles in grid services; energy data registration in a secure medium as an open ledger; and billing, switching providers, swapping capacities and so on are just a few examples of how blockchain technology can be employed (Dena <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2019</xref>).<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par169"><italic>Transparency</italic></p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par170">Everyone, not just its users, has access to the blockchain database.

This paradigm shift towards decentralised local energy exchange via peer-to-peer (P2P) will drastically minimise transmission losses while also deferring costly network upgrades. Unlike centralised architectures, the blockchain distributed ledger does not require the intervention of third parties to preserve the system’s integrity and security. Blockchain is a distributed ledger that employs automated technology to create smart contracts that improve cybersecurity and optimise energy operations, lowering transaction costs considerably (Küfeoğlu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR247">2020</xref>).

It is estimated that carbon dioxide emissions around the globe will be higher in 2050 than they were in 2018. Forecasts indicate that CO<sub>2</sub> emissions will increase gradually every 5 years and will exceed 40 billion metric tonnes from 2045 (Statista <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR362">2019</xref>). Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has emerged to mitigate climate change by reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (Singh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR428">2013</xref>). The first large-scale project on CO<sub>2</sub> capturing was planned to enhance produced oil by injecting CO<sub>2</sub> and increasing the pressure on the oil reservoirs in the 1970s (IAE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR196">2016</xref>). The increase in oil and gas production through injected captured CO<sub>2</sub> has revolutionised the energy sector, and the importance of carbon storage has also expanded. Although CCS is used to increase production, it has become one of the agenda items of many countries since it is known that the long-term effects of CO<sub>2</sub> released after this production on global climate change will be substantial. While CO<sub>2</sub> emissions dropped dramatically by 5.8% in 2020, the demand for fossil fuels in 2021 seems to reverse this situation. A 4.8% increase in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is expected in 2021, with demand for coal, oil and gas recovering after the temporary impact of the pandemic (IAE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR196">2016</xref>). Most of the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are caused by the use of fossil resources. The intensive use of coal, natural gas and oil in power plants, industrial facilities, vehicles, residences and workplaces to meet energy and heating needs are the biggest cause of the emission problem. The use of these resources releases large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Increasing livestock farming, cutting down trees, etc. are other causes of increased CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. However, their impacts are not as notable as fossil fuels and applying CCS for these causes ensures emission reduction in the longer term. In this regard, CSS methods are mostly focused on fossil fuels. Figure <xref rid="Fig27" ref-type="fig">2.27</xref> illustrates the CCS stages in detail.<fig id="Fig27"><label>Fig. 2.27</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Carbon capture and storage phases</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/532255_1_En_2_Fig27_HTML.png" id="MO27"><caption><p id="Par687">An illustration of C C S stages.

Lawmakers primarily aim to reduce carbon emissions for measures related to climate change. Governments and companies have adopted carbon-neutral methods to reduce this impact of fossil fuels, which have an equal balance between emitting carbon and absorbing carbon from the atmosphere in carbon sinks (European Parliament <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">2019</xref>). In this direction, incentives and orientations towards carbon-neutral technologies are increasing, together with regulatory methods such as carbon tax and carbon footprint monitoring. However, carbon-neutral methods are still not enough in line with climate targets. Countries that have committed to zero carbon emissions until 2050 at the Paris Climate Summit have started to use carbon-negative methods and carbon-neutral methods to achieve this goal. Carbon-negative methods aim to reabsorb more carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere than disseminated (IEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR199">2020</xref>). Although it is difficult to withdraw more carbon than is emitted today, carbon-negative methods have a significant role in reducing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere.

Carbon capture is a technology with multiple methodologies, but its basic logic is based on the separation of free CO<sub>2</sub> from the air. The capture of CO<sub>2</sub> could be classified into three types, i.e. post-combustion capture, pre-capture and direct capture (Kuckshinrichs and Hake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR246">2015</xref>). The fuel is not directly burned in pre-combustion capture but transformed into synthesised gas at the appropriate temperature and pressure. Afterwards, CO<sub>2</sub> is transformed into carbon dioxide and H<sub>2</sub>, and CO<sub>2</sub> is collected for H<sub>2</sub> as the fuel (Rackley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR369">2017</xref>). CO<sub>2</sub> is captured from the industrial process waste into a nearly pure CO<sub>2</sub> stream in post-combustion. (e.g. cement plant flue gases). In direct capture, pure CO<sub>2</sub> is captured directly from the air (e.g. mineralisation of steel slag) (Goel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">2015</xref>). The separated CO<sub>2</sub> could be used for different purposes such as soda ash production, oil drilling and alternative energy sources production. Thus, the storage of captured carbons has great significance. Figure <xref rid="Fig28" ref-type="fig">2.28</xref> articulates these carbon capture methods.<fig id="Fig28"><label>Fig. 2.28</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Carbon capture methods.

Each of these categories is sub-divided into combustion, adsorption, cryogenic distillation, membrane, gas hydrates, and chemical looping.</p></caption></graphic></fig></p><p id="Par190">Geological storage is the most used method to store carbon. First of all, carbon is captured in different ways. Then it is injected into different geological forms like oil and gas reservoirs, saline forms, unmineable coal seams and basalt formations. CO<sub>2</sub> is stored by impermeable cap-rock (Rackley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR369">2017</xref>). By significant developments of technologies in the injection industry, geological storage is in oil and gas reservoirs preferred by companies to store carbon. Stored CO<sub>2</sub> is also utilised for unmineable coal because its molecules could easily interact with the coal surface. The main problem for geological storage is transportation cost. Although it is not necessary to construct storage facilities, it is important to invest in transportation infrastructure to deliver CO<sub>2</sub> to these facilities. Ocean storage is one of the greatest storage since oceans are major candidates to store captured CO<sub>2</sub>. However, storage must be in-depth not to release CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere. Direct dissolution is sent by ships with pipes to deep waters at supercritical fluid, and it creates CO<sub>2</sub> lakes in the depth of the oceans. Creating CO<sub>2</sub> lakes in the oceans is an efficient method for long-term storage (Rackley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR369">2017</xref>). Mineral storage is suitable with the law of thermodynamics so it can occur in nature without any application by humans. CO<sub>2</sub> reacts with metal oxides and produces stable carbonates. This process takes over a long timescale in nature. When this process operates at higher temperatures and pressure, it can be accelerated, creating energy costs (Rhodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR380">2012</xref>).</p><p id="Par191">Although CCS is a useful technology, it has not received the necessary response in the industry due to its cost. The high unit and technology costs are among the main reasons why the private sector does not invest in this field. Incentives from governments, reduction in technology costs and private sector investments in this field play an important role in the future of CCS technology. In sectors where carbon capture is easy, and CO<sub>2</sub> is heavily emitted, CCS technologies perform more efficiently and more economically. Examples of these are the cement, iron and steel and refinery sectors. In addition, decomposed CO<sub>2</sub> has great importance, and it needs to be used or stored without being released back. The most suitable areas for storage are oil reservoirs. In addition, this storage method is used to increase oil production by pumping it into the oil deposits stuck between the layers. Figure <xref rid="Fig29" ref-type="fig">2.29</xref> illustrates the abovementioned storage methods.<fig id="Fig29"><label>Fig. 2.29</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Carbon storage methods</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/532255_1_En_2_Fig29_HTML.png" id="MO29"><caption><p id="Par689">An organizational chart of carbon storage methods is categorized into geological, unmineable coal, ocean storage, direct dissolution, and mineral storage.</p></caption></graphic></fig></p><p id="Par192">The efficiency of carbon-capturing technology may be as high as 90% when it comes to capturing the CO<sub>2</sub> that is released from industrial processes. These industrial processes are in a broad spectrum, from the energy sector to manufacturing and construction. Among all, the energy sector is covering the highest percentage when it comes to carbon-emitting, by almost 40%, when examined globally (Leung et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR265">2014</xref>). Steps of capturing, storing and utilising carbon are crucial to the environmental act against global warming by reducing and preventing the negative effects at some level. Overall carbon emissions may be negative with a combined strategy of capturing carbon and utilising biomass. In addition to the contribution of the global warming fight mentioned above, calculations indicate that CCS’s contribution to emission reduction attempts may be needed to reach a percentile of 14 to keep the globe’s temperature at a certain level of 2 °C or less by the year of 2050.</p><p id="Par193">Renewable energy, which has become increasingly important, cannot meet the rising energy demand on its own, and it seems that fossil fuels will still play an important role. According to Jackson, although renewable energy is now considered the most cost-effective source of power generation worldwide, the growth in energy demand and the growth needs of governments indicates that fossil fuels will continue to play an active role (Jackson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR210">2020</xref>). In the future, CCS technology appears to grow more and become crucial in terms of maintaining the environmental balance by absorbing CO<sub>2</sub> while supplying energy demand from fossil fuels. Aiming to benefit from the ecological and economic advantages of CCS, the UK government will provide £1 billion in funding to support the development of four CCS centres and cluster projects across the UK by the end of the decade (Kelly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR231">2020</xref>). Furthermore, the Norwegian climate solution will heavily rely on CCS with developed versions of the technology. Equinor, Shell and Total are investing in the Northern Lights project, which is Norway’s first CO<sub>2</sub> storage licence and a key component of the Norwegian government’s “Longship” strategy (Equinor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">2020</xref>). Canada is another country investing in Direct Air Capturing (DAC) technology. <italic>Carbon Engineering</italic> states that DAC technology can be scaled up to remove up to 1 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> per year from the atmosphere in Canada (Jackson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR210">2020</xref>). In addition to recent developments mentioned above, Climeworks, one of the CSS companies, expands its direct air capture and storage technology, making a permanent CO<sub>2</sub> removal solution more readily available. It includes the infrastructure and foundation of the next generation of Climeworks CO<sub>2</sub> collectors. Their solution includes the installation of plants and machinery in Iceland and is expected to be completed in spring 2021. What makes Climeworks’ use of DAC so intriguing is that it can capture pollutants straight from the air, rather than merely eliminating emissions connected with electricity generation, and also this is the company’s largest facility to date, with a CO<sub>2</sub> collection capacity of about 4000 tonnes per year (Jackson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR210">2020</xref>). As a result, CCS technology will gain even more importance and develop in the coming years. CCS seems like a viable solution to address the climate change problem.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Cellular Agriculture</title><p id="Par194">Throughout the years of extortion of natural resources, possible new solutions to neutralise the effects started to emerge. First, a decrease in consumption was suggested. Other suggestions included using less water to preserve the resources, less plastic and more biodegradable resources to prevent pollution and so on. Among many topics, the consumption of meat has always been on the agenda. Setting aside the ethical arguments, meat consumption is not sustainable in many ways and causes substantial global warming. At this point, cellular agriculture steps forth as a remedy. This technology focuses on the production of an animal product-like substance that does not harm the environment in the process of production or consumption. This substance is produced from cell structures rather than animals. Using advanced biotechnology, tissue-based products like meat (of fish, cattle, sheep, goats, chicken, turkey, etc.) and protein-containing foods like eggs and dairy products become available alternatives. Focusing on both sustainable food production and the safety of food, cellular agriculture uses many techniques to imitate and meet the standards of nutritional values while being almost carbon neutral.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par195"><italic>Cell Cultivation</italic></p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par196">Cell culture takes cells from a plant or animal and grows them in a controlled environment. The cells can be extracted directly from the tissue and crushed enzymatically or mechanically before being cultured, or they can be replicated from a cell line or cell strain. The primary culture phase begins after the cells have been separated from the tissue and multiplied under optimal circumstances until all substrates have been occupied. To provide more vacancies for growth, the cells must be subcultured by transferring them to a new case containing fresh growth. The primary culture is referred to as a cell line or subcloned after the first subculture. Cell lines are reproduced from primary cultures which have a limited lifetime, and when they are crossed, cells with the highest growth capacity dominate. As a result, genotype and phenotype will be uniform (Invitrogen and Gibco <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR205">2021</xref>). This cell line becomes a cell strain when a subclone’s subpopulation is positively selected from the culture through cloning. Following the commencement of the parent line, a cell strain frequently acquires further genetic changes. Culture conditions are variable for each cell type, but the environment generally contains essential nutrients, hormones, enzymes and gases that are necessary for substrate (Invitrogen and Gibco <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR205">2021</xref>).

The current system can produce animal meat that is enough to cover the existing consumption rate, but it will be unable to do so in the future due to factors such as increasing population. Experts estimate that the human population will be 9–11 billion in 2050 (UN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR532">2017</xref>). Increasing population means increasing food needs. Thus it seems that animals alone will not be enough for humans. Rather than encouraging consumers to choose plant-based diets more, the other ideal solution is the innovative improvements in meat production, which stands out as the task of cellular agriculture. There are three main benefits of cellular agriculture: benefits for the environment, benefits for the animals and benefits for human health. Figure <xref rid="Fig32" ref-type="fig">2.32</xref> demonstrates some benefits of cellular agriculture.<fig id="Fig32"><label>Fig. 2.32</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Benefits of cellular agriculture</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/532255_1_En_2_Fig32_HTML.png" id="MO32"><caption><p id="Par692">An illustration of an inverted prism.

It is astounding how much water, land and power livestock use. Khan states that in addition to the 1.6 kg of feed necessary to make a 0.23-kilogram steak, the manufacturing process necessitates 3515 litres of water and just as much energy is needed to charge a laptop as much as 60 times. Moreover, different greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere containing a total of 4.54 kg of CO<sub>2</sub>, which is equal to 2 litres of gasoline. This data represents what is needed to make an 8-ounce steak and not the entire animal. Roughly 25% of the surface of the world is dedicated to livestock. This is approximately 70% of all agricultural land (Khan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR236">2017</xref>). Furthermore, animals consume around 30% of the world’s freshwater. Livestock account for 14.5% of all emissions of greenhouse gases. Cellular agriculture promises to minimise global greenhouse gas emissions and to encourage more ethical usages of natural resources. Cellular farming is an eco-friendly and sustainable option in comparison with animal production. Fleece made from cellular farming requires less than 1/10 of the land and water (Khan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR236">2017</xref>). The greenhouse gas emissions in this beef will also be considerably reduced. The number of animals required in the production process is reduced due to cellular agriculture, eliminating livestock. With the increasing population, the demand for meat is increasing even more. On the other hand, meat production facilities quickly raise animals under unsanitary conditions to produce more meat without due concern given to animal welfare (Khan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR236">2017</xref>). Cellular agriculture is among the most effective solutions to fulfil the increasing meat demand while ensuring animal welfare. About 80% of all antibiotics sold in the USA are used in animal agriculture. This situation increases antibiotic resistance in humans and causes various health problems. For instance, most bacterial contaminants, <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>, that cause food-borne diseases commonly interact with contaminated animal excrement (Röös et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR384">2017</xref>). Bacterial contaminants like <italic>Salmonella</italic> or <italic>E. coli</italic> will not be the case in cellular agriculture since no livestock will contaminate the meat or other goods.</p><p id="Par207">Meat production has long been the subject of controversy. Animal rights activists think that obtaining meat from animals is a massacre, and they look for other ways to meet their protein needs without eating meat. For example, they turn to a vegan and vegetarian lifestyle. However, cultured meat, the most popular topic of cellular farming, could change this. Cultured meat comes as an alternative for its ecological and animal welfare benefits and to feed humanity’s growing population. Besides all the environmental benefits, cultured meat is also healthier than normal meat because it is produced under laboratory conditions in a controlled manner. Cultured meat does not contain bacteria and other disease-causing agents. While plastics/microplastics are seen in normal meats, they are not seen in cultured meats (Gasteratos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par208">Humanity continues its search for life on another planet. People have long kept their eyes on the Moon and Mars. The long-term missions have been targeted, and there is a basic problem in meeting the protein needs of astronauts. Experts have invested in cultured meat for a long time to solve this problem. If colonies are established on the Moon and Mars in the possible future, keeping human beings alive is planned by using cultured meat. Israel-based company Aleph Farms aims to accelerate cell-based meat production in space. Aleph Farms says that “We want to make sure that when people live on Mars, we’ll be there too” (Morrison <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR315">2020</xref>).

Moreover, it is an easy way to share the folders with other people and work by collaborating with them via the Internet from the personal computer or network servers. This sharing can be private or public. Cloud computing technology generally includes many clouds, and these clouds communicate with each other through application programming interfaces and using web services (Mirashe and Kalyankar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR307">2010</xref>). Cloud computing is quite popular among researchers, citizens and governments nowadays. One of the reasons for this is that when the memory of personal computers is full, it indirectly inhibits speed and performance. To prevent this, a personal account is created by transferring personal data to computers with a lot of memory via the Internet. Thus, both storage space and computer resources can be acquired without sacrificing the personal computer’s memory. Since the main consideration behind cloud computing is to minimise the burden on the terminals of the user, cloud storage, as one of the subdisciplines of cloud computing, comes forwards in line with this purpose. Cloud storage services can provide both data storage and business access. It consists of necessary storage devices, and it huddles all of them together in the application software for usage. As a result, it can be thought of as one of the cloud computing systems responsible for large capacity storage (Liu and Dong <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR270">2012</xref>). Many companies, such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Rackspace and GoGrid, provide particular cloud computing services (Chopra <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2017</xref>). Anyone can benefit from these services for a monthly subscription fee. In other words, this service can be thought of as renting a computer with very high memory and performance far away from the users themselves. It is especially useful because it does not require physical hardware to perform computation or storage. Since the data is stored and the other resources are available on the Internet, the data is always accessible anywhere and anytime as long as there is an Internet connection (Huth and Cebula <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR195">2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec><p id="Par211">Although cloud computing provides ease of use to users, it is a modular technology with a very different operating system.

Crowdfunding is the collaborative method to raise cash through friends, families, consumers and individual investors. This method uses people’s collaborative efforts – mostly online through social and crowdfunding media – to leverage their networks to reach them more widely. It is initiated by developing the accurate product to be funded and providing a solid history of its development, producing a unique video for a crowdfunding platform and establishing a monetary objective.

In this type, businesses are allowed to set investment ceilings, minimum pledge amounts, etc. and accept or reject investors interested in viewing their business paperwork. Second, reward-based crowdfunding is the most popular and useful kind of crowdfunding. This form of crowdsourcing requires the determination of several levels of awards that match the commitments. Third, peer-to-peer lending-based crowdfunding allows businesses to collect cash in the form of loans to repay lenders on a predefined schedule with a specified rate of interest. With crowdsourcing donations, campaigns accumulate donations without providing value in return. This kind of marketing is great for social reasons and charity. Lastly, donation-based crowdfunding is to raise money from other individuals for charitable causes. Campaigns are often 1–3 months in length and work well for amounts under $10,000 (Hossain and Oparaocha <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR190">2017</xref>).

A large group of backers invest in the company knowing the purpose of the loan and interest rate. A higher interest rate is received than the market rate by lenders (Chen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2021</xref>). Companies choose to crowdfund when the other debt instruments are too costly or cannot get credit from financial institutions because of credit default swaps. Equity and debt investments’ funding are risky investments, but the investor can diversify their capital in a wide range of ways. Individuals can directly support the companies they feel connected to by crowdfunding investment infrastructure (Chen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2021</xref>). In the path of developing a project or launching a business, having access to capital is crucial even if the project has nothing to do with R&amp;D. In emerging technologies<index-term id="ITerm25"><term>Emerging technologies</term></index-term>’ case, with the additional necessity to be possessed of enough material to research and develop truly, crowdfunding becomes even more than a way out. Funding by investors and VCs is not an easy method, especially when the project is not financially beneficial right away. Crowdfunding is a functional solution to this very problem. Surely, this does not mean crowdfunding does not have its criteria or standards to evaluate within but means that its broad spectrum of funders enlarges the criteria extent.

The World Bank report predicts worldwide crowdfunding investments to reach 93 billion dollars by 2025 (Fridman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">2016</xref>). Although the first crowdfunding portal, ArtistShare, launched in 2000, it is expected that there will be a return to specialised platforms in future years (Fridman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">2016</xref>). With so many crowdfunding choices, platforms will see value in narrowing their emphasis and attracting a specialised audience. Niches such as gaming, education, music, charities, researchers and local initiatives are creating their platforms to better serve supporters and make themselves noticeable. Rewards-based platforms such as Indiegogo and Kickstarter have garnered a lot of attention in the USA. Equity crowdfunding was the next great wave that began in 2016. Titles III and IV of the JOBS Act have made it feasible for unaccredited (i.e. not wealthy) investors to readily purchase ownership shares in new firms they care about (Fridman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">2016</xref>). Investing in a start-up’s shares was once restricted to rich people. Because of the new rules, businesses are trying to attract investors as well as people who wish to back a company’s concept or a goal. Crowdfunding provides firms with a different option for obtaining cash than venture capital or angel investors. The new investment class, a bigger group, made up of Middle Americans, will be the driving force behind investing and hence decision-making (Fridman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Cybersecurity</title><p id="Par235">Humankind has been faced with crimes since its existence. The phenomenon of crime, which has developed and changed over the years, has been defined and posted in tonnes of different ways. When it is asked, most people define crime as acts that break the law. The Declaration of Human Rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR469">1948</xref>, art.3) states that “Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person”. Therefore, in international laws, people have the right to defend their security. The twenty-first century has brought an era with the digitalisation trend to the new danger that humankind requires to defend themselves against. This new threat, which is encountered in all areas of life and whose importance increases day by day, is cybercrime. Various governments and companies are taking many measures to prevent these cybercrimes. Aside from the variety of measures, cybersecurity is still a huge concern for many. Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks and programs from digital attacks. Cyber resilience, on the other hand, is the measure of an individual’s or enterprise’s ability to continue working as normal while it attempts to identify, protect, detect, respond and recover from threats against its data and information technology infrastructure.</p><p id="Par236">This section mainly focuses on the challenges faced by cybersecurity on the latest technologies. It also focuses on the latest developments in cybersecurity techniques, ethics and the future of cybersecurity. For clarity, the cybersecurity concept will be examined in subsets. These subsets include types of attacks, types of cybersecurity threats and sectoral risk management. These will be examined as defence mechanisms against these cybercrime types that endanger individuals and organisations. Nowadays, with the increasing impact of technology in people’s lives, the security of information is exceedingly important. Cybersecurity plays an important role in the field of information technology. Information security has become one of the biggest challenges of our time. That is why one of the most valuable things is knowledge of cybersecurity. With the increasing use of technology, a large amount of digital information emerges individually and institutionally. The protection of digital information requires just as much importance. Multiple cyber methods compromise digital information. In the continuation of the chapter, these vulnerabilities and methods that endanger cybersecurity will be examined, and which systems are at risk and what this developing technology promises will be mentioned. Cyberspace can be defined as a worldwide territory in the data ecosystem, the interconnected IT infrastructures including the Internet, telecommunication systems, computer networks and embedded processors and controllers (Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par237">It is seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig40" ref-type="fig">2.40</xref>; various motivations lead the attackers, from personal gain to drawing attention to social problems. To receive social admiration, cybercrimes might cause many problems by taking large masses behind them. There are many attacks and types of attacks in cyberspace that will require cybersecurity experts to protect their computers. The most known attack types are backdoor, phishing, social engineering and malware.<fig id="Fig40"><label>Fig. 2.40</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Attackers’ motivation</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/532255_1_En_2_Fig40_HTML.png" id="MO40"><caption><p id="Par700">An illustration comprises 2 boxes under the heading motivates.

Backdoor attacks are a form of adversarial attacks on deep networks. The attacker provides poisoned data to the victim to train the model and then activates the attack by showing a specific small trigger pattern at the test time. Most state-of-the-art backdoor attacks either provide mislabelled poisoning data that is possible to identify by visual inspection, reveal the trigger in the poisoned data or use noise to hide the trigger (Saha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR393">2020</xref>).

Victims get a harmful email or text message that is like a workman, a bank or a government agency, imitating a person or institution they trust. If the user clicks the bait, a legally valid website counterfeit will be provided. Suppose people enter their username and password to log in. In that case, the attacker who uses it to steal identity sees this information and can thus trade their bank balances and black-market personal information. At this point, different methods are recommended to users and service providers to protect themselves from phishing attacks. The NCSC (National Cybersecurity Center) recommends an innovative layered method called the 4-layer approach for large institutions and cybersecurity professionals (“Small Business Guide” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR435">2018</xref>; “Phishing attacks” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR357">2018</xref>). According to the research, financial institutions are the target of phishing attacks, as seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig41" ref-type="fig">2.41</xref>, in the first quarter of 2021, followed by social media and SaaS/webmail. Due to increased digital banking transactions during the pandemic period, business e-mail compromise (BEC) is even more costly (APWG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2021</xref>).<fig id="Fig41"><label>Fig. 2.41</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Most targeted industries</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/532255_1_En_2_Fig41_HTML.png" id="MO41"><caption><p id="Par701">A pie chart of most targeted industries.

As it is colloquially known, social engineering hacks human behaviour and influences the modelling of societies in a devious way. Social media has produced a culture where sharing everything about everyone is normal and even encouraged by some (Hadnagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178">2018</xref>). If it is said that cyber thieves hack people’s systems using malware and viruses, social engineering is just the same by doing it with people’s thoughts. On the other hand, social engineering could be done with information shared online by users themselves. As the Cambridge Analytica case has demonstrated that standard privacy laws may not be enough to safeguard customer data, another branch of the privacy protection debate may be worth investigating (Sun <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR445">2020</xref>). Victims who solved the quizzes gave their personal data and information to the harmful social engineering companies. Emotions that can be utilised are love (in its various forms), hate or anger (us versus them), pride (in themselves or their organisation) and futility (in themselves or their organisation) (there is no other option). Picking the correct emotion is simpler in person because we can read body language or via phone to assess the tone of voice and alter the approach based on the scenario. This approach aims to influence the target’s emotions so that they overcome their natural cognitive replies (Winterfeld and Andress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR497">2013</xref>).

Malware has become a significant tool for unlawful economic activity, and its developers go to great lengths to avoid detection by anti-malware programs (Rieck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR381">2008</xref>). Malicious software (malware), hostile, intruder and purposely bland seeks the use of computers, computer networks, tabling and mobile devices to enter, harm or disable, frequently gaining partial control of activities of a device. It interrupts regular operations, like copying, encrypting, destroying or modifying essential computer functions without knowledge or permission and monitors computer activities. Commonly encountered types of malware are viruses, keyloggers, worms/trojans and ransomware. This type of malware is placed on your devices by attackers to threaten users. Except for the ransomware attacks, most types of cyberattacks aim to convey data/information to the attackers, but the ransomware attacks are more complicated. The attacker encrypts the data with his attack and demands a ransom from the victim. In such cases, the crucial point is that when the attacker gets what he wants, he can access and damage the information in the system again since he has encrypted software in the system. This type of malware is placed on your devices by attackers to threaten users by spying on users’ personal data. Spyware, malicious software, regularly collects data from targeted victims’ devices. Spyware, <italic>Pegasus</italic>, caused a major international scandal. As data from Forbidden Stories collaboration with Amnesty Security Laboratory states, approximately 180 journalists were affected by this spyware (Rueckert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR386">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par248">Unlike companies, individual users could lose their data in unfortunate situations because of cybercriminals. On the other hand, this threat can cost the data of numerous users. Therefore, companies may lose their reputation and reliability. Companies should care about cybersecurity as a corporate culture to prevent these threats and attacks from outside. Creating a cybersecurity culture requires altering how everyone works, how leadership is involved, how processes are implemented and how challenges are addressed. At the core of a culture of cybersecurity, each employee can carry out their daily tasks in the most secure way imaginable. To create this culture, companies need to take some external and internal actions. There are some influencing factors such as external regulations, national and social cybersecurity culture. Another factor affecting this culture in the company are activities such as managerial communication plans, training and performance measurements. In this way, values and beliefs will change in terms of both the individual and the group, and a cultural environment on cybersecurity will be created. As these beliefs become established, new behaviours will emerge that are both work-related and company-related.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par249"><italic>Systems at Risk</italic></p></list-item></list><list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par250"><italic>Utilities and Industrial Equipment</italic></p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par251">Computerised systems provide many services such as opening-closing valves in electricity networks, nuclear power plants, water, gas and treatment plants.

Great damage can be done by individuals and nations. National goals in cyberattacks might include harvesting information, reducing the target nation’s war-making capabilities, threatening other nations by showing their capability making the target nation feel weak and demoralised and/or creating a national distraction in the target nation.

Although it is a technology, this is an approach to arbitrate more effectively, share, connect and/or determine where, when and for whom target data should be sustained.

For example, any change made by anyone to their credentials takes place within this data hub, and all subscription applications can continue to use the connection. The data hub simplifies data governance requirements by keeping data in a central location.

This is a paradigm change from data warehousing systems where data custodians made all decisions about which data was made available to consumers. These benefit both parties in this equation: Data custodians may focus their resources on what is recognised as having the most demand/need while collecting input on datasets’ quality and usefulness. Data consumers can thus obtain more data and spend less time negotiating access to datasets maintained within organisations. With these aims in mind, a data hub is for people as much as it is for data (Delaney and Pettit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par290">Master data management (MDM) focuses on mastering collections of business data based on programmed (hard-coded) rules to enforce pre-set rules and synchronise (bi-directional) operational systems on one set of “golden rules” thanks to its well-documented definition and purpose. This was a much-needed guideline for data management and governance activities. Many businesses, however, have failed to implement MDM initiatives due to their complexity and cost, as well as the hazardous and ambitious nature of attaining the objective of having a single, agreed-upon set of data semantics provided across the organisation (Semarchy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR411">2021</xref>). It is quite difficult to form a clear idea with the available data from organisations running multiple and independent systems (Precisely Editor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR361">2021</xref>). Simultaneously, data analytics require mastered data and lineage to establish a data hub with accurate data attributions. As a result, analytics-driven companies began to migrate away from operational system connections and towards smaller, localised data hubs with agreed-upon analytics and application semantics. This is not to suggest that MDM is no longer necessary; rather, it demonstrates how businesses understood they needed to be more capable, flexible and nimble. It is noted in this context that there are a variety of scenarios linked to the utilisation of data hubs (Semarchy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR411">2021</xref>). Data hubs have been developed as a solution in the presence of complex and constantly updated data sources, in cases where they actively benefit from the data at hand, when real-time and operational data are desired to be used in contrast to past snapshots within the enterprise, and a reliable integration system is needed (Marklogic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR292">2021</xref>).

Considering the future of data hubs, one of the most important issues in business life, “marketing”, cannot be overlooked. Data hubs are the next step in the marketing stacks’ development, and they’re likely to become more popular in the future. The hub idea is essential because it can assist intelligently in organising campaigns across the digital and physical domains and because a data hub serves as an information aggregator rather than another marketing solution. The main distinction between a data hub and a marketing stack is that data hubs are completely back-end solutions that allow for cross-channel insights without being limited to a certain set of solutions. As a result, it is predicted that data hub utilisation would increase over time. More data involvement every day in marketing, such as cross-channel editing and real-time personalisation, may provide significant long-term effects. The data hub is a central location where consistent, tailored messages may be provided through a single interface via email, online domains, display advertisements and mobile applications and then tracked as part of the decision-making process.

The monitoring process takes place by using both miniature devices and remote sensing that produce ever-growing data streams (Pylianidis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR367">2021</xref>). The main goal of the digital twin is to create highly accurate virtual models of every physical entity of the original model to mimic their states and behaviours for further optimisation, evaluation and prediction (Semeraro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR412">2021</xref>). Before the industrial revolution, artisans primarily made physical artefacts, resulting in one-of-a-kind examples of a given template. However, when the notion of interchangeable components was introduced in the eighteenth century, the way things were designed and made changed dramatically as firms mass-produced products’ replicas. The mass customisation paradigm has recently emerged, which attempts to combine these two well-established manufacturing techniques to attain low unit costs for personalised items. Even though such paradigms of manufacturing allow for the mass production of vast amounts of comparable, i.e. tailored components or products, the created instances are not duplicates that are related. On the other hand, building a twin is creating a duplicate of a component or a product and using the duplicate to consider various other conditions of the same component or product, therefore building a relationship between various copies. This concept is believed to have come from NASA’s Apollo program, when “at least two identical space vehicles were created to allow mirroring of the space vehicle’s circumstances during the trip” (Rosen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR385">2015</xref>). While the terminology has evolved since its beginning in 2002, the underlying principle of the digital twin model has stayed relatively constant. It is mainly linked to the idea that the creation of a digital informational construct of a physical system can be independent of that particular physical system. This digital information then could be a “twin” of the information that belongs to the initial physical system and would be connected to the original system itself during the system’s lifespan. The basic working principle of digital twin technology is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig46" ref-type="fig">2.46</xref>.<fig id="Fig46"><label>Fig. 2.46</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Basic working principle of a digital twin</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/532255_1_En_2_Fig46_HTML.png" id="MO46"><caption><p id="Par706">An illustration of the digital twin mechanism.

The presentation’s slide in which the digital twin was introduced, shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig47" ref-type="fig">2.47</xref>, was called “Conceptual Ideal for PLM”. The slide included all the components of the digital twin, such as real space, virtual space, the link for information flow from virtual space, the link for data flow from real space to virtual space and virtual sub-spaces. The model’s proposition was composed of two different systems. The first system was about the physical system that has always existed. The second one was a new virtual system that held all the information and conditions about the physical system. This meant that the real spaces were mirrored to its virtual space model or vice versa. The term PLM, or product life cycle management, indicated that it was not a static representation but rather the two systems would be linked over the system’s lifespan. As the system moves through the four phases of creation, production, operation and disposal, the virtual and the real systems are linked together to create a more efficient way of working (Grieves and Vickers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">2017</xref>).<fig id="Fig47"><label>Fig. 2.47</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Conceptual ideal for PLM.

The advancement of “microchip, sensor and IT technologies” cleared the path for the creation of smart products that track and transmit their operational conditions, allowing them to contribute data regarding their status into their product models. Advanced sensing procedures, which go beyond mathematics and scanning, enable the collection of huge quantities of data from physical objects in a simple, fast and reliable manner. The significant advancements in simulation technology, along with the expanding capabilities for obtaining and transmitting data from goods, allowed virtual twins of actual products to be created.

The components that are mentioned are the initial stage in enabling a digital twin to monitor, analyse and evaluate agricultural systems while also providing a continuous stream of operations. A more complex version of a digital twin could include actuator parts to control fans and windows in a greenhouse. If needed, the monitoring and control operations would be performed constantly and can report relevant information to different stakeholders. The more improved digital twin model needs simulation components to decide based on past and future predicted conditions of the physical twin (Pylianidis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR367">2021</xref>). It may utilise considerably less expensive resources in designing, producing and running systems because information replaces wasted physical resources. It can better comprehend systems’ emergent forms and behaviours by modelling and simulating them in virtual space, reducing the accidental errors mainly made by humans (Grieves and Vickers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">2017</xref>). Future advancements could be expected since computer technologies show no signs of slowing down. Finally, because the digital twin reflects the physical system, we may be able to use the virtual system while the actual system is in use.

However, well-known Russian professor Andrew S. Tanenbaum defines this system as a set of <italic>independent computers</italic>, which presents the users of the system as a <italic>single</italic> united system. The independent computers by themselves cannot be a single united system. This is possible only if the special programs are used, which is the <italic>middleware</italic> (Косяков <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR243">2014</xref>). Thus, there is one single system to which connected nodes and all of them together solve a problem. To understand distributed systems and distributed computing, examples of application areas can be seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig49" ref-type="fig">2.49</xref>.<fig id="Fig49"><label>Fig. 2.49</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Examples of distributed computing’s application areas.

The location of the processors relative to each other indicates the communication network; consequently, interprocessor communication’s speed and reliability can be roughly defined considering the communication network. Components of the closely coupled network are spatially close to each other, and generally, communication is said to be fast and reliable. On the other hand, a system consisting of physically distant components is called a loosely coupled network where generally reliability and the speed of the communication are less than that of a closely coupled network (Bal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1989</xref>).</p><p id="Par320">Also, according to Gibb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">2019</xref>), distributed computing systems have three characteristic features, the first one works on all parts in the system simultaneously, the second the clock concept is not global and the last one does not affect the other parts in the system when one part fails. The main connecting link of distributed computing systems is software. A distributed computing system is a software and hardware system dedicated to solving a certain problem. On the one hand, each computing node is a self-contained unit. The software component of the DCS, on the other hand, should give users visibility into working with a unified computing system.

Because of the abundance of information, the run time of the simulations and the required memory scale-up, we will eventually require computers with high performance and many computation resources to use time efficiently. Therefore, distributed computing has become a trend for high-performance computation for complex applications (Lim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR267">2011</xref>). The fact that the organisations that use the programs are scattered is one of the main reasons why distributed programs are useful. A company, for example, is divided into multiple divisions. Each division has its own set of tasks and uses internal data to carry out operations. However, so the divisions supply services to one another, there must be some communication between them. Physically tight divisions or geographically distant divisions are also possible (Liskov <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR268">1979</xref>). In addition, distributed computing and distributed systems offer many other advantages and useful features for the users. Some of which are listed (Kshemkalyani and Singhal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR245">2007</xref>) as follows:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par331"><italic>Enhanced reliability:</italic> Reliability can be said to be one of the critical features of the distributed system.

For example, payroll data of a worldwide company is kept in a common single server accessible by all its branches remotely because of the unsuitability of this data to be copied in each branch of this company. Furthermore, the data kept in the supercomputers is accessible remotely, although supercomputers are in certain locations.

However, there is no longer any need to share a single, costly resource. Processors and memory have become much more affordable thanks to advancements in hardware technology (Liskov <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR268">1979</xref>). With the rapid development of microprocessors, distributed computing systems have become economically attractive for many computer applications. The calculation is the most important thing in computer science. After this technology, there will be some contribution to other emerging technology<index-term id="ITerm33"><term>Emerging technologies</term></index-term> areas. For example, datasets grow day by day in every field, requiring more parallelism. So, machine learning algorithms will need more performance and drive skills. Deep learning models are among the highest computational applications available today, and they frequently work with large datasets or search multiple purpose spaces. The demand for more cost-effective, energy-efficient and proficient computing devices and systems will expand throughout science, engineering, business, government and entertainment, driven by society’s achievable ideas of understanding extremely sophisticated phenomena in natural and human-constructed structures (Stoller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR443">2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Drones</title><p id="Par337">The advancement of technological developments and the emergence of different requirements in various areas of life have caused drones to start to be mentioned more often. They are one of the most emerging technologies<index-term id="ITerm34"><term>Emerging technologies</term></index-term> in the last years, actively used in many different areas including military, delivery, agriculture, etc. As a technological term, unmanned aircraft or unmanned aerial systems are called drones, which can be defined as remotely controlled or autonomous flying robots. A more detailed definition from Valavanis and Vachtsevanos is that drones are unmanned aerial vehicles or flying machines that do not have a human pilot or passengers on board (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR475">2015</xref>). Drones, which were first utilised in the military in the nineteenth century, have since become more widespread in all parts of daily life (Dalamagkidis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2012</xref>). Drones are most significantly related to the military, although they are also utilised for rescue operations, surveillance, route planning and weather forecasting (Udeanu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR467">2016</xref>). Drones come in a variety of types due to their wide range of applications. The technical characteristics of drones should be discussed to have a better understanding of them. Vergouw et al. state that drones can be categorised according to their kind, fixed-wing or multirotor, autonomy, weight and shape and energy source. These dimensions are significant for the drone’s cruise range, maximum flying time and payload capacity, among other factors. As stated previously, drones are an important technical feature of drones. Two of the most common drone types are “fixed-wing drones” and “rotary-wing drones”. The vast majority of current drones belong to one of these two categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR482">2016</xref>). These two broad drone categories have their own set of positive and negative attributes. Fixed-wing drones, to give an example, have a higher maximum speed and a greater capacity, but they ought to sustain constant forwards mobility to stay above, making them unsuitable for applications that require stability, such as close inspection. On the other hand, rotary-wing drones can travel freely and stay fixed in the air, despite their mobility and payload limitations (Zeng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR516">2016</xref>). Hybrid drones are outside of these two categories. Hybrid drones are expected to become more common in the future as manufacturing and design improvements and expenses descend (Saeed et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR391">2018</xref>). Figure <xref rid="Fig51" ref-type="fig">2.51</xref> demonstrates the abovementioned characteristics of drones in better detail.<fig id="Fig51"><label>Fig. 2.51</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Technical characteristics of drones.

Drone technology is on the rise because it has the potential to disrupt large industries. According to Giones and Brem, drones are anticipated to become as normal as smartphones are now. They have autonomous functionalities due to advances in artificial intelligence, image processing and robotics, which have increased their revolutionary potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">2017</xref>). Another reason drones, whose capabilities have increased in parallel with technology advancements, are significant is that they may be used to tackle global issues. According to Kitonsa and Kruglikov, drones may be a big force for good since they have an immense opportunity for being utilised to achieve the sustainable development goals (SDGs)<index-term id="ITerm35"><term>Sustainable development goals (SDGs)</term></index-term> of the United Nations. Hunger, diseases, poverty and other issues plague developing countries; drone technology is important since it can help solve many of these issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR242">2018</xref>). The role of drones in resolving these issues is discussed in further detail in Fig. <xref rid="Fig52" ref-type="fig">2.52</xref> with application areas.<fig id="Fig52"><label>Fig. 2.52</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Applications of drone technology</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/532255_1_En_2_Fig52_HTML.png" id="MO52"><caption><p id="Par712">An illustration of application areas of drones.

Drones can be associated generally with applications of defence. They can also greatly impact civilian duties such as agriculture, transportation, protection of the environment, communication and disaster affect minimisation (Floreano and Wood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">2015</xref>). Drones can make a difference in distorted areas for light package supplies transportation which can be more important after a disaster occurs (United Nations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR468">2021</xref>). A new vision with a wide range and perspective, locations that are hard to reach, static images, video records and detection of objects will come in with drone technology developments. Drone-based datasets will be used in different fields, such as visions of computers and related areas of them (Zhu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR519">2018</xref>). Also, passive or active sensors will become more important in drone development, and they will be designed specifically. 3D modelling for landscapes will be easier with drone technology development. Drones will displace the kites, balloons and blimps, helicity, which are used for inexpensive low-level aerial photography. Increasing drone instrumentation, such as GPS, can have effects on cost, payload, range of flight and drone structure, and lower-cost platforms should be improved; drones can be more automated (Campana <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2017</xref>). Additionally, in our day, drones are used in a large scale of civilian activities, such as photographing intense moments in extreme sports, construction surveillance, racing and agriculture, and their use is expected to expand in the upcoming years. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the USA estimates that the registered drone numbers in its database will reach 3.8 million by 2022 (Tezza and Andujar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR536">2019</xref>).<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par340"><italic>Military</italic></p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par341">Drones have a vital role in the military sector, which is where they were first utilised. Military forces use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), known as drones, to attack high-value stationary targets. Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) can have explosives and supplies for forces on the ground, for example, heavy weapons or more ammunition, but also provide real-time video monitoring capabilities. Ground forces’ combat power is increased by minimising their physical load (Fernández Gil-Delgado <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">2021</xref>). According to Pobkrut et al. a “survey drone” is a kind of drone designed for military purposes that use sensors such as an infrared camera and a motion detector to detect threatening targets. This means the drone is expected to possess the ability to visually detect the objectives. It is extremely difficult for a visual survey drone to detect hidden or invisible targets, so installing a system that imitates a nose to a fixed-wing drone to sense and categorise chemical volatiles or odours is a very useful method for locating hidden targets containing threats such as bombs and chemical weapons. The rationale of this method is that usually, the explosive parts of mass destruction weapons leak some gases that can be identified. Such technology will increase the survey drone’s productivity and considerably benefit security services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR359">2016</xref>).<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par342"><italic>Scientific Research</italic></p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par343">Drone research was started for the military, and after that, it has developed in different fields of science. As electronic technology has become smaller and cheaper, camera and sensor costs have fallen, and the battery power has increased. Previously, scientists could only examine the globe from above using manned planes or satellites; nowadays, they can expand, enhance and refine their studies thanks to drones. Drones are also used to monitor rivers to predict floods. They can locate places in which trees are illegally cut down. They can detect the growth of algae as well as the trespassing of saltwater into water bodies. Plant species are determined, and diseases in forest trees are detected. In the field of energy, drones are used to detect methane leaks in the production process of oil and gas and to monitor the effect of pipes and solar and wind installations (Cho <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2021</xref>).<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par344"><italic>Security</italic></p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par345">Drones are quite popular for delivery services. UAVs which are used to transport packages, food, medical equipment and other commodities are known as “delivery drones”. To accomplish a delivery, a drone has to specify the personal information of the customer and any data exchanged between the drone and the customer’s site, such as a landing area, needs to be shielded from eavesdropping and drone capture. Available operating systems of drones, on the other hand, lack security support and depend solely on security measures at the link level (e.g. Wi-Fi protected access). As a result, they are subject to common malicious attacks such as impersonation, manipulation, interception and hacking. Drones are also vulnerable to physical capture attacks because they are mobile and may pass through hazardous places. Outside landing locations that are not protected are especially vulnerable to physical capture by attackers. The security-related concerns for delivery services, such as authentication, non-repudiation and secrecy, must be addressed. Security measures to combat physical capture assaults are also necessary for delivery drones or outdoor landing places. A flexible system design is necessary to meet these security concerns for a broad range of parties and applications (Seo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR413">2016</xref>).<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par346"><italic>Entertainment</italic></p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par347">In the entertainment industry, drones are frequently used.

Farmers may use drones to examine farm conditions at the beginning of any crop year. They also create 3D maps for soil testing. Drone-based soil and field studies also offer irrigation and nitrogen management data in fields for improved crop development (Puri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR365">2017</xref>). Drones in agriculture and smart farming are more effective than satellite technology since they can provide farmers with an overview of their fields while keeping close to the land and therefore delivering more exact evaluations (Tripicchio et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR462">2015</xref>).<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par350"><italic>Medicine</italic></p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par351">Medicine is another field where drones are actively used and where their application is becoming increasingly prevalent.

Computational services and needs are satisfied better when using edge computing. Edge computing services allow the collection of data or perform a specific action in real time. Edge computing can be considered an alternative approach to the cloud environment, as real-time data processing takes place near the data source, which is considered the “edge” of the network. This is because applications that run with edge computing physically run on the site where the data was generated, rather than in the central cloud system or storage centre (Jevtic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR214">2019</xref>). Until the development of edge computing, there were four waves in the history of computing, including edge computing: monolithic systems, the technology of the web, cloud computing and edge computing (Mannanuddin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR288">2020</xref>).

In brief, it is the storage where one’s database is in. So, the idea of edge computing is to push the cloud services closer to the edge of the network. It gathers the data from the beginning, and the data processes at the very machines that gathered the data from the beginning. Thus, edge computing can be called a decentralised cloud. Also, edge computing is remarkably close to IoT technologies too. At this point, as IoT technologies gather the data, edge computing is the right service for it.</p><p id="Par358">Cloud computing’s centralised processing mode is insufficient to manage the data generated by the edge. The centralised processing paradigm transfers all data across the network to the cloud data centre, which then uses its supercomputing capability to solve computing and storage issues, allowing cloud services to generate economic benefits.

In edge computing, the data that comes from cloud servers is transmitted directly to a network edge. This brings users and services together. If the performance features of edge computing are considered, it can be seen that bandwidth is high, latency is extra-low and real-time access in the network is faster. As a result, it reduces the load of the cloud and offers low-latency processes. Cloud technology has a centralised structure, while edge computing has distributed servers and has a decentralised system (Khan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR237">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par365">There are two kinds of edge computing: edge server, which is a piece of IT equipment. The other one is edge devices, and this is a piece of equipment that was built for some purposes. For example, suppose a vehicle automatically calculates fuel consumption. In that case, sensors based on data received directly from the sensors, the computer performing that action is called an edge computing device or simply “edge device” (El-Sayed et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2017</xref>). Nowadays, all modern electronic devices can compute. Thus, this means that people can work everywhere, even where they did not consider before. To sum up, edge computing allows reaching the devices that we want and doing our job. So, these emerging or modern technologies are pieces of IT equipment, and they have servers. Figure <xref rid="Fig56" ref-type="fig">2.56</xref> summarises the components of edge computing.<fig id="Fig56"><label>Fig. 2.56</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Infographic of edge computing.

This method lowers network latency and gathers computing power to process data close to its base. Mobile applications could leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques more effectively over the edge network since they are currently fully reliant on the computing capacity of mobile processors (Стельмах <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2020</xref>). Edge computing is everywhere as we need vehicles, houses, planes, buildings, etc. Low latency, high bandwidth, device processing, data offload and trustworthy computing and storage are the major advantages of edge technologies (Ekudden <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2021</xref>). Edge computing offers some advantages to its users. The following are the advantages of edge computing listed by Mannanuddin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR288">2020</xref>):<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par368"><italic>Increasing the work performance:</italic> One of the biggest advantages of this technology is that it has a fast response time and minimum delay because it is closer to the end-user than cloud technology.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par369"><italic>No limit for the dimension of expansion:</italic> Again, due to its proximity to the end-user and real-time analysis, it does not need any memory limit and is always open to expansion.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par370"><italic>Protect your data at a high level:</italic> This advantage can be exemplified as follows, considering a single cabinet with all valuables, these items will be under threat in a possible attack.

In IoT, pulling data from sensors and going to process will be yielding and safe because wireless communication modules spend a lot of energy. However, edge computing does not. Normally, data is produced and presented to the consumer, but nowadays, data must also be obtained from consumers thanks to social media. Therefore, the cloud network cannot be located in one place. Processing and storing data at the edge provides better protection than transferring that data to a cloud (Shi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR423">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par374">Edge computing, day by day, is affecting more and more areas. According to Techjury, the total data volume will be around 40 trillion gigabytes by the end of 2021, with a generation rate of 1.7 megabytes per person each second (Tadviser <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR449">2019</xref>). First and foremost, edge computing is in high demand in situations where judgments must be made quickly. Autonomous transportation systems must be able to react to changing traffic conditions quickly, changing speed, direction and even the entire route. It is believed that they will be connected to the central cloud in some way, but operational decisions will have to be made “on board”. IoT systems are developing and attracting more data. A reliable source will be needed to process, store and optimise the accessed data. However, edge computing is not developed enough to do these yet. An efficient scheduling algorithm that manages and controls this edge computing is also developed for energy efficiency (El-Sayed et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2017</xref>). One more example is the “intelligent” IoT sphere. When it is compared to the last generation of IoT, the new generation with edge computing will be more reliable. The efficiency and reliability of such a system are improved by processing data at the border (in local data centres, micro-clouds and even on the devices themselves) (Орлов <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR340">2019</xref>). As mentioned in the smart home part, sometimes cloud computing is not safe, and data is accessible from everywhere, and space problems can happen, so, in the future, this technology will develop about cloud offloading. In this direction, navigation systems and real-time applications games, augmented reality will develop. After the latest developments in social media, with mobile phones’ smartness, many video analytics technologies are insufficient. Therefore, it will be used in the future, especially to increase security, for example, to catch a criminal, be quick and intervene immediately (El-Sayed et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Energy Storage</title><p id="Par375">Energy systems are critical for gathering energy from different sources and transforming it into the energy forms necessary for use in various industries, including utility, manufacturing, construction and transportation. Energy sources can be used to meet consumer demand since they are easily storable while not in use. Early societies used rocks and water to store thermal energy for later use. Flywheels have been employed in pottery manufacturing for thousands of years. With the industrial revolution, new energy storage systems began to be used by people in many areas. Thermal, mechanical, chemical, electrical and magnetic energy may now be stored, converted and used thanks to many different methods. Modern energy storage devices have a wide range of uses in everyday life, for example, battery-operated portable devices such as computers, power banks, tablets, phones and smartwatches. Grid energy storage systems are necessary to maximise the introduction of energy efficiency. The electrochemical energy storage system, known as a battery system, has huge potential for grid energy storage. Energy storage methods can be used in a variety of applications. The form of transformed energy mostly determines the categorisation of energy storage systems. As can be seen from Fig. <xref rid="Fig58" ref-type="fig">2.58</xref>, energy storage systems are grouped under five main headings: mechanical, thermal, chemical, electrochemical and electrical energy storage. The following topics include energy storage systems and technologies, their use areas and potential future.<fig id="Fig58"><label>Fig. 2.58</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Energy storage technologies</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/532255_1_En_2_Fig58_HTML.png" id="MO58"><caption><p id="Par718">An illustration comprises a circle labeled energy storage that is connected to the circles labeled chemical, electrical, mechanical, thermal, and electrochemical energy storage systems.

This technology is currently an emerging technology<index-term id="ITerm37"><term>Emerging technologies</term></index-term>. This system consists of four different system elements. The system consists of two solid-filled storage tanks plus a thermal engine that can perform both the functions of a heat pump and a heat engine. While electricity is utilised, the machine in the system works as a heat pump and gas is produced at high pressure and temperature. While the hot gas produced here is transferred to the hot storage tank, cold gas is injected into the cold storage tank. In this way, the gases are pumped into hot and cold stores and diffused into the solids that fill the tanks. In the discharge cycle, the machine used in the system works as a heat engine. It uses two storage temperature differences to operate the electric generator here. While the gas in the high-temperature storage tank has high-pressure values, the pressure value in the tank is kept at ambient pressure in low-temperature storage. The pressure difference between these two storage tanks is determined by the temperature difference, the solid material used and the working fluid (Barbour <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2013</xref>). While these systems have a storage capacity from kilowatt to a megawatt, they can perform this storage process at 70–80% efficiency values (Ruer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR387">2010</xref>).<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par381"><italic>Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES)</italic></p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par382">Compressed air energy storage is an old technique to store energy as the first CAES plant was built in 1978. Large CAES facilities utilise underground places such as salt mines and rock caverns as storage locations (Gallo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">2016</xref>). In CAES, electricity using compressors catches and compresses the air. Then, the electrical energy used by compressors converts into the potential energy of compressed air. When energy is demanded, stored air is released and goes through gas turbines, where turbines convert the energy into electrical energy. The air compression process generates heat. Different sub-methods of CAES, such as D-CAES (diabatic), A-CAES (adiabatic) and I-CAES (isothermal), are named based on their approach to waste heat (Budt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2016</xref>).<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par383"><italic>Flywheel</italic></p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par384">The stored energy is in the rotational kinetic energy form in flywheel systems. The motor is used to charge this system. This motor utilises electricity for the rotation of the flywheel rotor. While the discharge process is carried out in the system, the same engine performs as a generator and produces electricity by reducing the engine speed. In these systems, the power ratio is determined by the characteristics of the power electronics and the engine-generator set in the system. The storage capacity also depends on the rotor speed, material and shape (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2009</xref>). There are two different flywheel configurations. These configurations depend on the maximum rotor speed. High-velocity flywheels could get 100,000 rpm, and composite materials are preferred in these systems. In low-speed flywheel systems, they operate at less than 10,000 rpm. Steel is commonly preferred as the rotor material in these systems. Due to the engines and materials preferred in high-speed flywheel systems, system costs are higher than low-speed flywheel systems (Lund et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR276">2015</xref>). When they are modularised, the storage value can reach MW levels. These systems are capable of operating with 75–85% efficiency rates, and they are important storage alternative systems as they are fast-acting and long-lasting systems (Hadjipaschalis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR177">2009</xref>).<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par385"><italic>Liquid Air Energy Storage (LAES)</italic></p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par386">Liquid air energy storage is an emerging technology<index-term id="ITerm38"><term>Emerging technologies</term></index-term> that enables the storage of energy by storing liquified air in tanks. Unlike PHS and CAES, LAES does not require broad land to build a storage facility, and there is no significant environmental issue caused by LAES (Gallo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">2016</xref>). Therefore, LAES can be considered geographically independent and environmentally safe. LAES takes thermal and electrical energy as inputs and outputs thermal and electrical energy. Air liquefaction and power generation are two different cycles that act as the opposite of the other. Gaseous air is captured by a compressor and liquified by a condenser at the liquefaction cycle. This liquid air can be stored in a tank. When energy is demanded, the power generation cycle becomes active, and liquid air is released from the tank and pumped into a heater. Heated air moves through a turbine and spins it (O’Callaghan and Donnellan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR332">2021</xref>).<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par387"><italic>Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS)</italic></p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par388">The PHS technique stores energy as water’s potential energy by creating two water reservoirs where one is placed lower. Water is pumped from the lower reservoir to the upper one when stored energy is needed. Once power is required, blockings between the reservoirs are removed, and turbines produce energy while water travels to the lower reservoir (Rehman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR376">2015</xref>).<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par389"><italic>Electrochemical Energy Storage Systems</italic></p></list-item></list><list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par390"><italic>Conventional Batteries</italic></p></list-item></list><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par391"><italic>Lead-Acid</italic></p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par392">This technology has been used for 150 years, especially in the automotive industry. The components of this technology are lead metal as well as oxide electrodes, also a solution of sulphuric acid (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2009</xref>). Whereas lead and lead oxide transform to lead sulphate, as the concentration of the electrolyte decreases in the discharge cycle, the deposition of the lead and increasing concentration of the electrolyte that take place on the anode occurs in the charge reaction. High efficiency and low cost are advantages of lead-acid batteries; nevertheless, low cycle life, low specific energy and the toxicity of the lead are disadvantages of this type of battery (Beaudin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2010</xref>).<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par393"><italic>Lithium-Ion</italic></p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par394">Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are a high energy density, rechargeable energy storage technique that employs lithium ions as the main component. Lithium atoms in the anode are ionised during a discharge cycle and recombined with their electrons in the charge cycle.

The properties of this type of battery are long cycle life (1000–1500 cycles), elevated specific energy (55–75 W h/kg) and so on. However, the toxic property of cadmium is the negative side of this technology. Also, nickel-metal hydride batteries can be obtained by removing the cadmium in the system. This battery is an environmental version of nickel-cadmium batteries. When the energy density increases, the self-discharge and reduced durability occur in the nickel-metal hydride batteries (Gallo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">2016</xref>).<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par397"><italic>High-Temperature Batteries</italic></p></list-item></list><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par398"><italic>Sodium-Sulphur Batteries (NaS)</italic></p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par399">Sodium sulphur (NaS) batteries started to commercialise in 1984. This battery technology contains molten sulphur and sodium ions at cathode and anode, respectively. A high temperature is required for this technology to keep sodium and sulphur in the liquid phase. Due to this situation, this technology can be designated as high-temperature batteries. Besides, the electrodes are made from alumina, which only gives sodium transportation in the electrolyte. To keep this battery at a high temperature, electrical heaters are used in this type of battery. Electrical heaters give rise to discharge capacity losses (Schlumberger Energy Institute (SBC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR405">2013</xref>).<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par400"><italic>Sodium-Nickel Chloride (Na-NiCl</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub><italic>)</italic></p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par401">Sodium-nickel chloride batteries have molten materials at their electrodes. The first investigation started in the 1970s, and General Electric has been searching for this battery since 2007. An Italian company FIAMM produces commercial sodium-nickel chloride battery systems (Gallo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">2016</xref>). NiCl<sub>2</sub>, or the mixture of NiCl<sub>2</sub> and FeCl<sub>2</sub>, behaves as active material in the cathode. Also, sodium-nickel chloride batteries include beta-alumina electrolyte and molten sodium chloroaluminate (NaAlCl<sub>4</sub>). This type of battery system has high specific energy, efficiency and cycle life; however, the disadvantage of this system is that the heating up from the frozen state of the battery takes a long time, nearly 15 hours (Gallo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">2016</xref>). Na-NiCl is safer than Na-S batteries. Because when a failure occurs in the electrolyte, molten sodium initially gives the reaction of solid chloroaluminate. As a result of this reaction, non-dangerous products also inhibit any further reactions (Gallo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">2016</xref>).<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par402"><italic>Flow Batteries</italic></p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par403">To generate electricity, flow batteries use chemical reduction-oxidation processes.

Ion exchange occurs when liquids are pumped over the membrane, causing an electric current to be generated, with the charge being supplied or withdrawn via two electrodes. The energy capacity is solely determined by tank size, while the power is determined by anode surface area.

High specific energy can be obtained with this technology. Although this technology has not reached its potential, sodium air batteries have great interest due to the abundance of sodium in the world and easiness of reaction (Hartmann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR181">2013</xref>).

After this process, the product that comes out is a kind of synthetic natural gas or substitute natural gas. This created product has the same properties as natural gas and can be transferred, used and stored just like natural gas. This system functions as an efficient energy storage system. In this system, if renewable energy sources are used as an energy source, and carbon capture technology is used in the mentation process, the resulting gas turns into a carbon-neutral gas (MAN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR287">2021</xref>).<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par414"><italic>Power-to-Liquids (PtL)</italic></p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par415">As the name suggests, power-to-liquid technology is a technology that converts energy into various liquids.

The hydrogen obtained as a result of this production and the ready-made carbon dioxide are used for the production of liquid hydrocarbons. It is refined according to the type of hydrocarbon produced. There are two main production routes to realise liquid production in this technology, the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) pathway and the methanol (MeOH) pathway.

In these systems, thermal energy is stored by heating or cooling the material or environment. The energy to be stored can come from waste cold, waste heat or thermal solar energy. In addition, electrical energy can be converted into a storage source for these systems after it is converted into heat energy (Gallo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">2016</xref>). The energy here can be stored daily, weekly or even seasonally, then stored energy could be utilised to heat, cool or generate power. Thermal energy storage systems are divided into three in themselves.

The liquid or solid used in such systems is heated, increasing its temperature. Then, the energy stored here is released when needed by lowering the temperature of the material. The heat capacity of the material used here is essential. In these systems, materials with high heat capacity are used, so the amount of material used is kept as low as possible. Material thermal properties, material storage capacity and operational temperature values are factors that affect material selection (Hauer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">2012</xref>). Although these systems are less efficient (50–90%) than other thermal storage systems, they are preferred because of their simple structure and low cost (Connor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par422">Latent heat thermal energy storage systems utilise the change of phase to store thermal energy. In these systems, phase-changing materials (PCM) are preferred as storage materials. These systems eliminate the two disadvantages of SH-TES systems. The first of these is about specific energy. The obtained specific energy increases between five and fourteen by using this system than the usage of SH-TES. Secondly, while the discharge temperature remains constant in LH-TES systems, the discharge temperature changes in SH-TES systems. The efficiency of these systems is around 75–90%. The PCM used in these storage systems is incorporated into building walls. The temperature of this material decreases due to the decrease in air temperature at night, and it solidifies. With the increase in temperatures during the day, the temperature of the material also increases and the material melts and becomes liquid. During the phase change that takes place here, the wall temperature remains constant and reduces the heat input to the interior. In this way, it can reduce or eliminate the need for air conditioning to cool the environment. This cooling process using these systems is called passive cooling (Abele et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2011</xref>).</p><p id="Par423">Thermochemical energy storage systems are energy storage systems that perform chemical reactions using thermal energy and convert thermal energy into chemical energy. The purpose of these systems is not to synthesise new products to be used later. In these systems, reversible processes such as hydration-dehydration, adsorption-desorption and redox are used to store thermal energy to be utilised. These systems have a denser storage capacity than other thermal storage systems, and thus the material used for storage is much less. The efficiency of thermochemical storage systems is 75–100%, and these systems are a good alternative for long-term storage. These systems lose almost no energy during the storage period, which makes these systems suitable for long-term storage needs. Storage in these systems is usually carried out at ambient temperature (Abedin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2011</xref>).</p><p id="Par424">The energy storage enables the reduction of energy costs, increases energy system reliability and flexibility and integrates different energy systems into the system. In addition, storage systems also contain an environmentalist approach. Energy storage contributes to reducing energy costs both on the producer side and on the consumer side. While the operational costs of energy production companies in frequency regulation or providing spinning reserve services will decrease, the consumption costs of consumers will decrease thanks to the use from the warehouse, which they will make at peak times of energy consumption, especially thanks to storage. In addition, both producers and consumers will not be adversely affected by power cuts that may occur, and it will be possible to mitigate the economic losses due to interruptions to some degree (Energy Storage Association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par425">The grid’s flexibility and reliability increase by the development and integration of energy storage systems. The reliability of the grid is a very important issue for both producers and consumers. Thanks to the storage, in any negative situation that may occur in the grid, consumers are not adversely affected by power cuts because the energy in the warehouse is activated and can be given to the grid. In this way, the costs caused by the negativities will be prevented (Energy Storage Association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">2021</xref>). In addition, energy storage facilitates the connection of renewable energy sources to the grid. Today, the biggest disadvantage of renewable energy sources is the instability of energy production, and this is one of the biggest obstacles to the choice of renewable energy sources. However, thanks to energy storage, the stored energy is transferred to the grid at the point where renewable energy sources are insufficient to meet the grid needs. In addition, energy storage is important for existing energy production systems. Especially in cases where it becomes difficult to meet the required production due to the sudden increase in demand in the network, these storage systems come into play and ensure that the demand is met. Thanks to the storage, flexibility is provided to the system (Energy Storage Association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">2021</xref>). The extensive use of energy storage plays an important role in carbon emissions reduction through the common usage of renewable energy sources. In addition, since the networks can operate much more efficiently thanks to storage, the consumed energy will be used more efficiently. Accordingly, there will be a decrease in the amount of carbon released per unit of energy. Since storage systems contribute to decreasing carbon emissions, they also contribute positively to the environment (Energy Storage Association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par426">There has been a sharp growth in the use of renewable energy sources in recent years, and this trend is projected to continue. Suppose nations maintain their current and previously declared policies. In that case, the worldwide capacity of solar photovoltaic (PV) is expected to reach 3142 GW by 2040, surpassing coal and gas to become the world’s greatest energy source. Similarly, wind’s proportion in electricity generation will rise from 5% in 2018 to 13% in 2040, with a capacity of around 1856 GW. As a result, the total wind and solar capacity will be 4998 GW. In addition, when hydro and other renewable sources are considered, the overall percentage of energy generation will rise from 26% in 2018 to 41% in 2040 (Hossain et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR191">2020</xref>). It has become a necessity to meet the energy needs from renewable energy sources since the negative changes in the climate. However, renewable energy production systems cause various problems in continuous energy production, and fluctuations may occur in the production. Storing the produced energy becomes important at this point. In this period of transformation in energy systems, one of the keys to facilitating the transition to renewable energy is the development of new storage systems and the increase in their number. The storage capacity available worldwide in 2014 was around 140 GW (Xylia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR504">2021</xref>). By 2020, this amount has increased to 170 GW, and this corresponds to approximately 3–4% of the energy produced today (Kamiya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR226">2021</xref>; Xylia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR504">2021</xref>). It is aimed to increase the storage level to 450 GW by 2050 (Xylia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR504">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par427">The use of electric vehicles is increasing day by day. This increase brings with it new opportunities. It is possible to use electric vehicle batteries in two different ways for energy storage. One of these is to utilise batteries that have completed their life for energy storage (Renault Group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR377">2021</xref>). Batteries in electric vehicles need to be replaced when the capacity percentage drops to 60–70%, but they are still usable (Cagatay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2021</xref>). In this case, the batteries taken from the vehicles can be combined and converted into fixed energy storage systems. Another possible usage method is the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology. In this technology, vehicles store the electricity they receive from the grid and transfer the stored energy back to the grid when there is a lack of energy in the grid. In this way, mobile energy storage can be provided (Renault Group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR377">2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Flexible Electronics and Wearables</title><p id="Par428">Flexible electronics and wearables (FEAWs) are technologies that support each other and need to be looked at together. The development of one improves the other so that they will be covered together in this chapter. Conventional electronic systems have an inherently rigid and unalterable form. Re-developing these systems by adding features such as flexibility and stretchability allows electronics to be added to a broader range of applications and products where flexibility is required. New form factors and new products can be developed using technologies such as printed electronics. According to experts, the market share of flexible electronics will increase soon. For example, by 2024, the worldwide flexible electronics market is estimated to reach USD 87.21 billion (Grand View Research <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par429">Flexible electronics present many innovative technological developments in the electronics field, such as the flex circuit board. A flex circuit board is a type of printed circuit board with at least one readable feature of the board. Flexible circuits are called FFC (flexible flat cable) and are used by replacing cable wires and connectors. In this case, the flex circuit is designed without electronic components. Another common use includes parts mounted on flexible circuitry such as LED strip and LCD panel interface. The electronic circuit is designed on a flexible plastic substrate, usually polyimide film, which is resistant to high heat to make it suitable for soldering assembly components. Flexible electronics offer low-cost solutions to a wide range of applications such as foldable displays and TVs, e-paper, smart sensors and transparent RFIDs. The main advantages of flexible electronics over existing silicon technologies are low-cost manufacturing methods and inexpensive, flexible substrates. The fact that flexible electronics are light, bendable and portable and require low-cost electronics is also becoming a very interesting material for next-generation consumer products (Cheng and Huang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2009</xref>).</p><p id="Par430">Wearable technology is a phrase for items that have acceptable electronic functions and aesthetic qualities, consisting of a simple interface to provide specific activities to meet the demands of individuals. Since wearable technology provides many conveniences to individuals in terms of usage, portability and data utilisation, a considerable amount of attention has been paid to it in recent years, and the market share of wearable technology has increased like flexible electronics.

CGI technology (computer-generated imagery) added to the costumes allows all effects prepared on the computer to be transferred to movies. In this way, the imaginary world of people can be transferred to real life. Wearable technologies that integrate virtual reality to all of the digital and physical elements to increase the gaming sensation in the real world are also used in the game industry.

It enables students to study differently and without the danger associated. It may present students with actual scenarios and bring them the locations that are difficult or occasionally inaccessible, such as space studies, archaeological courses, medical education, chemical engineering and aviation training (Attallah and Ilagure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2018</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par436">Medical: Wearable bioelectronics provides clinicians with real-time monitoring of a patient’s physiological parameters, which has interested many researchers and technology companies. Wearable bioelectronics contains three types of sensors: pressure, temperature and biochemical. Tech companies use those sensors to monitor, measure and inject hormones and enzymes into the skin (Parlak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR349">2020</xref>). A tech company, Omnipod 5, designed an insulin pump that sticks into the skin and controls blood sugar levels of type 1 diabetes patients (Henderson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR186">2021</xref>).

Flexible electronics are used by a wide range of sectors and professionals in their equipment and products because they provide a variety of benefits such as, but not limited to, being affordable, flexible, customisable, innovative and portable. From a different standpoint, flexible displays and flexible sensors will revolutionise wearable technology by allowing devices to conform to our bodies and clothing while providing increased utility. For instance, the utilisation of FEAW technology has become more medically oriented, an increasing number of wearable devices are being programmed to interact with humans’ bodies and collect data that can be used to inform sports science and health research. It will be critical to ensure that these devices are shatterproof, unobtrusive and “unawareable” to design successful healthcare applications.

Soon, they will be able to do things that people cannot even think of right now. Major developments in medical, energy and electronics are coming. Studies in the medical field enabled innovative solutions. One of the featured solutions is electronic skins. Patients will be able to wear a plastic sheet with organic circuits embedded in it if they choose to use electronic skin. The skin can monitor the pulse, oxygen levels and temperature of the user’s blood. Users can become more aware of potential health issues and provide invaluable data to their healthcare providers by utilising electronic skin. The UV radiation monitoring patch will also be available in the future (Moser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR316">2016</xref>). Users will be able to track how much dangerous UV light they receive using a UV radiation tracking patch. The patch may provide the data directly to smartphones so that people may notice whether they have to search for melanoma and other potentially harmful consequences of UV radiation more vigilantly. Flexible circuits in contact lenses, another development that we will encounter in the field of health, is another technology that we will encounter in the future. Contact lenses with electrically conducting polymers are an intriguing opportunity for the future of flexible electronics. A user may transfer a picture from a TV or computer screen right into their contact lenses with these contact lenses (Watkins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR490">2021</xref>). Additionally, sensors integrated inside the lens could potentially detect a user’s glucose level and then project that level onto the lens, allowing the user to see it.</p><p id="Par441">Studies in the field of energy continue day by day. One of the most exciting innovations<index-term id="ITerm41"><term>Innovations</term></index-term> in the energy industry is printable solar panels. Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are a type of flexible electronics that are expanding solar energy possibilities. An OPV may print solar energy technology into the fabric of your drapes or laminate it onto your window panes rather than requiring solar panels to be placed on a roof. Consumers may see the technology integrated into solar-powered clothes, which could be used to recharge cell phone and laptop batteries (Global Electronic Services <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">2021</xref>). OPV cells are thin and flexible because they are placed on a flexible substrate. Sunlight is absorbed through technology, which then transmits that energy to devices. These OPVs are not only offered to make houses simpler and meet specific demands but may also be considerably cheaper than standard solar panels. The lower cost is primarily since OPVs employ a polymer-based semiconductor layer, whereas most solar panels on the market use more expensive semiconducting materials like silicon. Researchers and business professionals are developing techniques to increase the availability of OPVs and incorporate them into a wide range of products. In the future, experts expect to see a lot more of these OPVs (Watkins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR490">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par442">The last area to investigate in FEAW is electronics. The gadgets and devices that employ flexible electronics will be increased for consumers in the future. For example, foldable smartphones can be given as an example. While some of these modern phones are struggling for durability, flexible circuits help change this as technology progresses. As organic light-emitting polymers (OLEDs) develop and become more widespread, expect more durable foldable cell phones. In the future, individuals will be able to see televisions that can wrap around the walls of their houses, in addition to cell phones (Watkins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR490">2021</xref>; Delta Impact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2021</xref>, Global Electronic Services <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">2021</xref>).

The area covers various sectors and offers both international and micro viewpoints. It can point the way to better patient care, clinical data, diagnostics and corporate management. When paired with marketing intelligence suites and visual analytics, healthcare analytics help managers make more informed decisions by providing real-time information that can support choices and provide valuable insights. Healthcare analytics is a compilation of administrative and financial data that may help hospitals and healthcare managers improve patient care, provide better services and modernise existing processes (Sisense <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR432">2021</xref>). Wise decisions based on accessible data could help alleviate problems that can occur in traditional healthcare systems and ease the transition to value-based management. In their management systems, healthcare facilities are incorporating information technology. This system collects a significant amount of data on a constant schedule. Analytics supplies skills and strategies for extracting information from this complicated and extensive data and converting it into data that can be used to aid healthcare decision-making (Islam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR207">2018</xref>).

To gather this information, healthcare providers, insurance companies and governmental organisations employ a variety of health information systems (HIS) and various modern tools, the combination of which can demonstrate a comprehensive picture of each patient as well as trends related to geography, socioeconomic status, race and propensity. The data gathered can be separated into distinct datasets, which can subsequently be examined. A number of tools are used to collect, store, distribute and analyse health data.

A substantial amount of data is being collected in real-time as electronic record keeping, applications and other electronic means of data collecting and storage become more prevalent. There is a need for a centralised, systematic method of gathering, storing and analysing data so that it may be used to its full potential. In recent times, data collecting in health situations has become more efficient. The information might be utilised to enhance day-to-day operations and patient safety and predictive modelling. Both datasets can be used to track trends and generate predictions instead of merely looking at historical or present data. Preventative steps can be taken, and the results can be tracked in this manner (University of Pittsburgh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR470">2021</xref>). Four main types of healthcare analytics are stated below:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par452"><italic>Descriptive analytics</italic> commonly takes the form of a dashboard, leverages historical data to provide insights into trends or benchmarks.

This is made feasible through the use of data. Rather than just treating the symptoms as they occur, clinicians can detect individuals at significant risk of acquiring chronic diseases and intervene before they become a problem. Preventive care may help to avert long-term problems and expensive hospitalisations, saving costs for practitioners, insurance companies and patients. If hospitalisation is required, data analytics can assist clinicians in predicting infection, worsening and readmission risks. This, too, can assist in lowering expenses and improving patient outcomes. In terms of epidemics, healthcare analytics analyses collected data in real-time to better understand the consequences of epidemics and predict future trends so that the spread can be slowed and future epidemics can be avoided (University of Pittsburgh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR470">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par457">Pressures on healthcare institutions throughout the world to save costs, enhance coordination and results, deliver more with less and be more patient-centric are mounting. The growth of medical data systems, digital healthcare data and connected health equipment has resulted in an unparalleled information explosion, which has increased the industry’s unpredictability. Nonetheless, the proof is growing that unsatisfactory medical outcomes and inefficiency progressively beset the sector. Developing analytic skills may assist such companies in using “big data” to provide meaningful insights, define their future vision, increase performance and save the critical time necessary to examine healthcare data. New analytics approaches may be leveraged to generate clinical and operational improvements to tackle business problems. Analytics in healthcare will progress from a conventional base point of transaction tracking utilising basic reporting techniques, spreadsheet applications and software reporting components to a prototype that will ultimately integrate predictive analytics, allowing companies to “see the future”, provide more individualised health services, predict patient behaviour and allow for dynamic service (Cortada et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2012</xref>).</p><p id="Par458">Healthcare providers are obliged to report on a variety of key performance measures.

The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasised the value of leveraging technology to improve efficiency in remote patient care and telemedicine. Given the popularity of virtual health, it is apparent that the healthcare sector will increasingly rely on AI and big data to fill in the holes in conventional healthcare systems. Instead of remaining just huge storage, the move to electronic health records in clinics has opened up the option of using data models to utilise this information to deliver proactive healthcare actively. As a result, the idea of a “data-driven physician” is gaining momentum (Tabata <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR447">2021</xref>). Healthcare analytics in the future will contain increasingly bigger datasets for healthcare companies to interpret and manage. As new technologies develop and customer desire for personal control grows, it will become increasingly vital to understand how to navigate the competitive landscape and scale patient’s data to stay relevant. Leading hospitals are attempting to guarantee that data-generating technologies are utilised to produce the greatest outcomes for patients as data-generating technologies have spread throughout society and industry. The Internet of Things includes sensors that monitor patient health and machine status and wearables and patients’ mobile phones. Because of the network of this equipment, physicians get a complete picture of what is going on in the hospital and may be informed in real-time if a data anomaly reveals changes that require immediate attention. This drastic move towards data can help doctors make better judgments and, in turn, improve patient outcomes. Artificial intelligence and clever algorithms will evaluate healthcare data to improve medical practitioners’ abilities, from picking which individuals to cure to the effective methods to guide them throughout assessment and treatments. These breakthroughs are changing the way the community views healthcare, culminating in healthier communities with extended lifespans (Huiskens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR194">2020</xref>). The use of AI inside the forms of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) can add a lot of value to delivering better outcomes across the existing healthcare continuum. The application of these technologies in healthcare will also aid in the development of new “value-based care” models, and with the rise of big data, it may be used to drive greater personalisation and transformation in healthcare analytics for patients.

Hydrogen is the simplest member of the chemical element family, which is flammable, tasteless, odourless and colourless and represented by the symbol H. This element is normally found in nature as a hydrogen molecule in pairs. Although hydrogen is widely found in nature, this element makes up only 14% of the earth’s crust by weight. Hydrogen is not found alone in nature but as a part of the water in lakes, seas, glaciers and similar structures (Jolly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR219">2020</xref>).

In the grey hydrogen production method, natural gas (CH4) is the main material, and hydrogen production is carried out using auto thermal reforming (ATR) or steam methane reforming (SMR) methods. As a result of this production, CO<sub>2</sub> is released into nature. Due to this emission, this method is not environmentally friendly, and for this reason, it is called grey hydrogen production. In the production of blue hydrogen, the same methods as in grey hydrogen are used, and raw material (natural gas) is used.</p><p id="Par464">However, in this method, the carbon dioxide produced due to the decomposition of natural gas is captured and stored. In this way, this gas that causes the greenhouse effect is not released into nature, and the harmful gases that come out during hydrogen production are largely eliminated. Although this method is more environmentally friendly than the grey hydrogen production method, it still has various effects on the environment since it is not possible to capture all the carbon dioxide that occurs during hydrogen production. Hydrogen that is produced by adopting and using the most environmentally friendly production methods in hydrogen production is called green hydrogen. The production steps performed in this production method are given in Fig. <xref rid="Fig64" ref-type="fig">2.64</xref>. The method used in this production method is electrolysis. The raw material used is water. Water is broken down into oxygen and hydrogen by electrolysis. The hydrogen obtained as a result of the separation is stored, and the oxygen, which is harmless to nature, is released into nature. Electricity is required for electrolysis, which is the method used in this production method. In this method, electricity produced by renewable energy sources such as the sun and wind is used to produce environmentally friendly hydrogen (Petrofac <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR354">2021</xref>).<fig id="Fig64"><label>Fig. 2.64</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Green hydrogen production</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/532255_1_En_2_Fig64_HTML.png" id="MO64"><caption><p id="Par724">An illustration of the green hydrogen production process.

These usage methods are shared in Fig. <xref rid="Fig65" ref-type="fig">2.65</xref>. Petroleum refining, chemical, stationary fuel cell, transportation and energy storage are the usage areas of hydrogen. Developments in transportation and energy storage appear as important application areas with the potential to increase the widespread use of hydrogen.<fig id="Fig65"><label>Fig. 2.65</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Hydrogen usage areas</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/532255_1_En_2_Fig65_HTML.png" id="MO65"><caption><p id="Par725">An illustration of hydrogen usage areas.

Chemicals, fuel cell vehicles, petroleum refining, energy storage, and stationary fuel cells.</p></caption></graphic></fig></p><p id="Par466">Hydrogen storage brings with it various advantages compared to other storage systems. For example, batteries can store certain amounts of energy for a certain time, and long-term energy storage is not possible in these systems. Here, the long-term storage feature of hydrogen storage systems comes to the fore. Depending on the size of the hydrogen storage facility, it can be stored and can keep the amount of hydrogen stored for days or even weeks after the storage process so that there is no storage-related loss during energy production. Although another storage system is pumped water storage systems that do not have various problems in terms of storage time or amount of stored energy, they require large lands and large constructions and are required to be formed in desired geographical conditions. In this direction, hydrogen storage systems also precede such storage systems (FCHEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">2021</xref>). Long-term storage is an important feature. These storage systems stand out as important candidates in emergency generators or other critical energy applications. The widespread use of renewable energy sources can bring along various problems. With this diversity in the sources of energy production, various problems can be experienced in ensuring the supply-demand balance in energy systems. These production imbalances experienced here cause the energy produced to be wasted if the production is more than needed or the system to be supported with fossil fuels due to the insufficient amount of energy being produced when the demand is high. In this case, energy storage systems gain importance. Hydrogen storage systems are becoming an important alternative at this point. These systems provide the needed power to the electrolysis machines when the energy need is low, hydrogen production is carried out and electrolysis machines can produce green hydrogen. This hydrogen produced can be stored, transferred to stationary fuel cells for power generation, transferred to fuel cell vehicles for use in transportation, transferred to these pipelines to reduce the carbon density in natural gas pipelines, or for later use as a cryogenic liquid, compressed gas (FCHEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">2021</xref>). When an energy system needs the energy, stored hydrogen can be used for electricity production.</p><p id="Par467">Another area where hydrogen can be used is in transportation systems. Here, in these hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, the vehicles still work with electric motors, but at this point, unlike the battery electric vehicles used today, they are systems that produce their electricity. In other words, these vehicles do not meet their energy needs from an internal battery that can be charged externally, as in electric vehicles. Thanks to the fuel cells they contain, these vehicles effectively have their efficient power plants. By using this fuel cell technology in vehicles, the reverse of the electrolysis process used to produce hydrogen is applied. Thanks to this reverse electrolysis, the hydrogen taken from the tanks react with the oxygen taken from the environment. As a result of this reaction, water vapour comes out of the exhaust and electricity is produced. These vehicles are vehicles that operate without causing emission problems, just like electric vehicles. In addition, while long charging times in electric vehicles are a problematic issue, these vehicles can be charged in a short time, and this problem is significantly eliminated. Therefore, this technology constitutes an important alternative for the future (BMW <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par468">As it can be understood from these two usage areas, fuel cells gain importance at the point of conversion of stored hydrogen into electricity. Fuel cells are devices that produce electricity via an electrochemical way. The components situated in fuel cells are anode, cathode, electrolyte and circuit. Chemical reactions occur in anode and cathode; moreover, hydrogen is used as a fuel while oxygen is used as an oxidant. The working procedure of the fuel cells are very similar to a battery; however, if the fuel is available, the heat and electricity can be obtained without problems such as recharging against battery systems. The fuel and oxygen are inserted into the system at the anode and cathode sites, respectively. Electric energy and heat are produced during fuel cell activities. The electrons go through the circuit, whereas the protons are transmitted through the electrolyte membrane (Behling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2012</xref>). The electron movement can be designated as current. At the anode, the splitting of the hydrogen into electrons and protons takes place. As a by-product, water is emitted by the reaction that is carried out by combining protons, electrons and oxygen at the cathode site (Behling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2012</xref>).</p><p id="Par469">Hydrogen can be used as a stationary and portable energy transfer source. This source is an energy carrier with great potential for clean and efficient power. Hydrogen energy is an important candidate for energy security, reducing oil and natural gas dependency, reducing greenhouse gas and air pollution. In addition, it is an important alternative fuel source for land or air transportation (Smith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR436">2016</xref>). It contributes to the solution of the problem of supply-demand balance, which is in front of the storage of hydrogen and the transfer of energy thanks to hydrogen and the use of renewable energy sources. Since these systems can provide long and efficient storage, they become more advantageous systems than normal short-term and low-efficiency storage systems. Thanks to the storage of green hydrogen, which is produced using renewable energy sources such as the sun and wind, energy storage can be realised. In this way, when excess supply occurs in the supply-demand balance, the excess energy that has been produced can be stored. Hydrogen storage systems provide long-lasting energy storage. In this way, when energy is needed, hydrogen is converted back into electrical energy and an energy supply is provided. By using this storage method, the problem of not being able to reach the energy when needed, which is one of the negative aspects of renewable energy sources, is eliminated. In this way, when energy is needed, instead of preferring the use of fossil fuels to ensure energy balance, the use of stored green hydrogen can be used to prevent CO<sub>2</sub> emissions that may arise from energy production. In this way, energy is produced and used more cleanly. Hydrogen technology is emerging as an alternative that can be used in the field of transportation, and with its contributions in this field, it can contribute to reducing the use of fossil fuels and reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emission values. Today, electric vehicles are increasing day by day, but charging time is still an important problem in these vehicles. Since hydrogen vehicles provide an important alternative for this existing problem thanks to their short filling times, they stand out as an important option for the dissemination of such environmental-friendly vehicles in transportation. In this way, it can be an important solution for the environmental pollution problem caused by the transportation sector by increasing the environmental transportation options.</p><p id="Par470">The reason why hydrogen attracts so much attention today is because of this low carbon emission. If hydrogen is used in energy transfer, it does not cause carbon dioxide emissions as in fossil fuels. When hydrogen is consumed, only heat and water are produced (Clark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2012</xref>). Although hydrogen seems to be such an attractive source, its usage areas are limited today and it is used in a limited way, especially in projects that can contribute to the environment. Today, the amount of hydrogen widely used in the petroleum and chemical industries is approximately 80 million tonnes. The amount of hydrogen produced is expected to increase to 100 million at the end of this decade and 500 million by 2050, especially with the development of technologies such as energy storage and hydrogen transportation. At this point, it becomes an important economy with the expected growth in the field of hydrogen. Today, 95% of the hydrogen produced is produced as grey hydrogen. In other words, fossil sources are used in the production of hydrogen (Schnettler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR406">2020</xref>). The main reason for this is that this method is much cheaper than green hydrogen production. Grey hydrogen production costs are 1–2 Euros per kilogram, while green hydrogen production costs are 3–8 Euros per kilogram in Europe and 3–5 Euros in regions such as the Middle East, Russia, the USA and Africa. For this reason, grey hydrogen is a much-preferred source. However, with the increasing awareness about the environment, the demands and policies for green technologies are increasing. Efforts are also being made to reduce green hydrogen production costs. In the future projections, it is predicted that the green hydrogen production costs will decrease by half by 2030 and the kilogram cost of green hydrogen will decrease to 1–1.5 Euros by 2050. With the arrangements to be made and the technological developments to be experienced, it is foreseen that the hydrogen economy will turn into a green hydrogen economy and hydrogen production will increase rapidly, especially after 2030 (Van Hoof et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR478">2021</xref>). At this point, although hydrogen is an important energy-transportation alternative for the future, it also has important economic potential.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Internet of Behaviours</title><p id="Par471">The increase in the accuracy of analysis studies that can be done from existing sources and the expansion of their scope has allowed many different technical disciplines to emerge thanks to the development of technology. One of the technologies that can be mentioned in this context is the Internet of Behaviours (IoB). IoB can be defined as studies on data to provide information on user behaviours, interests and various possible preferences (Techvice Company <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR453">2021</xref>). While the Internet of Things (IoT) technology deals with the interaction of electronic devices with each other, IoB combines location, face and various preference information obtained from users and tries to match this information with various behaviours (International Banker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR204">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par472">The starting point of IoB is to create an optimum level of choice with the integration of data obtained by electronic devices providing data exchange over the Internet with IoT (Todaro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR459">2021</xref>). To achieve the integration mentioned here, data can be collected and processed from various sources such as customer information, social media, location tracking and citizenship data provided by government agencies (Techvice Company <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR453">2021</xref>). In this context, transactions related to IoB can generally be considered as a combination of behavioural science, data analytics and technology (Tech The Day <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR452">2021</xref>). Today, the concept of IoB is used effectively in several areas. These areas are listed in Fig. <xref rid="Fig66" ref-type="fig">2.66</xref> (Pal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR345">2021</xref>).<fig id="Fig66"><label>Fig. 2.66</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Some usage areas of IoB technology.

It is profoundly altering sectors and ways of operation, including digital marketing. The importance of IoT technology and the IoB cannot be underestimated today, as they will have an impact on consumer behaviour and the marketing platforms used to capture their attention. So, it is critical to begin incorporating the IoB technology into the digital marketing plan of the business world as soon as possible to profit and obtain the greatest number of pleased consumers (Kolomiiets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR244">2021</xref>). According to McKinsey, behavioural insights are key to unlocking an 85% boost in revenue and a 25% rise in gross margin. Businesses can utilise data to do behavioural analysis and establish where customers come from and what happens to them. Knowing this data via the IoB is crucial for analysing recommendations, constructing predictive models and developing effective methods to improve engagement, retention and conversion (Singh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR429">2021</xref>). Furthermore, IoB integrates current technologies that directly focus on the person, such as facial recognition, location monitoring and big data. While some consumers are hesitant to provide their data, many others are willing to do so if it offers data-driven value. For businesses, this includes modifying their image, advertising items more successfully to their consumers or improving a product’s or service’s customer experience (CX). In theory, data on all aspects of a user’s life may be collected with the ultimate objective of increasing efficiency and quality (Vector ITC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR481">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par475">The biggest challenge that IoB technology will face is cybersecurity issues. Analyses made on people’s data can be of great interest to cybercriminals. In addition, the sharing of this data by various companies due to commercial concerns is also a problem for personal security. The legal process from the past related to this situation should also update itself and make users feel safer (Techvice Company <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR453">2021</xref>). Apart from these problems, the free use of users’ data is another issue that makes people prejudiced against IoB. This issue can be overcome by providing customised prices and services to individuals based on data obtained from individuals. The leading sectors that can do this are the banking and insurance sectors (personal interest rate, insurance pricing, etc.) (Kidd <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR240">2019</xref>).

IoB is still in its early phases, according to Gartner, but by 2025, more than half of the world’s population will have been exposed to at least one IoB program, whether from the government or a private organisation. Furthermore, according to Gartner, by 2023, 40% of the global population’s digital actions will be tracked in order to affect human behaviour (Axıos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2020</xref>). However, for these developments to take place, this technology must be accompanied by a transparency policy that is as user-friendly as possible, protecting privacy rights. In addition, it is very important to protect the cybersecurity of this data as highly as possible (International Banker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR204">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par477">To minimise negative customer reactions, it will be critical to keeping a balance between customised offerings and interference. Any firm that adopts an IoB strategy must ensure that it has robust cybersecurity in place to secure all of that sensitive data. In the hands of the right people and with the proper data protection regulations, IoB will play a significant role in the near future (Sayol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR402">2021</xref>). In personnel management, it will be feasible to measure the quality of workers’ work and analyse how much each department, division or particular employee contributes to the organisation’s overall success. Managers in Europe and the USA are already preparing to chip their staff. CNN Business noted that CEOs in the west are optimistic about implants on their employees. A Citrix survey reports that these implants can replace cards, keys and more to increase productivity. Respondents believe that such technologies will be widely available by 2030 and will be incorporated into the IoB.</p><p id="Par478">Intelligent VoIP systems can find keywords in conversations. There is a strong belief that it will be possible to analyse even more to gather information about one’s verbal, paraverbal and nonverbal characteristics. These feats would facilitate the management of atmosphere among employees, which is especially important for organisations in which contact hygiene is essential, such as insurance, audit and law firms. These teams are highly vulnerable to negative effects that can be caused by a single toxic or depressive behaviour of one specialist. Using IoB technology can potentially revolutionise the fashion business. It can be selected as a customised outfit for a person using this modern technology. The idea of “fashion” may then just vanish.</p><p id="Par479">New IoB technologies have the potential to revolutionise medicine. For example, during the Coronavirus pandemic, many individuals acquired a new term: saturation (the degree of oxygen saturation in the blood). This indicator is measured regularly by patients suffering from severe diseases. Wearable devices, such as smartwatches, will almost certainly learn to monitor them fast as well. The same may be said about other appliances. Subcutaneous chips, for instance, will arise that record the temperature of the human body, the quantity of sugar in the blood, the number of leukocytes in the blood and other data. Also, humanity is moving closer to the day when the patient’s medical data will be transmitted in real-time to the attending physician, regardless of where the patient is on the planet. The treatment will get more distant and objective (Sannacode | Web &amp; Mobile App Development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR397">2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Internet of Things</title><p id="Par480">The Internet of Things (IoT) connects the virtual world with real-world physical activity. The fundamental idea behind the Internet of Things is to create an independent and secure connection that allows data to be shared between physical objects and real-world applications (Chopra et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2019a</xref>). The Internet as we know it today has expanded into the real world, embracing ordinary things that characterise the IoT concept. As we know it today, the Internet has expanded into the real world, embracing ordinary devices that constitute the Internet of Things vision. The components of the IoT vision include steady improvements in information technologies, microelectronics and communication technologies that we have seen so far, as well as their potential to continue into the foreseeable future (Mattern and Floerkemeier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR295">2010</xref>). As the number of IoT applications grows, intelligent cars, smart cities, smart factories, smart homes, agriculture and energy as components of a broad IoT ecosystem are gaining greater consideration. More potential applications may be predicted by integrating similar technologies, technical methods and concepts (Vermesan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR483">2013</xref>). As a result, IoT is envisioned as an ecosystem that grows to integrate surroundings and services better to satisfy better human life expectations (Lutui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR279">2018</xref>). The growth of IoT will dramatically increase Internet traffic by connecting numerous objects to the Internet. This will eventually result in increased data storage requirements. Privacy and security problems would arise as a result of such a huge network. To fulfil all these objectives, a suitable architecture is required. Although the IoT architecture is still being developed, it already has several characteristics. Business layer, application layer, middleware layer, network layer and perception layer are the five levels that make up this architecture. Figure <xref rid="Fig69" ref-type="fig">2.69</xref> illustrates the architecture of an IoT system.<fig id="Fig69"><label>Fig. 2.69</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Architecture of IoT</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/532255_1_En_2_Fig69_HTML.png" id="MO69"><caption><p id="Par729">An illustration comprises 5 headings from top to bottom as follows.

Depending on the object’s identifying method, these sensors might be RFID tags, barcodes or infrared sensors. This layer’s primary role is to categorise things and collect information about them using sensor tools. This information on the object’s position, inclination, humidity, velocity and orientation may depend on the type of sensor. The network layer’s primary responsibility is to transfer information from the sensors to the processing unit reliably. This information can be delivered both wired and wirelessly. The middleware layer is largely in charge of managing service between IoT devices and apps. It can also communicate with the local datahub. It transfers information from the network layer to the database. This layer analyses the data and conducts computations regularly. Finally, it makes automatic judgments based on the results of the tests. Based on the object information processed in the middleware layer, the application layer offers global management of the whole program.

In other words, IoT and home automation are inextricably linked because all passive home electronics are becoming digital, wirelessly linked and capable of communicating over local networks or the Internet (Raj and Raman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR370">2017</xref>). More capable and smarter appliances are the beginning of a smarter home environment. Real-time energy usage monitoring for all smart home equipment may considerably cut energy expenditures. In terms of smart security, combinations of alarms and sensors at the range of the property may immediately notify the police or fire department and homeowners. Second, by dividing the utilisation of IoT technologies in manufacturing into two categories: manufacturing and user experience, the use of IoT in the industry can be attested. Manufacturers utilise IoT to automate operations, track machinery and determine whether machines require repair. Furthermore, IoT devices in Internet networks are utilised to collect data from customers, which improves the user experience. Then it looks through the information it has acquired to see how it might improve the outcome and possibly solve problems. Finally, IoT-enabled remote patient monitoring (RPM) might enable patients to be tracked while at home. Caregivers can perform the first-step medical check-up without considering the distance, using data of the wearables that collect data of subject’s vitals (e.g. blood pressure) (Greengard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">2015</xref>; Hassan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182">2018</xref>). Fourth, the Internet of Things (IoT) is an initiative to introduce smart city applications that use prevalent sensors in municipal infrastructures to provide real-time data (Latre et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR257">2016</xref>). To meet the needs of urbanisation, energy management, transportation, health, governance and other aspects of modern smart cities are all centred on sustainable and effective solutions (Ejaz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2017</xref>). Finally, agriculture is one of the examples of IoT applications that are worth highlighting. Farmers and producers would benefit from incorporating the Internet of Things into their operations, as well as a variety of equipment or gadgets that obtain and convey data through cloud services, because it would give them more choices to settle on, cuts costs and increase production efficiency (Namani and Gonen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR325">2020</xref>).

With the deployment of the IoT, potential opportunities for reducing resource consumption and boosting efficiency may be identified. In recent years, IoT technologies have presented an intriguing potential to develop sophisticated solutions for sensor devices, and Internet-based information systems are used to monitor and control energy consumption. With an adequate power management system, energy hotspots may be detected and energy production can be raised in real-time in proportion to their process (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par486">Chen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2018</xref>) also proposed an energy monitoring and management framework for a machining workshop. Depending on the tasks of the machinery, unused auxiliary equipment can be turned off. To improve energy efficiency, real-time energy-focused planning can be used. Moreover, by tracking power consumption frequency in real-time, effective load balancing can be used to reduce energy consumption during peak times. The Internet of Things attempts to increase energy use visibility and comprehension by including smart sensors and smart metres into the system. Consequently, data on real-time energy use from complex systems may be easily gathered and analysed to help people or home automation make more energy-conscious decisions. By acquiring vast quantities of energy-related data in near-real-time, these types of solutions generate a great deal of knowledge. As a result, it is critical to plan ahead of time how to integrate these IoT energy monitoring devices into the overall energy management system for the environment (Shrouf and Miragliotta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR425">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par487">Also, IoT is seen as a feasible technical option for tracking, evaluating and making quick decisions about infrastructure provision before it fails. A smart water management network could be imagined by integrating IoT across the whole infrastructure architecture. When IoT is fully integrated, the water tracking system becomes a smart entity capable of detecting and treating problems without the need for constant third-party monitoring (Ramakala et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR371">2017</xref>). The control application can also provide a real-time summary of the recorded data and make recommendations for corrective action (Geetha and Gouthami <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par488">Conventional approaches may be combined with cutting-edge technology like the Internet of Things and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to enable a wide range of uses in contemporary agriculture for long-term sustainable food production. New IoT technologies are addressing agricultural issues by boosting farm production efficiency, quantity, productivity and cost-effectiveness. This rapid adoption of IoT in agriculture and smart farming technologies is gaining momentum, intending to have 24/7 visibility into the health of the land and crops, equipment in use, storage conditions, animal behaviour, energy consumption and water usage rates.</p><p id="Par489">The concept of collecting and storing all relevant data, analysing it and giving meaningful outcomes enables the Internet of Things to become a significant modulator of existing urban and rural life. We might argue that robots and people would become increasingly intertwined after the first industrial revolution due to the gradual blurring of their boundaries between them (Greengard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">2015</xref>). The disappearance of these boundaries allows for the formation of greater direct or indirect ties between humans and nature. Air is a direct method to engage with the environment, and pollution is a major issue nowadays. Air quality data analysis may be used to monitor toxic gases and harmful particles such as carbon dioxide and soot generated by factories and farmlands (Patel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR351">2016</xref>). Following that, necessary measures may be implemented right away. The energy derived from nature is the most extensive sphere of human connection. Because of the massive amount of data and traditional home power networks, measuring, administering, pricing and monitoring the energy that appears in every aspect of a person’s daily life is extremely challenging. IoT appliances have the potential to occupy a large field of home appliances on their own, but in a network with a lot of data and continuous processing, the system grows wiser over time and develops its intelligence. The expansion of the Internet’s area and depth above and beyond human contact will affect people’s lives in the future (Greengard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Natural Language Processing</title><p id="Par490">Natural language processing (NLP) is a multidisciplinary field consisting of computer science, artificial intelligence (AI) and linguistics subfields. The study of NLP is concerned with computers’ capacity to apprehend words from texts or speech as well as humans. Through the combination of language modelling, computational linguistics, statistical, machine learning and deep learning models, NLP aims to enable computers to comprehensively process language, recognising the intent and sentiments of speakers or writers (IBM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR198">2020</xref>). Many languages and text-oriented studies such as translating between languages, building a database, extracting summaries or understanding text content can be performed using this technology (Allen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2003</xref>).</p><p id="Par491">The goal of NLP researchers is to learn how humans comprehend and utilise language so that suitable tools and techniques may be developed to help computers understand and modify natural languages to execute the tasks they are programmed to do (Chowdhury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2003</xref>). During NLP, the sentence’s grammatical structure and word meanings are analysed by breaking down the sentences at hand. This way ensures that the computer understands and reads both spoken and written text at the human level (Wolff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR498">2021</xref>). Only if the source text is a speech is a phonological analysis used. This analysis has to do with the internal and between word translation of tone of language, which can convey much about a word or sentence’s meaning (Banerjee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par492">If the source text is written, tokenisation is used. Simply put, tokenisation is the division of large amounts of text into smaller pieces. This process breaks down the raw text into tokens to assist in understanding the context or developing the NLP model (Chakravarthy and Nagaraj <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2020</xref>). Morphological analysis is a method that concerns the internal structure of words, often used for NLP; it refers to the process of decoding words based on their smallest meaningful units known as morphemes. Banerjee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2020</xref>) explains this process through an example phrase, namely, “unhappiness”. In his words: “It can be broken down into three morphemes (prefix, stem and suffix), with each conveying some form of meaning; the prefix un- refers to “not being”, while the suffix -ness refers to “a state of being”. The stem happy is considered as a free morpheme since it is a “word” in its own right. Bound morphemes (prefixes and suffixes) require a free morpheme to which it can be attached to and can therefore not appear as a “word” on their own”. An additional method used for NLP is lexical analysis, which refers to the process of determining and examining the structure of words through separation into smaller pieces such as paragraphs, phrases and words. A language’s lexicon is a collection of words and phrases that make it up and when working with lexical analysis, lexicon normalisation is considered to be essential. Among others, stemming and lemmatization are considered to be the most prevalent approach to lexical analysis. Stemming is a rule-based approach that regards the elimination of suffixes of a word (e.g. “ing”, “ly”, “es”, “s” and so on). Additionally, lemmatisation is a method that combines vocabulary (the prominence of terms in dictionaries) and morphological analysis and is used to define the root form of a word. Syntactical analysis refers to the investigation of words in sentences to discover the sentence’s grammatical structure. The grammatical evaluation and relative arrangement of words in sentences are used to perform syntactic analysis parsing. The semantic analysis focuses on the interconnections between word-level meanings in a phrase to find probable meanings. Some individuals feel that the step determines the meaning, but all of the stages ultimately decide the meaning. In contrast, discourse integration regards texts as a whole, examining aspects that transmit meaning by linking component phrases. For instance, sentences are linked together or dependent on prior context. This can be illustrated by the word “it” in the sentence “It wasn’t that difficult”. According to pragmatic analysis, without being encoded in the text, extra meaning is read into it. This demands a comprehensive awareness of the world that includes understanding intentions, plans and goals (Banerjee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par493">Figure <xref rid="Fig73" ref-type="fig">2.73</xref> is a sample word cloud technique that is used to visualise the result of processed text data.

It may not be difficult to imagine the usefulness of this technology in business contexts, as it was shown in multiple cases. For instance, NLP can be used in business process management (BPM) to significantly reduce the amount of effort that is required to ensure these processes work smoothly by enabling automation (van der Aa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR476">2018</xref>; Delicado et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2017</xref>). Furthermore, NLP can be used in human resources (HR) practices such as selection and recruitment. Analysing and screening applicants’ resumes, responses and various other types of data with NLP allow for more efficient, less time consuming and less biased hiring processes (Talview <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR451">2018</xref>). However, NLP is an interdisciplinary technology, and its application has a great range, as demonstrated by its success across fields. For instance, Demner-Fushman and Simpson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2012</xref>) explain that, compared to the recent past, NLP techniques, which are used to analyse immensely large amounts of text data from biomedical literature, have been greatly improved and its promising results are a source of excitement in the field of biomedicine.</p><p id="Par498">Furthermore, there has been increasing interest in NLP’s application and use for sustainability<index-term id="ITerm43"><term>Sustainabilities</term></index-term>. A recent report by Chakroun et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2019</xref>) underlines the importance of NLP in the context of sustainable development<index-term id="ITerm44"><term>Sustainable development</term></index-term>, which provides an exemplary use of NLP that contributes to the goal of reaching quality education<index-term id="ITerm45"><term>Quality education</term></index-term>. The example is of a chatbot that can successfully reproduce everything that a good teacher should do. In other words, it provides students with direction and support that is tailored for each student with the use of NLP. Another interesting application of NLP was demonstrated by analysing sustainability<index-term id="ITerm46"><term>Sustainabilities</term></index-term> reports using NLP (Luccioni et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR275">2020</xref>). Suggested by its developers, a custom model of NLP named ClimateQA was specifically designed to analyse, otherwise demanding, amounts of text from financial reports to detect segments that are of interest to climate change.</p><p id="Par499">Additionally, NLP has found use in sustainable, responsible and impact investing (SRI), which emphasises the sustainability<index-term id="ITerm47"><term>Sustainabilities</term></index-term> of organisations in three main categories called ESGs. Letter E stands for environmental factors such as carbon emissions, S stands for social indicators such as diversity and G stands for corporate governance factors such as bribery and corruption policies (Mukherjee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR320">2020</xref>). These elements indicate the overall sustainability<index-term id="ITerm48"><term>Sustainabilities</term></index-term> of a given organisation, and plenty of research indicates that there is a strong and significant relation between ESG’s and financial performance (Morgan Stanley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR537">2021</xref>; Whelan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR492">2020</xref>; O’Brien et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR331">2018</xref>). To assess the sustainability<index-term id="ITerm49"><term>Sustainabilities</term></index-term> of organisations, a considerably large amount of data from sustainability<index-term id="ITerm50"><term>Sustainabilities</term></index-term> reports and articles has to be examined. This is where the use of NLP is highly efficient as it can analyse immensely large amounts of text data both from existing and live sources, mining for ESG related insights. NLP addresses various challenges of SRI by producing results significantly easier for interpretation, eliminates human error and the feat of including the most recent changes makes for a better, more efficient and up to date approach to SRI (Mukherjee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR320">2020</xref>). Applications of NLP include, but are not limited to, the aforementioned examples across numerous fields such as biomedicine, psychology, business, finance and economics, all underline its usefulness and effectiveness in the automation of analytic processes.</p><p id="Par500">NLP is a challenging problem of AI today. The biggest reason for this difficulty is that human language always contains semantic breadth and uncertainty. In studies conducted in this context, difficulties are usually encountered at the lexical and structural levels (Jusoh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR224">2018</xref>). However, the increase in the amount of text data available every day and the potential to be used in other applications will make this technology even more important. Large volumes of unstructured, text-heavy data must be analysed efficiently by businesses. A great majority of the data created online and stored in databases is made up of natural human language. Until recently, businesses have not been able to utilise it properly. However, NLP can assist them in making efficient use of the largest available data (Lutkevich <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR278">2021</xref>). The mere fact that NLP is used even in the digital marketing industry is an indication that this technology will take a more important place in our lives (Lee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR260">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par501">One of the greatest challenges to NLP stands to be code-mixed language, which refers to altered forms of language possibly unique to certain locations such as urban areas (Markets and Markets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR291">2021</xref>). This limits the accuracy and efficiency of NLP processes with possible changes to normal meanings of sentences; thus, its application among various fields is also limited.</p><p id="Par502">There has been a growing interest in automation and the facilitation of hiring processes among organisations and researchers. Personality is one of the most significant indicators, even more so than cognitive ability, of many work-related outcomes such as job performance, as established by a growing body of research (Barrick et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2001</xref>; Judge et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR222">2013</xref>; Chiaburu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2011</xref>; Salgado 2002). NLP methods have a highly promising future in its application to assess personality through numerous types of data, which can come from various sources such as job interviews, resumes and more, which in turn can be used to predict important job-related outcomes (Campion et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR538">2016</xref>; Andrew <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2021</xref>; Hickman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR187">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par503">Finally, regarding its financial future, there is a great expectancy of exponential growth in the market of NLP.

Additionally, the costs of commercial NLP solutions are considered to be high and may not be very tempting for smaller businesses and instead appeal to advanced programmers (Nadkarni et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR323">2011</xref>). However, costs are expected to decrease in the future due to the increase in demand.

The first question in this technology began when Feynman asked, “What kind of computer are we going to use to simulate physics?” He saw that classical computers are impossible to simulate the physical world. Because of the simulating time, the computers were not making a simulation. They were making only imitations. He asked at this point “Is there a way of simulating it, rather than imitating it?” in the space-time view. The answer to his question is superposition and entanglement in twenty-first-century technology, although this was unknown when Feynman was considering these questions. Therefore, nowadays, these questions give rise to the starting steps of quantum computing. It is understood that quantum mechanics can simulate the physical world with quantum machines (Feynman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">1982</xref>). A “bit” is formed in classical computers to process and transfer data. It can be either “1” or “0”. Bit 1 corresponds to an electrical signal in the wire, whereas bit 0 does not correspond to any electrical signal. In quantum computing, characteristics of quantum mechanics are utilised in expressing and processing the information as quantum bits. Quantum bits are so small that they work with the physical properties of atomic particles like classical bits. Although quantum bits, aka qubits, are similar to classical bits, there is a major difference: qubits can be in both 1 and 0 positions at the same time. The calculation process, which is also called “superposition”, also measures all possibilities, namely, positions, according to the size of the problem. Graphical representation of the bits and qubits can be seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig75" ref-type="fig">2.75</xref>.<fig id="Fig75"><label>Fig. 2.75</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Comparison of classical bits and quantum bits</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/532255_1_En_2_Fig75_HTML.png" id="MO75"><caption><p id="Par735">Two illustrations with 2 headings. Under classic computing, 2 circles are labeled 0 and 1 with a text that reads bits are stored either as a 1 or 0.

Inside the circle, there are 3 shaded circles with a text that reads qubits can be stored anywhere.</p></caption></graphic></fig></p><p id="Par505">While analysing the probabilities of a problem simultaneously, it chooses the correct answer according to some mathematical operators. Thus, quantum computers are designed to solve the problems prepared for them in seconds. This makes the computation process much faster because 0 and 1 are not to be performed separately (Hughes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR193">2021</xref>). Figure <xref rid="Fig76" ref-type="fig">2.76</xref> shows the comparison clearly. According to this, classical computational approaches, algorithms run on quantum computers can even reach exponential speedups. A quantum computer can operate at a cost that scales polynomially while operating on an exponentially large computational space thanks to certain features of quantum physics. Hence, quantum computing algorithms have the potential to make hard and time-consuming problems yielding and quickly solvable (Martonosi and Roetteler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR293">2019</xref>).<fig id="Fig76"><label>Fig. 2.76</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Comparison between classical and quantum computers</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/532255_1_En_2_Fig76_HTML.png" id="MO76"><caption><p id="Par736">An illustration of a comparison between classical and quantum computers.

As Feynman argues, it is often difficult for scientists to understand and simulate these materials because of the number of parameters needed to characterise a many-particle quantum system. It is mentioned before this part, a quantum computer can be used as a quantum simulator to simulate quantum systems way more efficiently than a classical computer (Eisert and Wolf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">2013</xref>). According to Moore’s famous law, the number of transistors located per square inch of an integrated circuit increases exponentially year by year (Moore <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR314">1998</xref>). If this trend somehow keeps continuing, the quantum effects will dominate in the computer components which are at the atomic scale (Eisert and Wolf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">2013</xref>).

It is assumed that quantum computing technology can be utilised to surmount vast amounts of data to yield better scalability and performance in machine learning algorithms (Perdomo-Ortiz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR353">2018</xref>). Since quantum computing offers reduced computational time, it may cause many applications of classical computing to evolve quantum computing applications. Robots that are used in drug discovery, logistics, cryptography and finance need to deal with large amounts of data. This creates a necessity for faster computation; as a result, quantum computing can be utilised to perform intensive computational tasks with less time required compared to the required time of classical computing (Buyya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2018</xref>). In robotics, solving the problems related to kinematics, such as mechanical movement or unexpected behaviours against a command is challenging. It is expected that quantum neural networks or the other quantum computing algorithms will be able to handle these problems (Gill et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">2020</xref>). Quantum computing is also expected to be useful in weather forecasting in the future. The computational power of the supercomputers that are used today is limited for some applications such as flood forecasting, urban modelling, sub-surface flow modelling and allied complex tasks. So, quantum computing algorithms can be adapted to solve such problems and achieve better Earth system models in the future (Frolov <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">2017</xref>). Quantum computing in the future in biochemistry and nanotechnology is expected to play an active role.

Secondly, products should be used in other possible means even after they complete their lifetime. After all this, recycling is a necessity.

Closed-loop recycling, in which the product produced from the material obtained as a result of the recycling of the EoL product, is the same. The utilisation of recovered resources to create a new product is referred to as open-loop recycling. This results in either open-loop upcycling, which refers to the conversion of waste materials into something of more value and/or durability, or open-loop downcycling, in which the quality and usefulness of the resource is decreased or the capture of the material for future use (Dorn and MacWhirter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par520">In Fig. <xref rid="Fig80" ref-type="fig">2.80</xref>, the recycling process is separated into two main stages:<fig id="Fig80"><label>Fig. 2.80</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>General recycling stages.

The ability to move these methods works favouring them to get installed near precast concrete manufacture facilities or directly into the area of demolishment. Generally, the important features of these methods have been increasing the greenhouse gases (like CO<sub>2</sub> and NOx) produced by transportation, helping to conserve the resources and utilise the sources more efficiently.

High-speed steel objects could have cobalt in them, which is a highly valued alloy, and one could come across them in nearly every hardware shop, for instance, in gimlets or milling tools. LIBS is a method that can be used to differentiate at least 20 alloying metal types in tiny metal objects rapidly, automated and deprived of contact (“Laser-based sensor technology for recycling metals” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR256">2021</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par530">Plastics: Today’s technology like incineration, pyrolysis and mechanical recycling are technologies with high costs and not adequate in environmental and economic terms. The solution for this issue is collecting and processing plastic waste and producing more valuable outputs much more affordable and desirable. The new method is named low-pressure hydrothermal processing. It offers a process to make gasoline, diesel fuel and other valued matters out of the most frequent type of plastic, polyolefin, securely in the environmental and economic regards. A newly developed alteration method works on the combination of hydrothermal liquefaction with effective departure. When the alteration of plastics into oil or naphtha happens, it is proper to work as a reserve for different synthetics or to be torn into monomers, different types of solvents or various outputs (“pulp and paper mill waste becomes fish feed, energy and more” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR363">2019</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par531">Textiles: Recycling and recovering old textiles and waste fibre materials through various procedures result in recycled textiles.

Cobalt, graphite and lithium, which are all considered essential minerals, are used in Li-ion batteries. Critical minerals are raw resources that are economically and strategically vital to the USA, with a high risk of supply disruption and no viable replacements. We lose these important resources when these batteries are thrown away in the garbage (US EPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR472">2019</xref>).</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par535">The massive population growth in recent decades and the desire for people to embrace better living circumstances have resulted in a huge increase in polymer consumption, mainly plastics. The continued use of plastics has resulted in a rise in the number of plastics ending up in the waste stream, sparking a surge of interest in plastics recycling and reuse (Francis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par536">The effect on the economy is explained through the plastics industry. The progress of the plastics sector reflected the so-called linear economy model, which emphasised the beneficial life of plastic items. This was true until the last decades. Growing environmental recognition at social and legislative levels has aided the adoption of the worldwide circular economy model (CEM) in the plastic sector in recent years. This model proposes that the plastic waste created after its useful life be recycled effectively and efficiently (Guran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par537">There are several advantages of recycling for an individual. First of all, recycling can reduce pollution. It can reduce the demand for new resources by recycling materials. This process may minimise the number of pollutants generated when creating new materials by using recycling methods. Secondly, it leads to lower costs. Recycling has an environmental as well as a financial point for companies. Working with recycled material is substantially less expensive than working with brand new material. For this reason, firms may save money by employing recycled materials. On the other hand, recycling is related to saving energy; since recycling materials saves a lot of energy compared to making new ones. With the increasing environmental awareness, it is beneficial for businesses to be seen as sensitive to the environment (“Advantages of recycling” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2021</xref>). These advantages are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig81" ref-type="fig">2.81</xref>.<fig id="Fig81"><label>Fig. 2.81</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Advantages of recycling</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/532255_1_En_2_Fig81_HTML.png" id="MO81"><caption><p id="Par741">An illustration with the heading is the advantages of recycling.

Through recycling, in most cases, these incinerated wastes are recycled to combat global warming and air pollution. On the other hand, landfills and incineration sites have a very harmful effect on the environment that surrounds them. These sites can cause irreparable damage to animals’ habitats. Through recycling, the need for these harmful landfills can be reduced by decreasing the amount of waste sent to them. In this way, especially animals in danger of extinction are protected. Moreover, recycling offers us a more environmentally friendly alternative to extracting raw materials from the soil. This helps conserve resources. So, recycling can help protect the world’s natural resources for future generations (“Advantages of recycling” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par539">Every year, humanity produces 2 billion metric tonnes of trash. According to global waste statistics, waste production would increase by 70% to 3.1 billion by 2050 if the current trend continues (Kaza et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR230">2018</xref>). Also, the immensely increasing world population may speed up this period. Therefore, the 3Rs (reduce, reuse and recycle) have a significant role in preventing this problem and preserving the environment and natural sources. The success of the 3R implementation depends on the balance between the programs and policies at the local level. The essential points of action relate to governance issues, education and the awareness level of people and critical stakeholders. Other than these, technological issues significantly affect that action to minimise the environmental impact while using technologies in the recycling step (Srinivas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR442">2015</xref>). Automation will have a considerable impact on the recycling industry. In the coming decades, substantial developments may be expected to provide identification and separation processes more carefully than humans. Indeed, 62.6% of jobs in the waste management sector will become automated by 2030, according to a study conducted by PwC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR366">2017</xref>). The recycling process will become much more effective and safer with advances in robot and automation technologies because fewer items are directed towards the landfill, and fewer people are exposed to hazardous waste items (“The Future of Recycling Services 2021). In terms of economy, the circular economy concept has grown in popularity, and it only takes a little effort to put it into practice. As manufacturers and recycling efforts collaborate and achieve critical mass, the future of recycling will see a rise in circular products. Once they are accomplished, they may become standard, with 100% closed-loop recycling systems assuring that recovered components are utilised in products of equivalent value to the original. Additionally, the future of the recycling sector depends on reducing the amount of the different substances recycled together and improving the quality of the raw materials obtained by the recycling process. One aspect of this future vision is standardising materials across products, which effectively reduces and redefines what we define as waste (“The Future of Recycling – Looking to 2020 and Beyond” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR455">2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Robotic Process Automation</title><p id="Par540">The most important debate in business and information systems engineering is which jobs will be done by humans and which jobs will be done by automation. This argument has become more critical as data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence have become widely used (van der Aalst et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR477">2018</xref>). These technologies have shaped the structure of robotic process automation (RPA) solutions (Lamberton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR254">2017</xref>).

So, a systematic approach is necessary to analyse the business model<index-term id="ITerm53"><term>Business models</term></index-term> for RPA, and this approach consists of at least three main steps: proof of concept, pilot and leveraging. Firstly, the goal of an RPA is installation and identifying potential use cases<index-term id="ITerm54"><term>Use cases</term></index-term> inside the organisation. End-to-end processes and details are examined to find use cases<index-term id="ITerm55"><term>Use cases</term></index-term>. Depending on the process, it is seen for which parts of the process RPA can be a solution. At this stage, RPA use cases<index-term id="ITerm56"><term>Use cases</term></index-term> are established during the pilot phase. Procedures and technical requirements are completed. To ensure data flow, all necessary data must be in electronic form and missing data must be entered to ensure that the data is available. Also, the standardisation of data is essential. Lastly, the RPA system is tested at the leveraging stage. RPA is adjusted according to the tasks to be done. Once the procedures for usage and RPA have been determined, the RPA is then expected to be ready for use (Alberth and Mattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2017</xref>).

To fulfil the need for sustenance for this blooming number of people, the food products should be up to 110% more (Okemwa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR335">2015</xref>). This increasing number of the population needs an efficient solution to manage their needs. Soilless farming methods like hydroponics could be a proper suggestion regarding this problem. Soilless farming can be explained as a way of breeding plants by using water to nourish the roots while using different mediums than soil. The plant’s needed nutrients are fused into a water solution in proper density, called a “nutrient solution” (Oyeniyi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR341">2018</xref>). The goal is to create an environment where the plant can grow properly without soil as a growing medium. When using farming methods such as hydroponics, the process is, simply put, making the plant meet the nutrients it needs by carrying them to the roots as a water solution containing the needed oxygen and nutrients (“Soilless Agriculture” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR438">2021</xref>).

The roots are dangled 6–18 inches into the nutrient water, which contains dense oxygen levels, to the time of harvesting. The deep water culture contains a large amount of water to balance inconsistencies in the saturation of the solution.

The nutrient film technique is focused on circulating the nutrient solution plants need to their roots through some routes such as pipes. The solution is contained in a tank, and through a pump, it is sent to pipes or watering equipment, and it turns back to the tank, constantly circulating (Elkazzaz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">2017</xref>). For this technique, a level slope must be prepared, immune from depressions that could allow deep pools of the non-rotating solution to collect within a channel and multiple methods are utilised to achieve this (Spensley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR440">1978</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="FPar22"><title>Aquaponics</title><p id="Par600">Aquaponics is a mutual system of plants and fish and their environments.

For aquaculture, the waste of the water animals should be expelled from the environment since the excrement is harmful to the animals due to the ammonia it contains. The aquaponics create a configuration where the water is purified by the organisms living in the roots of the plants, which are in the hydroponics, nitrifying the waste coming from the aquaponics systems and turning the waste into nutrients the plant can benefit from, therefore cleaning the water and circulating it back (Elkazzaz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="FPar23"><title>Aeroponics</title><p id="Par601">Aeroponics systems work by sending nutrients to the plant by spraying a mist of nutrient water to their roots.

In aeroponics systems, the plants’ roots are left dangling inside a cover where a powerful pump mists the nutrient solution and diffuses the solution to the entire root.

Vertical and smart farming can be used with soilless farming techniques. Firstly, vertical farming is one of the suitable configuration options when working with hydroponic systems. Vertical farming is the method of producing crops via a configuration that is multiple layered and controllable with being inside of the buildings where every aspect affecting the improvement of the plant-like saturation of carbon dioxide, amount of illumination, levels of heat and nutrition are under close control to get yields with great qualities and quantities for the entire year without being related on the sun for illumination and different outside obstacles (“Vertical Farming” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR484">2020</xref>).

They can engage with the virtual world via traditional input devices like a keyboard and mouse or multimodal equipment like a wired glove, omnidirectional treadmill and/or a Polhemus boom arm (Halarnkar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179">2012</xref>). There is no little screen with symbols to manipulate nor are there any commands to input to make the computer do something (Zheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR518">1998</xref>).</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par624">Based on the definitions above, it is reasonable to conclude that certain factors define the quality of any VR system. The three (3) characteristics referred to as the 3 “I” or triangle will be the subject of this review. Immersion, interaction and imagination, or presence, refer to the feeling of being involved in or a part of a computer-generated environment. This is due to the system’s stimulation of the human senses (haptic, aural, visual, smell etc.). Interaction is a way of talking to the system, although unlike traditional human-computer interaction (HCI), which employs 1–2 dimensional (1D, 2D) means such as a keyboard, mouse or the keypad, VR interaction is commonly done using three dimensional (3D) means such as a head-mounted device (HMD) or a space ball. VR interaction systems have some characteristics, including effectiveness, real-time responsiveness and human engagement. The system designer’s imagination might be thought of as a strategy for achieving a certain goal. VR systems are used broadly for solving complicated problems in a variety of sectors. Their effectiveness as a more efficient way of communicating concepts than traditional 2D drawings or text explanations cannot be denied (Bamodu and Ye <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2013</xref>). Virtual reality is divided into three levels:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par625"><italic>Non-immersive</italic></p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par626">This level is typically encountered on a desktop computer, where the virtual environment is created without the need for any certain hardware or processes. It has the potential to be used for training reasons. Almost any event may be reproduced if the necessary technology is present, which eliminates any potential threats. Pilots can use flight simulators to experience and prepare for circumstances that are either impossible or too dangerous and expensive to replicate in real-world training. The illusion of immersion is created by the user’s ability to interact with responsive computer-generated characters and behaviours (Halarnkar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179">2012</xref>).<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par627"><italic>Sensory-immersive (semi-immersive)</italic></p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par628">In this method, real-world modelling is crucial in a variety of virtual reality applications, including robot navigation, building modelling and flight simulation. The user can navigate a visual depiction of himself within the virtual world. As an example, the CAVE is a 10’x10’x9’ cube in which the user is surrounded by projected pictures, giving the impression of being completely immersed in the virtual environment (Halarnkar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179">2012</xref>).<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par629"><italic>Neural-direct (fully immersive)</italic></p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par630">The most significant concept in virtual reality, as well as the ultimate aim, is neural-direct. Immersion into a world in which the human brain is directly linked to a database as well as the viewer’s present position and orientation is the goal of this sort of virtual reality. It fully ignores the equipment and physical senses in favour of immediately transferring a sensory input (Halarnkar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179">2012</xref>).<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par631"><italic>Augmented reality (AR)</italic> is defined as a real-time, indirect or direct view of a physical, real-world environment that has been enhanced by the addition of virtual computer-generated information (Carmigniani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2011</xref>). Augmented reality (AR) is a broad term that encompasses a variety of technologies that display computer-generated content such as text, pictures and video onto users’ perceptions of the actual environment. Academics first described AR in terms of particular enabling equipment, such as head-mounted displays (HMDs). However, claiming that such definitions were too basic for a changing and increasing industry, three criteria may be used to define AR experience: (a) a combination of real-world and virtual components, (b) that are interactive in real-time and (c) that are registered in three dimensions (3D) (Yuen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR513">2011</xref>). There are many different types of augmented reality, but they all share a few things in common: screens, graphical interfaces, trackers and processors. There has to be a way for users to comprehend both real situations and the digital format provided information, a pointing instrument (e.g. a mobile device), a way to guarantee that the digital information is properly coordinated with what the consumer is currently seeing in real-time, and software program to handle the display. Creating applications determines how these elements are assembled and then used (Berryman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2012</xref>).</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par632">The possibilities for spatial computing technology are endless: simulation of surgical procedures, archaeology with site reconstructions, virtual museum tours, architecture, phobia treatment, training with simulators and many sorts of learning. The importance of virtual reality in education and learning derives from its potential to improve and support learning, boost memory capacity and make better judgments while working in a fun and engaging setting. When we read textual material (such as a printed document), our brain participates in an interpretation process, which increases our cognitive efforts. Understanding gets clearer while utilising virtual reality since there are fewer symbols to comprehend. For example, picturing the process rather than reading a verbal description makes it simpler to understand how a machine performs. With further VR technology, it becomes much easier to visualise. Virtual reality-based learning has been shown to improve both test performance and boost learners’ level of attention by 100% (Elmqaddem 2019). Virtual reality (VR) is a cutting-edge teaching method for medical professionals. It can be utilised to provide adequate medical communication for a variety of conditions. It is often used to identify and investigate bone structure in orthopaedics. Medical students are now able to perform surgery virtually by step-by-step learning. Furthermore, VR is beneficial in the treatment of cancer patients. The patient’s chemotherapy is carried out easily with high precision. By using a VR headset, one may view the patient’s body and parts from various angles. On the patient’s side, when they wear VR glasses, this technology boosts their confidence by reducing their apprehension since it gives more realistic information. This technique allows a cardiac surgeon to monitor a patient’s heartbeat and changes in rhythm (Javaid and Haleem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR213">2020</xref>). AR may be utilised to present a real-world battlefield environment and augment it with annotation data for military applications. Liteye, a firm, studied and developed certain HMDs for military use. A hybrid optical and inertial tracker with tiny MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical systems) sensors was created for cockpit helmet tracking. The use of AR for military training planning in urban terrain is effective. Arcane, a company, created an AR approach for displaying an animated terrain that may be utilised for military intervention planning. The National Research Council of Canada’s Institute for Aerospace Research (NRC-IAR) developed the helicopter night vision system using AR technology to extend the effective range of helicopters and improve pilots’ capability to control inclement weather. Practising in massive battle situations and replicating real-time enemy action, as in the battlefield augmented reality system (BARS), may provide additional benefits particular to military users. The BARS system also includes tools for authoring new 3D information into the environment, which other system users may see (Mekni and Lemieux <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR302">2014</xref>). Application areas of spatial computing can be seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig90" ref-type="fig">2.90</xref>.<fig id="Fig90"><label>Fig. 2.90</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Application areas of spatial computing</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/532255_1_En_2_Fig90_HTML.png" id="MO90"><caption><p id="Par750">An illustration comprises a hexagon in the center labeled fields of spatial computing.

A mobile system can be defined as a system that allows the user to move around without being restricted to a single room, and therefore allows users to move using a wireless connection. Static systems cannot be relocated, and users must utilise them anywhere they are established, with any ability to move unless they are moving the entire system configuration. The sort of system to be developed is the first decision that programmers must consider since it will guide them in selecting the tracking system, display option and potentially interface to employ. For example, installed systems will not employ GPS tracking, but exterior mobility systems will (Carmigniani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2011</xref>). Extending reality, which might be called the future technology platform, has altered the way we work, learn, engage and amuse by integrating the physical and digital worlds.

MR is a concept that is occasionally defined variably, and based on its meaning, it might include or exclude specific VR or AR implementations. As a result, the concept of “extended reality” has lately gained popularity as a catch-all word for AR, VR and MR. The terms VR and AR are used to refer to gadgets that fully block the user’s sight of the actual world and XR to relate to devices that allow users to see both the real and digital worlds.

Users may mentally immerse themselves in the simulated 3D environment and experience the sense of “being physically there”, thanks to VR’s capacity to mimic detailed real-life scenarios. As a result, virtual reality (VR) has been dubbed integrated virtual multimedia that produces a 3D, virtual imagined and interactive entertainment environment that a person perceives as being in the actual world (Chuah <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2018</xref>). Whereas virtual reality innovation<index-term id="ITerm60"><term>Innovations</term></index-term>, or virtual environment as Milgram refers to it, totally immerses consumers in an artificial world without allowing them to see the reality. Augmented reality (AR) technology enhances the perception of reality by overlaying digital environments and cues onto the physical world in real-time (Carmigniani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2011</xref>). The goal of AR is to make the person’s life easier by introducing virtual knowledge not just to his surrounding environment but also to any indirect view of the physical environment, such as a video broadcast. The person’s perspective of and connection with the physical environment is improved through augmented reality (Carmigniani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2011</xref>). As a result, people engage with real-time virtual 3D items seamlessly and intuitively, seeing them as realistic and learning to comprehend, analyse and connect with the items (Halarnkar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179">2012</xref>).</p><p id="Par637">VR is a technology that draws inspiration from a wide range of areas. However, it is distinguished by a close relationship between human aspects and assisting technology as a discipline. Hardware, programming, human aspects and transmitting VR via the Internet are the most pressing issues (Zheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR518">1998</xref>). Today, AR is everywhere in our daily life. The wide usage of AR has become feasible due to the low cost of smartphones and other technology designed to process and present data at high rates. In addition, experts anticipate that the advancement of portable devices that can deliver augmented reality content and experiences will keep accelerating. As the technologies that enable AR to continue to improve, research and development on how AR may be used in education will keep on improving simultaneously (Yuen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR513">2011</xref>). In the upcoming years, spatial computing offers a wide range of ground-breaking abilities; for instance, instead of focusing on the shortest path or the travel time, companies have come up with eco-routing, which involves determining paths that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. UPS saves over 3 million gallons of gasoline each year by using smart sequencing, which avoids left turns. When customers and owners offer eco-routing options, such savings can be increased substantially (Shekhar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR421">2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Wireless Power Transfer</title><p id="Par638">Wireless power transfer (WPT) is currently one of the trendiest subjects in research, and it is getting a lot of attention. WPT has already made great progress in the field of charging mobile devices or charging electric vehicles, and in the future decades, the WPT sector is anticipated to develop steadily (Rim <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR382">2018</xref>). WPT is the transferal of electrical energy without the need for cables based on electric, magnetic or electromagnetic fields that change over time (Georgios and Evangelos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">2019</xref>). The notion of WPT is based on Faraday’s law of induction, which is well-known among engineers. According to this rule, alternating current (AC) generations are caused by the changing magnetic field (Würth Elektronik <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR502">2021</xref>). There have been a lot of fascinating initiatives in the history of WPT. Even though the inherent complexity of this technology prevented it from being commercialised, the improvements deserve consideration and are worth investigating.

The term “near-field WPT” refers to when the antenna is located close to the transmitter. On the other hand, if the transmitter and the antenna are further or far apart, this is referred to as “far-field WPT”.</p><p id="Par640">An inductive and a capacitive, also known as primary and secondary respectively, coils are used in close distance technology. These coils have been known as Tesla coils since Nikola Tesla invented them in the early 1890s. They can be used to transfer power between themselves by employing the transformer principle. That is electromagnetic induction, electric power through spark-excited ratio frequency resonant frequency. The alteration of the magnetic field and the passage of a current that oscillates through the primary coil conducts the secondary coil. The primary coil carries a magnetic flux around it, produced by the oscillating current it possesses. Because these coils are looped around the secondary coil, a voltage is induced in the secondary coil. The largest distance that may be covered by this way of delivering electricity via electromagnetic induction is 5 cm. This is since, as the distance between primary and secondary coils increase, the loss of magnetic flux exponentially increases, resulting in a significant power loss.</p><p id="Par641">Long-distance technologies, sometimes known as radioactive technologies, are utilised to achieve long-range wireless uses with distances of several kilometres range. Microwaves and lasers are the most common technologies for long-range communication. The wavelength steers the transmitter in the receiver’s direction, while diffraction limit is employed in radio frequency design, allowing this application to be free of electromagnetic radiation dangers and achieve nearly fully efficient transmission. Several methods of WPT technology are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig93" ref-type="fig">2.93</xref> (Lokesh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR273">2020</xref>).<fig id="Fig93"><label>Fig. 2.93</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic of different methods of WPT.

To begin with, it has the potential to replace existing charging methods. Instead of using a power cord to charge a phone or laptop, wireless power may be applied in the house, allowing computers or smartphones to charge constantly and wirelessly. Another application of WPT is the charging of electric vehicles (EVs). Chargers for EVs are among the higher-level uses. As EVs grow increasingly common on the road, fixed and even mobile WPT devices can improve the viability of driving one (Mehrotra <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR301">2014</xref>). Implantable medical devices are also among the usage areas of WPT. These devices have a very low power demand and thus can be powered by WPT to substantially increase the operation time in vivo (a medical procedure that is done on a living organism), improve the accuracy of diagnosis and therapy, minimise the rate of misdiagnosis and achieve permanent operation in vivo, all while improving patient comfort. WPT can also be used in industrial environments where it is impossible to use wire for power transmission, such as underwater and chemical areas (Wang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR486">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par643">Even though the notion of wireless power transmission has been around for over a century, it is regaining popularity in the twenty-first century as a result of the widespread use of smartphones and other mobile devices (Allied Components International <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2019</xref>). The widespread use of WPT has the potential to bring many benefits. Such as the ability to decrease or eliminate the usage of wires and batteries. Therefore, reducing the use of copper- and aluminium-based electric cable (Sumi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR444">2018</xref>). In addition, thanks to WPT, the use of elements used in battery technology is reduced. Until recently, charging difficulties have made EVs less appealing to consumers, despite several government incentive programs. However, charging becomes the simplest process by wirelessly transmitting energy to the EV. Furthermore, projections indicate that the battery capacity of EVs equipped with WPT could be reduced to 20% or less compared to those without WPTs (Li and Mi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR266">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par644">WPT eliminates the need for power ports, which solves significant problems of conventional charging methods such as mating cycles, deterioration of connection points, thus greatly contributing to device longevity. Additionally, removing power docks and ports allows manufacturers to design completely sealed devices, advancing water-resistant to waterproof, thus increasing durability and longevity (Würth Elektronik <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR502">2021</xref>).
