As one of the new and most promising alternative energy storage technologies, zinc-ion rechargeable batteries have recently received much attention owing to their high abundance of zinc in natural resources, intrinsic safety, and cost effectiveness, when compared with the popular, but unsafe and expensive lithium-ion batteries. In particular, the use of mild aqueous electrolytes in zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) demonstrates high potential for portable electronic applications and large-scale energy storage systems. Moreover, the development of superior electrolyte operating at either high temperature or subzero condition is crucial for practical applications of ZIBs in harsh environments, such as aerospace, airplanes, or submarines. However, there are still many existing challenges that need to be resolved. This paper presents a timely review on recent progresses and challenges in various cathode materials and electrolytes (aqueous, organic, and solid-state electrolytes) in ZIBs. Design and synthesis of zinc-based anode materials and separators are also briefly discussed.<fig id="Figa" position="anchor"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40820_2019_322_Figa_HTML.png" position="anchor" id="MO1"/></fig></p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Zinc-ion batteries</kwd><kwd>Electrolyte</kwd><kwd>Cathode</kwd><kwd>Zinc anode</kwd><kwd>Flexible device</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>104</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>10</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>9</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/40820_2019_Article_322.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>ReviewPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Nanotechnology and Microengineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Nanotechnology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Nanoscale Science and Technology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec2"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par4">Energy crisis and environmental pollution have become two of the most serious issues in the present time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. For hundreds of years, fossil fuels (petroleum, coal, etc.) have dominated the energy supply for the needs of humanity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, usage of fossil fuels can lead to numerous environmental issues, especially air pollution, which is caused by the emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, and other gases containing volatile organic compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Meanwhile, the development of environment-friendly energy sources such as solar cell and wind electricity is seriously restrained by their intermittent production and inability for storing energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. To overcome the above-mentioned challenges, electrical energy storage (EES) offers an effective way to improve the reliability and scalability of the grid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In recent years, much progress has been made by developing new energy technologies, especially rechargeable batteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Since the first secondary cell (lead–acid battery) was invented about 150 years ago, numerous kinds of rechargeable batteries have been designed, such as nickel zinc battery, nickel metal hydride, and lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. For several decades, lithium-ion batteries have been widely applied as commercial energy storage devices owing to their advantages of high efficiency in delivering energy, high voltage, and long cycling life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, many issues such as high cost and safety problems seriously hinder the large-scale applications of lithium-ion batteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In recent years, a lot of research work focused on aqueous rechargeable batteries using naturally abundant monovalent ions (Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>) and multivalent cations (Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Al<sup>3+</sup>) as charge carriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) are very appealing owing to the unique properties of zinc anode, including the low cost, rich resources of zinc metals, high chemical/physical stability, environmental friendliness, and high safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">A typical ZIB consists of a cathode for hosting Zn ions, zinc metal anode, electrolyte, and a separator to separate cathode and anode, which is quite similar to the structure of a LIB. Zinc ions are moving between cathode and anode during charging and discharging processes. Since Volta et al. used zinc metal as electrode in battery in 1999 for the first time, Zn metal has been deemed as an ideal anode material in types of primary and secondary Zn cells due to many excellent properties, especially high capacity of Zn metal anode, nontoxicity, relatively low redox potential (− 0.76 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)), high safety, and low cost. Therefore, such Zn metal has been applied in various batteries, such as Ni–Zn batteries, MnO<sub>2</sub>–Zn batteries, Zn-ion batteries, and Zn–air batteries. Among them, Zn–MnO<sub>2</sub> batteries are dominant as primary batteries owing to the properties of low cost and high energy density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Later effort further expands the alkaline Zn–MnO<sub>2</sub> batteries to secondary battery field, while, as electrode in rechargeable batteries, the continuous formation of zinc dendrite in zinc metal and the irreversible reaction lead to limited cycling life and low discharge capacity. Several decades ago, Yamamoto et al. first designed aqueous zinc-ion batteries by replacing the alkaline electrolyte with aqueous mild acid zinc sulfate electrolyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Unlike the case in alkaline Zn–MnO<sub>2</sub> batteries, the formation of by-products (ZnO, Zn (OH)<sub>2,</sub> etc.) on zinc metal is very few. Also, compared with Mg metal, another advantage of zinc metal is that zinc can be dissolved more easily in electrolyte and deposited more easily on metal anode. In recent years, a lot of research work has been focused on both zinc metal anode and cathode materials, especially manganese-based oxides, vanadium-based oxides, polyanion compounds, sustainable quinone analogs, and Prussian blue analogs. This research work has made significant progress on the development of ZIBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Furthermore, the rapid development of various wearable electronic devices keeps promoting the exploration on portable energy storage devices with superior electrochemical performance and desirable mechanical flexibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. As a promising candidate, rechargeable solid-state zinc-ion storage systems also have increasingly attracted research interests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. It should be noted that safety problem requires serious consideration in the wearable and flexible devices while they maintain high energy storage capabilities, because these electronics may undergo continuous mechanical force or damage such as strike or being bended, and directly in contact with human body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. In comparison with liquid electrolytes, solid-state electrolytes show a noticeable advantage for avoiding the electrolyte leakage. Furthermore, solid-state electrolytes show high stability, desirable flexibility, and can effectively control the formation of zinc dendrite and the dissolution of active electrode materials in zinc-ion storage systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. To date, electrolytes based on zinc sulfate (ZnSO<sub>4</sub>) and zinc triflate (Zn(CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) in conjunction with polymer hosts such as ZnSO<sub>4</sub>–gelatin, Zn(CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>–polyethylene oxide, and Zn(CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>–polyvinyl alcohol have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. However, these polymer electrolytes suffer from insufficient mechanical strength, undesirable ionic conductivity, and fast degradation. By employing these electrolytes, the batteries display relatively narrow voltage window and undesirable cycling stability, posing challenges for the gel electrolyte selection and preparation method. Additionally, an intrinsically self-healable ZIB is proposed by the utilization of hydrogel electrolyte, in order to effectively enhance the recoverability of the devices against various shape deformations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. More importantly, the exploration of desirable solid-state electrolytes with a wide working range from subzero to high temperature is still lacking and researchers need to put more efforts to promote its development, which can boost the practical applications of flexible ZIBs used in airplanes, aerospace, or ocean vehicles. Consequently, the careful design on the suitable solid-state electrolytes with high stability, excellent zinc-ion conductivity, superior mechanical properties, and easy fabrication is highly required for the further development of flexible and safe rechargeable zinc-ion based energy storage devices, which could effectively prevent electrolyte leakage issue and achieve industrial production of batteries with desirable structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Recently, Fan et al. have analyzed and summarized the Zn-ion storage mechanisms of various cathode materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. And Liu et al. summarized the design strategies for vanadium-based cathodes for aqueous ZIBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Though many review articles have been published in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], few review papers discuss various electrolytes in the ZIBs in details despite that electrolyte is a crucial component in ZIBs and there have been rapid new developments concerning it lately. The main difference in this review is that we systematically present recent progresses and challenges of all the components in ZIBs in detail, including various cathode materials, aqueous and nonaqueous electrolytes, solid-state ZIBs, and Zn anodes. We also provide opinions on current limitations of ZIBs and perspectives for future research directions. The review is divided into six parts: (1) research background, recent development and research progress of ZIBs based on (2) aqueous electrolytes, (3) summarization of representative cathode materials, (4) solid-state zinc-ion batteries, (5) design of zinc anodes and separators, and (6) current challenges and perspectives for future research directions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Zinc-Ion Batteries based on Aqueous Electrolytes</title><p id="Par8">Aqueous rechargeable batteries are regarded as promising candidate for large-scale energy storage due to their high safety nature, low cost, and environmental friendliness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Moreover, compared with organic electrolyte, the aqueous electrolytes can provide two times higher ionic conductivities (~ 1 S cm<sup>−1</sup>) due to the higher mobility of ions in water environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. In addition, the rechargeable zinc-ion batteries employing divalent ions can provide higher specific capacity as well as energy density than monovalent ions due to the double electrons involved in redox reactions. Because the most common anode material in ZIBs is zinc metal and the battery capacity is more limited by cathode than anode, a vast variety of cathode materials have been explored for applications in high-performance ZIBs, as detailed below.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Manganese Oxide Cathode Materials</title><p id="Par9">For thousands of years, manganese-based materials have been widely used by humans due to their abundant resources in the crust. Manganese oxides have remarkable diversity of atomic structures and multivalent phases due to different oxidation states of Mn: + 2, + 3, and + 4. Therefore, manganese oxides can be widely applied as catalysts, battery materials, and deoxidizer in steel making, etc. Moreover, manganese oxides are the first material researched and reported as cathode in the field of ZIBs due to its high valence state and specific phases which can readily accommodate inserted ions. To better understand manganese oxides and their crystal structures and the Mn-based materials applied in ZIBs, we summarize the recent studies about manganese oxides below.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title><italic>γ</italic>-MnO<sub>2</sub></title><p id="Par10">Kim et al. investigated the phase evolution in a mesoporous <italic>γ</italic>-MnO<sub>2</sub> material during the intercalation of zinc ions via in situ Synchrotron XANES and XRD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].

Instead of intercalation of zinc ions, the reaction is induced by the reaction between <italic>α</italic>-MnO<sub>2</sub> and inserted protons. Moreover, another electrochemical mechanism of H<sup>+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> co-insertion was reported.</p><p id="Par17"><italic>The H</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>and Zn</italic><sup><italic>2</italic>+</sup><italic>co</italic>-<italic>insertion mechanism</italic> It is possible that the open tunnel <italic>α</italic>-MnO<sub>2</sub> enables the co-insertion of H<sup>+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions. To understand the mechanism, Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] developed Zn/MnO<sub>2</sub> batteries and studied consequent H<sup>+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> insertion processes by using electroanalytical technology combined with XRD, SEM, and TEM. The two insertion processes happened at two different voltage regions. The galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) results show that the H<sup>+</sup> insertion process happens at region I with low overvoltage of 0.08 V, and the Zn<sup>2+</sup> insertion process takes place at region II with much higher overvoltage of 0.6 V. The significant difference of H<sup>+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> insertion processes is mainly attributed to the different resistances for H<sup>+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion diffusion. The EIS results show that the ohmic resistances of these two regions are close, while the charge transfer resistance of region II is much larger than that in region I. Moreover, the bivalent zinc ions have much larger radius and stronger electrostatic interactions with the host atoms than H<sup>+</sup> ions, leading to slower Zn<sup>2+</sup> diffusion. It can be also observed in ZIBs with other cathodes, such as V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>·<italic>n</italic>H<sub>2</sub>O [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] and NaV<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>·1.5H<sub>2</sub>O [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Despite that three different Zn<sup>2+</sup> storage mechanisms in MnO<sub>2</sub>/Zn batteries have been proposed, more efforts are still needed to further identify the electrochemical reaction mechanism and further enhance the battery performance.</p><p id="Par18">Many strategies have been applied to improve the performance of MnO<sub>2</sub>/Zn batteries. For example, to slow down the manganese dissolution during electrochemical cycling, Liang et al. introduced potassium ions and oxygen defects in MnO<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. The incorporated K<sup>+</sup> ions can stabilize the Mn-based cathodes, and the oxygen defects can improve electrical conductivity and diffusion rate for zinc ions. Therefore, the K<sub>0.8</sub>Mn<sub>8</sub>O<sub>16</sub>/Zn batteries show improved capacity at high rate. At a high current density of 1 A g<sup>−1</sup>, the K<sub>0.8</sub>Mn<sub>8</sub>O<sub>16</sub>/Zn batteries can provide a high specific capacity over 300 mAh g<sup>−1</sup> and a high energy density of 398 Wh kg<sup>−1</sup> for over 1000 cycles, showing outstanding durability and energy density. Composite nanostructure design is another effective strategy to boost the performance of MnO<sub>2</sub>/Zn batteries. For example, Xia et al. designed the manganese dioxide with polyaniline preintercalated in the interlayer space. The intercalated polyaniline can strengthen the layered structure of manganese dioxide in nanoscale size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Furthermore, the combination of PANI-reinforced layered structure and nanoscale particle size (~ 10 nm) can efficiently hinder the phase transformation induced by the insertion of hydrated H<sup>+</sup>/Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions, maintaining the structural stability during the electrochemical reaction. The co-insertion process of hydrated H<sup>+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions was also carefully examined and clarified a self-regulating mechanism involving generation/dissolution of electrolyte (zinc hydroxide sulfate). The PANI-reinforced MnO<sub>2</sub> achieves a high capacity of 125 mAh g<sup>−1</sup> for over 5000 cycles, showing long cycling life with high capacity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>ZnMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub></title><p id="Par19">Inspired by the success of LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, spinel MFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (M = Zn, Ni, or Cu), Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, ZnCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and ZnMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> have also been explored as electrode material for batteries.

The zinc ions can be extracted from the structure in acid condition during the Mn<sup>3+</sup> disproportionation reaction, while, with the increase in Ni content, the extraction of Zn<sup>2+</sup> will decrease. The researching results appear that the spinel-structured materials are not quite suitable for the intercalation of zinc ions, while, with a certain content of defects (vacancies), the Zn-ion diffusion can be much easier due the lower electrostatic repulsion.

They investigated the electrochemical mechanism by in situ XRD combined electrochemical analyses. And the results demonstrate that VO<sub>2</sub> (B) nanofibers have an intercalation pseudocapacitance behavior. The pseudocapacitance behavior is owing to the unique tunnel-like framework, which can not only provide efficient pathways for transporting Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions, but also has strong mechanical stability during the intercalation/deintercalation of Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions. Therefore, the VO<sub>2</sub> (B) nanofibers show remarkable electrochemical performance.

Moreover, ex situ XRD and XPS results showed that the diffusion behavior of Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions in and out of the layered KVO structure is dominated by the redox reaction of vanadium. At the specific power of 72 W kg<sup>−1</sup>, the KVO nanorods can deliver a reversible high specific energy of 172.1 Wh kg<sup>−1</sup> with ~ 82% capacity retention for over 500 cycles, indicating high energy density and long-term cyclability.</p><p id="Par29">Na<sub>0.33</sub>V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> is composed by quadruple octahedra chains, which are linked by double chains of square pyramids via sharing their corners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>].

Sodium ions in sodium vanadium oxides are believed to act as pillars to stabilize the framework to keep the reversible phase transform during cycling. In the most recent years, many researchers focused on the development of sodium vanadium oxides with stable ion storage properties.

The stable layered framework and structural water molecules in the V-based cathodes facilitate fast diffusion of zinc ions, leading to their high rate capability and long cycling life. However, the average operation voltage of vanadium oxides is only about 0.8 V in aqueous ZIBs, which seriously restricts its practical applications. The discharge potential of vanadium oxides can be increased by introducing polyanions or fluorines. For example, M<sub>3</sub>V<sub>2</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> (M = Li, Na) and Na<sub>3</sub>V<sub>2</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>F<sub>3</sub> show much higher discharge potential of about 1.5 V. However, these additional groups lead to increased molecular mass and decreased specific capacities (only 113.5 mAh g<sup>−1</sup> for M<sub>3</sub>V<sub>2</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> (M = Li, Na), and 50 mAh g<sup>−1</sup> for Na<sub>3</sub>V<sub>2</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>F<sub>3</sub>). Therefore, further explorations should be focused on enhancing both the operating voltage and specific capacity for vanadium-based cathodes. Compared with manganese oxides and vanadium-based cathodes, the electrochemical performance of PBAs is poor. Even though the PBAs can support a high average operation voltage up to 1.5 V [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>], they suffer low specific capacities (50–80 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>) and limited cycling life (~ 200 cycles). The poor performance of PBAs is attributed to the randomly distributed Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub> vacancies that can break the electronic conduction between Fe–CN–M bonds and thus result in poor rate capability. Therefore, it is important to reduce the lattice defects to improve the performance. Moreover, herein we also summarize the ZIBs with aqueous and nonaqueous electrolytes. The anions and solvents in the electrolytes are significant for the diffusion of charge carriers and stabilizing electrode materials. ZnSO<sub>4</sub> and Zn(CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> solutions are commonly used as electrolytes in aqueous ZIBs due to their excellent electrochemical performances. However, the acidic condition may damage the long-term stability of the Zn metal anode. Compared to ZIBs with aqueous electrolytes, ZIBs with organic electrolytes exhibit higher operation voltages and moderate discharge capacities, but they show much poorer rate performance and limited cycling life, which probably attributes to faster ionic diffusion rate, and higher reversibility of metal deposition/dissolution in mild aqueous electrolytes.<table-wrap

As a promising new energy storage system, solid-state zinc-ion batteries (SZIBs) exhibit a series of noticeable advantages, such as high safety without electrolyte leakage, good flexibility, and low cost. Though much work has been done on zinc-ion batteries with liquid electrolytes, progress on SZIBs is still limited due to the lack of high zinc-ion conducting solid-state electrolytes. Therefore, it is imperative to explore the physicochemical properties of suitable solid-state electrolytes and the zinc-ion migration mechanism inside the solid-state electrolytes, which may provide more insight into the realizations of practical SZIBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">In 2017, Tong et al. first developed flexible quasi-solid-state Zn–MnO<sub>2</sub>/PEDOT battery with high performance via using PVA/ZnCl<sub>2</sub>/MnSO<sub>4</sub> gel electrolyte and MnO<sub>2</sub>/PEDOT cathode (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>a, b) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>].

Moreover, this flexible battery can maintain similar discharge properties and show no capacity loss under bending or twisting, demonstrating excellent mechanical strength.

Moreover, the battery cell exhibits outstanding durability under bending and twisting (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>f) and effectively prohibits the zinc dendrite growth during continuous charge–discharge cycles, suggesting that the gum bio-electrolyte is a very promising candidate for flexible energy storage systems.</p><p id="Par46">Inspired by Zhi et al.’s work above, Chen et al. investigated a Zn/NaV<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>·1.5H<sub>2</sub>O (NVO) cell by using a quasi-solid-state electrolyte that consists of gelatin and aqueous ZnSO<sub>4</sub> solution (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>a) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].

Specifically, the flexible cell exhibits a highly reversible capacity of 204 mAh g<sup>−1</sup> with an initial high Coulombic efficiency of 95% at 0.5 °C, corresponding to the two-electron transfer process.

This self-healing electrolyte displays enhanced healing property and good ionic conductivity owing to the Fe<sup>3+</sup> cross-linkers forming ionic bonds between the PANa chains, as well as the favorable compatibility of PANa-Fe<sup>3+</sup> with aqueous solution of Zn(CH<sub>3</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub> + KOH. Hence, the assembled NiCo/Zn batteries with such intrinsically self-healing PANa-Fe<sup>3+</sup> electrolytes show autonomically self-healing ability with over 87% capacity retention after four cycles of cutting/healing. When the two broken parts of the cell were brought to connect, the watch was on again without weakening the brightness, indicating excellent healing performance and high potential applications in broken electronics.

Although zinc metal is considered as a promising anode for aqueous ZIBs owing to its intrinsic safety, low toxicity, and high theoretical capacity, metallic zinc inevitably suffers from passivation, irreversibility, corrosion, and growth of dendrite during plating/stripping. Especially in alkaline aqueous electrolytes, passivation problems caused by the formation of ZnO layer can limit the surface contact between electrolyte and zinc anode and seriously reduce the conductivity of the anode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>]. Moreover, the growth of zinc dendrites can continuously consume water during cycling and irreversibly produce by-products (Zn(OH)<sub arrange="stack">4</sub><sup arrange="stack">2−</sup>, etc.), leading to very low Coulombic efficiency, poor capacity, limited cycling life of ZIBs. Zinc dendrite still tends to form especially at high current densities. It is believed that the formation of zinc dendrite is due to the uneven Zn<sup>2+</sup> distribution on flat metallic Zn foil. The sharp end of dendrite tips can act as a charge center in the electric field, supporting further growth of dendrites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Moreover, with the growth of zinc dendrite, the surface area of zinc anode increases, while the corrosion and other surface-dependent reactions increase with the larger surface area of zinc anode, leading to continuously consuming of zinc anode and a faster fading of the battery performance. To overcome these problems, many efforts have been devoted to designing the composite nanostructure of the Zn metal anode, adding additives in electrolyte, or changing the concentration of zinc salts in electrolyte.</p><p id="Par51">Composite nanostructure design is deemed as an effective strategy to restrict dendrite growth, suppress the formation of by-products, and constrain the corrosion of zinc anode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>]. For example, Yan et al. designed lasagna-like nanostructured Zn anode, in which ZnO nanoparticles are wrapped with graphene oxide nanosheets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>]. The composite anode can provide much higher volumetric capacity and capacity retention when compared with pure ZnO. Moreover, Wang et al. deposited zinc on conductive graphite felt via electrodeposition method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>]. The graphite felt substrate can facilitate fast electron transport and efficient zinc plating in various specific directions, leading to enhanced cycling stability.</p><p id="Par52">In addition to the above composite nanostructure design of Zn anodes, adding additives in electrolyte is also an important strategy to constrain the corrosion and dendrite formation of Zn metal anode. For instance, as reported by Mantia et al., the electrolyte’s additive can decrease the grain growth rate and thus affect the morphology of zinc electrodeposition and suppress the formation of dendrites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>]. Unfortunately, at the same time, it can also decrease the kinetics of reaction and cycling stability of ZIBs due to induced higher overpotential. Mantia and his co-workers studied the effect of branched polyethyleneimine (BPEI) as an electrolyte’s additive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>]. They found that the introduction of BPEI can adjust the morphology of the deposited Zn and decrease the size of the crystals, leading to the improved efficiency and stability. Moreover, Chen and his co-workers found that the addition of Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> in ZnSO<sub>4</sub> aqueous electrolyte can effectively hinder the growth of Zn dendrites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. This is because sodium ions with a lower reduction potential can form a positively charged electrostatic shield on Zn ions, avoiding the growth of Zn dendrites. In addition, Chen’s group systemically studied the additives in gel electrolyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>]. They first applied fumed silica as additive in gel electrolyte and found that the fumed silica can significantly reduce dendrite formation. However, the adding of fumed silica can also increase the corrosion on Zn anode. Therefore, they further introduce pyrazole in electrolyte and found that the pyrazole can serve as a good additive to inhibit both zinc corrosion and dendrite growth. The optimized composition 5% fumed silica + 0.2% pyrazole finally exhibits improved performance with enhanced open-circuit voltage, rate capability, and cycling stability.</p><p id="Par53">Highly concentrated neutral Zn-ion electrolyte is another effective method to suppress the dendrite growth. To completely eliminate the formation of Zn dendrites, Wang et al. developed a unique aqueous electrolyte at high concentrations composed of 1 M Zn(TFSI)<sub>2</sub> and 20 M LiTFSI, proved to achieve 100% Coulombic efficiency and no dendrite formation during Zn plating/stripping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>]. In addition, Chen and his co-workers developed Zn/VOPO<sub>4</sub> batteries using a water-in-salt electrolyte to realize reversible oxygen redox chemistry in a high voltage region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>]. Since Zn metal anodes show high corrosion current and low positive corrosion potential in 1 M Zn(Tr)<sub>2</sub> electrolyte, they applied highly concentrated 21 M LiTFSI/1 M Zn(Tr)<sub>2</sub> water-in-salt electrolyte in ZIBs, which can suppress the corrosion of zinc and also constrain the dissolution of VOPO<sub>4</sub> cathode due to the limited activity of water. The water-in-salt electrolyte facilitates the reversible oxygen redox reaction in Zn/VOPO<sub>4</sub> batteries, leading to increased discharge potential to 1.56 V and significantly improved power density from 160 to 217 Wh kg<sup>−1</sup>, which is comparable with lithium-ion batteries. This work of water-in-salt electrolyte is scientifically enlightening for future research. However, the electrolyte with high Zn and Li salts is quite expensive and largely hinders its potential for grid-scale production.</p><p id="Par54">It is known that the passivation and dendrite growth on zinc anode surface could be reduced in acidic electrolyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. However, acidic electrolytes will cause the corrosion on Zn anode, seriously affecting long-term cyclability. Surface coating on zinc metal foil is an effective way to alleviate the corrosion of zinc anode and thus improve the performance. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>a, b, stable coating layer on zinc anode can slow down zinc dissolution and dendrite growth. For example, Zhao et al. applied atomic layer deposition method to coat the zinc metal plate with thin TiO<sub>2</sub> layer to prevent corrosion during electrochemical reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>]. They demonstrated that TiO<sub>2</sub> layer can effectively protect the inner zinc from corrosion and suppress Zn(OH)<sub>2</sub> by-product formation, leading to improved capacity retention and prolonged cycling life. In addition, Zhi et al. coated Zn anode with a uniform porous nano-CaCO<sub>3</sub> layer to enhance the electrostripping/electroplating stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>]. The porous uniform coatings can guide the Zn plating reaction on the entire Zn anode surface, effectively avoiding the corrosion and the growth of large protrusions/dendrites. Liu et al. coated zinc metal anode with graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets via casting method (Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>c, d) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>]. The GO nanosheets can not only prevent the Zn intermediates from dissolving into aqueous electrolyte, but also improve the surface electron conductivity, leading to the prolonged cycling life and rate capability. Moreover, synthesis of zinc anode with organic additives is another strategy to reduce corrosion. For example, Chen et al. prepared novel zinc anode via electroplating with various organic additives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>]. They found that organic additives can change the surface crystallographic orientation, surface density, and texture of the produced zinc anode. Based on the linear polarization results, compared with the commercial pure zinc metal, the corrosion rate of the prepared Zn-SDS is 30 times lower, showing significantly improved corrosion tolerance. However, there are still very few studies on mechanisms of suppressing corrosion and passivation of zinc anode by now. Therefore, more research efforts should be made to manipulate the Zn<sup>2+</sup> chemistry based on the Zn anode to overcome the above-mentioned corrosion and dendrite growth problems.<fig id="Fig12"><label>Fig. 12</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic illustration of the zinc metal anode with stable coating layer. <bold>a</bold> Plating and stripping of zinc ions lead to unstable surface.

The preparation methods of the electrode materials, fundamental electrochemical reaction mechanisms, corresponding battery performances, and their correlations are discussed in detail. Continuous efforts are being made for exploring a vast variety of cathode materials. However, there remain many essential electrochemical details that are yet to clarify. For example, the electrochemical reaction mechanisms of Mn-based cathodes in ZIBs are still disputable, with three different mechanisms of Zn<sup>2+</sup> migration, proton migration, and Zn<sup>2+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> co-migration being reported. Moreover, the combination of valence state change of manganese ion during cations insertion and corresponding typical voltage plateaus still need to be examined carefully, which may shed more light on the electrochemical mechanisms and thus provide effective guidance for constructing Mn-based electrode/Zn batteries with improved performances. Compared to the Mn-based electrodes, V-based cathodes display a higher specific capacity and longer cycling performances, but the lower discharge plateaus ~ 0.7 V is a distinct drawback. In addition, V-based materials may continuously dissolve in aqueous acidic Zn<sup>2+</sup> electrolyte (ZnSO<sub>4</sub> or Zn(CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> electrolyte). Therefore, developing effective strategies to prevent the vanadium dissolution is necessary, such as adjustment of the electrolyte pH or growth of protective layers on the surface of the V-based cathodes. For the PBA cathodes in ZIBs, removing interstitial water content and reducing crystal defects help to increase the robustness of their crystalline structure and further improve their electrochemical performances.</p><p id="Par57">As to the liquid-based electrolytes, their electrochemical behaviors and compatibility with both cathode and Zn anode are essential for the overall electrochemical properties. Typically, aqueous Zn(CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and ZnSO<sub>4</sub> electrolytes are the most commonly used solutions in ZIBs, owing to their better electrochemical performances than other zinc salts. It should be noted that Zn(CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> is much more expensive than ZnSO<sub>4</sub> (with over 18 times higher price), which is not a cost effective electrolyte choice in large-scale ZIB production, while ZnSO<sub>4</sub> is accompanied with the formation of unfavorable by-product of hydroxide sulfate. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate the by-product caused by ZnSO<sub>4</sub> electrolyte and the interface fluctuation between the Zn anode and ZnSO<sub>4</sub> electrolyte, which may facilitate industrial production of ZIBs based on low-cost ZnSO<sub>4</sub> electrolytes. For the solid-state electrolyte, most reported polymer electrolytes suffer from low ionic conductivity, insufficient mechanical strength, and fast degradation. Therefore, studies on the chemical conjunction between Zn-based electrolyte and polymer hosts and their joint electrochemical properties will play important roles in advancing solid-state electrolytes with high stability, broad voltage window, and improved long-term cycling performance. Furthermore, the systematic studies of solid-state polymer electrolytes operating in subzero or high temperature are lacking, which hinder the developments of ZIBs for harsh conditions, and more efforts should be made to explore and obtain electrolytes working in a wide temperature range. Despite much progress that has been achieved in the area of ZIBs, there remain challenges as summarized above. Additional fundamental studies are urgently needed, which are crucial for maturing the battery technology and realizing practical zinc-ion batteries for wide applications.</p><p id="Par58">Overall, the combination of environment-friendly property, high safety, high energy density, and long cycling life makes ZIBs high potential candidates for future energy storage devices. Moreover, compared with current LIBs (about $300 per kWh), the price of ZIBs ($65 per kWh) is much lower, which is even comparable with lead acid batteries. The low cost makes ZIBs very promising for practical large-scale applications. The current manufacturing can be leveraged to large-scale commercialization for ZIBs. However, the major challenges of ZIBs still reside in the high energy efficiency cathode, stable Zn anode, and cheap electrolytes. In the near future, adequate zinc anodes, metal oxide cathodes (probably MnO<sub>2</sub>-, V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>-based materials), and electrolytes can be designed with more mature technology. The commercialization of rechargeable ZIBs will potentially be scaled up.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>W.W. Xu and Y.
