Many factors affect the functioning of photovoltaic panels, including external factors and internal factors. External factors such as wind speed, incident radiation rate, ambient temperature, and dust accumulation on the PV cannot be controlled. The internal factors can be controlled, such as PV surface temperature. Some of the radiation falling on the surface of the PV cell turns into electricity, while the remainder of incident radiation is absorbed inside the PV cell. This, in turn, elevates its surface temperature. Undesirably, the higher panel temperature, the lower conversion performance, and lesser reliability over the long term occur. Hence, many cooling systems have been designed and investigated, aiming to effectively avoid the excessive temperature rise and enhance their efficiency. Many cooling methods are used to cool solar cells, such as passive cooling, active cooling, cooling with phase change materials (PCMs), and cooling with PCM with other additives such as nanoparticles or porous metal. In this work, the common methods utilized for cooling PV panels are reviewed and analyzed, focusing on the last methods, and summarizing all the researches that dealt with cooling PV solar cells with PCM and porous structures.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Photovoltaic</kwd><kwd>Enhancement</kwd><kwd>Thermal

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Excessive consumption of traditional fossil-based energies at a disturbing rate resulted in an energy crisis and was accountable for accompanying environmental concerns such as global warming, greenhouse harmful gas emissions, and ozone depilation that threaten the security of human beings and the future of the world (Abdulmunem et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2020</xref>). Therefore, greater demands for clean and renewable energy technologies are raised to reduce our dependency on fossil-based energies and abate its subsequent adverse environmental concerns. Solar energy is the best widespread and broadly prevalent accepted renewable energy source due to its cleanliness, simple accessibility, sustainability, and unlimited potential (Xu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2021</xref>). The sun is the most powerful renewable energy source, as natural sunlight can heat and light houses and other buildings. In addition to that, solar energy is used in generating electricity, water heating, and a variety of other industrial processes. The methods used to harvest solar energy are constantly evolving, and their efficiency increases with the development of technology, including water heating tubes on rooftops, solar cells, and mirrors (Sharaf et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2021</xref>; Yousef et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2016</xref>). Most of the renewable energy produced on Earth is attributed to solar radiation and secondary energy sources, such as wind energy, wave energy, hydropower, and biomass (Abo-Elfadl et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2020a</xref>; Hassan and Yousef, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2021</xref>). It is worth noting that only a small fraction of the solar energy that reaches the earth is harvested. Once solar energy is converted into electrical energy, only human controls its use. Among the solar energy applications are the heating and cooling systems in architectural designs that depend on the exploitation of solar energy, potable water from distillation and disinfection processes, the exploitation of daylight, water heating, solar cooking, and high temperatures for industrial purposes.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Different PV technologies</title><p id="Par3">Photovoltaic (PV) systems range from small, rooftop-mounted, or building-integrated systems with capacities from a few to several tens of kilowatts, to large utility-scale power stations of hundreds of megawatts. Nowadays, most PV systems are grid-connected, while stand-alone systems only account for a small portion of the market. We will now show the most important applications of photovoltaic panels.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Rooftop and building integrated systems</title><p id="Par4">Photovoltaic arrays are often associated with buildings: either integrated into them, mounted on them, or mounted nearby on the ground. Building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs) are increasingly incorporated into the roof or walls of new domestic and industrial buildings as a principal or ancillary source of electrical power (Darby, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2018</xref>). Typically, residential rooftop systems have small capacities of around 5–10 kW, while commercial rooftop systems often amount to several hundreds of kilowatts. Although rooftop systems are much smaller than ground-mounted utility-scale power plants, they account for most of the worldwide installed capacity (Association, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector</title><p id="Par5">Photovoltaic thermal (PVT) hybrid solar collectors are systems that convert solar radiation into thermal and electrical energy. These systems combine a solar PV cell, which converts sunlight into electricity, with a solar thermal collector, which captures the remaining energy and removes waste heat from the PV module. The capture of both electricity and heat allow these devices to have higher exergy and thus be more overall energy efficient than solar PV or solar thermal alone (Pathak et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Power stations</title><p id="Par6">Many utility-scale solar farms have been constructed all over the world. In 2011, the 579-megawatt (MW<sub>AC</sub>) Solar Star project was proposed, to be followed by the Desert Sunlight Solar Farm and the Topaz Solar Farm in the future, both with a capacity of 550 MW<sub>AC</sub>, to be constructed by US company First Solar, using CdTe modules, a thin-film PV technology. All three power stations will be located in the Californian desert. When the Solar Star project was completed in 2015, it was the world’s largest photovoltaic power station at the time (Wesoff, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>In transport</title><p id="Par7">PV has traditionally been used for electric power in space. PV is rarely used to provide motive power in transport applications, but it can provide auxiliary power in boats and cars. Some automobiles are fitted with solar-powered air conditioning. A self-contained solar vehicle would have limited power and utility, but a solar-charged electric vehicle allows use of solar power for transportation. Solar-powered cars, boats, and airplanes have been demonstrated, with the most practical and likely of these being solar cars (Sukumaran and Sudhakar, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Telecommunication and signaling</title><p id="Par8">Solar PV power is ideally suited for telecommunication applications such as local telephone exchange, radio and TV broadcasting, microwave, and other forms of electronic communication links. This is because, in most telecommunication application, storage batteries are already in use and the electrical system is basically DC. In hilly and mountainous terrain, radio and TV signals may not reach as they get blocked or reflected back due to undulating terrain. At these locations, low-power transmitters (LPT) are installed to receive and retransmit the signal for local population (Tech, n.d.).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>4G solar cell technology</title><p id="Par9">Over the years, this technology has evolved from the first generation to the fourth generation, which we refer to as 4G solar cell technology. As such, since the discovery of the first photovoltaic effect in 1839 by Alexandre Becquerel, the use of solar energy has been a goal in the scientific world. Photovoltaic (solar cells) are basically grouped into four generations and this is based on the materials used: these are first-generation, second-generation, third-generation, and fourth-generation cells (Tala-ighil, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par10">First-generation cells are the earliest photovoltaic cells produced using silicon in 1954 which had an efficiency of 6%. They are currently the most efficient solar cells for use in our homes, accounting for above 80% of all the solar panels sold globally. As the most abundant element on earth, second only to oxygen, it is therefore readily available for use as a semiconducting material suitable for PV applications (Aghenta and Iqbal, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2019</xref>). The second-generation solar cells are also referred to as thin-film solar cells. They are comprised of successive thin layers of solar cells deposited onto a large, cheap substrate such as metal and glass. The third-generation solar cell technology came into existence due to the high costs of the first generation, toxicity, and limited availability of solar cells for the second-generation technology. The third-generation solar cell technology make solar cells from a variety of materials apart from silicon. It uses silicon wires, nanomaterials, organic dyes, and conductive plastics, all in an attempt to devise a more efficient and readily available technology (Singh et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">The fourth-generation solar cell technology is also referred to as the 4G solar cell technology. This technology makes use of the combination of inorganic and organic materials, as a means to boost the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of solar cells. The 4G solar cells are engineered at solar scale and are characterized by the flexibility of conducting polymer films (the organic materials), and the stable nanostructures (inorganic materials). In the 4G solar cells, the commonly used substrate is transparent tin doped indium oxide; however, new alternatives have made use of graphene, metal nanowires, and metal grid structures (Singh et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2021</xref>). The essence of the nanomaterials in these solar cells enables large volume of surrounding the nanomaterial to be filled using a conductor, such as a polymer. The main advantage of 4G solar cell over the other technologies is that the combination of organic and inorganic substrates improves the harvesting of solar energy, thereby ensuring better efficiency while also maintaining meaningful cost savings (Tala-ighil, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Working principle of photovoltaic cell and temperature effect on its output power</title><p id="Par12">Photovoltaic (PV) is one of the most established solar energy conversion technologies, which converts solar energy directly into electricity with unrestricted potential, noiseless operation, and little necessity for maintenance. The PV cell is basically a diode of the junction p-n. PV solar cells are a form of photoelectric cell, defined as a device whose electrical characteristics—such as voltage, current, or resistance—vary when exposed to light. Individual solar cells can be combined to form modules commonly known as solar panels. The common single-junction silicon solar cell can produce a maximum open-circuit voltage of approximately 0.5 to 0.6 V. By itself, this is not much—but remember, these solar cells are tiny. When combined into a large solar panel, considerable amounts of renewable energy can be generated (Krishan and Suhag, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par13">When light reaches the p–n junction, the light photons can easily enter the junction through a very thin p-type layer. The light energy, in the form of photons, supplies sufficient energy to the junction to create several electron–hole pairs. The incident light breaks the thermal equilibrium condition of the junction. The free electrons in the depletion region can quickly come to the n-type side of the junction. Similarly, the holes in the depletion can quickly come to the p-type side of the junction (Jordehi, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2016</xref>), as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Due to the motion of the electrons from the p-type side to the n-type side and vice versa, the voltage is produced, and if we connect a load through the junction, the current will flow through the circuit.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The working principle of (PV) (“<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.electrical4u.com/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.electrical4u.com/</ext-link>,” n.d.)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11356_2022_18719_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par14">Due to the increase in surface temperature of the PV cell, the circuit resistance increases, and this limits the velocity of the electron, which directly affects the open-circuit voltage besides badly influencing the cell material. The voltage drop-in/temperature rise unit, called temperature coefficient, describes the temperature reliance of the particular material used for PV cell performance analysis and indicates the strong dependency of PV power output on the surface temperature of the PV.

Therefore, to maintain the electrical performance of the PV module at an acceptable level, it is essential to utilize an appropriate cooling technique to lower its surface temperature, thereby prolonging its lifetime (Shastry and Arunachala, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2020</xref>). Most researches are carried out to minimize the effect of high temperature on the PV module’s electrical efficiency in order to make the power produced from the PV module able to challenge the non-renewable sources of energy. Different types of cooling methods used in PV cooling are reviewed in the following sub-sections and are summarized in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref><fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The different cooling techniques</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11356_2022_18719_Fig3_HTML.png" id="MO3"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Active cooling</title><p id="Par18">This method relies on another mechanical device to pump the water or air necessary for cell cooling.

The power used in the fan or pump is deducted from the power produced from the cell, reducing the net output power produced from the PV cells (Abdulmunem et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2020</xref>). This method is divided into two basic types: first, forced air cooling, and second, forced water cooling, and many studies have been conducted on the two types, which will be reviewed in the next sections.</p><sec id="Sec12"><title>Forced air cooling</title><p id="Par19">Amelia et al.

The use of one fan increased the power produced by 12.93%; when the number of fans is raised to 2, 3, and 4, the power increased to 37.17%, 41.28%, and 44.34%, respectively.

In their setup, he used two photovoltaics; one is a reference, and the other has a steel plater under it to create an air channel underneath it. The first study let the natural air circulate through the channel to cool the photovoltaic by natural convection. The second study uses a centrifugal fan to force the air inside the channel to cool photovoltaic by forced convection, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>.

Air flows through a ground-coupled heat exchanger and decreases its temperature. The cooled air soothes the solar panels while passing beneath them. The researchers installed nine solar panels of 100 W each. The air is flown by a single blower and the cold air is distributed to each solar panel through the pipe.

According to the results, using active water cooling for PV modules can lead to approximately 20% reduction in module temperature which translates to about 9% efficiency enhancement. In addition to the improvement in the electrical generation efficiency of PV, by applying this method, the extracted heat can be used for different purposes, which means increase in collected energy. Several novel ideas are tested out in liquid cooling of PVs with the goal to achieve more uniform temperature in the cells such as converging channel tested by Baloch et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2015</xref>). The designed shape of channel is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>. Due to mass conservation in converging channels, reduction in the cross-section leads to velocity increment, which enhances forced convection; consequently, the temperature profile is more uniform. In order to find the most appropriate converging angle, seven angles were modeled and assessed. The considered angles varied from 0° to 10°, while the mass flow rate and outlet cross-section were kept constant. The most favorable results, in terms of temperature uniformity, were obtained at 2° converging angle. According to the thermal analysis of the system, by using converging channels, the PV temperature can be reduced from 71.2 to 45.1 °C and from 48.3 to 36.4 °C in a typical hot day in June and a cold day in December, respectively.

These systems are capable of reducing the cell temperature to as low as 37 °C even for high concentration levels. The main drawback of these dissipation techniques however is that to keep the cell temperature maintained, heat sink area directly increases with the concentration ratio.

Then after that, the PCM begins to absorb another part of the heat generated in the PV until transfer from a solid state to a liquid state (latent heat). As a result of the heat absorbed from the PV cell during the day, the PV cell cooled, and consequently, the power produced from the PV cell increases. Then, during the sun’s absence, the heat absorbed in PCM is transferred to the ambient, and the temperature of the PCM decreases. Then the cooling cycle is restarted the next morning. Once again, many types of research have dealt with this cooling method, which we will review in the following. Among numerous PV thermal regulation techniques, the use of PCM has been suggested as a promising candidate in PV systems due to its significant phase change enthalpy, ease of use, low cost, chemical stability, and applicable application phase transition temperature (Maatallah et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2019</xref>). Thus, PCM has been widely utilized in various engineering system’ thermal regulation, electronic cooling, solar thermal energy applications, automotive industry, energy conservation of buildings, and waste heat recovery (Yousef and Hassan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2019a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">2019b</xref>). For thermal regulation of PV systems, when PCM is assimilated at PV back, solar energy dissipated as heat energy is captivated by PCM in the form of latent heat, retaining the PV temperature at an acceptable level and nearly uniform for some period (Yousef et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2022</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>PCM selection</title><p id="Par50">The choice of PCM used to cool the PV solar cell depends on the melting point and the ambient temperature. It is preferable to choose PCM with a melting point less than the ambient temperature by 8–10 °C. The choice of PCM also depends on the properties of the PCM itself, which includes the thermal conductivity and the amount of the latent heat of fusion (Hasan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2014</xref>). Hasan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2014</xref>) conducted an experiment to compare the use of five different types of PCMs, both organic and inorganic with the different melting points with a range from 21 to 30 °C, and the amount of latent heat with a range from 170 to 240 kJ/kg.

The effectiveness of metal foams is governed by different parameters such as the metal material, porosity, and pore density. Metal foams boost the rate of heat transfer by augmenting the exposure area between the heat source (absorber plate) and the working fluid (PCM), providing enhanced heat transfer capability with a slight penalty on the thermal storage capacity (Hajjar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2020</xref>).

This research represents a comprehensive review of the different cooling techniques used in PV cooling, such as active cooling, passive cooling, PCM cooling, and PCM with additives. The main conclusions are as follows:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par82">The passive cooling technique is easy, simple, and low cost but is characterized by the low heat transfer rate, so it did not provide a high enhancement in the photovoltaic performance.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par83">The active cooling technique is considered an effective way to improve the photovoltaic performance, but it depends on an external power source, so the external power is deducted from the power produced from the PV cells, reducing the net output power produced from the PV cells.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par84">PCM cooling is considered one of the successful future methods in photovoltaic cooling, but due to the low thermal conductivity of the PCM, this method gives a low enhancement. The thermal conductivity of the PCM should be improved by adding another component to improve the cooling performance.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par85">Adding fins to the PCM is a rather primitive method and works to improve only the PCM adjacent to the fins without looking at the rest of the quantity.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par86">Adding the nanoparticles to the PCM is an innovative way to improve the performance of the PCM better than adding the fins and gives better results, but due to the high price of the nanoparticles, this method is considered uneconomic.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par87">Adding the porous metal to the PCM is an ideal way to improve the performance of PCM in cooling, and it is considered an economical method compared to adding nanoparticles.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contribution</title><p>Mohamed Sharaf: writing.</p><p>Mohamed S.
