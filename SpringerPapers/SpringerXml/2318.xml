Viral agents include emerging and re-emerging pathogens characterized by extremely small size, and high environmental stability. Since the mainly used conventional disinfection methods are usually not able to achieve complete disinfection of viral and other microbial targets, in real water and wastewater matrices, effective strategies for the treatment, use and reuse of water and the development of next-generation water supply systems are required. The scope of the present systematic review was to summarize research data on the application of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for viral disinfection of water and wastewater. A literature survey was conducted using the electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. This comprehensive research yielded 23 records which met the criteria and were included and discussed in this review. Most of the studies (14/23) used only MS2 bacteriophage as an index virus, while the remaining studies (9/23) used two or more viral targets, including phages (MS2, T4, T7, phiX174, PRD-1, S2, ϕB124-14, ϕcrAssphage) and/or Adenovirus, Aichivirus, Norovirus (I, II, IV), Polyomavirus (JC and BK), Sapovirus, Enterovirus, Coxsackievirus B3, Echovirus, and Pepper mild mottle virus. The vast majority of the studies applied a combination of two or more treatments and the most frequently used process was ultraviolet light-hydrogen peroxide (UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) advanced oxidation. The review is expected to highlight the potential of the AOPs for public health protection from the waterborne viral exposure.</p></abstract><kwd-group

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>General Issues</title><p id="Par2">The contamination of water resources is an issue of global concern and the need for provisions of clean water is increasingly becoming demanding (Kokkinos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2020</xref>). Moreover, water scarcity has been identified as a major problem of this century (Schmitz et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2016</xref>). Limited and frequently deteriorated freshwater resources, along with an increasing water consumption, combined with the climate change has led to water reclamation concepts, which support the reuse of treated wastewater worldwide for different purposes (e.g. agricultural, industrial, potable, etc.) (Giannakis et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2017a</xref>; Gomes et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2019</xref>; Schmitz et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2016</xref>). Water microbiological quality issues have been extensively investigated, since waterborne outbreaks have been recorded in both developing and developed countries, and contaminated water may seriously affect economic activities (primary production, tourism, etc.) (Kokkinos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2020</xref>). Bacteria, viruses and protozoa are the cause of many emerging and new waterborne infectious diseases, and the most common cause is fecal pollution of human and/or animal origin (Kokkinos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2020</xref>). More stringent water quality regulations are adopted and, nowadays, it is well recognized that chlorination and other conventional disinfection methods are often not able to achieve complete disinfection of bacterial, viral and protozoa microbial targets, in real water and wastewater matrices (Galeano et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2019</xref>; Giannakis et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2017a</xref>; Nieto-Juarez &amp; Kohn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2013</xref>). The prevalence of human enteric viruses in water and wastewater may pose a serious threat to public health, and new and more efficient treatment methods are required to ensure the microbiological quality of water and specifically the abatement of enteric viruses to levels that pose no significant risk to human health (Gerba et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2018</xref>; Nieto-Juarez &amp; Kohn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2013</xref>). Interestingly, the vast majority of the viral agents, which are transmitted via the fecal–oral route are non-enveloped, highly stable under environmental conditions, characterized by extremely small size, and include emerging and re-emerging pathogens with the most relevant of them belonging to the families of Adenoviridae, Caliciviridae, Hepeviridae, Picornaviridae and Reoviridae (Rodríguez-Lázaro, et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2012</xref>). The enteric viruses of human stool and urine belong to more than 140 types (Kokkinos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2011</xref>). Surprisingly, untreated wastewater has been identified as the most diverse viral metagenome examined so far, with most sequence reads having little or no sequence relation to known viruses, indicating that most of the viruses have not yet been characterized (Cantalupo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2011</xref>). The current global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has highlighted the urgent need to investigate the fate and transport of coronavirus and other enveloped viruses in urban sewage and drinking water, and also to develop rapid, sensitive, specific and inexpensive methods for water virological analysis (Foladori et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>; La Rosa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Advanced Oxidation Processes</title><p id="Par3">Nowadays, it is well recognized that the existing biological and physicochemical treatment methods are unable to deal with the complete abatement of viral agents in hydric resources. In spite of its inherent weaknesses such as the production of disinfection by-products (e.g. trihalomethanes), chlorination is still the most common disinfection technique (Giannakis et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2017a</xref>). However, the adoption of advanced treatment technologies such as advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are a promising approach for the improvement of water and wastewater treatment (Feitz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2005</xref>). AOPs have emerged as promising, environmentally friendly and efficient alternative disinfection methods to conventional ones, to control water microbiological quality. They rely on the in situ formation of chemical oxidants to disinfect water and degrade diverse harmful organic contaminants (Giannakis et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2017a</xref>; Marjanovic et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2018</xref>; Nieto-Juarez &amp; Kohn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2013</xref>; Shabat-Hadas et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2017</xref>). AOPs are, in practice, redox technologies including different processes such as ozonation, ozonation coupled with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and/or ultraviolet (UV) radiation, Fenton and alike reactions, photocatalysis activated by semiconductors such as TiO<sub>2</sub>, sonolysis, electrochemical oxidation, and various combinations of them (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). They are based on the production of highly reactive oxygen species (ROS), characterized by the non-selectivity on the target and can be used as pre- or post-treatment to a biological process (Galeano et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2019</xref>; Kokkinos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2020</xref>; Monteiro et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2015</xref>). The principal oxidizing agent is the hydroxyl radical, being the second most powerful oxidant after fluorine. However, other ROS may also be produced (e.g. hydroperoxyl radicals, superoxide radical anions, etc.) (Giannakis et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2017a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2017b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017c</xref>). Hydroxyl radicals are frequently produced by the homolytic cleavage of the O–O bond of hydrogen peroxide with UV light (Bounty et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2012</xref>; Shabat-Hadas et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2017</xref>). A well-studied AOP is the photo-Fenton process, in which hydroxyl radicals are produced by light, iron and hydrogen peroxide (Nieto-Juarez et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2010</xref>, Marjanovic et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2018</xref>). It is an environmentally friendly, simple, low-cost process which has been shown to be effective in the abatement of structurally simple, complex or resistant microbes (Giannakis et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2017a</xref>). Indeed, AOPs have shown a high disinfection potential against a wide range of microorganisms like virus, protozoa, spore-forming bacteria, fungus, and yeasts, mainly through the action of ROS such as singlet and triplet oxygen, anion-radical superoxide, hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl radical, and hydrogen peroxide. ROS are known oxidants of different types of molecules, such as proteins, lipids, and also nucleic acids. Specifically for nucleic acids, ROS may exert their action at different levels (e.g. change the nucleotides, break the phosphodiester bond, enhance the formation of pyrimidine dimers, change the tridimensional structure, and affect DNA replication) (Galeano et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2019</xref>). Different factors, such as the use of sunlight (a renewable source of energy), the minimal needs of hydrogen peroxide and consequently reduced costs, and the application of a low-cost catalyst such as Fe<sup>3+</sup>, which is frequently present in natural waters, render photo-Fenton a process of great potential for viral abatement in water matrices (Ortega-Gomez et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2015</xref>). Sulfate radicals, which are characterized by a redox potential close to that of hydroxyl radicals (2.6 V), may be used as an alternative to hydroxyl ones, since they are more selective against various target contaminants and pollutants. Different activating factors (light, heat, transition metals, etc.) may promote the production of sulfate radicals from chemicals such as peroxymonosulfate and peroxydisulfate (PDS) (Marjanovic et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2018</xref>). Although during the last years, the photo-Fenton and alike processes have been used as a green alternative to chemical disinfection of waters and wastewaters, they have still to be completely clarified (Giannakis et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2017b</xref>, Giannakis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2018</xref>). Different studies have revealed the order of microbial resistance to solar photo-Fenton process as follows, bacteria &lt; viruses &lt; spores (fungi or bacteria) (Giannakis et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>). The assessment of the disinfection using light-driven AOPs is based on the use of different approaches such as computational fluid dynamics, chemical actinometry or biodosimetry (Shabat-Hadas et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2017</xref>). The concurrent abatement of pathogens and chemical pollutants by solar-enhanced AOPs has been reviewed by Tsydenova et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2015</xref>)<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Categorization of AOPs for environmental applications with a potential for viral disinfection in water and wastewater matrices</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/12560_2021_9481_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par4">To face the limitations of the homogeneous Fenton processes, which are associated with the pH-dependent solubility and stability of ferrous and ferric species, the use of an alternative iron source, i.e. iron (hydr)-oxide particles, has been assessed in a process called heterogeneous Fenton-like. The effectiveness of such a process for viral inactivation catalyzed by colloidal iron around neutral pH under sunlight has been proved (Nieto-Juarez &amp; Kohn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2013</xref>; Nieto-Juarez et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2010</xref>). Interestingly, iron-bearing particles may support viral disinfection by different ways, i.e. physical removal by adsorption onto particles, by Fenton-like processes, photocatalysis or disintegration upon adsorption (Nieto-Juarez &amp; Kohn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2013</xref>). More research is needed though on viral inactivation by photo-Fenton process (Giannakis et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2017b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017c</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">Nanoparticle-mediated photocatalysis is another interesting approach for water disinfection, and TiO<sub>2</sub> has been found to be effective against different pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi (Prasse &amp; Ternes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2010</xref>) Zhu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2020</xref>) reviewed the formation of nanostructured manganese oxides and their application in wastewater remediation; these oxides can catalyze peroxides to produce ROS in aqueous phase, thus initiating in situ chemical oxidation and AOPs. Duan, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>) performed a proof-of-concept study to unravel the principles in developing fine-tuned and high-performance transition metal (TM)@carbon composites for advanced catalytic oxidation for water decontamination.</p><p id="Par6">During the last decades, the UV technology is upgraded through its application in AOPs (Timchak &amp; Gitis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2012</xref>). The use of UV irradiation for water disinfection of enteric pathogens is an emerging technique characterized by high efficiency and the absence of the formation of disinfection by-products (Chu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2012</xref>). Microbial disinfection by UV irradiation is mainly exerted by UV-induced photochemical reactions of the genetic material. Direct (or endogenous) inactivation involves the absorbance of UVB light by the viral genome, which causes its degradation. Although viral proteins may also absorb UVB radiation to a lesser extent, the contribution to viral inactivation has still to be clarified (Mattle et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2015</xref>). While UVC/UVB are strongly absorbed by DNA and have additive disinfection effects, UVA cannot induce DNA damage and has no direct photochemical reactions on DNA. However, it may produce reactive intermediates such as ROS (e.g. hydroxyl and superoxide radicals, hydrogen peroxide, etc.), which in turn may damage microbial targets (e.g. proteins, DNA, etc.) (Mamane et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2007</xref>; Song et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2019</xref>). Compared to DNA, RNA is known to be more susceptible to oxidative damage by exposure to UV (Galeano et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2019</xref>). In indirect (or exogenous) inactivation, UVB/UVA and visible light are known to be absorbed by different water sensitizers (e.g. organic matter, nitrate, iron-containing complexes, etc.), which produce reactive species with viral inactivation potential. The type of virus, as well as the solution conditions, are both critical factors, which dictate the relative contribution of direct and indirect inactivation (Mattle et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2015</xref>). The UV treatment disinfection efficacy may be impeded by absorbing particles and microorganisms that are captured in aggregates of particulate matter (Kosel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2017</xref>). One of the most widely used AOP is the UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Such a process has been shown to be highly efficient for the treatment of burdened wastewater like that of meat processing industry. (Yapıcıoğlu, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">Another new advanced technique is hydrodynamic cavitation, which exerts its disinfective action through chemical (production of hydroxyl radicals) and physical mechanisms (pressure gradients, shock waves, shear forces, very high local temperatures). Although the exact mechanisms of viral disinfection have not yet been clarified, it may be hypothesized that hydrodynamic cavitation may cause structural damages at different components of a viral particle (coat, host recognition receptors, capsid, genome) (Kosel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">We have recently reviewed the main categories of nanomaterials used in catalytic processes (carbon nanotubes/graphitic carbon nitride (CNT/g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>), composites/graphene-based composites, metal oxides and composites, metal–organic framework and commercially available nanomaterials) and discussed their application in the removal of different classes of pollutants, as well as for the elimination of bacterial, viral and protozoan microbial targets, from water and wastewater matrices (Kokkinos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">Since AOPs are typically energy-intensive processes, the so-called electrical energy per order (i.e. the energy needed to reduce the concentration of contaminant by an order of magnitude in a unit volume of water, EEO) is a useful measure to classify them in three groups as follows: &lt; 1 kWh m<sup>−3</sup> (e.g. O<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>/UV, UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, etc.), 1–100 kWh m<sup>−3</sup> (e.g. photo-Fenton) and &gt; 100 kWh m<sup>−3</sup> (e.g. UV-based photocatalysis) (Miklos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2018</xref>).

It is small, spherical (icosahedron), non-enveloped, and characterized by high resistance to chemical disinfectants and/or environmental stressed conditions (e.g. temperature, osmotic pressure, and desiccation). Interestingly, it seems to be more resistant to inactivation compared to many waterborne viruses of public health concern with similar basic features, such as size, morphology, structure and overall behaviour (Jolis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2002</xref>). Due to its resistibility characteristics and its high numbers in sewage, it is frequently used as an index of wastewater contamination and a quantitative marker for the assessment of the function of water treatment plants and filtration devices as well as for the effectiveness of antiviral/antiseptic agents (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) (Kosel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2017</xref>). It is characterized by a negative charge under a wide pH range (isoelectric point ~ 3.9) and it is relatively hydrophobic (Horovitz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2018</xref>). It is also non-pathogenic and easily propagated and purified in laboratory, up to elevated viral titers, which are frequently required for inactivation experiments. (Kosel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2017</xref>, Giannakis et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2017a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2017b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017c</xref>, Giannakis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2018</xref>, Horovitz et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2018</xref>) A 5-log reduction of MS2 is used in California for the assessment of disinfection systems for non-potable reuse applications (King et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2020</xref>). It has been extensively used as a surrogate for human enteric viruses in studies of assessment of the AOPs potential for viral abatement. Its inactivation requires a high oxidation power because is mainly based on the denaturation of capsid proteins, whose structure is simple and rigid (Horovitz et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2018</xref>; Mamane et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2007</xref>). MS2 has been proposed as a reference virus for the assessment of solar disinfection (SODIS) processes, since it is expected to support the standardization and interpretation of diverse experimental setups, focusing on different water matrices and using different light sources and reactor setups (Cho et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2011</xref>; Gamage et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2013</xref>; Giannakis et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2017a</xref>; Marjanovic et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2018</xref>; Mattle et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2015</xref>; Sherchan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par14">Like MS2, PRD-1 (a coated, double-stranded DNA bacteriophage with an approximate diameter of 65 nm), PMMoV (a rod-shaped, 18 × 312 nm RNA virus used as a non-pathogenic fecal indicator), bacteriophages related to non-pathogenic human gut microbiota (e.g. ϕcrAssphage and ϕB124-14, spherical, double-stranded DNA viruses with diameters of approximately 50 nm and 75 nm, respectively), as well as adenoviruses and polyomaviruses have been proposed as indicators for contamination and microbial-source tracking and have been used for the evaluation of viral disinfection in advanced water treatment systems (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

Similarly to MS2, adenovirus is sensitive to ROS but relatively resistant to direct inactivation, while phiX174 (single-stranded DNA) was found to display the contrary behaviour (Mattle et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2015</xref>) Gerba et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2018</xref>) stressed out the need to use the appropriate viruses for the assessment of individual treatment processes. For example, they suggested the use of adenoviruses for the evaluation of UV light disinfection, while reoviruses have been proposed for the assessment of chlorination. (Gerba et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par16">It should be taken in consideration that, although viral inactivation may be reached by targeting the viral capsid through direct reaction of disinfectants with its constituents, the diffusion of disinfectants inside other microorganisms through an outer membrane may be required. In such case, disinfectants with a short lifetime such as those produced by photo-Fenton processes, may not be efficient. (Nieto-Juarezet et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2010</xref>) Some studies focused on the MS2 inactivation by the photo-Fenton process, but complete viral abatement was not succeeded (Ortega-Gomez et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2015</xref>). The main MS2 inactivation pathway during photo-Fenton treatment has to do with the generation of oxidants in the bulk, while bacterial inactivation is principally attributed to oxidative-stress inside the cell and, to a lesser extent, to that from the bulk concentration of hydroxyl radicals. (Giannakis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2018</xref>) Moreover, due to the absence of repair enzymes and molecular processes for the repair of nucleic acids damages, MS2 is not able to repair UV-induced RNA damages through photoreactivation, in the contrary to bacteria such as <italic>E. coli</italic>. (Song et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par17">Phage T4 is one of the biggest double-stranded DNA bacterial viruses, and it has also been used as a viral indicator in numerous studies (Ghernaout et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020</xref>). Similarly, T7 is a double-stranded DNA bacteriophage with many applications, especially in studies of solar UV disinfection assessment (Mamane et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2007</xref>). Endogenous inactivation by UVC/UVB irradiation has been found to depend on the type and size of the viral genome (Nelson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2018</xref>). Hence, MS2 which is an RNA virus, shows a different UV inactivation behaviour compared to the T series viruses, which are DNA viruses (Mamane et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2007</xref>).</p><p id="Par18">Compared to lab-made strains, naturally occurring pathogens are characterized by elevated resistance to oxidative processes (Giannakis et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>). It must be pointed out that wild strains should also be considered to successfully assess the performance of engineered treatment processes; moreover, field scale systems should also be used for the confirmation of laboratory and pilot plant experimental data. (Giannakis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2018</xref>, Gerba et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2018</xref>) Numerous confounding factors affect the correct comparison of different treatment processes (e.g. season, wastewater origin, sampling and analysis methods, etc.) (Schmitz et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2016</xref>). Moreover, the biological diversity within families and genera of viruses and specific virus types (e.g. serotypes or genotypes) is a significant source of uncertainty (Gerba et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2018</xref>). More research is needed for the elucidation of the viral behaviour in natural surface waters and engineered systems in an attempt to enhance the disinfection of hydric resources (Ghernaout et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020</xref>; Nelson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par19">Miklos et al.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2018</xref>) studied the enhancement of solar disinfection by the simultaneous addition of iron and PDS. They evaluated PDS activation by three individual factors (i.e. iron, heat and solar light), as well as their possible combinations. Authors reported that the abatement of MS2 bacteriophage was achieved in few minutes, when triple activation was applied (Marjanovic et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2018</xref>). In another study, the fate of MS2 coliphage in heterogeneous solar Fenton-like processes catalyzed by different iron (hydr)oxide particles was studied. Adsorption to goethite (α-FeOOH), magnetite (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) and amorphous iron(III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)<sub>3</sub>) was found to cause virus inactivation of 7%, 22%, and 14%, respectively. No inactivation was recorded in the absence of sunlight or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with the exception of magnetite, where partial MS2 inactivation occurred through a dark Fenton-like process. The findings of that study proved that heterogeneous Fenton-like processes can support viral abatement from water by physical removal, and inactivation by adsorption and a particle-mediated (photo-)Fenton-like process. (Nieto-Juarez &amp; Kohn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2013</xref>) Ortega-Gomez et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2015</xref>) also studied the inactivation of MS2 by solar photo-Fenton process, and assessed the effects of reactant concentrations (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>3+</sup>) and solar irradiance on the process. Complete MS2 inactivation (from 10<sup>6</sup> PFU/mL to the detection limit) was achieved with 1 mg/ L Fe<sup>3+</sup> after 60 min of solar irradiance at 45 W/m<sup>2</sup>, in the absence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. After the addition of 1 mg/L H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, complete inactivation was achieved after 20 min at 30 W/m<sup>2</sup>. Additionally, it was observed that the process with Fe<sup>3+</sup> was faster than with Fe<sup>2+</sup>, showing that the source of iron may be a significant inactivation parameter. MS2 and echovirus inactivation by the photo-Fenton process was also tested in natural water samples. Echovirus was more resistant than MS2 and, in either case, inactivation rates were reduced presumably due to the competition between the natural organic matter and the virus for oxidative species. (Ortega-Gomez et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par24">In another study of Nieto-Juarez et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2010</xref>) regarding MS2 inactivation by iron- and copper catalyzed Fenton-like systems, it was found that viral reduction followed a first-order rate in relation to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. For the Cu/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> system, the rate constant increased with increasing copper concentration up to 2.5 μM, above which it reached a plateau, thus implying that only soluble copper was responsible for viral inactivation. On the other hand, inactivation in the Fe/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> system was dictated by colloidal iron. Moreover, solar irradiation influenced only the Fe/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> system; oxidants such as ferryl species could have also been implicated, complementing the action of hydroxyl radicals (Nieto-Juarez et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2010</xref>).</p><p id="Par25">Giannakis et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2017b</xref>) investigated the application of heterogeneous photo-Fenton process for MS2 disinfection in wastewater matrices. They reported that low concentrations of iron oxides (wüstite, magnetite, maghemite) in wastewater without H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> resulted in restricted semiconductor-mediated MS2 inactivation. The dissolved organic matter was proved to be a catalyst poison since it competes with MS2 for the active sites and oxidants. A significant enhancement of the abatement process was shown after the addition of low amounts of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, leading to heterogeneous photo-Fenton processes on the surface of the oxides. The use of nano-sized iron oxides caused an increase of the active sites of the catalyst which in turn increased the active photo-Fenton sites positively affecting viral abatement. Moreover, partial photo-dissolution of iron in the bulk led to homogeneous photo-Fenton, which was supported by the complexation by the dissolved organic matter in the solution. According to the authors, the financial feasibility of such systems based on magnetically separable and reusable catalysts will affect the implementation of photo-Fenton treatment processes in combination with UVA, medium pressure UV lamps or solar light. In another study of photo-Fenton process assessment Giannakis et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017c</xref>), evaluated the effect of principal parameters, such as Fe species and concentration, solar irradiance, pH and microbial competition on MS2 disinfection in wastewater. They found that ferrous materials were more effective than their ferric counterparts, resulting in faster abatement at any combination of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration, sunlight irradiance or starting pH (6–8). Initial treatment with Fe(II) caused the presence of more free iron ions in solution compared to Fe(III), which led to higher inactivation kinetics. Even so, exposure for 30 min at 600 W/m<sup>2</sup> in the presence of Fe(III):H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at 1:1 ratio resulted in a 4-log MS2 reduction. Finally, it was shown that MS2 inactivation was moderately reduced in the presence of the bacterial host, indicating a limited competition for the oxidants in the bulk. Although ROS scavengers were present, an effective inactivation of MS2 was recorded (Giannakis et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017c</xref>).</p><p id="Par26">In another study, Giannakis et al.

Disinfection kinetics were investigated in the presence and absence of iohexol (an iodinated contrast medium). A reduction of the viral load by approximately 4-logs was recorded for UVC and UVC/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment after 2 and 1.5 min of exposure, respectively. MS2 bacteriophage was found to cause an average 45% reduction of the bacterial inactivation in all studied matrices, and similarly, <italic>E. coli</italic> was shown to delay the inactivation of MS2, except in synthetic wastewater matrices. Interestingly, the study showed that a rapid bacterial and viral inactivation was achieved even in the presence of significant quantities of iohexol, as found in hospital effluents.

The sunlight is absorbed by virus, but it is also absorbed by external chromophores, which subsequently generate reactive species finally attacking viral targets (Mattle et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2015</xref>). Photocatalysis is an attractive “green” disinfection strategy since solar energy is used and there is no need of additional oxidants. It is mainly based on semiconductors that are sensitive to the UVA and/or visible regions of the solar spectrum and, thus, the disinfection processes are based on the photoinduced electron–hole pairs on the excited semiconductor to produce different ROS (Chen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2021</xref>). Numerous semiconductors have been applied but titanium dioxide (either as such or in various modified forms) has been extensively used due to its interesting characteristics (chemical inertness, high photoactivity, non-toxicity, low cost) (Brienza &amp; Katsoyiannis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par28">In the study of Mattle et al.

Moreover, the second-order rate constants of four reactive species (OH•, <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>3</sub><sup>•−</sup>, triplet states) implicated in indirect inactivation process were estimated. φX174 was more sensitive to direct inactivation, with the highest quantum yield, than the other studied viruses.

A predictive model was used to assess the solar disinfection of MS2 and φX174 in a natural water sample.

MS2 abatement was increased by the addition of 2.5–5 mg/L H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with a reduction of more than 7 log10, while qPCR showed only a 3–4-log10 reduction in viral RNA copy number, an indication that this technique overestimates the infective viruses (Sherchan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2014</xref>). It is well recognized that compared to the traditional culture-based methods, sequence-specific DNA amplification strategies can significantly decrease the required time of microbiological/virological analyses of environmental samples, especially for non- or slow-culturable organisms/virus types. However it is also known that a positive PCR result does not discriminate between infective and inactivated viruses since viral nucleic acid can also be amplified even when no infective virus is present.

No synergy was recorded for the treatment by UV irradiation followed by free chlorine, while increased inactivation was found when H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was added in the primary UV disinfection step. In this case, a significant synergy was recorded since an additional 1.5-log inactivation was added to the 2 logs occurring by UV treatment and free chlorine. The synergistic effect was based on the additional inactivation achieved during the primary UV disinfection step due to the generation of hydroxyl radicals during H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> photolysis, and also on the microbial injury during the primary step which facilitated the subsequent secondary chlorine disinfection. Overall the addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the primary step, and thus the conversion of the UV process to an AOP, could significantly enhance the efficiency of UV/free chlorine sequential disinfection processes (Cho et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2011</xref>). Similarly, a UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-Cl<sub>2</sub> integrated flow through system was assessed by Chu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2012</xref>) for MS2 disinfection. A 5.78 log abatement was achieved at a flow rate at 50 L/h (corresponding to a hydraulic retention time HRT = 7 s), while a 4.49 log removal was achieved at a flow rate of 100 L/h (HRT = 36 s) (Chu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2012</xref>) Mamane et al.

Authors reported that bacteriophages T4 in phosphate buffered saline were sensitive to irradiation &gt; 295 nm in the absence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, nonetheless, MS2 was very resistant. Overall, sensitivity decreased in the order: T4 &gt; T7 &gt; MS2, with MS2 suffering no inactivation at wavelengths &gt; 295 nm. Interestingly, the addition of 25 mg/L H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> under UV irradiation for 15 min resulted in 2.5-logs of MS2 inactivation, had a small additional effect on T7 inactivation (of 1 log), but it did not result in any additional T4 disinfection (Mamane et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2007</xref>). To investigate dye-virus interactions, Timchak and Gitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2012</xref>) used various combinations of phages (MS2, φX174 and T4) and fluorescent dyes (rhodamine B and fluorescein) to study inactivation and degradation processes.

The presence of viruses caused the reduction of the bleaching of fluorescent dyes presumably due to restricted availability of hydroxyl radicals and their preferential involvement in virus inactivation (Timchak &amp; Gitis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2012</xref>).

Ozone-based AOPs are characterized by elevated capital and operating costs, and high electric power consumption besides other drawbacks, such as low water solubility of ozone and formation of hazardous by-products (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) (Brienza &amp; Katsoyiannis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2017</xref>; Rasalingam et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par38">King et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2020</xref>) assessed ozone treatment of pathogens and pollutants in reverse osmosis (RO) concentrates produced during the potable reuse of municipal wastewaters. Approximately 5-log removal was observed at 0.30 mg O<sub>3</sub>/mg of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) when 10<sup>6</sup>–10<sup>7</sup> PFU/mL of MS2 were spiked into RO concentrate samples from facilities where nitrite was not measurable. Samples from facilities, which contained nitrite, required higher O<sub>3</sub> doses to achieve 5-log inactivation of MS2. However, ozonation led to a 5-log abatement of MS2 in all concentrate samples at 1.18 mg O<sub>3</sub>/mg of DOC. Due to its higher selectivity, ozone may be a more effective oxidant for controlling pathogens in RO concentrates compared to other AOPs which are based only on hydroxyl radicals, given that the contact time is sufficient before its rapid degradation and partial conversion to hydroxyl radicals (King et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2020</xref>) Gamage et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2013</xref>) assessed ozone and ozone/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for MS2 inactivation in secondary wastewater effluents. Time-integrated dissolved ozone concentrations of 1 mg·L<sup>−1</sup>·min caused MS2 inactivation higher than 6 logs. Various process control indicators, i.e. ozone to DOC ratio, differential UV<sub>254</sub> absorbance and differential total fluorescence were also assessed in the context of this study and they were found useful for predicting the inactivation of MS2 (Gamage et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2013</xref>). To assess the disinfection efficiency of ozone and hydrogen peroxide treatment at a pilot plant, different phages (MS2, φX174, and PRD-1) were used in the study of Sommer et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2004</xref>). The ozone/hydrogen peroxide process was found to have a significant microbicidal effect. MS2 bacteriophage and phages φX174 and PRD-1 showed a reduction of approximately 6 logs. These findings corresponded to ozone disinfection in controlled batch experiments (residual 0.4 mg/L after 4 min contact time, 20°C) (Sommer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2004</xref>). In another study, catalytic ozonation with a volcanic rock led to complete abatement of all target viruses (norovirus genotype I, II, and JC virus) from secondary municipal wastewater, while JC polyomavirus could not be eliminated even after 150 min of treatment by non-catalytic ozonation (Gomes et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Hydrodynamic Cavitation</title><p id="Par39">Sun et al. (2020) have summarized the fundamental principles of hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) and the recent progress achieved in HC disinfection. HC is a promising emerging technology for large-scale disinfection without the need of using chemicals. Interestingly, it may generate extreme conditions (pressures of ~ 1000 bar, local hotspots of ~ 5000 K, high oxidation—hydroxyl radicals) which in turn can be highly destructive for microorganisms in water matrices. Kosel et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2017</xref>) studied the effect of hydrodynamic cavitation on MS2 infectivity. Reductions of viral infectivity higher than 4-logs were recorded using small scale reactors. Authors underlined the viral disinfection efficiency of wastewater and discussed the potential of using cavitation generators for large-scale applications (Kosel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Photocatalytic Membrane Reactor</title><p id="Par40">When an AOP such as photocatalysis is combined with membrane filtration, high quality water may be produced by the combination of filtration/photocatalytic inactivation, in a single step treatment Horovitz et al.

Authors used water of different quality to investigate the viral removal efficiency of a N-doped TiO<sub>2</sub>-coated Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> PMR and they recorded a viral abatement of 4.9 ± 0.1 log (&gt; 99.99%) in natural surface water under irradiation. Complex virus–PMR interactions were found to occur even before the exposure to light. Electrostatic forces, in addition to photocatalytic inactivation, were also responsible for viral abatement in complex matrices. Although alkaline water pH reduced interactions and, consequently, the extent of viral abatement, the addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> had a beneficial effect (Horovitz et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Photo-Electro-Oxidation</title><p id="Par41">The main advantage of photo-electro-oxidation processes is that they do not require the use of additional chemicals and/or disinfectants, while they operate at ambient conditions of pressure and temperature (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). On the other hand, they are frequently characterized by low selectivity and reaction rates. Their application may be restricted by high operational costs associated with the use of UV irradiation and electric power (Monteiro et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2015</xref>; Rasalingam et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par42">A 60-min treatment by the photo-electro oxidation process was capable of decreasing human adenovirus type 5 (HAdV-5) by 7 log10 in no DNAse-treated samples.

PMMoV, ϕB124-14 and ϕcrAssphage were detected in membrane bioreactor (MBR) feeds at concentrations of approximately 10<sup>3</sup>, 10<sup>5</sup> and 10<sup>6</sup> gene copies/mL, respectively. Only PMMoV was detected above the limit of quantification in the MBR filtrate (25 ± 8 gene copies/mL). Viral log removal values were found to be 1.4 ± 0.5 for PMMoV, &gt; 3.9 ± 0.3 for ϕB124-14 and &gt; 6.2 ± 0.3 for ϕcrAssphage (Papp et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2020</xref>). The study of Schmitz et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2016</xref>) compared the advanced Bardenpho to conventional treatment processes by assessing the abatement of eleven different types of viruses. The Bardenpho process is a multiple stage biological nutrient removal process without any addition of chemicals and in the study of Schmitz et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2016</xref>) was composed of serial compartments (anaerobic, anoxic, oxic, anoxic, and oxic). Interestingly, the advanced Bardenpho wastewater treatment was proved to be more efficient than conventional treatments in reducing pathogenic viruses. The highest mean reduction values were recorded for nine target virus types, and also the highest rate of removal to concentrations below the detection limit was achieved. Mean reduction of viruses as calculated by the mean difference between influent and effluent sample sets were &gt; 2.7 ± 1.6, &gt; 2.7 ± 0.9, &gt; 1.7 ± 1.4, &gt; 2.6 ± 0.6, &gt; 3.6 ± 0.4, &gt; 3.0 ± 0.6, &gt; 2.5 ± 0.5, &gt; 1.7 ± 1.1, &gt; 3.3 ± 1.2, &gt; 3.1 ± 0.5, &gt; 3.4 ± 1.1 for pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), Aichi virus (AiV), genogroup I, II, and IV noroviruses (GI NoV, GII NoV, GIV NoV), enterovirus (EV), sapovirus (SaV), group-A rotavirus (ARV), adenovirus (AdV), JC and BK polyomaviruses (JCPyV and BKPyV), respectively. Following the advanced Bardenpho treatment all viruses except PMMoV were found at concentrations of &lt; 4.0 log<sub>10</sub> copies/L. Aichi virus was found to be a conservative index virus for the assessment of viral removal in wastewater treatment. Bardenpho processes were the major sources of virus removal probably because of virus sorption to solids (Schmitz et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par45">Vaidya et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2019</xref>) compared the performance of two pilot-scale, advanced water treatment plants with different treatment processes, a carbon-based and a membrane-based. The carbon-based treatment process involved flocculation/sedimentation, ozone-biofiltration, granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption, and ultraviolet (UV) disinfection. The membrane-based treatment process was composed of ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, and UV-hydrogen peroxide advanced oxidation steps. In both water treatment processes, a &gt; 8-log removal of MS2 and &gt; 6-log removal of Pepper mild mottle virus was achieved (Vaidya et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2019</xref>). An advanced oxidation-based net-zero water (NZW) pilot system was evaluated in the study of Gassie et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2016</xref>). The system consisted of a septic tank, membrane bioreactor (MBR), aluminum electrocoagulation (EC), flocculation, vacuum ultrafiltration, peroxone or UV-hydrogen peroxide advanced oxidation, chlorine disinfection, and point-of use granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration. No viruses (somatic, male-specific coliphage and adenovirus) were found in the treated water, although adenovirus genetic material was detected probably due to the presence of inactive viral particles in hydraulic dead zones (Gassie et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2016</xref>) Pecson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2017</xref>) assessed the efficiency of a full-scale, direct potable reuse demonstration facility. The treatment train included ozonation, biological activated carbon, micro- or ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, and a UV-based advanced oxidation process. Performance distribution functions evidenced treatment that consistently surpassed the 12-log thresholds for virus, as required for potable reuse in California (Pecson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par46">Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> summarizes the studies which have used only MS2 bacteriophage as the index virus, while Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> summarizes the studies which have assessed more than one viruses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Future Aspects</title><p id="Par47">Although constructed wetlands, stabilization ponds and membrane filtration have traditionally been employed for microbial abatement, the use of AOPs as tertiary or disinfection processes capable of dealing with resistant microbial targets, including viruses, has received less attention (Meric &amp; Fatta Kassinos, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2009</xref>). The increasing application of AOPs has been recognized as one of the most promising technological strategies for efficient water treatment, as well as the safe discharge or potential reuse of wastewater effluents. Specifically, photo-Fenton processes have been proven to be effective for the treatment of secondary effluents and potable water and are also efficient against micropollutants and different microbial targets (Galeano et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2019</xref>; Giannakis et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2017a</xref>; Gogate &amp; Pandit, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2004</xref>). Of course, AOPs suffer from certain limitations, including the production of significant quantities of ferrous sludge associated with Fenton and alike processes, costly chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide and ozone, elevated installation and operating costs for UV/ozone processes, etc. (Srivastav et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2020</xref>). Interestingly, such limitations can partly be counter-balanced through process integration, involving the coupling of various AOPs either together or to other physical and/or biological processes. For instance, the synergy recorded when two or more AOPs are combined is mainly due to the enhancement of free radicals production, which in turn is responsible for increased oxidation rates, but also to the modification of the reactor conditions and/or configuration (Gogate &amp; Pandit, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2004</xref>). Although viral abatement in water and wastewater matrices is a tricky task, the application of advanced water treatment trains is expected to support the efficient disinfection goals. The adoption of a multi-barrier techniques’ approach is expected to reduce the risks due to the prevalence of viruses for both the environment and public health (Ghernaout et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par48">To promote the application of AOPs in real world scenarios, issues such as i) the investigation of metabolites generated during the process, ii) the examination of biological safety linked to cytotoxic and/or genotoxic effects, and iii) the execution of scaling-up and economic feasibility studies, have to be taken into account (Galeano et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2019</xref>). AOPs are expected to find broader full-scale applications, according to the trend which is recorded during the last decade. Most probably, diverse technological solutions will be applied locally, according to the specific prevailing conditions (e.g. solar driven processes will be adopted in areas with high solar irradiation levels) (Kokkinos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2020</xref>). Omics tools (high throughput sequencing, metagenomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, etc.), are expected to further support the exploitation of the viral diversity in water matrices and also to elucidate the mechanisms of disinfection achieved by treatment methods such as AOPs. They will also expand the research from culturable pathogens and indicators to whole microbial communities (Nelson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par49">To compare fairly the disinfection potential of various AOPs with particular focus on the virological quality of water matrices, energy consumption and treatment cost, it would be interesting to link the EEO values with the viral load. This could provide a useful tool for the selection of the most effective processes for viral abatement with the higher potential for full-scale applications according to energy and operational cost.</p><p id="Par50">The current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has stressed out, among others, the need to better understand wastewater as potential source of epidemiological data, environmental and human health risks, and to effectively disinfect wastewater to reduce the risks to the public and the environment (Carraturo, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2020</xref>; Kitajima et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2020</xref>; Wang, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2020</xref>). Limited research data are available on endogenous and exogenous reaction rates of enveloped viruses (Nelson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2018</xref>). The implications of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in water and wastewater matrices have to be clarified, along with its fate during different treatment processes. According to Ghernaout et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020</xref>), the combination of UV irradiation with membrane ultrafiltration will successfully remove coronaviruses from water matrices (Ghernaout et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020</xref>). The role of AOPs, alone or in combination with other processes in wastewater and drinking water treatment plants in the event of future pandemics may be crucial towards safeguarding public and environmental health.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group
