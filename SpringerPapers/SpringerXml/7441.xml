For the past few decades, numerous reports have been published in view of MN’s synthesis; but addressing the challenges and its associated problems of MNs is very limited.

Such kind of NP’s production methods were accomplished by photolithographic techniques, grinding, sputtering, and milling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Each method has its limitations and fine production capacity of NPs. The top-down approach is quite a feasible technique resulting in the production of a large mass of NPs. But the disadvantages associated with top-down are surface imperfection of NPs and in some cases, NP’s may get damaged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

The plant material (leaves) will be available at all times and all seasons. Moreover, the plants will not be affected by using leaves but using other resources like a flower, fruit, seed, root, and latex will also be meaningful but the volume of materials and it should not affect crop productivity. Moreover, the plant-based nanoparticles are reproducible, stable, and environmentally friendly also. In plant-mediated nanoparticles, various parameters like pH, precursor, and extract concentration, time, and other factors will determine the size of nanoparticles. Since plant constituents were different in species and genera level, so optimization of these parameters will eventually produce nanoparticles with the desired size and shape. Another important concern of nanoparticles is stability. The colloidal stability of nanoparticles is important for long-term application studies. Comparatively, chemical-mediated synthesis of nanoparticles is stable for a long duration; biological synthesis of nanoparticles stability is determined by the capping agents. In a study, silver nanoparticles are synthesized chemically and biologically; the zeta potential of chemical AgNPs is 17.8 mV and biological AgNPs are 15.2 mV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. In biological nanoparticles, the stability of the nanoparticles solution is due to the stabilization of the metal particles by the biomolecules. Moreover, the stability of the nanoparticles is determined by pH, surface capping agents, and functionalization techniques.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Effect of pH</title><p id="Par76">The role of pH during nanoparticle synthesis not only affects size but also the shape of the particle. Yang and Li [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>] demonstrated the shape of the product prepared under lower pH was less regular and tend to aggregate.

The pH causes the local surface of nanoparticles by protonation and deprotonation of molecular atoms in the nucleation and growth stage of NPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. At the alkaline pH range, the NPs forms cluster distribution in the colloidal stage preventing aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Armendari et al.

This phenomenon may be due to too many reducing agents bound to the surface of preformed nuclei, which intensifies the secondary reduction of silver ions on the surface of the nuclei. Consequently, the growth rate of NPs is increased, leading to larger NPs. On the other hand, too many reducing agents may enhance the bridging effect among the formed NPs, resulting in the aggregation of NPs. This may be due to too many metal ions absorbed on the surface of preformed nuclei, where the secondary reduction process occurred leading to form larger NPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. Not only size, but the shape of NPs will also get affected (Tables <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Chandran et al.

Conventionally, steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are administered for inflammation but the side effect exerted by the drugs had an adverse effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>]. Nano-based herbal formulation is proved as a pioneer in developing anti-inflammatory drugs. Numerous articles emphasize the metallic NPs synthesized from plant extracts endowed with anti-inflammatory properties. Recently, a study concluded that silver NPs generated from <italic>Selaginella myosurus</italic> demonstrated the anti-inflammatory potential under in vivo and in vitro conditions. The study implied that AgNPs can be able to inhibit the protein denaturation, which is an important phenomenon in inflammation in the Carrageenan-induced rat hind paw edema model AgNPs that interferes with the release of acute inflammatory mediators [histamines, serotonin, kinins, prostaglandins, and cyclooxygenase products] and antagonizes their action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>].

Generally, wounds are classified into two types, namely acute and chronic wounds, based on healing time and other complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Healing of wound is a phenomenal process in which various factors intricate each other between various cell types, coagulation factors, connective tissue, growth factors, cytokines, and the vascular system. There are four phases of the wound healing process: (i) hemostasis phase, (ii) inflammatory phase, (iii) proliferative phase, and (iv) maturation phase. These four phases are a complex process and coordinately function altogether to heal the wound. Failure in any phase led to chronic wound and its complications are severe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>]. Moreover, other factors lead to impaired wound healing, such as diabetes, obesity, malnutrition, medication, and lifestyle habits, including excessive alcohol intake and smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>]. The current therapies involve the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy, negative pressure wound therapy, bioengineered cell construct, dressing materials, and vascular surgery. Besides medications like steroidal drugs (glucocorticoid drugs), nonsteroidal drugs (ibuprofen, naproxen, rofecoxib, and celecoxib) and chemotherapeutic drugs (bevacizumab, lenvatinib, cabozantinib, brivanib, refametinib, and everolimus) are commonly practiced.

But howsoever, with the advent of science and technology, researchers drive their focus in wound therapy by involving herbal extracts with nano concepts to address the specificity and complexity associated with wounds. Nano-based approaches for wound therapy is comprised of two groups; in one group, nanomaterials (metals, metal oxide, metalloid) acts as a drug for wound healing while the latter nanomaterials (growth factors, nucleic acids, small molecules) act as vehicles/delivery agent to repair wound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>].</p><p id="Par87">Recently, silver NPs generated from <italic>Lindera strychnifolia</italic> claimed to have wound healing property determined by the cell scratch method on NIH3T3 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>].

The synthesized copper oxide NPs rendered superior wound healing activity and upregulated major 60, 47, 32, 26, and 25 kDa proteins which play an important role in the different phases of wound repair, wound contraction, and re-epithelialization process.

Further, BNC/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanocomposite triggers the expression of TGF-β1, CTNNB1, MMP2, MMP9, WNT4 and downregulate the expression miR-29b and miR-29c gene. These genes play a pivotal role in the wound healing process and henceforth the nanocomposite is a prominent agent in wound healing. Shao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>] reported that <italic>Barleria gibsoni</italic> leaf extract-mediated zinc oxide NPs ameliorated the wound healing effectively in male albino Wistar rats. Likewise, <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic>-mediated titanium dioxide NPs improve the healing efficacy in an excised wound in male albino Wistar rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>]. The underlying mechanism behind the wound healing efficacy is not yet clearly understood. But regarding the literature report, we can plausibly affirm that the wound healing reaction is initiated by inhibiting the proliferation of the microbial population. Further, inorganic metallic NPs induce ROS and activate angiogenesis by downregulating 38MAPK/Akt/eNOS-dependent pathway and upregulating key angiogenesis growth factors like vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] and fibroblast growth factor [FGF] to accelerate wound healing. Henceforth, it is very essential to understand the molecular mechanism of inorganic metallic NPs-mediated wound healing process for developing metallic NPs as an alternative for wound treatment. Therefore, it is indeed to carry out extensive research to determine the effect of metallic NPs in differing phases of wound healing, toxicity, and biocompatibility to develop NPs as therapeutic potential.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Anticancer activity of metallic nanoparticles</title><p id="Par88">Cancer is a dreadful global disease causing major health problems and mortality, accounting for 8.8 million deaths worldwide in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>].

These viruses cause pathologically complicated diseases and if left untreated or vaccinated it will worsen or in some cases, death may occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">174</xref>]. In the present scenario, numerous antibiotics identified from plant and microbial sources have been developed and formulated and commercialized as antiviral agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175">175</xref>].
