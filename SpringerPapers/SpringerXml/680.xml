Perovskite cells prepared with the most common perovskite solvent <italic>N,N</italic>-dimethylformamide (DMF) by different research groups exhibit disparate efficiencies and stability for nominally identical perovskite films. Although the differences can be related to processing conditions, a consistent physical cause for the differences has been lacking. Highly-sensitive time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) reveals significant dimethylamine (DMA) included in perovskite films. TOF-SIMS and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results suggest DMA levels ranging from roughly 10–50%. Only the highest levels register as perovskite peak shifts in x-ray diffraction; lower levels are invisible. We propose that methylamine (MA) can react with DMF solvent by transamidation to produce dimethylamine (DMA), which then displaces some MA in perovskite crystals, see Fig. 1. Transamidation of DMF can be catalyzed by TiO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, water, or acid, but in perovskite films transamidation is inhibited by water.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>24</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>20</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Materials Research Society</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>9</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>26</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/43578_2017_Article_32010045.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Materials Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Materials Science, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Biomaterials</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Nanotechnology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Inorganic Chemistry</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Materials Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Applied and Technical Physics</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p>To view supplementary material for this article, please visit <ext-link xlink:href="10.1557/jmr.2016.272" ext-link-type="doi">https://doi.org/10.1557/jmr.2016.272</ext-link>.

We turned to time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS), the chemical microscope, to identify changes in chemical composition of perovskite films.</p><p>We present a reaction of DMF that occurs during perovskite film formation, but that has gone un-noticed until now. TOF-SIMS identifies dimethylamine (DMA) after film formation, which we propose is a product of transamidation of DMF (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). DMA is present in films formed by two representative methods of perovskite solar cell film preparation that use DMF (two-step sequential deposition and one-step spin-coating), suggesting that the reaction is generally applicable when DMF is used. But DMA is not present in perovskite formed without DMF (single crystal, and solvent-less vapor deposition of perovskite films), correlating with improved stability when DMF is not used. We confirmed the presence of DMA by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and x-ray diffraction (XRD), and suggest how DMA might influence stability or degradation.

This reduction is consistent with depletion of excess MAI by annealing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref> However, the carbon content increased relative to nitrogen. Increasing carbon is consistent with transamidation. Transamidation adds carbon by replacing MA (C:N = 1:1) with DMA (C:N = 2:1); the extra carbon comes from DMF solvent molecules. Carbon content exceeds the carbon in the original MAI and approaches 1.5 atoms of carbon for each nitrogen atom (50% MA + 50% DMA). Two-step perovskite may have 10% DMA, while DMF solution-prepared perovskite can have up to 50% DMA content.</p><p>When DMF was present, we observed perovskite XRD peaks gradually transform into a PbI<sub>2</sub>–DMF complex. More DMF produced more intense peaks from the complex. After heating above 90 °C, the peaks irreversibly reverted to perovskite peaks. However, the most intense DMF peaks (before annealing) were associated with XRD peak shifts in the perovskite peaks to smaller diffraction angles (after annealing). Similar shifts have been observed when some MA is replaced by FA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref> Because DMA is similar in size with formamidinium, shifting is consistent with replacement of some MA by DMA in perovskite. No XRD peak shift was observed for our high-efficiency, two-step films that have roughly 10% DMA (based on TOF-SIMS). This suggests that ∼10% impurities in perovskite can easily hide in high-performance solar cells prepared by methods common in the literature.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref> In contrast, roughly 50% DMA (based on XPS ratios, Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) induced a measurable shift of 0.1 degree in XRD. Considering that perovskite with 15% formamidinium, a similarly sized cation, induced a shift of 0.2 degrees,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref> either DMA’s effective size is smaller, or not all of the DMA gets incorporated into the perovskite structure. Considering that a film formed from DMAI and PbI<sub>2</sub> has a high enough band gap to be mostly transparent and does not exhibit perovskite peaks (Fig. S13), the latter option is more likely.</p><p>We observed a reversible transition that this suggests that water could inhibit transamidation between perovskite and a complex with water that dominates if water is present, but disappears after sufficient annealing (Figs. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and S5). The complex includes more methylammonium iodide and water relative to lead than perovskite does. Because water is still present as humidity, termination of the reversible transition is more likely due to loss of methylammonium iodide and convergence to stoichiometric perovskite (Fig. S7 and S8). Samples exposed to humid air (pre-annealing), which also produced the water-complex transition in XRD did not exhibit the shifted XRD peaks due to DMA incorporation (post-annealing). Perhaps the transient structure protects the perovskite components until annealing converges the composition to stoichiometric perovskite. Transamidation could explain why some published works claim water improves perovskite.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></p></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusion"><title>V. CONCLUSIONS</title><p>TOF-SIMS conclusively identified DMA in high-performing PSC films that were prepared using DMF. We suggest that perovskite researchers consider TOF-SIMS as a powerful and perhaps even necessary tool for chemical characterization of perovskites. Based on TOF-SIMS, XPS, and XRD, we believe transamidation of DMF produces DMA, some of which is inserted into the perovskite crystal. The extent of transamidation and perovskite incorporation of DMA, which could be as high as 50% for some methods, depend on the environment and annealing conditions. DMA could explain the variability in results in the literature. Although we did not measure the effect that DMA has on perovskite performance, films prepared from pure DMAI + PbI<sub>2</sub> are transparent and are not perovskites. This suggests that DMA is detrimental. Finding an alternative solvent that is not chemically reactive will likely further improve thin film perovskite solar cell performance. NMF is a potential alternative.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by funding from the Energy Materials and Surface Sciences Unit of the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University.
