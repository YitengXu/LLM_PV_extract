Increased salt delivers reduced feature sizes down to line widths as small as 78 nm, a level of structural intricacy that represents a significant advance in fabrication complexity. The development of a general methodology to efficiently mix pentaerythritol triacrylate (PETA) with gold chloride hydrate (HAuCl<sub>4</sub>∙3H<sub>2</sub>O) is reported, where the gold salt concentration is adjustable on demand from zero to 20 wt%. For the first-time 7-Diethylamino-3-thenoylcoumarin (DETC) is used as the photoinitiator. Only 0.5 wt% of DETC was required to promote both polymerisation and photoreduction of up to 20 wt% of gold salt. This efficiency is the highest reported for Au-containing composite fabrication by two-photon lithography. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis confirmed the presence of small metallic nanoparticles (5.4 ± 1.4 nm for long axis / 3.7 ± 0.9 nm for short axis) embedded within the polymer matrix, whilst X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed that they exist in the zero valent oxidation state. UV-vis spectroscopy defined that they exhibit the property of localised surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). The capability demonstrated in this study opens up new avenues for a range of applications, including plasmonics, metamaterials, flexible electronics and biosensors.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>11</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>27</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2017_Article_17391.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="Misc"><p>A correction to this article is available online at <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-21513-8" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-21513-8</ext-link>.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Metal-containing nanocomposites have numerous advanced optical, mechanical, electrical and photovoltaic properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Thus, recent advancement in the diverse fields of metamaterials, plasmonics, flexible electronics, biosensors, artificial implants and solar cells have generated a significant demand for the fabrication of Au-containing nanocomposites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, the traditional techniques for the production of such nanocomposites are either inherently limited to two-dimensional (2D) processing and/or involve multiple, time- and cost-intensive synthetic steps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Two-photon lithography based additive manufacturing has been shown to overcome these limitations and fabricate arbitrary 3D micro/nano structures with resolution in the region of 100 nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Moreover, both polymeric and metallic structures have been manufactured respectively by two-photon induced polymerisation and metal salt reduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, demonstrating the potential of the technology as a layer by layer manufacturing tool.</p><p id="Par3">The combination of both processes into a single step to produce gold-containing nanocomposites was previously reported by Shukla <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, who demonstrated the fabrication of 2D periodic structures comprising <italic>in situ</italic> generated gold nanoparticles embedded in a matrix of the negative photoresist SU-8. Up to 10 wt% of gold salt was included in the formulation as a precursor for the resultant metallic nanoparticles. This method was further developed by Blasco <italic>et al</italic>. who created bridge-like conductive elements using an aqueous based solution containing 99.45 wt% of water in the resin mixture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The fabrication of gold-containing pyramidal structures was shown to be possible by Liu <italic>et al</italic>. through the addition of a ruthenium-based dye to the resin mixture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. This enhanced the efficacy of the polymerisation process but the loadings were limited to 3 wt% of the gold salt. Whilst these studies clearly demonstrate the potential to create functional 3D nanocomposite structures, the need for a more efficacious way of inducing the formation of the matrix whilst controlling the growth of the nanoparticles is still a critically requirement. Further, for a range of applications, including for example the production of metamaterials and biosensors, it is desirable to be able control the gold concentration on demand. As a consequence it is important to develop a general formula which can support a broad range of gold concentrations and can be developed through two-photon lithography.</p><p id="Par4">One barrier to the development of a general formula is the absence of a proven efficient photoinitiator that can be used to produce materials with a range of gold concentration. A candidate for this is 7-Diethylamino-3-thenoylcoumarin (DETC), which has been reported as an efficient photoinitiator for polymerisation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Compared to commonly used Type I photoinitiators, such as Irgacure 819 and Irgacure 369, DETC can reduce the initiator requirement by up to 4 times (compared to Irgacure 819) or 14 times (compared to Irgacure 369)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In fact, a level as low as 0.25 wt% DETC has been shown to be sufficient to achieve the polymerisation of pentaerythritol triacrylate (PETA) monomer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. However, no prior studies have reported the use of DETC as a photoinitiator for composite fabrication. This study reports the first demonstration of DETC as an efficient initiator for simultaneous two-photon polymerisation and photoreduction. In addition to promoting the polymerisation of PETA, only 0.5 wt% of DETC was sufficient to also promote the photoreduction of up to 20 wt% of the gold salt. This represents the highest efficiency for an initiator in the fabrication of gold-containing composites by two-photon lithography.</p><p id="Par5">In this paper, the use of DETC as an efficacious photoinitiator to promote the formation of complex 3D gold-containing nanocomposite structures using simultaneous two-photon polymerisation and photoreduction is shown. It is also demonstrated that the concentration of the gold salt in the resin mixture can be readily varied between 0 and 20 wt%, offering potential for the control of the resultant hybrid microstructure. The feature size can be effectively reduced by incorporation of a gold salt into the resin mixture, with line width as small as 78 nm has been shown to be possible under these conditions. The structural intricacy demonstrated here represents a significant advance in the fabrication complexity achievable. The gold nanoparticles generated <italic>in situ</italic> exhibit a remarkable optical property of localised surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). The capability demonstrated in this study opens new avenues for a range of applications, including plasmonics, metamaterials, flexible electronics and biosensors. In particularly, user-defined 3D composite structures can be readily fabricated in this way.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p id="Par6">A general additive manufacturing (AM) method to synthesis nanocomposites by simultaneous two-photon polymerisation and photoreduction is illustrated in Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The first pre-resin consists of PETA with 0.5–1.5 wt% of the photoinitiator DETC, whilst the second gold salt pre-resin contains gold(III) chloride hydrate (HAuCl<sub>4</sub>∙3H<sub>2</sub>O) and 0.5–1.5 wt% DETC dissolved in N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc). These two resins are always prepared to contain the same concentration of DETC which are then mixed to achieve the desired gold concentration. The compositions of the 15 individual formulations that were used in this study are summarized in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>. A mixture composed of two pre-resins is loaded onto a glass substrate. A near-infrared (780 nm) femtosecond laser beam is then focused into the resin mixture, such that the photoinitiator is excited by the simultaneous absorption of two photons. This excitation subsequently triggered local chemical reactions, including monomer polymerisation, cross linking and metal salt reduction. In this way, both the polymer matrix and metal nanoparticles were formed simultaneously. As a direct result of this methodology, the <italic>in-situ</italic> generated nanoparticles were instantaneously embedded in a polymer matrix, preventing their further growth.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Illustration a general method of fabricating nanocomposites by simultaneous two-photon polymerisation and photoreduction.

A photoinitiator is excited by the simultaneous absorption of two photons, and triggers local chemical reactions, including monomer polymerisation, cross linking and metal salt reduction (image on the right). In this way, both polymer (orange) and metal nanoparticles (red) are formed simultaneously.

The DETC and the gold salt content was then systematically varied and the threshold (the minimum laser power) required for the formation of a structure with each gold loading was determined (See Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref> for the details of the methodology). As shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, the presence of the gold salt significantly increased the laser energy required to achieve polymerisation. This extra energy is believed to be required to compensate for the energy consumption involved in the gold salt reduction.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The relationship between the polymerisation threshold and the gold salt concentration for different levels of initiator concentration in the mixture.

Further increases in the DETC concentration above 0.5 wt% were observed to have little effect on the polymerisation threshold. However, for the gold containing mixtures, our previous work on a Type I initiator in resin mixture had found that surplus initiator was needed, as both polymerisation and metal ion reduction consumed the generated free radicals. Thus a lack of free radicals was found to lower the efficacy of the reactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. For example, it was shown that to fabricate PETA-Au composites containing 3 wt% gold precursor, 3 wt% Type I initiator 2-benzyl-2-(dimethylamino)-4′-morpholinobutyrophenone (DBMP) was required<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In this study, a Type II initiator (DETC) was found to be far more efficient in this process. Additional DETC was also noted to reduce the polymerisation threshold (see Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This was attributed to the higher concentration of initiator leading to a higher probability of radical formation, therefore the minimum required energy for radical formation was reduced accordingly.</p><p id="Par9">For controlled 3D structure fabrication, sufficient material stability is needed to maintain the desired shape after laser exposure, <italic>i.e</italic>., the material must have sufficient rigidity imparted by the polymerisation process. In this study, the fabrication energy was typically set 10~20 mW above the threshold for this purpose. Furthermore, the laser power applied was also associated with the hatching distance (<italic>the distance between adjacent lines of a fill pattern</italic>), layer distance and geometry of the structure that can be achieved.</p><p id="Par10">To confirm the success of the photopolymerisation process, samples were analysed by Raman spectroscopy (see Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>). The degree of polymer conversion (DC) is estimated by measuring the ratio change of the peak areas associated with the C=C bonds to the C=O bonds before and after polymerisation. This is based on the assumption that during polymerisation and cross-linking, the C=C bonds in the monomer are attached by the radicals such that their band order is reduced and are converted to carbon-carbon single bonds (C‒C). Meanwhile, the C=O bonds do not change due to their non-participation in these radical reactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The DC of pure PETA was shown to be similar to the results reported by Jiang <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Increases in the DC were observed with increasing laser power and the maximum achievable DC was limited to below 50% due to the restricted mobility of the oligomers. Our results also showed that under the same laser processing conditions, the DC decreases with a corresponding increase in the concentration of the gold precursor. This was associated with the energy consumption by the photoreduction, which leads to the effective energy for photopolymerisation being reduced accordingly. This finding is consistent with the observed relationship between the gold concentration and the polymerisation threshold. Furthermore, the presence of solvent molecules in the resin mixture was demonstrated to result in the effective dilution of the monomer, making the cross linking less efficient. Therefore, as the concentration of gold increases, higher laser energy is required.</p><p id="Par11">It was also found that the feature size of the fabricated structure that could be achieved decreased with increasing gold salt concentration in the mixture. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> compares five samples prepared under the same processing conditions. The line width of the sample prepared with 20% gold salt was about 4.8 times smaller than that of the sample without gold salt, exhibiting an average line width of 97 nm and minimum line width of 78 nm. This phenomenon of feature size reduction was also observed in fabricated 3D structures. The reduced feature size was mainly attributed to the energy consumed by the gold salt reduction lowering the effective energy available for polymerisation and so narrowing the portion of the laser beam which is above the threshold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. This indicates that the gold salt can be used as a further lever to reduce feature size and control the fabrication resolution achieved during two-photon lithography.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The relationship between the line width and the gold salt concentration in the resin mixture.

By comparison, the pure PETA sample is absent of any absorbance features within the analysed energy range. It is well known that the size, shape, dispersity and dielectric environment surrounding nanoscale gold particles have a significant effect on the position, symmetry and intensity of the LSPR absorbance, with ~5 nm gold nanoparticles often appearing as wine red coloured solutions (with a maximum absorbance centred at ~525 nm). However, the significant redshift of the mean position of the LSPR band to ~600 nm and the presence of a shoulder above 700 nm are strongly indicative of the formation of one-, two- and three-dimensional aggregated networks of nanoparticles, often observed in solution and in polymer matrices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.

Complex 3D structures could be successfully generated when the concentration of the gold salt in the resin mixture was in a range from zero up to 20 wt%. For the first-time DETC has been used as a photoinitiator to achieve simultaneous two-photon polymerisation and photoreduction. Furthermore, it has been identified to be the most efficient initiator reported to date, where 1 unit mass of DETC can also promote the reduction of up to 40 unit mass of gold salt, in addition to promoting polymerisation. This efficiency was attributed to the excited state absorption of radical generation. Both the polymerisation and gold salt reduction reactions have been verified by a range of microscopy and spectroscopy approaches. The polymerisation threshold was shown to increase with increasing gold salt concentration and decrease with increasing initiator concentration, which was linked to the overall level of energy needed to generate the level of radical required to complete both chemical transformations. For a particular radical concentration its degree of polymer conversion was observed to decrease with the increasing gold salt concentration which again was related to radical use in the reduction. The feature size can be tuned by the addition of the gold salt to the resin mixture, with the ability to produce line widths as small as 78 nm demonstrated, which is linked to a smaller portion of the laser beam would being able to exceed its target threshold value. Gold particles of well controlled size, <italic>i.e</italic>., average size of 5.4 ± 1.4 nm for the long axis and 3.7 ± 0.9 nm for the short axis, were shown to be generated due to being growth restricted by the polymer matrix, and a few large particles can be found on surface whose size had not been controlled. All the <italic>in-situ</italic> generated gold nanoparticles exhibit a characteristic optical property of localised surface plasmon resonance. The manufacture of various complex 3D structures has been demonstrated, where the complexity demonstrated here is far in advance of those previously observed.
