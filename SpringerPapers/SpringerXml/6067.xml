The proposed model enables us to take into account how optimal operation strategy of ESS in the lower level can affect and be affected by the optimal allocation of ESS in the upper level. The power characteristic model of micro-grid (MG) and typical daily scenarios are established to take full consideration of time-variable nature of renewable energy generations (REGs) and load demand while easing the burden of computation. To solve the bi-level mixed integer problem, a multi-subgroup hierarchical chaos hybrid algorithm is introduced based on differential evolution (DE) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). The modified IEEE-33 bus benchmark distribution system is utilized to investigate the availability and effectiveness of the proposed model and the hybrid algorithm. Results indicate that the planning model gives an adequate consideration to the optimal operation and different roles of ESS, and has the advantages of objectiveness and reasonableness.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Active distribution system</kwd><kwd>Energy storage system</kwd><kwd>Optimal planning</kwd><kwd>Bi-level

rapid growth has been experienced in the integration of REGs into distribution networks, mainly wind generation (WG) and photovoltaic (PV). However, due to natures of intermittent and difficult prediction, REGs pose new challenges to the reliability of distribution networks. In this regard, MGs and ADSs are introduced and perceived to be key technologies to alleviate aforementioned challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">As a comprehensive energy unit, MG can integrate multiple REGs and be managed autonomously. In addition, multiple MGs in ADSs can share distributed energy resources and operate them in close coordination. Therefore, multiple MGs in ADSs can improve operation features and have significant merits for ADSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In this architecture, distributed ESSs (DESSs) in MGs and mass ESSs (MESSs) in ADSs perform multiple important roles, such as network upgrade deferral, frequency-voltage control, power quality and reliability improvement, and alleviating the fluctuation of REGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, the large costs of ESS lead to the cost ineffectiveness of ADSs. Therefore, ESS should be properly sized and sited according to optimal costs while satisfying the load demand.</p><p id="Par8">Optimal planning of ESS has been previously studied in the literature of different fields, such as MGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], distribution networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and large-scale power plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In terms of MGs, an optimal sizing method in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] is proposed for the wind solar battery hybrid power system, considering two working modes of stand-alone and grid-connected. A sub-period optimization strategy is utilized to calculate the battery capacity. Authors in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] use PSO to optimize the power rating and energy capacity of ESS for frequency control of a stand-alone MG.</p><p id="Par9">For distribution networks, to accommodate spilled wind energy, a multi-step method based on the optimal power flow is presented in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] for allocation of ESS to minimize the annual electricity cost. Authors in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] explore a multi-objective allocation model of ESS in ADSs for sake of peak shaving, voltage quality improvement, and power self-regulation capacity. A weighted minimum module ideal point method is proposed to simplify the multi-objective problem. A chance constrained optimal model is proposed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] to determine the sizing and sitting of ESS. The model adopts minimizing investment and operation costs as the objective while meeting the constraint of wind utilization level. Research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] proposes an optimal model to determine the location, capacity, and power rating of ESS in ADSs. The model takes roles of ESS into account based on the short-term optimal power flow. The roles are modeled as different costs and the penalty factor in the objective function. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], authors extend their work in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] to take electric vehicles (EVs) into account. A point estimate method serves to tackle the uncertainties of load, REGs, and EVs.</p><p id="Par10">In terms of large scale power plants, a two-steps co-optimization model is proposed to determinate the suitable sizing and control of ESS for the hybrid system of PV &amp; ESS in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Authors in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] propose operation models of ESS to maximize REGs revenues, and sizing models of ESS to minimize costs of the hybrid system.</p><p id="Par11">Regarding the above literature review, it is clear that many optimal allocation models of ESS have been proposed. However, it is worth noticing a common drawback that most of the planning models do not take full consideration for the operation of ESS. For example, some straightforward models are used to represent the operation process with one objective, or they adopt the weighting method to deal with multiple objectives. Thus, multiple crucial roles of ESS in ADSs can’t be represented adequately.</p><p id="Par12">In addition, another drawback in the aforementioned literature is related to the models of REGs: probabilistic models are often adopted to reflect the intermittent nature of WG and PV, such as [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], which can’t give full expression to the time-variable nature of multiple REGs. Furthermore, these models are not suitable for the simulation of ESS.</p><p id="Par13">These two main drawbacks lead to the distortion of ESS operating state in planning models, contrary to the principle of ADS planning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], where operation models of active managements, such as the operation of ESS, should be integrated into planning models of ADS to get more optimal and reasonable planning solutions.</p><p id="Par14">This paper focuses on the planning problem of MESS in ADSs, which contains WG, PV, and multi-MGs. In order to properly determine the sizing, siting and type of ESS, a fuzzy multi-objective bi-level optimal planning model is proposed with several primary highlights.</p><p id="Par15">Firstly, to capture operation aspects which can affect planning stage, a bi-level model is adopted to achieve the collaborative optimization between planning and operation of ESS. For the purpose of giving expression to multiple roles of MESS in ADSs, a fuzzy multi-objective model is adopted, which consists of peak load shaving, restraining volatility, and improving the reserve capability of ESS.</p><p id="Par16">Moreover, time-dependent data are adopted to represent time variable nature of REGs, MGs and ESSs instead of probabilistic models. To ease the computational burden, these time-series profiles are recognized and clustered into typical daily scenarios based on the fuzzy C mean (FCM) clustering algorithm and multiple scenarios technique.</p><p id="Par17">Finally, to solve this bi-level mixed integer optimization problem efficiently, a multi-subgroup hierarchical chaos algorithm is introduced based on DE and PSO.</p><p id="Par18">The paper is organized as follows. Section <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">2</xref> provides the framework of the planning model. Section <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">3</xref> presents methods to establish the power characteristic model of MG and typical daily scenarios. In Section <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">4</xref>, we formulate the fuzzy multi-objective bi-level model. A multi-subgroup hierarchical chaos hybrid approach is further developed in Section <xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec">5</xref>. Then, the computational results and discussions are given in Section <xref rid="Sec16" ref-type="sec">6</xref>. Section <xref rid="Sec20" ref-type="sec">7</xref> concludes this paper with several remarks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Framework of optimal planning model of ESS</title><p id="Par19">The planning of ESS in ADSs should consider not only minimizing of costs, but also significant roles of ESS. To demonstrate multiple roles of ESS, two statuses of ADSs should be considered: 1) the normal status with roles of peak load shaving and restraining volatility, 2) the failure status with the responsibility for system support. Moreover, the time-variable nature of load and REGs is another essential factor that needs to be considered.</p><p id="Par20">Based on the discussion above, the framework of the optimal planning model of ESS is described in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, where <italic>F</italic><sub>upper</sub> and <italic>f</italic><sub>lower</sub> are objectives of the upper level and the lower level, respectively; <italic>C</italic><sub>cap,d</sub>, <italic>C</italic><sub>FOM,d</sub>, <italic>C</italic><sub>VOM,d</sub> are the diurnal capital cost, the diurnal fixed operating and maintenance (O&amp;M) cost and the diurnal variable O&amp;M cost of ESS, respectively; <italic>C</italic><sub>load,d</sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub>loss,d</sub> are diurnal costs of load demand and network losses, respectively; <italic>B</italic><sub>def,d</sub> denotes the benefits got by deferral upgrade; <italic>f</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>f</italic><sub>2</sub>, and <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub> represent the three objectives of the lower level.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Framework of bi-level optimal planning model of ESS</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40565_2017_332_Fig1_HTML.gif" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par21">The left side of Fig.<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> describes the procedure to establish these scenarios: after annual forecasting data of REGs and load are processed by FCM, the typical daily scenarios are developed by multiple scenarios technique. These typical daily scenarios preserve the chronological sequence of power outputs of REGs and power consumptions of load, which allows representing eventual chronological aspects related to ESS scheduling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">The right side provides the fuzzy multi-objective bi-level planning model. Each level of bi-level model has its objectives and decision spaces affected by variables controlled at another level. Meanwhile, the execution of decisions is sequential, from higher level to lower level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. These features enable bi-level model to be suitable for the planning of ADS. For the planning aspect, minimizing the total costs of the ADS and ESS serves as the objective of the upper level. For the operation aspect, a fuzzy multi-objective model is introduced to obtain ESS scheduling in the lower level, which will be fed back to the upper level to calculate operation costs by power flow calculation at hourly time-steps for every daily scenario.</p><p id="Par23">The most prominent roles of ESS to ADSs are elected to be optimal objectives: 1) peak load shaving and valley load filling aiming at deferral of system investment, 2) restraining the volatility with the purpose of alleviating the fluctuation of load and REGs, and 3) improving the reserve capability of ESS seeking to take some degree of responsibility for system support.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Establishment of typical daily scenarios</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Power characteristic model of MG</title><p id="Par24">The power characteristic of MG is bundled with the allocation of MG, as well as the operation strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In this work, the wind solar battery hybrid MGs are adopted, and maximizing the utilization of REGs is adopted to be the strategy of DESS in MGs. Meanwhile, the electricity price is also an important factor to be considered.</p><p id="Par25">1) When the output of REGs is more than the local load demand, the DESS should be charged. At this moment, if this surplus power is larger than the charging demand of DESS, DESS is charged by REGs alone. If this surplus power is smaller than the charging demand of DESS, and the electricity price of the external system is lower than the contract price of REGs, DESS is charged by both REGs and the external system. If this surplus power is smaller than the charging demand of DESS, and the electricity price of the external system is higher than the contract price of REGs, DESS is charged by REGs alone, or charged by both REGs and the external system until the SOC of DESS reaches a pre-set value (<italic>λ</italic>) in case of need.</p><p id="Par26">2) When the output of REGs cannot meet the local load demand of MG, and the DESS together with REGs has no enough energy to meet the local load demand, the DESS starts to be charged with the external system until the SOC of DESS reaches a pre-set value (<italic>λ</italic>).</p><p id="Par27">3) When the output of REGs cannot meet the local load demand of MG, and the DESS together with REGs has enough energy to meet the local load demand, the DESS starts to discharge and has the priority to meet load demand before the external system.</p><p id="Par28">The power model of DESS is formulated as follows:<disp-formula id="Equ1"><label>1</label><alternatives><mml:math display="block" id="Equ1_Math"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">DES</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">C</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">max</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:mspace width="1em"/><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">C</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">max</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math><tex-math id="Equ1_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

A multi-subgroup hierarchical chaos hybrid algorithm is developed to deal with the bi-level mixed integer optimization problem.</p><p id="Par117">Based on the simulation results and discussions, several final remarks and conclusions can be drawn as follows.</p><p id="Par118">1) By means of the bi-level optimization, the proposed planning model enables us to take full consideration of the operation strategy of ESS, which contributes to obtaining a more reasonable planning scheme.</p><p id="Par119">2) By means of FCM and the multiple scenarios technique, annual time-dependent forecasting data of REGs and load demand can be processed into typical daily scenarios effectively. These scenarios can capture the time-variable nature of REGs and load demand, and ease the computational burden.</p><p id="Par120">3) Based on the current economic and technological conditions of ESS, the costs of ESS play a decisive role in the planning process of ESS in ADSs. But, the integrating of ESSs will also bring other additional value.
