These can transform the sustenance and low return livelihood to a profitable and respectable occupation for smallholder farmers, while motivating, attracting and empowering youth and women in agriculture. A paradigm shift is needed to: i) increase productivity, profitability, inclusiveness and efficiency of human engagement, ii) achieve complete nutrition security, iii) address the challenges of climate change, iv) adopt environment-friendly sustainable practices, and v) establish efficient farmer-market linkages. To achieve the desired goals, this chapter highlights effective pathways for: i) scaling innovations by combining ITK, conventional methods, and adopting NextGen cutting edge technologies evolved nationally or internationally, ii) enduring STI through a Gold Class education system, and iii) leveraging strong public-private partnership. The chapter also recommends increased investments in R&amp;D, urgent need for enabling policy environment for scaling innovations and suggests clear transformative action points.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>chapter-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>chapter-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/978-981-19-0763-0_Chapter_8.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></book-part-meta><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">India has been successful in building a massive ecosystem of science, technology and innovation (STI) since independence in 1947. Also, globally, STI continuum has been the main driver of agricultural growth, development and transformation of national socio-economic and agroecological milieus, and evolving dynamically to meet the fast changing development goals. Today, in the midst of the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, the world is challenged to meet the new and emerging health and nutrition demands along with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals—Agenda 2030 (UN, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2015</xref>). In this scenario, an effective STI system will be needed to disruptively transform Agriculture-Food Systems to achieve the veritable goal—leaving no one behind—especially youth and women.</p><p id="Par3">The foremost challenge to the STI in India and other agriculturally-important developing countries is the increase in number of hungry and malnourished people. One-third of the humanity is malnourished and nearly one-fourth of the world’s children are stunted—annually costing about 6–10% of GDP. Nearly one-fourth of the world’s hungry, one-third of the world’s stunted children and half of the world’s wasted children are from India (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>: FAO, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2018</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Number of undernourished people, 2017 (million)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Geographic entity</p></th><th align="left"><p>Number of undernourished people</p></th><th align="left"><p>Number of children under 5 wasted</p></th><th align="left"><p>Number of children under 5 stunted</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>World</p></td><td align="left"><p>821</p></td><td align="left"><p>51</p></td><td align="left"><p>151</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>India</p></td><td align="left"><p>196</p></td><td align="left"><p>26</p></td><td align="left"><p>47</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>China</p></td><td align="left"><p>125</p></td><td align="left"><p>1.6</p></td><td align="left"><p>6.9</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Asia</p></td><td align="left"><p>515</p></td><td align="left"><p>35</p></td><td align="left"><p>84</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Africa</p></td><td align="left"><p>257</p></td><td align="left"><p>14</p></td><td align="left"><p>59</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>Source</italic><ext-link xlink:href="http://www.fao.org/state-of-food-security-nutrition-in-the-world" ext-link-type="uri">www.fao.org/state-of-food-security-nutrition-in-the-world</ext-link></p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p id="Par4">In India, STI-led Rainbow Revolution transformed the country from ‘ship-to-mouth’ status to the ‘Right-to-Food Bill’ situation, with formidable foodgrain export and buffer stocking, making it the second largest agrarian economy in the world. Accounting for 18% of the world’s population, with only 2.3% of the world’s land and less than 4% of global freshwater, the country’s STI effort must be geared to produce <bold><italic>More from Less for More</italic></bold> without further damaging the agroecological system and accentuating water and carbon footprints.</p><p id="Par5">STI for Development (STI4D) must break the co-existence of food surplus and wastage, and high incidences of hunger and malnutrition; check the high inequities, trade and market distortions; halt unabated depletion of natural resources; stop the accelerated emergence of infectious diseases and aggressive pests; and, of course mitigate the ever-aggravating climate change volatilities posing major challenges to the Indian agriculture today. Another major challenge is to break the asymmetry of low and poorly planned investment in agricultural research, education and technology generation and transfer. This, despite the fact that investment in agriculture is at least three times more effective than in other sectors in alleviating hunger, under-nutrition and poverty (World Bank Group, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2020</xref>). Hence, moving beyond research and production as usual, an unusual science-technology-innovation continuum must be adopted to meet these challenges, and create zero hunger India (Singh, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2015</xref>). Ramesh Chand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2019</xref>), Member, NITI Aayog, emphasized the importance of advancement in science-led technology, enhanced role of private sector, liberalized output and active land lease market and increased input use efficiency along the value chain for transforming Indian agriculture.</p><p id="Par6">Committed to demand-driven and technology-led revolution to transform agriculture, this chapter discusses the following sub-themes of science, technology and innovation (STI) towards transforming agriculture-food system to meet the veritable development goals: (i) paradigm shift in agricultural research to address new challenges, (ii) frontier technologies, IPR issues and their application, (iii) indigenous technical knowledge in agriculture, (iv) innovative technology dissemination options, (v) innovations outside agriculture influencing agriculture, (vi) rejuvenating agricultural education system and (vii) pathways from research to innovation for impact.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Paradigm Shift in Agricultural Research and Technology to Address New Challenges and Opportunities</title><p id="Par7">While STI have continuously been transforming the agriculture-food-systems in the past, keeping in mind short, medium and long-term perspectives, the following major paradigm shifts in agricultural research are needed for making these more efficient, knowledge-based, inclusive and sustainable, in providing solutions to the new and emerging challenges, and capturing uncommon opportunities.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Smallholder Farmers at the Centre Stage</title><p id="Par8">Smallholder and marginal farmers, accounting for nearly 86.25% of Indian farmers, 47.38% of the cultivated land and over 50% of the total agricultural production, are vital not only for India’s agrarian economy (10th Agriculture Census 2015–16), but also for achieving alleviation of hunger and poverty. Over 50% of the smallholders, referred to as sub- marginal farmers, possess less than 0.5 ha land. Despite their higher per unit productivity, the extremely small and fragmented holdings are economically non-viable, swelling the ranks of hungry and poor. The biodiverse, predominantly crop-livestock integrated farming in India is the key to ensure resilience to climate change and sustainability of smallholder farming agroecologies. Recognizing that access of smallholders to technology, land, other production resources, credit and capital is limited, a holistic pro-smallholder approach and robust policy initiatives are called for. Augmented by new farm reform policies (aggregation of land through contract farming, diversification of cropping system and remunerative markets as per new Farm Bills, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>, GoI), effective technologies and innovations are aimed at mitigating vagaries of climate change and enhancing farmers’ net income, while encouraging entrepreneurship and off- farm and non-farm employment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Nutritional Security to Be a Key Goal of Agriculture</title><p id="Par9">Keeping in view the high incidence of hunger and under-nutrition in India vis-à-vis a fact that the country accounts for 20% of obese people in the world (Ahirwar &amp; Mondal, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2019</xref>), ASTI (Agriculture Science, Technology and Innovation) needs to shift focus on achieving comprehensive nutritional security than just food security. This may be achieved through genetic improvement, bio-fortification, enhanced protein and other quality factors and/or value addition through post-harvest innovations. Decentralized research approaches will be needed for diverse ecologies, food preferences and market options, which call for region-specific prioritization of research, with due consideration to various socio-economic parameters. For extenuating the emergence of new infectious diseases and aggressive pests, that can often be transmitted along the entire agriculture-food system, from microbe to man, a ‘One Health’ concept comprising healthy soils—healthy plants—healthy animals—healthy people—healthy environment, would be the preferred approach (Singh, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par10">In the post-Green Revolution period, agricultural research in India gradually moved from crop-based to farming system-based agriculture integrating horticulture, livestock, poultry and fisheries as essential components to achieve sustainable food and nutritional security and to maximize farm income. For the economic and nutritional security of a largely vegetarian population, dairy animals are of prime importance; and to improve their productivity and climate resilience, a two-pronged approach will be required—strengthening the availability of superior germplasm and enhancing fertility through biotechnological augmentation of reproduction (NDRI, Vision 2030, ndri.res.in/design/document/vision/pdf). Besides expanding the area and production by introducing better production technologies and genetically improved varieties of horticultural crops and breeds of livestock including the small meat animals, particularly in the northeastern region (NER), and poultry and fishes, the present focus needs to be demand-driven, changing from the ‘Farm to Fork’ approach to the ‘Fork to Farm’ one to ensure efficient marketing and better price for the farmers (Paroda, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2019a</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">The efforts to make this happen comprise inter-disciplinary collaborations in developing innovative production and processing technologies, including nutraceuticals and fortified nutri-foods; cold chains involving refrigerated van using conventional and non-conventional energy sources, and necessary policy support to agro-industries, and all will play critical roles. COVID-19 pandemic generated considerable public awareness about the nutritional benefits of many indigenous herbs and seed and non-seed spices. Wild food plants (WFPs) have been a vital component of food and nutritional security for centuries. Recently, India and several other countries reported on the widespread and regular consumption of WFPs, particularly by rural and indigenous communities and in urban areas also. These would open new business opportunities for small farm holders. However, technological advancements and better extension would be required for better shelf life, food safety and value addition of these products. Hence, Research, Science, Technology, Innovation (RSTI) framework would need to play a bigger role encompassing six-dimensions of food security: availability, access, utilization, stability, agency and sustainability. Considering that the majority of the events in agricultural sector are influenced by events occurring in (i) bio-physical and environmental, (ii) technology, (iii) innovation and infrastructure, (iv) economic and market, (v) political and institutional, (vi) socio- cultural and (vii) demographic domains (FAO, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>), a paradigm shift is needed to create an agricultural RSTI system, which is demand-driven, but farmer-centric, decentralized and structured on a bottoms-up, participatory, inter-sector and multidisciplinary approach to provide variable solutions to diverse problems along the entire value chain.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Value Chain Management and Prevention of Food Losses</title><p id="Par12">Scientific enrichment and management of value chain for agricultural commodities are urgently needed as these are globally changing rapidly in response to disruptive changes in agricultural and food standards influenced by dynamic public and private requirements on food quality, safety, ethical and environmental aspects. WTO notifications on new Sanitary and Phyto Sanitary (SPS) measures are fast changing, which ought to be internalized in national regulations. It is hoped that food processing industries (FPIs) will grow fast, especially in rural areas, and national system will provide integrated solutions to support the knowledge management, trade, collaborative ICT solutions, innovations, risk management and regulatory measures to all stakeholders along value chains.</p><p id="Par13">Recalling that “a grain saved is a grain produced” and “unsafe food is no food”, “zero wastage of food” is one of the five pillars of the Global Zero Hunger Challenge Programme. According to the UNDP, up to 40% of the food produced in India is wasted and 50% of all food across the world meets the same fate, never reaching the needy. In India post-production losses, especially of perishables and semi-perishables like milk, meat, fish, fruit and vegetables, range from 18–25% amounting to INR 50,000 crore (INR 500,000 million) annually (<italic>The Economic Times</italic>, 28 Feb 2019). About 50% of these losses are preventable using suitable post-harvest processing technologies. Keeping in view the growing market of processed foods, the future ASTI has to offer innovative options to increase better nutrition and profitability through processing and value addition all along the value chain besides generating new employment opportunities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA)</title><p id="Par14">Indian agriculture-food system economy is greatly prone to climate change consequences. As India is projected to be one of the most negatively impacted countries by the climate change (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), the ASTI efforts are needed to negate the impacts of climate volatilities, and also to create CSA endowed with sustainably enhanced productivity, resilience to climate change stresses (adaptation) and mitigation of climate change. A paradigm shift to imbibe interdisciplinary, participatory and international collaborative approach can address the multiple challenges caused by climate change while sustaining the desired economic growth (Aggarwal et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2018</xref>; Singh, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2014</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Projected changes, considering 2013–14 as the baseline, in agricultural productivity from climate change at 2050</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Country</p></th><th align="left"><p>Percentage change</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Australia</p></td><td align="left"><p>−17</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Canada</p></td><td align="left"><p>−1</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>United States of America</p></td><td align="left"><p>−4</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>China</p></td><td align="left"><p>−4</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>India</p></td><td align="left"><p>−25</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Brazil</p></td><td align="left"><p>−10</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>European Union</p></td><td align="left"><p>−4</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Least developed countries</p></td><td align="left"><p>−18</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>Source </italic>IPCC, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2014</xref></p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Greening the Growth</title><p id="Par15">The ASTI systems developed during the Green Revolution and Post-Green Revolution eras could not be judiciously adopted, leaving serious yield gaps, low total factor productivity and declining benefit-cost ratios. With mere 36–40% water use efficiency, India is predicted to become ‘water scarce’ before 2030 (NITI Aayog, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2018</xref>). With widespread deficiency of NPK and the increasing deficiencies of Zn, Bo, Fe, Mn and S, the nutrient use efficiency is only around 36–40% for N and about 15% for P. Similarly, constant mining of K is distorting mineralogical make-up, resulting in an irreversible deterioration of soil health, which already suffers from low organic carbon content. Achievement Gap Advisory Panel (AGAP) Report (UNAID, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2014</xref>) cautioned that with the business as usual only 59% of India’s demand of food and agricultural production will be met by the year 2030.

Plants are crossed to introduce traits/genes from a particular variety into a new genetic background. In this, highly heritable oligo genes and exploitation of additive and dominance gene effects and interactions, led to the development of short stature, input-responsive, high yielding varieties (HYVs), often resistant to common diseases and pests, which ushered in the Green Revolution in the country especially in wheat, rice, maize, pearl millet and sorghum. Molecular breeding including transgenics and marker-assisted selection (MAS)-based gene pyramiding, brought incremental as well as transformational genetic gains in the last 20 years.</p><p id="Par18">Genomics and gene editing must be adopted as preferred technologies for precision breeding (Vats et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2019</xref>). However, to do so, a science-based policy and well defined guidelines need to be placed on priority. In the new era of genomics, phenomics, proteomics and other omics – molecular breeding, the availability of high quality reference genomes of crop plants accelerated the discovery of genes, quantitative trait locus (QTLs) and DNA markers linked to the traits of agronomic importance. This is now being routinely applied in MAS of crop varieties, including those of horticultural species, for increased selection efficiency. The genomic selection approach will be further enriched by technologies haplotype-based breeding, single cell sequencing, Drop Synth technique for synthesizing large genetic libraries etc. Innovative approaches, such as apomictic F1 seed production, now a distinct possibility, can revolutionize the exploitation of hybrid vigour. As horticulture attains high importance, genomics of coconut, mango, banana, aonla, pointed gourd, tuber crops etc. need greater attention. In view of diminishing water availability, development of improved varieties/hybrids for dryland/arid horticulture along with appropriate cultivation technology will be a priority.</p><p id="Par19">In livestock, genome editing has high prospect of enhanced prolificacy and reproductive performance, improved health, increased feed utilization and growth rate, carcass composition, improved milk production and or composition and increased disease resistance (Bharati et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2020</xref>). For instance, in pigs, resilience to African swine fever virus, a deadly disease, was achieved through gene editing. Further, using CRISPR/Cas, the generated pigs, were completely protected against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) infection. Using this technology in several livestock breeding populations, frequencies of favourable alleles were greatly increased while deleterious alleles removed. Gene-edited livestock (pigs, goats and cattle), developed jointly by three USA and one UK universities, for the first time, were rendered “surrogate dads”, meaning that the sperm they produce holds only the genetic material of donor animals, paving the way for breeding elite livestock with certain desirable traits to boost food production (<italic>The Times of India</italic>, 19 September 2020).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Digital Solutions and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Evergreen Revolution</title><p id="Par20">Using Big Data Analytics, we can create decision support systems at various levels, including weather forecasting and efficient management of water, pest and nutrient.

In spite of increased investments in agricultural research and extension in the past decades, the impact on the livelihoods of small farmers had not been significant, as mostly the improved technologies did not reach them. Therefore, well-functioning agricultural extension and advisory services are essential for translating technological achievements into tangible gains (Babu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par57">The pathways to impact should include scientifically designed systemic systems for enhancing production and productivity, sustaining natural resources, identifying and managing major risks, building resilient communities, enriching value chains and eliminating waste, enhancing opportunities for agri-business, job creation, creating opportunities for women and youth, coordinating the knowledge product and integrating communications, linking farmers with remunerative markets and reorienting education and skill development.</p><p id="Par58">Innovative technologies suggested in the previous sections will help increase the income of small and marginal farmers by enhancing the value of farm output and reducing the cost of operations. These would be integral to a sustainable model of profitable agriculture across the divergent scenario in the country. Effective diffusion of such innovations holds the key to achieve success in agriculture. It is also important that with the growing presence of pluralistic extension system with varied approaches, a robust research framework and methodology is put into practice (NAAS, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par59">During the COVID-19 pandemic, several new multi-dimensional challenges emerged impacting food and rural livelihood security; these are going to affect the food and nutritional security of the country, and also the livelihoods of over 50% of the population depending on agriculture, directly or indirectly (<italic>The India Today</italic>, 4 May 2020). Transformational innovations in agriculture, therefore, have to be affordable, profitable, rugged and user-friendly and supported by an efficient diffusion strategy.</p><p id="Par60">The Green Revolution showed the importance of an efficient agricultural extension and advisory services. Conventionally, agricultural extension is in the domain of public sector, comprising State Extension machineries including line departments and Agricultural Technology Management Agency (ATMA), ICAR institutes and SAUs including the KVKs. However, it still left big gaps between the technology development and dissemination on one hand and developing need based technologies on the other. As a result, it could cater to only about 15% of the total mandated area of extension system, leaving majority of small farmers deprived of all resources including information and appropriate technology. However, the scope of innovative technology development and their diffusion has undergone significant changes in the last 10 to 15 years, with the involvement of a range of service providers including the private sector, NGOs, farmer organizations, civil society and independent professionals. This was further boosted by a revolution in communication technology. Mobile-based agro-advisory models delivering information based on real time conditions, and farmers’ participatory programmes undertaken by the private sector and NGOs are complementing the existing extension services for a better last mile penetration. These have brought forth some efficient and cost effective extension models such as Indian Farmers Fertilisers Co-operatives <italic>Kisan Sanchar</italic> Limited (IKSL); e-Choupal of ITC; and aggregated vegetable farming and seed production by small farmers by SFI and BAIF (Mittal et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par61">There are several innovative technologies ready to be scaled up and scaled out (<italic>see</italic> Box below), where skilled intermediaries can act as effective links between the technology providers and farmers. However, for the available extension machinery, better coordination among different players and active participation of private sector and paid service providers are going to be vital. Indian farmers demonstrate high levels of ingenuity in devising grassroots innovations, and re- engineered innovative technologies using local resources, which are valuable in solving situation-specific problems in cost-effective manner. Therefore, farmer-led innovations also need to be assessed, validated, refined and out scaled to harness their full benefits and adopted in a participatory mode involving all stakeholders (Paroda, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2019a</xref>).</p><p id="Par375"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par62">Hybrid technology (maize, <italic>bajra</italic>, sorghum, rice)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par63">Biotechnology GM crops (soybean, mustard, maize, brinjal)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par64">Conservation agriculture (3.5–20 m ha)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par65">Protected cultivation (expand area from 50,000 ha to 2.00 m ha) Micro-irrigation (discourage flood irrigation) – atleast 10 m ha Bioenergy/biofuel (use of sugarcane and maize—initially 20%)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par66">Biofortified crops (QP maize, Fe and Zn rich rice, Fe rich <italic>bajra</italic>, Zn rich wheat)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par67">ICT for knowledge sharing, e.g. e-Choupal</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par68">(Paroda, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2019b</xref>)</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par69">Since the customers are typically resource poor in agricultural sector, following the principle of making profit at the ‘Bottom of the Pyramid’, diffusion models need to target a large number of users who can use such innovations at a reasonable cost.

With a large portfolio of innovations, only a few successful ones can more than pay for failures; whereas with a small portfolio it may only incur loss, profitability, and their diffusion is typically left to the state and federal extension machinery. Government may consider a transparent policy of reasonable pricing of agricultural technologies including seeds, pesticide, fertilizers, machines and tools as well as services, if required. This may be decided on case to case basis involving all stakeholders, instead of blanket orders, ensuring a level playing field for all players, to encourage the best technology to spread fast. Agrinnovate India Ltd of ICAR - an interface with the private sector, can provide such a platform (Saxena, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2017</xref>). However, the requirements of smallholder farmers must critically be assessed through on-farm testing while planning for either up-scaling or out-scaling new innovations (Gulati et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2006</xref>; Swarup, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2017</xref> and Pal et al<italic>.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par75">Partnering of corporate houses with public institutions or local bodies at village/block level, be it a local Farmers’ Group, Self Help Group (SHG), NGO, or a village level startup, needs to be encouraged for quick and effective dissemination of knowledge and technology transfer.

Policy support and financial incentives can drive establishment of ancillary agri-businesses, startups and small scale enterprises (MSMEs), such as those based on post-harvest value added products, Agri-Clinics, Agri-Input centres, farm gate storage, sorting and grading houses and cool chain facilities. Since agriculture-based startups experience difficulty in finding venture capital, incentives and credit availability on easy terms (Saxena, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2017</xref>) can boost the scope of such businesses. As farm mechanization and precision farming are going to be indispensable in agriculture, Custom Hiring Centres (CHC) need to be established in every block and village under the Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM) scheme of GoI (Farm Mechanization in India, 2015. <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.agricoop.nic.in/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.agricoop.nic.in/</ext-link>). Similarly, ‘Uberization’ or affordable rental of farm-friendly vehicles for quick transport of farm produce and inputs is a promising option.

Short Diploma courses offered by institutions accredited by ICAR or AICTE and intensive hands-on training of farm technologies by the KVKs are the need of the hour. Though the traditional methods of training involving instructor-led approach works well, yet it has limitations of penetration and access, especially in COVID-19 scenario and reaching the far flung and difficult to reach areas. In these situations, use of Extended Reality (XR) simulation platforms could be an option.

Retraining, up-skilling and retooling of teachers, students and related staff, bridging gap between education and research by adopting a holistic approach, strengthening of vocational education, autonomy to institutions and establishing a self-sufficient domestic ranking system for Indian educational institutions, are the main planks of NEP 2020. Consequently, the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MoHRD) has been renamed as the Ministry of Education (MoE, GoI, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec49"><title>Pathways from Research to Innovation for Impact</title><p id="Par112">The UN Inter Agency Task Team (IATT, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2020</xref>) had underpinned that science, technology and innovation, the key means for achieving the Agenda 2030, must be coherently integrated to meet economic, social and environmental aspirations in line with the SDGs. The UN Guidebook for the Preparation of STI for SDGs Roadmaps has emphasized integrating STI and the SDG Plans with the National Plan. Emphasizing that, ‘The Future is Now: Science for Achieving Sustainable Development’, IATT suggested six key steps and three core inputs for developing STI for SDGs roadmaps, as elucidated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Process flow of six key steps in the development of STI for SDGS roadmaps.</p><p><italic>Source</italic> Guidebook for the Preparation of Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) for SDGs Roadmaps (IATT, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2020</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/520930_1_En_8_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par113">The UN, in collaboration with World Bank, other international organizations and multilateral donor agencies, is pilot testing the guidebook approach with India, as one of the initial five participating countries.</p><p id="Par114">In India, the Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser, NITI Aayog and other concerned offices, underpinning the current policy and strategy frameworks, jointly prepared the STI for SDGs Roadmaps, emphasizing agriculture, energy, water, biodiversity and comprehensive food, nutrition, health, livelihood and environmental securities—One Health One World inter-linkages, multi-disciplinary and system approaches, inclusiveness, digitalization, climate smart agriculture and resilience to biotic and abiotic stresses. It underpins the essentiality of coupling of funding with technology transfer as also envisaged in the Multilateral Fund under the Montreal Protocol, Green Climate Fund, GEF and UNFCC, which are supporting the STI for SDGs global movement. The Roadmap suggests: (i) establishing a Technology Facilitating Mechanism, (ii) adopting new models for incentivizing innovations for global public goods and enhancing access to them and (iii) integrating STI cooperation into strategies for the achievement of the SDGs.</p><p id="Par115">An Agri-Food system-based approach has been adopted for addressing the large and systemic challenges the country is facing. The food systems lens should secure that research and innovations in sub-systems are clustered, monitored and evaluated from the overall food systems viewpoint. It will identify leverage points for improving a specific outcome without compromising other desirable outcomes. India’s roadmap is designed to build inclusive food systems (IFPRI, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2020</xref>) to wipe off the Indian enigma of being food surplus and also home to about one-fourth of the world’s hungry and poor, majority being smallholder and marginal farmers. This inclusive growth system should promote SMEs and participation of smallholders all along the value chain. Policies and regulations should be in place to ensure – land tenure security, access to credit, training, technical assistance and resilience-enhancing social protection. Income of the farmers thus enhanced will improve their access to education and information, which in turn will increase their inclusiveness in the food systems, breaking the inter-generational cycle of poverty, hunger and malnutrition.</p><p id="Par116">Keeping in mind the frameworks and guidelines suggested above and ensuring policy coherence and enabling environment, including cooperative federalism, the following integrative pathways from research to innovations for impact are suggested.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par117"><bold>Science-Technology-Innovation Continuum to be Farmer-centric and Demand- driven.</bold> The cutting edge and innovative technology can bring agricultural transformation only if it addresses the problems of small and marginal farmers. While integrating basic and applied sciences, focus should be on being demand-driven (local being vocal) and adopting pluralistic delivery of innovations. Collaboration among all stakeholders is needed at the niche, regime and landscape levels in compliance with regulatory requirements. The implementing actors must explore various contextual conditions and work with potential adopters to situate new innovations within local socio-ecological practices. Along with capacity building and skill development, socio-political ambience should nurture local leadership to champion innovations (Shilomboleni and Deplaen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2019</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par118"><bold>No more ‘Closed Jacketed’ Approach.</bold> Encourage Agri-food system-based multi-institutional, inter-disciplinary research, leading to rapid problem solving. Innovations to tackle COVID-19 pandemic have brought forward the advantages of dissolving boundaries in science to develop effective technologies leveraging expertise at various levels. This should be adopted as the norm by linking fundamental science to applied research; innovations at technology development and their diffusion; and partnership among the public and private sectors and civil societies. New initiatives of synergizing Science Social Responsibility (SSR) with Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), can bridge the gap between private and public sectors. Agri-startups should help solve agribusiness problems, promote entrepreneurship and provide products, services, applications, etc. enhancing competitiveness.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par119"><bold>Invest in Agri-Food Research and Development (ARD).</bold> Studies showed that among all major components, investment in R&amp;D gives the highest returns in agriculture, in socio- economic and ecological terms. In India, expenditure intensity in agricultural research has remained around 0.4% and in agricultural extension only around 0.16% for the past 15 years or so (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Against this, the intensity in USA and Australia is over 3.0%. Hence, in India both public and private funding need to be more than doubled as an immediate measure and a long-term strategy by bringing complementary convergence in funding from different sources and extending tax rebates, proportionate to the scale of investment. The National Education Policy, 2020 has proposed a common National Research Foundation (NRF), to minimize overlapping in funding, break barriers between various S&amp;T Departments and create beneficial linkages. A similar approach is needed for ARD, with at least 0.2% of GDP invested, equalling about 1.0% of agricultural GDP as has repeatedly been recommended in the past.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Expenditure intensity in R&amp;D in India</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="3"><p>Expenditure intensity in India (per cent)</p></th></tr><tr><th align="left"/><th align="left"><p>Research</p></th><th align="left"><p>Extension</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>1983</p></td><td align="left"><p>0.25</p></td><td align="left"><p>0.10</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>1993</p></td><td align="left"><p>0.31</p></td><td align="left"><p>0.15</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>2003</p></td><td align="left"><p>0.39</p></td><td align="left"><p>0.14</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>2014</p></td><td align="left"><p>0.40</p></td><td align="left"><p>0.18</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>2018</p></td><td align="left"><p>0.39</p></td><td align="left"><p>N.A</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>Source</italic> NIAP, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2017</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">18</xref></p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></list-item></list><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par120"><bold>Make the Education System Scientifically Sound and Professionally Competitive.</bold> The agricultural education must maintain a Gold Standard ensuring that agricultural graduates from India are professionally well equipped to handle national as well as international challenges as enunciated in the NEP 2020 (GoI, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>). The NARES should assess the manpower needs of the fast transforming, knowledge-intense agriculture to make necessary adjustments in curricula and skill development, emphasizing on experiential learning and exposure to national and international issues. More technological interventions are likely in the disciplines of ICT, digitalization, biotechnology, nanotechnology, agro-processing, precision agriculture and systems simulation, hence the associated manpower demand and shift in the pedagogy are to be brought in. Pluralistic approach and public-private partnership focusing on business/marketing/income orientation are needed for making the local extension sensitive to the challenges at micro level, strengthening the feedback mechanism and setting the right priorities. Promoting entrepreneurship and agri-startups, encouraging market-led extension strategies and intensive use of electronic media should be duly covered in the educational programmes.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par121"><bold>Agriculture is Integral to Ecological Balance</bold>. Agriculture being a risky (weather and market dependent) and low income occupation, makes farmers follow the cropping systems having assured market, resulting in serious depletion of resources, deterioration of soil health and ecological imbalance. Leveraging the growing preferences for nutri-foods, policy decisions, regulatory framework and incentives will be needed to reverse the trend. Steps taken by some state governments, such as discouraging certain crops or promoting others, or fixing the sowing dates for rationalizing water use, are showing promise. Long-term policies both for domestic and export trade, and support through subsidies linked to balanced use of natural resources and inputs can pave the way. Eco-friendly models of farming system, integrating natural, technical, economic and social aspects are needed to promote resource-use efficiency, sustainable intensification, climate smart agriculture, zero food waste/loss and enhanced food safety.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par122"><bold>Small can be Bountiful</bold>. More than 85% of farmers belonging to small and marginal categories primarily depend on agriculture for subsistence. Excessive fragmentation of farm lands, low factor productivity, vulnerability to climate change, poor value chain and lack of viable agro-industries are some of the key reasons for low profitability from agriculture in India, forcing millions to migrate to far off places in search of farm/non-farm employments. To reverse this trend by creating rural employment opportunities, an integrated approach is needed to aggregate small farms through reforms, digitization, need-based farm mechanization, creation of aggregation/collection centres, affordable transportation and market links. Shifting of some of the non-farm industries to rural areas also needs to be considered as a long-term strategy to – provide steady and equitable income to rural population, decongesting the cities and containing labour migration without affecting the economy. Dynamic retooling and retraining of the human resources would be essential.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par123"><bold>Harnessing the Treasure of Traditional Knowledge</bold>. An effective integration of traditional knowledge with modern agricultural technology will be desired for increasing the productivity while addressing the adverse impacts of climate change. To reap the benefits of ITK, we need sustained efforts in: (i) collection and documentation of traditional knowledge relating to sustainable agricultural practices to build a National Database; (ii) a comprehensive policy framework to protect and utilize traditional knowledge and practices and facilitate better exchange, documentation and conservation of available agro-biodiversity; (iii) provisions for incentives and rewards to the saviours of ITK as well as access and benefit sharing (ABS); and (iv) translational research with focus on identification, validation and adoption of traditional agricultural practices. An apex body at the national level may be established to create wide awareness and acceptance of ITKs and to coordinate between various stakeholders for their adoption and mainstreaming.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par124"><bold>Respect the Intellectual Investments in Innovations</bold>. Generating new technologies and innovations to meet emerging challenges by the public and private sectors need to be encouraged through commensurate policies and necessary IPR regime. In this context, National Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Policy, the Protection of Plant Variety and Farmers’ Rights Act (PPV&amp;FRA) and the Biological Diversity Act (BDA) of the Government of India need to be harmonized to ensure a win–win situation and to accelerate the pace of developing new innovations, and their quick access in the interest of farmers.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par125"><bold>Take Technology to the Doors of Farmers</bold>. Following Dr Norman E Borlaug’s advice, a turnaround in the agricultural extension system will need to be brought in. There is a need to strengthen the existing extension system through partnerships with the private sector, NGOs, farmers’ organizations, civil societies etc. imparting greater role to youth (including women) as Technology Agents and input providers. For showcasing and scaling of innovations, there is a need to establish technology parks and encourage farmer-led and paid extension work that is more efficient and accountable.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par126"><bold>Scale-up and Scale-out</bold>. Professionals, farmer producer organizations (FPOs), farmer producer companies (FPCs), self-help groups (SHGs), cooperatives and NGOs are to be effectively involved for scaling of innovations with an easy access to technology, policy and financial support and hand-holding from the research institutions. Thus, financing on easy terms, risk management and incentives from state administration will attract entrepreneurs to establish successful start-ups. Land reform act, including land tenure, rent contracts and land leasing should be streamlined to facilitate farms aggregation.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par127"><bold>Empowering Women and Attracting Youth in Agriculture</bold>. Urgent action is called at the national, regional and international levels to encourage women leadership at all levels and build collective advocacy to recognize their contribution towards agricultural development. For this the agricultural research for development (AR4D) agenda needs to be made gender-sensitive. Concerted efforts are needed to develop women friendly machineries, tools and technologies. It must be ensured that the institutions and legal support system promote women’s ownership and equitable share in resources. To utilize India’s human capital in agricultural development by attracting youth (including women), agri-education system needs to be reoriented towards farm innovations and agri-preneurship, by introducing high quality vocational/ non-degree courses and by providing funding on easy terms to set up agri-business. Accreditation of skilled service providers in specialized fields will open up enormous scope of entrepreneurship and self- employment.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par128"><bold>Build Back Better (and Differently)</bold>. To overcome the unprecedented disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, a holistic approach will be needed with agriculture at the centre stage of the national rebuilding process. To address the large and systemic challenges, inclusiveness and rapid conversion of knowledge into needed and commercial products will be the key to innovative and affordable solutions. Promoting the policy of Zero Hunger India, Make-in-India, <italic>Swasth Bharat</italic>, One Health, <italic>Aatmanirbhar Bharat</italic> and the like, technical and financial support to strengthen entrepreneurship, start-ups, Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) and other concerned Ministries and Departments will synergistically integrate to ensure social, economic and ecological sustainability towards building a green and strong India.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Aggarwal, P.
