The succession of field-leading discoveries that Drickamer has made during the last 30 years, and the insights they afford, has had incomparable influence on the forefront of research in several disciplines, including biochemistry, structural biology, immunology and microbiology.</p><p>Beginning with his 1981 JBC publication on the hepatic glycoprotein receptor, which controls serum-glycoprotein turnover by recognising changes with age in their carbohydrate moieties, Drickamer initiated molecular analysis of what turned out to be a huge family of glycan-binding lectins. After this pioneering (single-authored!) study, he went on to demonstrate that the soluble mannose-binding protein (MBP) (alternatively called the mannose-binding lectin or MBL) of blood and lymph also contains CRDs. In this protein he showed the CRDs are linked to collagen-like sequences, as is also the case for pulmonary surfactants. Thereby he also saw the functional parallel between mannose-binding protein and C1q: the former detecting pathogens to initiate innate immunity, the latter initiating adaptive immunity through detection of pathogen-specific antibody bound to the pathogen. This was a major contribution to our understanding of innate immunity in a time (<italic>i.e.</italic> pre-Toll receptors) when innate immunity was not all the rage.</p><p>From these seminal observations of CRDs in soluble and cell-surface receptors with different functions in blood homeostasis and immunity, Drickamer predicted that CRDs were likely to be a feature shared by many other carbohydrate receptors. To test this hypothesis he initiated systematic investigation and classification of glycan-binding receptors based on the presence of different types of CRDs. From comparison of the CRDs in those C-type lectins that were discovered using traditional assays of biological function, Drickamer had defined the sequence motifs that typify this class of CRDs, which enabled him to identify several CRD-containing proteins that were not known to bind carbohydrates. He pioneered the scanning of whole-genome sequences to identify novel, uncharacterised proteins that contain CRDs and are thus candidates for having glycan-binding function. Complementing this approach for the identification of candidate lectins, Drickamer has been a leader in using glycan array technology to test such candidates for their capacity to bind glycans and determine their sugar specificities.</p><p>He is also well known for co-writing, with his colleague and collaborator Maureen Taylor, the text book “Introduction to Glycobiology”, now in its third edition. Their book enunciates the established and emerging principles of glycobiology in a manner accessible to students and the broader scientific community and has been translated into Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.</p><p>To summarise, Drickamer is a scientist who has both made seminal ‘text book’ discoveries and followed up on them to become the leading authority on CRDs and their role in cell-cell and cell-microbe recognition. Moreover he unselfishly gives an enormous amount of his time supporting international glycobiology—for example he served as the deputy chair of the Consortium for Functional Glycomics Steering Committee for a decade and personally made substantial contributions to the CFG Paradigm Pages. Since 2005 he is Professor of Biochemistry at Imperial College London and in 2012 he received the Karl Meyer Award from the Society for Glycobiology. In 2013 he has been selected to be recipient of the International Glycoconjugate Organisation Award.</p><p>Michael A.J.

Training at the intersection of glycobiology and host-microbe interactions led her to an Assistant Professor position at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, USA where she has built a successful research program supported by multiple foundation and government grants. The Lewis lab investigates mechanisms of host sialic acid mimicry and sialoglycan degradation in host-bacterial interactions within the female urogenital tract. Dr. Lewis’ work on Group B Streptococcus (GBS), the leading cause of sepsis and meningitis in newborns, has contributed to our understanding of mechanisms by which the bacterium uses its sialic acid-containing capsule to survive in the maternal urogenital tract and the infant bloodstream. Dr. Lewis also led studies showing that the presence of GBS and its ability to precisely mimic host sialic acids influences the severity of urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by E. coli, the most common cause of human UTI. Genomic and biochemical investigations by Dr. Lewis and colleagues suggest that bacterial mimicry of host sialic acids may be a more common theme in bacterial immune evasion than previously recognized.</p><p>The Lewis lab has also made recent strides in understanding an enigmatic polymicrobial imbalance of the vaginal microbiota known as bacterial vaginosis (BV)—a condition linked with preterm birth and other pregnancy complications. Lewis’ group has demonstrated new biochemical and cellular phenotypes of BV and is building new experimental models of the condition by combining approaches in genomics, microbiology, biochemistry, and infection studies. Recent findings demonstrate that a controversial contributor in BV, Gardnerella vaginalis, is sufficient to cause BV-like phenotypes in an animal model of infection and to engage in degradation, foraging, and depletion of mucus barrier sialoglycans. Ongoing studies in the Lewis lab explore novel contexts and mechanisms of bacterial glycan mimicry, roles of bacterial glycosidases in colonization and infection, and concepts in glyco-ecology within the female reproductive tract.<fig id="Figc" position="anchor"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10719_2013_9474_Figc_HTML.jpg" position="anchor" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p>Dr. Wen YI</p><p>Dr. Wen Yi received his bachelor degree from Fudan University in China in 2002. He went to the U.S for graduate study, and in 2008 obtained his Ph.D. degree in Biochemistry from the Ohio State University under the guidance of Prof. Peng G. Wang. His doctoral research mainly focused on chemo-enzymatic synthesis of complex carbohydrates, and <italic>in vitro</italic> characterization of bacterial polysaccharide biosynthesis. From 2008 to 2012, he conducted his postdoctoral training with Prof. Linda C. Hsieh-Wilson in California Institute of Technology, where he carried out studies to understand the role of O-GlcNAcylation in regulating cancer metabolism and cell growth. After finishing his postdoctoral training, he moved back to China and accepted a faculty position at the College of Life Sciences in Zhejiang University. He was awarded multiple prestigious research grants, including the Concept Award from the Department of Defense Breast Cancer Research Program, and the Postdoctoral Fellowship from the Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program. He was recently elected to the Thousand Young Talents Program, a prestigious award given by the Chinese government for recruiting outstanding young talents from overseas.</p><p><bold>Plenary Lectures</bold></p><p><bold>001: A structural and genomic view of receptors for cell surface glycans</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Kurt Drickamer</underline></bold>; Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College, London SW7 2AZ, United Kingdom</p><p>k.drickamer@imperial.ac.uk</p><p>Mammalian receptors that recognise specific oligosaccharides represent an important way in which information in glycan structures can be decoded. We are interested in defining the complement of human glycan-binding receptors and understanding how they function. Our focus is on receptors that contain calcium-dependent carbohydrate-recognition domains. Biochemical, structural and glycan array studies have revealed multiple different mechanisms by which these receptors bind selectively to different types of glycans. In receptors found on macrophages, dendritic cells and endothelial cells in the innate immune system, the binding mechanisms often favour interaction with broad classes of sugar structures, facilitating selective interaction with viral, bacterial and fungal pathogens. In receptors that mediate either glycoprotein trafficking in cells and organisms or cell-cell adhesion, the binding sites are more restrictive, leading to interactions with a much more limited set of oligosaccharides. Knowledge of the structures of carbohydrate-recognition domains has led to identification of novel glycan-binding receptors. Investigation of these receptors and their target ligands has allowed us to proposal novel roles for carbohydrate-mediated communication between cells.</p><p><bold>002: Glycomics and glycoproteomics: Windows to glycan function</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Anne Dell</underline></bold>; Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London, SW7 2AZ, UK</p><p>a.dell@imperial.ac.uk</p><p>Ultra-high sensitivity mass spectrometric strategies incorporating MALDI-MS/MS and nano-electrospray(ES)-MS/MS enable very complex mixtures of glycans and glycopeptides from biological extracts of cells and tissues to be studied thereby revealing the types of glycans present and, importantly, providing clues to structures that are likely to be functionally important. Glycomic methodologies seek to define the total N-glycan and/or O-glycan repertoire in a biological sample, whilst glycoproteomic strategies are concerned with the analysis of glycopeptides in order to define heterogeneity at individual glycosylation sites.</p><p>Data emerging from our glycomic and glycoproteomic programmes of collaborative research, which are helping to provide new insights into the functions of glycans in health and disease, will be described. Exemplar projects in the fields of human reproduction, pathogen-host interactions, glycoimmunology and congenital disorders of glycosylation will be discussed.</p><p>In addition our progress on the development of informatic tools to manage the large volumes of data being acquired will be outlined.</p><p>Acknowledgements: My research is primarily supported by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.

Among them GnT (UDP-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases)-III, IV, V, IX (Vb), and Fut8 (alpha1,6-fucosyltransferase) play key roles in various physiological and pathological situations. These enzymatic products such as bisecting GlcNAc, beta1,6-GlcNAc branching and core fucose are attached to specific target proteins, including E-cadherin, integrin RPTP (receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase)-beta, TGF (transforming growth factor)-beta receptors, EGF (epidermal growth factor) receptors, glucose transporters, and play key roles in various diseases such as the development of cancer, type II diabetes, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia <italic>etc.</italic> Serum proteins such as AFP (alpha fetoprotein) are also being used or planned for use as cancer biomarkers. Moreover glycan modifications, such as core fucose, result in an enhancement in the activity of ADCC (antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity) for antibody therapy against leukemia and several other diseases. On the other hand, the deletion of core fucose in mice is semi-lethal and the survivors develop emphysema. In humans and mice, decreased levels of core fucose result in the development of sensitivity to emphysema and COPD, respectively. Bisecting GlcNAc was found to have a suppressive action against cancer metastasis and to be involved in the development of a protective effect against Alzheimer’s disease. In some cases, the addition of bisecting GlcNAc in the brain results in the opposite behavior. In the case of GnT-V, its activity is high in most cancers with metastatic properties, whereas it is decreased in some.</p><p>In this lecture I will present an overview of the complex and yin and yang behavior of branched N-glycans when added to target proteins.</p><p><bold>004: Cytoplasmic Glycosylation Targets a Polyubiquitin Ligase to Control Oxygen Sensing in Protists</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Christopher M.

The target of this modification is a single proline on Skp1, an adaptor subunit of the large SCF (Skp1/cullin-1/F-box protein) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases that control physiological and developmental timing <italic>via</italic> targeted protein degradation. Genetic studies show that prolyl hydroxylation and five sequential glycosylation reactions modulate O2-sensing by a mechanism that does not affect Skp1 stability. Cellular and biochemical studies reveal that modifications affect Skp1 conformation and promote binding to F-box proteins, the first step in SCF assembly. The terminal glycosyltransferase is particularly influential, contributing both positive enzymatic and negative non-enzymatic functions to pathway activity and Skp1 function. Key elements of the pathway have conserved O2-sensing functions in other protists including the agent for human toxoplasmosis, Toxoplasma gondii. The findings suggest a model in which developmental progression is tuned by environmental cues <italic>via</italic> a multi-step hydroxylation/glycosylation pathway that controls the rate of assembly of E3SCFUb-ligases which, in turn, influence lifetimes of specific regulatory targets according to the genetic program of F-box protein expression.</p><p><bold>005: Complicated N-linked glycans in simple organisms</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Iain B.

However, strides are being made in a few groups of invertebrate and unicellular organisms as regards their N-glycans and N-glycosylation pathways. Thereby, the traditional classification of glycan structures inevitably approaches its boundaries. Indeed, the glycomes of these organisms are rich in surprises including a multitude of modifications of the core regions of N-glycans and unusual antennae. The trifucosylation of nematode N-glycan cores can now, from our data, be explained enzymologically; the pentosylation of trichomonad and <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> glycans is based on different Man<sub>5</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> or Man<sub>8-9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> based scaffolds; zwitterionic glycans with phosphorylcholine or phosphorylethanolamine are found in nematodes, cestodes and some <italic>Trichomonas</italic> strains; phosphate and sulphate are modifications of glycans from one trichomonad strain, from <italic>Dicytostelium</italic>, from oysters and possibly even insects. From the actually rather limited glycomic information we have, it is nevertheless obvious that the biotechnological, developmental and immunological relevance of these modifications, especially in insect cell lines, model organisms or parasites means that deciphering unusual glycomes is of more than just academic interest.</p><p><bold>006: Targeting siglecs for modulation of immune responses</bold></p><p><bold>Mathew S.

Using rational design and high-throughput synthesis and screening of sialoside analogs we have developed siglec ligands that selectively recognize a single siglec, suitable for <italic>in vivo</italic> targeting of liposomal nanoparticles loaded with a therapeutic agent or immune modifier to siglec bearing cells. Using this platform, we have investigated the roles of B cell siglecs, CD22 and Siglec-G, in modulation of B cell receptor signaling. CD22 and Siglec-G are well documented as inhibitory co-receptors of the B cell receptor. We hypothesized that the inhibitory activities of CD22 and Siglec-G cooperate to tolerize B cells that recognize a cell surface autoantigen, as a result of their recruitment to the site of the immunological synapse <italic>via</italic> sialic acid containing ligands on the antigen bearing cell. To test this, we generated liposomes displaying an antigen and siglec ligands to mimic a cell expressing an autoantigen. Remarkably, injection of the liposomes into mice results in induction of apoptosis in reactive B cells, and the mice are then incapable of mounting an antibody response to that antigen in a subsequent challenge. Since development of inhibitory antibodies to FVIII is a serious problem in treatment of hemophilia A patients, we investigated the potential of this approach for inducing tolerance to FVIII in a hemophilia mouse model. Our tolerogenic liposomes prevented formation of inhibitory FVIII antibodies, allowing for effective administration of FVIII to hemophilia mice to prevent bleeding. Further studies have documented that the same tolerogenic mechanism is induced by natural siglec ligands present on cells that contain a membrane bound antigen. Thus, through a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches, we have obtained strong evidence for a major function of the B cell siglecs as receptors that recognize sialic acid as ‘self’ to induce apoptosis in autoreactive B cells for maintenance of peripheral tolerance. Exploiting this mechanism has therapeutic potential in the areas of autoimmunity, allergies, and biotherapeutics (NIH grants AI050143, AI099141, CA013889 and HFSP Fellowship LT001099/2010-L).</p><p><bold>007: Large-scale identification of</bold><bold><italic>in vivo</italic></bold><bold>target proteins of glycosyltransferases by Lectin-IGOT-LC/MS, an LC/MS-based glycoproteomic approach using knock-out mouse</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Hisashi Narimatsu</underline></bold>; Research Center for Medical Glycoscience, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), 1-1-1 Umezono, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8568, Japan</p><p>Model organisms containing deletion or mutation in a glycosyltransferase-gene exhibit various physiological abnormalities, suggesting that specific glycan motifs on certain proteins play important roles <italic>in vivo</italic>.

Cummings</underline></bold><bold>, Yingchun Wang, Xiaokun Ding, Sean Stowell, and Tongzhong Ju;</bold> Department of Biochemistry, The Emory Glycomics Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA</p><p>Altered expression of glycan structures is seen in many human diseases and disorders, including many types of cancers. A common modification of membrane and secreted glycoproteins is O-GalNAc type O-glycans linked to Ser/Thr residues. These O-GalNAc O-glycans are normally extended, and occur as branched, sialylated, sulfated, and/or fucosylated forms. Our studies show that such O-glycans are essential for normal development and are involved in numerous cellular interactions. In addition, normal O-GalNAc O-glycans are essential to for normal hemostasis, and truncations of O-glycans result in altered blood cell and endothelial cell functions, including abnormal hemostasis from loss of functions in platelets and Von Willebrand factor. In some human diseases in human diseases such O-GalNAc glycans are be truncated. Among the most common tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens are the Tn and Sialyl Tn antigen. Extension of the Tn antigen (GalNAcα1-Ser/Thr), which is a normal precursor for extended O-glycans, is under the control of two key genes, the X-linked gene encoding Cosmc (Xq24) and the autosomal gene encoding the T-synthase (7p14-p13). Expression of functional T-synthase, a β3-galactosyltransferase that is required for formation of normal extended core 1-derived O-glycans of the structure Galβ1-3GalNAcα1-Ser/Thr, depends on the expression of the unique molecular chaperone Cosmc. Our studies show that Cosmc is a resident protein in the endoplasmic reticulum that prevents oligomerization of the T-synthase into inactive forms that are targeted for degradation, and promotes formation of active T-synthase dimers that leave the ER to function in the Golgi apparatus. Immunohistochemical screening of a wide variety of human tumor specimens in tissue microarrays with specific monoclonal antibody to the Tn antigen show that it is expressed in a majority of human carcinomas. There are multiple mechanisms that cause Tn expression, including acquired loss-of-function of Cosmc. Thus, the expression of normal O-glycans are required in a surprising number of biological systems and leads to normal glycoprotein function and expression. Moreover, expression of the Tn antigen is uniquely associated with neoplastic transformation and Cosmc is implicated as a major contributor to the expression of altered O-glycans in neoplasia.</p><p><bold>009: General Tactics and New Glycosylation Methods for the Assembly of Naturally Occurring Glycosides</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Biao Yu</underline></bold>; State Key Laboratory of Bio-organic and Natural Products Chemistry, Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200032, China</p><p>byu@mail.sioc.ac.cn,</p><p>The secondary metabolites (or natural products), such as flavonoids, steroids, triterpenes, lipids, and antibiotics, are frequently post-modified with saccharides.

Wolfe St., Baltimore, MD 21205</p><p>gwhart@jhmi.edu</p><p>Dynamic O-GlcNAcylation serves as a major sensor of cellular nutrient status, and has extensive crosstalk with phosphorylation. O-GlcNAc also crosstalks with other abundant post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, methylation, and acetylation. This extensive crosstalk regulates transcription, signaling and cellular metabolism in response to nutrient status. O-GlcNAcylation plays a fundamental role in gene transcription at many levels, including regulation of the basal machinery, as well as modifying the interactions and localizations of transcription factors. Prolonged excess O-GlcNAcylation, as occurs in diabetes, underlies fundamental mechanisms of glucose toxicity. Abnormal O-GlcNAcylation is associated with neurodegenerative disease and is elevated many types of cancer. Recent glycomic analyses have found that many kinases are both modified and regulated by O-GlcNAcylation. For example, O-GlcNAcylation either inhibits or activates, depending upon the kinase, and can alter substrate specificity, as exemplified by casein kinase II. Hyper-O-GlcNAcylation of mitochondrial proteins in diabetic tissues contributes directly to production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mitochondrial O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is strikingly elevated and mis-localized in cardiac mitochondria from diabetic rats. O-GlcNAcylation is very abundant at nerve terminals, is abundant on myriad synaptic vesicle proteins, and appears to play a direct role in learning and memory. OGT is highly enriched in the post-synaptic density. Supported by NIH R01CA42486, R01DK61671; N01-HV-00240; P01HL107153 and the Patrick C.

Sialidase activity in vaginal fluids is diagnostic of BV and sialic acid-rich components of mucus have protective and immunological roles. However, while mucus degradation is believed to be important in the etiology and complications associated with BV, the role(s) of sialidases and the participation of individual bacterial species in the degradation of mucus barriers in BV have not been investigated. Here we demonstrate that the BV-associated bacterium Gardnerella vaginalis uses sialidase to break down and deplete sialic-acid-containing mucus components in the vagina. Biochemical evidence using purified sialoglycan substrates supports a model in which 1) G. vaginalis extracellular sialidase hydrolyzes mucosal sialoglycans, 2) liberated sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid) is transported into the bacterium, a process inhibited by excess N-glycolylneuraminic acid, and 3) sialic acid catabolism is initiated by an intracellular aldolase/lyase mechanism. G. vaginalis engaged in sialoglycan foraging <italic>in vitro</italic>, in the presence of human vaginal mucus, and <italic>in vivo</italic>, in a murine vaginal model, in each case leading to depletion of sialic acids. Comparison of sialic acid levels in human vaginal specimens also demonstrated significant depletion of mucus sialic acids in women with BV compared to women with a “normal” lactobacilli-dominated microbiota. Taken together, these studies show that G. vaginalis utilizes sialidase to support the degradation, foraging, and depletion of protective host mucus barriers, and that this process of mucus barrier degradation and depletion also occurs in the clinical setting of BV.</p><p><bold>012: Protein O-GlcNAcylation Regulates Cancer Metabolism and Cell Growth</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Wen Yi</underline></bold><sup><bold>1,2</bold></sup><bold>, Peter Clark</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Daniel Mason</bold><sup><bold>3</bold></sup><bold>, Eric Peters</bold><sup><bold>3</bold></sup><bold>, Edward Driggers</bold><sup><bold>4</bold></sup><bold>, and Linda C.

More recently, O-GlcNAcylation is also implicated in tumor pathogenesis. For instance, O-GlcNAc levels are increased in multiple tumor types, and O-GlcNAc ablation has caused inhibition of tumor growth and cancer metastasis. However, the functional role of O-GlcNAc in cancer development and progression is largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that O-GlcNAcylation of a key glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1) plays an important role in regulating cancer cell growth and metabolism. Glycosylation inhibited PFK1 activity and redirected glucose flux through the pentose phosphate pathway, thereby conferring a selective growth advantage to cancer cells.

However, little is known about the age- and sex-associated differences in the glycopatterns of human salivary glycoproteins and their significant roles against influenza A virus (IVA). Here we investigate the glycopatterns of human salivary glycoproteins with 180 healthy saliva samples divided into six age/sex groups using lectin microarrays and fabricate saliva microarrays to validate the terminal carbohydrate moieties of glycoproteins in individual saliva samples. Furthermore, we assess the binding activity of saliva against two strains of influenza A (H9N2) virus. We find that seven lectins (<italic>e.g.</italic>, MAL-II and SNA) show significant age differences in both females and males, and seven lectins (<italic>e.g.</italic>, WFA and STL) show significant sex differences in children, adults and elderly people. Interestingly, we observe that elderly individuals have the strongest resistance to IVA mainly by presenting more terminal α2-3/6-linked sialic acid residues in their saliva, which bind with the influenza viral hemagglutinations. We conclude that age- and sex- associated differences in the glycopatterns of human salivary glycoproteins may provide pivotal information to help understand some age related diseases and physiological phenomenon.</p><p><bold>015: Analysis of glycan and lectin arrays printed on functionalized ITO slides by Mass Spectrometry and Fluorescence</bold></p><p><bold>Ana Beloqui</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Javier Calvo</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Manuel Martin-Lomas</bold><sup><bold>1,3</bold></sup><bold>, </bold><bold><underline>Niels-Christian Reichardt</underline></bold><sup><bold>1,3</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup>Biofunctional Nanomaterials Unit, CICbiomaGUNE, Donostia-San Sebastian, 20009, Spain, <sup>2</sup>Mass Spectrometry Platform, CICbiomaGUNE, Donostia-San Sebastian, 20009, Spain, <sup>3</sup><italic>CIBER-BBN,</italic> Donostia-San Sebastian, 20009, Spain</p><p>nreichardt@cicbiomagune.es</p><p>Microarrays are now the preferred format for most high-throughput screening applications in genomics, proteomics and glycomics and the ability to analyze them by more than a single readout method is desirable to broaden their applications.<sup>[1]</sup> We have prepared micrometer sized glycan and lectin arrays on functionalized indium tin oxide (ITO) slides that can be analyzed by fluorescence spectroscopy, MALDI-Tof-MS and optical microscopy without a change of the format.

The aim of this study was to identify altered glycans which take the responsibilities in the metastasis of breast carcinoma cells. To this end, human breast carcinoma cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and its single cell progenies (SCPs) of different metastatic abilities were examined by lectin microarray with 91 lectins. As a result, we found lectins, PTL II, RCA-I and black bean crude express an increasing binding with the rising of metastatic ability of breast cancer cells. In contrary, lectins, VFA, PSA and WGA express a decreasing binding with the rising of metastatic ability of the same cells. And most interestingly, WFA, a lectin binds to glycans terminating in N -acetylgalactosamine linked alpha or beta to the 3 or 6 position of galactose, showed a different binding to the breast cancer cells of close metastatic ability, but different organ-specificities, which indicate that the glycans recognized by WFA plays a role in the tropism of metastatic breast tumor cells. To our knowledge, we are the first one to show the global picture of membrane- localized glycans related to tumor metastasis in breast cancer. We believe the results from this study will help us to pave the way for studying the correlation of aberrant glycans and breast cancer metastasis, and the underlying mechanism.</p><p>References:</p><p>1.

The functional roles of glycoproteins include cell signaling and immune response. Thus, understanding the structure of sugars and effects of glycosylation are vital for developing indicators of disease. Although computational methods based on mass spectrometry data have proven to be effective in monitoring changes in the glycome, developing such methods for the glycoproteome can be challenging, largely due to the inherent complexity in studying glycan structures in tandem with corresponding glycosylation sites. Here, we present a computational framework for identifying <italic>intact glycopeptides</italic>, <italic>i.e.</italic> glycopeptides with glycans attached to their glycosylation sites, in complex proteome samples. Scoring algorithms are presented for tandem mass spectra of glycopeptides resulting from Collision-Induced Dissociation (CID), High-energy C-trap Dissociation (HCD) and Electron Transfer Dissociation (ETD) fragmentation methods. An empirical false-discovery rate (FDR) estimation method is derived based on a target-decoy search approach to assign confidence to the identified glycopeptides. The power of our method is further enhanced when multiple datasets are pooled together from technical and biological replicates. Using this framework, a considerable number (~100) of highly confident glycopeptides are identified from complex human serum proteome samples using conventional liquid chromatography mass spectrometry platforms without any further glycopeptide enrichment. Finally, we developed a novel linear statistical model for quantifying and comparing site-specific glycosylation events across multiple samples. We applied the model to an esophagus cancer study based on blood serum samples to discover potential glyco-biomarkers that show significant abundance alteration at glycopeptide level, but not at the corresponding whole glycoprotein levels. A total of five glycoproteins were detected in this study showing significantly different abundances at site-specific glycosylation levels within cancer/control samples, indicating that our method is ready to be used for the discovery of biomarkers on site-specific protein glycosylations for human disease. Our framework was implemented in a new software tool called GlycoFragWork, which analyzes multiple pre-aligned LC-MS/MS datasets, and reports a list (termed as a <italic>glycomap</italic>) of identified intact glycopeptides with their mass, elution time and abundances.

Despite advances in medical technology, the 5-year survival rate is 8–13 %, likely due to the fact that the majority of patients with HCC are diagnosed at advanced stage. Currently, alpha-feto protein (AFP) is used in combination with several imaging methodologies to help identify HCC. Unfortunately, AFP is elevated only in 40–60 % of patient with HCC, limiting its usefulness. In this setting of a significant increase in the number of patients with HCC, early detection and treatment are vital to improve outcome. The association of carbohydrates with cancer has long been known and we were one of the first groups to combine glycomic strategies with proteomic methods to identify modified glycoproteins in cancer. One such protein was Golgi protein 73 (GP73), which has shown great promise as a biomarker of HCC and is now commercially available in China.</p><p>However, GP73 has limitations and is better in the detection of AFP positive cancers than in the detection of AFP negative cancers. Thus in this study, we have performed biomarker discovery in AFP and GP73 negative, HCC positive individuals. Our discovery effort involved the examination of the N-linked glycans on serum proteins following resolution <italic>via</italic> two dimensional electrophoresis (2DE). This approach has led to the discovery of specific change in glycosylation that were associated with AFP negative HCC. The changes that were observed included increased levels of alpha 2,6 linked sialic acid and increased level of branching on several proteins.

Quantitative and/or qualitative variations in glycans may result in aberrant glycosylation patterns, which are linked to cancer metastasis. In this study, we attempted to identify alterations of N-glycans involved in tumor metastasis in SKOV3(human serous ovarian cancer cell line) and its high metastatic derivative cell line. Using quantitative glycomics technology, we determined the detailed N-glycan profile of secreted proteins from this two ovarian cancer cell lines. Interestingly, the N-linked glycomic profiles revealed that the levels of some specific glycoforms like tri-antennary glycans that were identified altered in SKOV3ip compared to high metastastic derivative cell line. Real time PCR, western blotting analysis, transwell experiments and immunohistochemical study were further employed to validated these specific changes. All the results were in accordance with the change of the N-glycans revealed by quantitative glycomics methods. With the methods, we revealed specific N-glycans changes of cell-secreted proteomes associated with metastasis of epithelial ovarian cancer. Our data suggest alterations of these glycoforms in human ovarian cancer cells correlate with cancer metastasis, and their glycan subclass could poteintially be used as a biomarker for metastatic prognosis. Also, this study are helpful to understand the mechanism of metastasis of epithelial ovarian cancer.</p><p><bold>022: Monoclonal IgM cryoglobulins show patient specific glycosylation patterns that differ from average polyclonal human IgM</bold></p><p><sup><bold>1,2</bold></sup><bold><underline>Daniel Kolarich</underline></bold>, <sup><bold>2,3</bold></sup><bold>Pia H.

The clinical severity varies widely and correlates with the type of cryoglobulin (monoclonal or mixed Igs) and the physical nature of the aggregates (precipitate, gel or crystal). We present a comprehensive glycoproteomic study of two monoclonal IgM cryoglobulins (Pot [precipitating] and Yvo [gelling]) isolated from plasma of patients with Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia [2], and compare this data with commercially available polyclonal IgM isolated from pooled normal human plasma.</p><p>Porous Graphitized Carbon (PGC) LC-ESI-IT-MS/MSn glyco-profiling of the glycan structures [3] revealed a significant difference between the two cryoglobulin IgMs and normal IgM.

Qualitative and quantitative of the glycoproteome, which involves the identification and quantitation of protein components in various biological systems, therefore becomes an important area for biomarker research.</p><p>However, the huge dynamic range of proteins expressed in the complex biological always masks the detection of the inherent low abundance glycoproteins, and the glycan microheterogeneity further reduces the relative amount of glycopeptides and decreases the detection sensitivity. To gain thorough insights into glycosylation and elucidate the functional relationship among proteins, efficient separation of glycoproteins for their analysis is absolutely necessary. Therefore, one of our research interests is the development of novel methods for highly specific and efficient capture of glycoproteins. Different kinds of boronic acid-functionalized nanomaterials have been developed and successfully applied to glyco-specific enrichment in large-scale glycosylation identification. Sensitivity for glycoproteins was improved by 1 ~ 2 orders using these newly synthesized nanocomposites. Especially, 165 new N-glycosylation sites were identified by our new methods. The other research interests of our group focuses on developing mass-spectrometry based strategies for the relative quantification of glycoproteins as well as the changes of occupancy of N-glycosylation at specific sites between healthy and diseased individuals. 18O atom incorporated into the N-glycosylation site of asparagines-linked sugar chains specifically <italic>via</italic> a N-glycosidase F (PNGase F)-mediated hydrolysis served as one isotope-code. Other labeling methods, for example 18O or iTRAQ, introduced an additional isotope-code. Thus, the relative quantities of N-glycosylated and its parent protein levels were obtained simultaneous by measuring the intensity ratios of 18O/16O for glycosylated peptides and 18O/16O or 114/115/116/117 for nonglycosylated peptides, respectively. A comparison of these two ratios was utilized to evaluate the changes of occupancy of N-glycosylation at specific sites. For example, N-glycosylation site ratios on serum haptoglobin (Hp) beta-chain in healthy individuals as well as patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV), liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were quantified and glycosite ratios of VVLHPN#YSQVDIGLIK were observed to change significantly in HCC patients compared with LC and HBV patients.</p><p><bold>024: Characterization of the Yeast Glycoprotoeme by Using Hydrophilic Affinity Enrichment Coupled to Mass Spectrometry</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Long Yu</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Xinmiao Liang</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup>Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian, 116023, China</p><p>souron@126.com</p><p>Glycosylation, which is a common and important post-translational modification of proteins in eukaryotic origanisms, involves in many cellular activities. It is essential to acquire the structure information of glycosylation, <italic>i.e.</italic>, the glycosylation site and the attached glycan structure, prior to understand the biological functions of glycosylation. We developed a bottom-up glycoproteomic strategy based on the hydrophilic affinity enrichment, where a customized hydrophilic material named Click TE-Cys was used for the selective enrichment of glycopeptides. We first evaluated the selectivity and the glycosylation site coverage of Click TE-Cys by using the immunoglobulin G (IgG) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as model glycoproteins, respectively. We have identified 21 IgG glycopeptides in the glycopeptide fraction enriched by Click TE-Cys from the IgG digest mixed with human serum albumin digest (w/w, 1:10). We also identified 11 glycopeptides with different peptide backbone from the enriched HRP glycopeptide fraction. Thereafter, we applied the enrichment method to the lysate of the baker’s yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, where 174 glycosylation sites from 102 glycoproteins were identified. By comparison, only 48 glycosylation sites from 31 glycoproteins were identified from the yeast glycopeptide fraction enriched by concanavalin A-immobilized lectin affinity chromatography. These results indicated the superior selectivity and glycosylation site coverage of the Click TE-Cys material. We hope the Click TE-Cys material and the corresponding enrichment method could be a powerful tool for the glycoproteomics analysis.</p><p><bold>025: The GlycoFilter: A Simple and Comprehensive Sample Preparation Platform for Proteomics, N-Glycomics and Glycosylation Site Assignment</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Hui Zhou</underline></bold><sup>1</sup><bold>, John W.

The amount of glycoproteins, glycosylation site occupancy, and the glycoforms are well known to alter between normal and disease. Unfortunately, current strategies to study N-glycoproteins in complex samples are often distinct, focusing on either N-glycans, or N-glycosites enriched by sugar-based techniques such as the hydrazide beads or lectins. In this study we report a simple and rapid sample preparation platform, the GlycoFilter, which allows a comprehensive characterization of N-glycans, N-glycosites, and proteins in a single workflow. Both PNGase F catalyzed de-N-glycosylation and trypsin digestions are accelerated by microwave irradiation and performed sequentially in a single spin filter. Both N-glycans and peptides (including de-N-glycosylated peptides) are separately collected by filtration. The condition to effectively collect complex and heterogeneous N-glycans, including those with multiple sialic acid residues, was established on model glycoproteins, bovine ribonuclease B, bovine fetuin, and human serum IgG. With this platform, the N-glycome, and proteome of human urine and plasma were characterized. Furthermore, a total of 912 and 318 N-glycosites were identified from three pairs of urine and plasma samples, respectively. Many sites were defined unambiguously as partially occupied by the detection of both their sugar-modified and non-sugar-modified peptides (149 from urine and 75 from plasma), demonstrating that partial occupancy of N-glycosylation occurs frequently, even in healthy adults. Given the likely high prevalence and variability of partial occupancy, an unbiased approach that captures both the sugar-occupied and non-sugar occupied peptide will lead to improved glycoprotein quantifications.</p><p><bold>026: Selective Enrichment of N-linked Glycopeptides Using Hydrophilic Interaction Chromatography-based Materials</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Xiuling Li</underline></bold><bold>*, Bingcheng Yang, Yanyan Zhao, Xinmiao Liang;</bold> Key Lab of Separation Science for Analytical Chemistry, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Science,457 Zhongshan Road, Dalian 116023, China</p><p>lixiuling@dicp.ac.cn</p><p>N-linked protein glycosylation is the most common post-translational modification (PTM). However, characterizing this PTM is difficult for mass spectrometry (MS) because of low concentration of glycopeptides and suppression effect of non-glycosylated peptides. Therefore it is imperative to enrich glycopeptides prior to MS analysis. Hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) in solid phase extraction (SPE) mode has been increasingly employed to enrich glycopeptides in the last few years. Various types of N-linked glycopeptides can be selectively separated from non-glycosylated peptides and the glycosylation heterogeneity coverage is improved. However, the enrichment selectivity for glycopeptides is moderate because of co-elution of non-glycosylated peptides containing multiple serine/threonine residues or larger molecular weight. In order to improve the enrichment selectivity of glycopeptides, two types of novel HILIC-based materials including Click aspartic acid (Click Asp) and Click OEG-CD were synthesized in our group and applied to enrich N-linked glycopeptides. For the case of Click OEG-CD, N-linked glycopeptides could be selectively enriched through reversed phase depletion coupled with hydrophilic affinity enrichment. Compared to single HILIC mode, the method exhibited remarkably higher selectivity for glycopeptides. Concerning Click Asp, It demonstrated good hydrophilic property for separation of highly polar compounds. Click-Asp based HILIC SPE was observed to efficiently bind both neutral and sialylated glycopeptides with short to long peptide chain. The application of Click-Asp to simulated proteomic samples proved its specialty toward glycopeptides. The high hydrophilicity of these Click-based HILIC materials result from their unique structure constructed <italic>via</italic> simple click chemistry. We believe these HILIC materials will become promising tools in glycoproteomic studies.</p><p><bold>027: Glycoproteomics in the diagnosis and understanding the pathogenesis of Rheumatoid Arthritis</bold></p><p><bold>Ashish Saroha</bold><sup><bold>1,3</bold></sup><bold>, Sagarika Biswas</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Sarvanan Kumar</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Hasi R Das</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, </bold><bold><underline>Bishnu P Chatterjee</underline></bold><sup><bold>2*</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup>Glycomics and Molecular Medicine Division, CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Delhi-110007, India, <sup>2</sup>Department of Natural Science, West Bengal University of Technology, Salt Lake, Kolkata-700064, India, <sup>3</sup>Department of Biological Chemistry, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot-76100, Israel.</p><p>cbishnup@gmail.com</p><p>Glycosylation studies of plasma proteins can provide information about the onset and progression of disease. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune, chronic systemic inflammatory disease characterized by swelling of synovial joint leading to there deformation and destruction. The most notable changes in the development of RA are alteration of glycosylation in plasma proteins and there level of expression. The increased level of agalctosylated IgG (IgG0) correlates with the disease severity of RA and thus showing its role in disease pathogenesis. Our study demonstrates plasma glycoproteins enrichment by <italic>wheat germ</italic> agglutinin (WGA) followed by 2DE. The protein spots were identified by MALDI-TOF-MS. Database search of MS-MS spectra identified alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), haptoglobin alpha 2 (Hp-α2) and haptoglobin beta 2 (Hp-β) chain respectively. High performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulse amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) revealed the presence of significantly higher levels of GlcN (<italic>p</italic> = 0.02), Gal (<italic>p</italic> = 0.01) and Man (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0) in plasma of AGP in RA patients. Similarly by HPAEC-PAD analysis showed the decreased amount of Man (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.5) in Hp-β chain of RA patients. These results were further validated by ELISA using ConA lectin which showed higher binding of ConA with AGP in RA plasma indicating possible increased expression of biantenary glycan. In another study <italic>O-</italic>linked glycoproteins in plasma of RA patients enriched by jacalin affinity chromatography followed by 2DE revealed a number of differentially expressed protein spots as compared to healthy control. Eighteen protein spots were found to have statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.5) difference in their expression level from four sets of gel and were identified by MALD-TOF-MS. Most of the proteins were identified to be <italic>O</italic> glycosylated by Net-O-Gly 3.1 algorithm. Among these the alpha 2-HS glycoprotein (A2HSG) were found to be down regulated whereas inter alpha trypsin inhibitor 4 (ITIH4) was up regulated and this was validated by western blotting. Thus glycoproteomics is a promising approach to discover novel glyco-markers in diagnosis of RA and understanding the disease pathogenesis.</p><p><bold>Biosynthesis &amp; Metabolism of Glycoconjugates</bold></p><p><bold>028: Keynote Lecture: Development of Glyco-enzyme Inhibitors</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Chun-Hung Lin</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup>Institute of Biological Chemistry, Academia Sinica, Taipei 115 Taiwan</p><p>chunhung@gate.sinica.edu.tw</p><p>Fucosyltransferases (FucTs) usually catalyze the final step of glycosylation and are critical to many biological processes.

In this process, trimming reaction of α-1,2 linked mannose moieties is catalyzed by members of glycosylhydrolase family 47, which include ER α-1,2 mannosidase I (ERManI), Golgi α-1,2 mannosidase IA-C, and EDEM1-3.</p><p>We had synthesized various high-mannose type oligosaccharides by our convergent methods and utilized them to analyze biochemical characteristics of proteins involved in ER quality control<sup>1</sup>. As a part of the studies, we had revealed that a recombinant form of human ERManI had an activity to generate smoothly Man<sub>6-5</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> from Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>. In addition, hERManI removed more mannose moieties from some glycoproteins, when they had been exposed to denaturing conditions<sup>2, 3</sup>. In this study, we have examined to reveal influencial factors and reaction conditions which could accelerate trimming of mannoses from the oligosaccharides by ERManI in living organisms.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Pyridylaminated GlcMan<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> was prepared from oligosaccharides in chicken immunoglobulin Y<sup>3</sup>. Mannotrioses of Man(α-1,2)Man(α-1,2)Man-dansyl<sup>2</sup>, Man(α-1,2)Man(α-1,3)Man-dansyl, and Man(α-1,2)Man(α-1,6)Man-dansyl were synthesized. A solution of polyethyleneglycol (PEG) was included in each de-mannosylation reaction<sup>2</sup>.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> First, chemicals to induce macromolecular crowding effects were included in the reaction. As a result, removal of mannoses from GlcMan<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>-PA was markedly accelerated in the presence of 50 % PEG 400. The result may suggest that de-mannosylation by hERManI could be enhanced under macromolecular crowding circumstances.</p><p>Second, we have revealed that all three mannotrioses were susceptible to hERManI. The reactivity of hERManI to Man(α-1,2)Man(α-1,6)Man was, however, much lower than the two other compounds, suggesting that the efficiency of de-mannosylation by hERManI was highly dependent on the structure at the non-reducing end. When reactions were performed at pH 5–7, maximum processing of those compounds was observed around pH 5.0. In addition, hERManI exhibited highest efficiency at pH 5.5 of de-mannosylation from heat-treated immunoglobulin Y. These results indicated that de-mannosylation by hERManI was accelerated under acidic conditions.</p><p><sup>1</sup>Takeda, Y. <italic>et al. Curr. Opin. Chem.

Methods: Online prediction of the transcription factor c-jun binding sites in the β3Gn-T8 promoter region was performed with a transcription factor database. Eight β3Gn-T8 promoter segments and one mutated segment were cloned by PCR from the gastric cancer cell line SGC-7901 genomic DNA. Then, they were used to construct recombinant plasmids with luciferase reporter gene respectively. The above β3Gn-T8 promoter segment reporter gene expression vectors, as well as an internal control plasmid pRL-SV40 and transcription factor expression vector pCI-neo-jun were co-transfected into the SGC-7901 cells. A Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System was used to detect the activation of the β3Gn-T8 promoter by the transcription factor c-jun. Whether the activation relied on the c-jun binding site (-561/+8) of β3Gn-T8, and whether it was dose-dependent on c-jun was also observed. Furthermore, the binding of c-jun protein to β3Gn-T8 DNA in gastric cancer cells was detected using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Results: The transcription factor c-jun binding sites resided within the β3Gn-T8 promoter region and could activate the transcriptional of β3Gn-T8. pGL3-luc (-561/+8) showed the highest luciferase activity, which was dose-dependent on c-jun. The ChIP results verified the binding of c-jun to β3Gn-T8 DNA fragments. Conclusion: The transcription factor c-jun is involved in the expression regulation of β3Gn-T8 in the gastric cancer cell line SGC-7901.</p><p><bold>035: Epigenetic regulation of glycosyltransferase gene expression</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Yasuhiko Kizuka</underline></bold><sup><bold>1,2</bold></sup><bold>, Shinobu Kitazume</bold><sup><bold>1,2</bold></sup><bold>, Naoyuki Taniguchi</bold><sup><bold>1, 2, 3</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup>Disease Glycomics Team, <sup>2</sup>RIKEN-Max Planck Joint Research Center, RIKEN, Wako, 351-0198, Japan;<sup>3</sup>Alliance Laboratory of ISIR, Osaka Univ. and RIKEN, Ibaraki, 567-0047, Japan.</p><p>y.kizuka@riken.jp</p><p>Glycan expression is regulated by several factors such as nucleotide-sugars, acceptor substrate molecules, glycosidase <italic>etc.</italic> Expression level of glycosyltransferase is a key factor to control glycan expression, and the tissue-specific regulation of glycosyltransferase expression is indispensable for distinct glycan biosynthesis in tissues. However, it is poorly understood how each glycosyltransferase is expressed in a tissue specific manner, suggesting that unidentified mechanisms exist to regulate glycosyltransferase gene expression.</p><p>Recently, we have reported that the expression of one of brain-specific glycosyltransferases, GnT-IX (also designated as GnT-Vb), is epigenetically regulated at chromatin level (Kizuka <italic>et al.</italic> J. Biol. Chem. 2011). Particularly, active and repressive histone modification marks are well-correlated with the GnT-IX mRNA expression level in a tissue or cell-type specific manner, indicating that brain specific GnT-IX expression is regulated by an epigenetic mechanism. So far, however, little is known about detailed mechanisms of how glyco-genes including GnT-IX are regulated epigenetically.</p><p>In this study, we investigated epigenetic mechanisms of how chromatin of GnT-IX gene is activated. In addition, epigenetic regulation mechanisms of other glycosyltransferase genes are also analyzed including GnT-III, -V and Fut8. As target epigenetic factors, we focused on 1) HDAC (histone deacetylase) that downregulates histone acetylation, 2) histone methylation particularly at histone H3 lysine 27 that is involved in gene repression, 3) TET (ten-eleven translocation) that is required for hydroxylation of methylated DNA. As a result, we found that histone acetylation selectively activates GnT-IX gene among the glyco-genes tested while histone methylation down-regulates several glycosyltransferase genes in a cell type specific manner. In addition, it was revealed that TET enzyme is involved in activation of the specific GnT genes. These results indicate that glycosyltransferase genes are systematically regulated by multiple epigenetic mechanisms and that each gene is distinctly regulated by different epigenetic factors.</p><p><bold>036: Keynote Lecture: Plasma membrane glycohydrolases and new strategies for medical dignosis and therapeutic treatments</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Sandro Sonnino</underline></bold><bold>, Nicoletta Loberto, Rosaria Bassi, Vanna Chigorno, Alessandro Prinetti and Massimo Aureli;</bold> Department of Medical Biotechnology and Translational Medicine, University of Milan, Italy</p><p>The following enzymes of the sphingolipid metabolism have been found associated to the external leaflet of the plasma membranes: sialidase, sialyl transferase, -hexosaminidase, -galactosaminyl transferase, β-galactosidase, β-glucosidase, sphingomyelinase, sphingomyelin synthase.</p><p>The association of glycosphingolipid metabolic enzymes with the plasma membranes, the information on their activity on natural substrates in living cells, the availability of couples of enzymes capable to catalyze opposite reactions, suggest that changes of glycosphingolipid structures at the plasma membrane could be the way to change rapidly the GSL plasma membrane concentration, to modify the glycosphingolipid pattern and to modulate cell functions.</p><p>All the enzymatic activities found associated to the plasma membranes result strictly related to the extracellular pH, being in general optimal under mild acidic conditions. Mild acidic conditions are found in specific membrane domains known as lipid rafts, where glycosphingolipids are highly enriched together with cholesterol, receptor proteins, proteins involved in cell signaling, and antiports or general ion exchange proteins. Several proton pumps are present on the cell surface and inserted into lipid rafts together with the glycohydrolases. Thus their activity and the following catabolic process at the cell surface, that under particular conditions can lead to apoptosis, can be increased by activating the proton pump and decreasing the local pH of their extracellular environment. In addition to this, it has been demonstrated that a cross talk among the glyoshingolipid hydrolases exists.

Mutations in NST genes cause human and cattle diseases and impaired cell walls of yeast and fungi. Information regarding their function in the protozoan parasite, <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, a causative agent of African trypanosomiasis, is unknown. Here, we characterized the substrate specificities of four NSTs, TbNST1-4, which are expressed in both the insect procyclic form (PCF) and the mammalian bloodstream form (BSF) stages. TbNST1/2 transport UDP-Gal/UDP-GlcNAc, TbNST3 transports GDP-Man, and TbNST4 transports UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-GalNAc and GDP-Man. TbNST4 is the first NST shown to transport both pyrimidine and purine nucleotide sugars and is demonstrated here to be localized at the Golgi apparatus. RNAi-mediated silencing of TbNST4 in PCF caused underglycosylated surface glycoprotein EP-procyclin. Similarly, defective glycosylation of the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG221) as well as the lysosomal membrane protein, p67 was observed in Δ<italic>TbNST4</italic> BSF <italic>T. brucei</italic>. Relative infectivity analysis showed that defects in glycosylation of the surface coat resulting from TbNST4 deletion were insufficient to impact the ability of this parasite to infect mice. Notably, the fact that inactivation of a single NST gene results in measurable defects in surface glycoproteins in different life cycle stages of the parasite, highlights the essential role of NST(s) in glycosylation of <italic>T. brucei</italic>. Thus, results presented in this study provide a framework for conducting functional analyses of other NSTs identified in <italic>T. brucei</italic>.</p><p><bold>039: POFUT1/2 Promotes Embryonic Cell Adhesion and Migration at Fetal-Maternal Interface</bold></p><p><bold>Shuai Liu</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Xuesong Yang</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Jiao Wang</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Xiaoqi Wang</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, </bold><bold><underline>Qiu Yan</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup>Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalian Medical University, Liaoning Provincial Core Lab of Glycobiology and Glycoengineering, Dalian 116044, China; <sup>2</sup>Department of Dermatology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60611, USA</p><p>yanqiu63@126.com</p><p>Implantation is a complex developmental event that is initiated by the recognition and adhesion of the embryo to the endometrial epithelium. The fucosylation of glycoproteins both on the embryonic and uterine epithelial cell surface plays critical roles in the molecular interactions at fetal-maternal interface. Our previous study shows that the occurrence of N-linked fucosylated sugar chain, such as sialyl LeX (sLeX), is closely related to the adhesive potential of embryo to the endometrium. However the function of O-fucosylation in this process is not still clearly stated till now. In this study, the expression of protein O-fucosyltransferases 1 and 2 (POFUT1/2), which are the two subtypes of synthetic enzymes transferring GDP-Fuc to the Ser/Thr residues of the specific substrate protein molecules, was detected in human embryonic cells (Jar) and human uterine epithelial cells (RL95-2 and HEC), respectively. The results showed that both embryonic cells and uterine epithelial cells expressed POFUT1/2 by RT-PCR, Western blot and immunofluorescent assays. The POFUT1/2 expression level was dose-dependently regulated by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in embryonic cells, and was correlated to the adhesive potential detected by adhesive percentage <italic>in vitro</italic> implantation model constituting by Jar and RL95-2. Furthermore, the elevated POFUT1/2 increased the invasive capability of embryonic cells by migration and matrix-degradation assays. The primarily study in mouse also showed that the level of POFUT1/2 in murine embryos changed dynamically with the different stages of embryo development. <bold>Conclusion</bold>: POFUT1/2 is expressed at fetal-maternal interface, and the elevated POFUT1/2 is related to the adhesion, invasion as well as developmental processes of embryo.

Blocking GPI anchor synthesis leads to severe phenotypes such as cell wall defects, increased cell death, and attenuated virulence. However, the mechanism by which the phenotypes are induced is unclear. To gain insight into global effects of GPI anchoring in A. fumigatus, in this study a conditional expression mutant was constructed and a genome wide transcriptome analysis was carried out. Our results suggested that suppression of GPI anchor synthesis mainly led to activation of the phophatidylinositol (PtdIns) signaling and ER stress. Biochemical and morphological evidences showed that autophagy and increased necroptosis were induced in response to suppression of the GPI anchor synthesis. Based on our results, we proposed that activation of PtdIns3K and increased cytosolic Ca2+, which was induced by both ER stress and PtdIns signaling, acted as the main effectors to induce autophagy and necroptosis.</p><p>This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31030025) to C.

The process is evolutionary conserved and contributes to the structural and functional integrity of the N-linked glycoproteins. Dynamics of the N-glycosylation process indicates the presence of a cross-talk between mannosyphospho dolichol synthase (DPMS) and N-acetyl-glucosaminyl 1-phosphate transferase (GPT). DPMS has a conserved phosphorylation motif and has been found to in all Dpm1 gene sequenced from 35 different species, <italic>viz</italic>., protozoan parasite to human. Phosphorylation activation of DPMS accelerates the Glc<sub>3</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>-PP-Dol (LLO) biosynthesis and turnover, and consequently the protein N-glycosylation and capillary endothelial cell proliferation, <italic>i.e.</italic>, angiogenesis. GPT activity is also increased. Cells transfected with overexpressing DPMS plasmid enhances the expression of GlcNAc-β-(1,3)-GlcNAc)1-4-β-GlcNAc-NeuAc containing glycans and increased angiogenesis. Removal of the phosphorylation motif by site-directed mutagenesis prevents DPMS activation and reduction of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> proliferation. Similarly, silencing of DPMS with shRNA down regulates glycan expression, angiogenesis as well as Matrigel™ invasion. Reduced PCNA, Bcl-2 and caspase-3 expression supports that DPMS silencing affects the cell cycle progression without inducing apoptosis. Dol-P-Man is an activator of GPT, and tunicamycin is a competitive inhibitor of GPT. When treated, tunicamycin inhibits DPMS activity in capillary endothelial cells without affecting the protein or the mRNA. The results are G1 arrest and the induction of apoptosis. Silencing of the transcription factor E2F1 has no additive or synergistic effect. Mechanistic details support development of “ER stress” and the cell deaths is due to <italic>unfolded protein response</italic> (upr). Raman Spectroscopy of the proteome at C-O stretching supports protein denaturation. cDNA microarray analysis indicates that among the affected genes, nearly 20 % are transcription factors. The developmentally regulated genes such as c-fos, c-myc and c-jun are all upregulated but not their down-stream regulators. <italic>In vivo</italic>, tunicamycin inhibits angiogenesis in Matrigel™ implants in athymic Balb/c (nu/nu) mice and prevents breast tumor progression.

Pathogens such as <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> use GPI-anchor variants to escape from host immune surveillance, and the enzymes involved in their synthesis are potential drug targets for the treatment and prevention of disease. GPI-anchored proteins are concentrated in lipid rafts on the cell surface or membrane nanodomains and play essential roles in signal transduction in multicellular organisms. Using <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we determined that GPI-anchored proteins are present in germline cells as well as distal tip cells (DTCs), which are essential for maintenance of the germline stem cell niche. We identified 24 <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologs of human genes involved in GPI-anchor synthesis by PSI-BLAST search and used RNAi and gene knockout strategies to inhibit their functions. Inhibition of genes involved in various steps of GPI-anchor synthesis resulted in abnormal development of oocytes and early embryos, and both lethal and sterile phenotypes were observed. The <italic>PIG-A</italic> gene codes for the major catalytic subunit (subunit A) of the phosphatidylinositol N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase complex (EC 2.4.1.198), which catalyses the first step of GPI-anchor synthesis. Mutations in this gene would thus inhibit all GPI-anchor synthesis. By isolating a deletion mutant allele of <italic>piga-1</italic> gene (<italic>C. elegans PIG-A</italic> ortholog), we showed that GPI-anchor synthesis is indispensable for the normal development of germline cells. Lack of GPI-anchor synthesis resulted in 100 % lethality with decreased mitotic germline cell number, abnormal oocyte formation and death of cleaving eggs. Using cell specific rescue of the null allele, we showed that expression of PIGA-1 in DTCs or in gonadal sheath cells is sufficient for germline cells to develop normally.

Among the conventional human iPS (hiPS)/ES marker antibodies, SSEA-3 and SSEA-4 recognize specifically globosides, and TRA-1-60 and TRA-1-81 recognize keratan sulfate. However, most of these antibodies were generated against human embryonal carcinoma (hEC) cells. Consequently, these antibodies recognize those glycans, which are common to hiPS/ES and hEC cells. In order to obtain antibodies specific to hiPS cells, we immunized mice with a hiPS cell line, Tic, and selected hiPS-cell positive hybridomas. These hybridomas were then subjected to screening with hEC cells and hEC positive hybridomas were excluded. Upon Western blotting with antibody R-10G, one of these hiPS/ES specific antibodies, following SDS-PAGE, the Tic cell lysate indicated one major but broad immunoreactive band at the position corresponding to over 250 kDa. The antigen protein was isolated from the Tic cell lysate by using an affinity column of R-10G. The epitope was identified as keratan sulfate with little over-sulfation, since digestion of the R-10G antigen with keratanase, keratanase II and endo-beta-galactosidase reduced completely the immunoractivity of the antigen protein. The carrier protein of the R-10G epitope on hiPS cells was identified as podocalyxin by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) analysis of the R-10G positive-protein band material obtained on SDS-PAGE. The R-10G epitopes differ from those recognized by other human pluripotent-cell marker antibodies such as TRA-1-60 and TRA-1-81 and from high-sulfated keratan sulfate-recognizing antibodies such as 5D4 and BCD4, indicating that the R-10G should be a new useful tool for studying the roles of glycans on the cell surfaces. The R-10G epitope is distributed heterogeneously on hiPS cells, suggesting that a single colony of undifferentiated hiPS cells consists of different cell subtypes. Survey of a human tissue array indicated that the R-10G epitope is not confined to hiPS/ES cells but is expressed in the adult brain and cerebellum.</p><p><bold>044: The role of multiple exopolysaccharides in the communities of</bold><bold><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic></bold><bold>and their coordinate regulation</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Luyan Ma</underline></bold><bold>;</bold> State Key Laboratory of Microbial Resources, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China</p><p>luyanma27@im.ac.c<italic>n</italic></p><p>Biofilms are surface-associated communities of microorganisms encased in an extracellular substances matrix. Exopolysaccharide is a critical biofilm matrix component. <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> can produce several biofilm matrix exopolysaccharides that include alginate, Psl, and Pel, which each has contributions in biofilm. The overproduction of exopolysaccharide alginate leads to the mucoid phenotype of <italic>P. aeruginosa,</italic> which is believed to play a role in the bacteria’s resistance to antibiotics and to evade host defense mechanisms. Our data shows that alginate occupy a lot of space in biofilm, resulting in the muciod biofilm with high biofilm thickness, but little biomass. Psl is an essential matrix component for nonmucoid and mucoid <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to initiate and maintain biofilms. Pel is a glucose-rich exopolysaccharide, which is required to form air-liquid interface biofilms (pellicles). We demonstrated that AlgC, a key enzyme that provides sugar precursors for the synthesis of alginate and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) is also required for both Psl and Pel production. We showed that forced-synthesis of Psl in alginate-producing mucoid bacteria reduced alginate production but this was not due to transcription of the alginate biosynthesis-operon. Likewise, when either alginate or Psl were overproduced, levels of B-band LPS decreased. Induction of Pel resulted in a reduction of Psl levels. Since the effects of reduced exopolysaccharide synthesis when another is overproduced didn’t appear to be regulated at the transcriptional level, this suggests that the biosynthesis pathways of Psl, Pel, alginate, and LPS compete for common sugar precursors. As AlgC is the only enzyme that provides precursors for each of these exopolysaccharides, we propose that AlgC is a key checkpoint enzyme that coordinates the total amount of exopolysaccharide biosynthesis by controlling sugar precursor pool. Our data also provide a plausible strategy that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> utilizes to modulate its biofilm matrix exopolysaccharides.</p><p><bold>045: Keynote Lecture: Roles of Heparan Sulfate in Normal and Cancer Stem Cells in intestine</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Minoru Fukuda</underline></bold><bold>;</bold> Glycobiology Unit, Tumor Microenvironment Program, Cancer Center, Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, La Jolla California 92037, USA</p><p>minoru@sanfordburnham.org</p><p>Differentiation system of intestinal epithelia cells develops from normal stem cells residing crypt of the intestinal cells.

It has been shown that stem cells to normal differentiated cells develop into these cell types while stem cells maintain self-renewal. To determine the roles of heparan sulfate in intestinal cell development, we utilized Lgr5-driven inducible gene knockout, which was generated by Hans Clevers (<underline>Nature</underline>; 459: 262–265, 2009). After treatment on mouse with tamoxifen, heparan sulfate was significantly abrogated. As a result, the height of villus was shorter than EXT1<sup>wt/wt</sup> control mice, and resulted in fewer enterocyte and endocrine cells.

Maintenance of self-renewal and pluripotency in mouse ES cells is regulated by the balance between several extrinsic signaling pathways. Recently, we demonstrated that heparan sulfate (HS) chains play important roles in the maintenance and differentiation of mouse ES cells by regulating extrinsic signaling. Sulfated HS structures are modified by various sulfotransferases during differentiation of mouse ES cells. However, the significance of specific HS structures during their differentiation remains unclear. Therefore, we performed a screen by overexpression of various sulfotransferases in mouse ES cells and found that HS 3-<italic>O</italic>-sulfotransferases (3OSTs) contribute to the differentiation of mouse ES cells.</p><p>The 3-<italic>O</italic>-sulfated HS structure synthesized by 3OSTs and recognized by the antibody HS4C3 increased during differentiation of mouse ES cells.

Furthermore, knockdown of <italic>3OST</italic> and inhibition of Fas signaling reduced the potential for differentiation into the three germ layers during embryoid body formation.

However, the spatial-temporal expression profiles of these novel chondroitin sulphate sulphation motifs in GAGs during the development of human articular cartilage are largely unknown.</p><p><bold>Materials &amp; Methods:</bold> Articular cartilage from figure joints was obtained from aborted human fetuses aged 25 and 32 weeks, respectively. Articular cartilage from normal human figure joints aged 2-year-old was used as a postnatal control. The expression of novel chondroitin sulphated sulphation motifs including 3B3, 4C3, 6C3 and 7D4 were investigated immunohistochemically.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 7D4 and 6C3 positive staining was observed in the articular cartilage from both foetal (25-week-old &amp; 32-week-old) and juvenile figure joints (2-year-old). In 25-week-old foetal figure joints, 7D4 positive staining was found in the inter-territorial matrix in the surface layer of articular cartilage, and the cartilage near synovium. Differently, intensive 7D4 positive staining was observed in the superficial, upper middle zone, and deep zone of articular cartilage near subchondrol bone in the figure joints from 32-week-old foetus. Interestingly, 7D4 positive staining was only localised in the territorial but not inter-territorial matrix around some cell clusters in the deep zone of articular cartilage from the juvenile figure joints. 6C3 positive staining mainly localised in the territorial matrix of surface &amp; middle zone of articular cartilage from 25-week-old foetal figure joints. However, its positive staining expanded to the inter-territorial matrix in the surface and deep zone of articular cartilage from the 32-week-old figure joints. In the juvenile figure joints, 6C3 positive staining can be observed in both territorial and inter-territorial matrix across the whole depth of articular cartilage. There was no or very weak 3B3 or 4C3 positive staining in the articular cartilage from these figure joints.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The different expression profiles of these novel chondroitin sulphated sulphation motifs indicated their dynamics of distributions during articular cartilage development, which may be associated with distinct chondroitin sulphated proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix in the articular cartilage, and tissue mature as well as homeostasis.</p><p><bold>048: Direct interaction of FGF2 with polysialic acid regulates the cell growth, but not cell survival</bold></p><p><bold>Sayaka Ono</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Masaya Hane</bold><sup><bold>1,2</bold></sup><bold>, Ken Kitajima</bold><sup><bold>1,2</bold></sup><bold>, and </bold><bold><underline>Chihiro Sato</underline></bold><sup><bold>1,2</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup>Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University; <sup>2</sup>Program for Leading Graduate Schools IGER, Nagoya University, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan</p><p>chi@agr.nagoya-u.ac.jp</p><p>Polysialic acid (polySia) is a unique polymer that spacio-temporally modifies the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) in vertebrates. Recently, we demonstrated that polySia functions not only as an anti-cell adhesion molecule, but also as a reservoir for neurologically important molecules such as neurotrophic factors and neurotransmitters. In this study, to gain further insight into the reservoir function of polySia, we focused on FGF2 as a critical molecule in neurogenesis and neural functions. We first demonstrated the direct interaction between polySia and FGF2 by native-PAGEs, gel-filtration, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) methods. Actually, polySia formed a large complex with FGF2, and the minimum chain length of polySia for the binding was 17 sialic acid residues. Heparan sulfate (HS), which is a well-known FGF2-binding glycosaminoglycan, also formed a large complex with FGF2; however, the size and structural feature of the FGF2 complexes were completely different between polySia and HS. To understand the effects of the expression of cell surface polySia on FGF2-dependent physiological effects, the cells expressing non-polysialylated NCAM were transfected with plasmids encoding either polysialyltransferase ST8SiaII/STX or ST8SiaIV/PST genes and analyzed for cell survival and cell growth under FGF2 treatment. Interestingly, polySia-NCAM-expressing cells inhibited the FGF2-dependent cell growth without affecting the cell survival. These results suggest that the FGF2-polySia complex stimulates a new signal pathway <italic>via</italic> FGF receptor (FGFR) different than the FGF2-HS complex that triggers conventional FGFR signaling to enhance the cell proliferation.</p><p><bold>049: Novel regulation of the intracellular Ca</bold><sup><bold>2+</bold></sup><bold>by microdomain-localized GPI-anchored glycans in animal sperm</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Ken Kitajima</underline></bold><sup><bold>1,2,3</bold></sup><bold>, Takeru Kanazawa</bold><sup><bold>1,2,3</bold></sup><bold>, Estelle Garénaux</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Waraporn Kasekarn</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Kazuki Hori</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Andrés D.

In 1999, we reported the first biochemical characterization of sperm microdomains from sea urchin [Ohta <italic>et al.</italic> 1999; 2000]. Many reports have since been made on gamete microdomains in various species. Of glycoproteins of sea urchin sperm microdomains, a heavily glycosylated protein localized in sperm flagella, named flagellasialin, is involved in sperm motility by regulating an intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i. Flagellasialin is a GPI-anchored protein that contains a high content of glycans (80–90 % by weight) on a short polypeptide (7.2 kDa). We have recently reported that flagellasialin is involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent mechanosensory behavior of sea urchin sperm [Kambara <italic>et al.</italic> 2011]. Regulation of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i is an important physiological event in animal sperm. However, no report has been made on how heavily glycosylated proteins like flagellasialin are involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation through the microdomain. Therefore, we asked if this type of glycoprotein is also present in sperm of other animals. Here we report the presence of such a glycoprotein in pig sperm. The glycoprotein is named WGA-gp due to its high binding property with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) [Kasekarn <italic>et al.</italic> 2012]. WGA-gp is a highly glycosylated GPI-anchored protein and shares the unique features in localization, structure, and potential function with flagellasialin. Several lines of evidence demonstrated that WGA-gp is identified as CD52, which is known to be a mammals-specific protein. Interestingly, the structure of mature protein and glycans is extensively different among CD52 molecules. Furthermore, the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i started oscillating at sperm population level, when sperm were treated with a monoclonal anti-WGA-gp antibody (4D1). The transient increase of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i was observed at a single cell level. This is a mAb.4D1-specific event, because no other antibody recognizing sperm glycan epitopes induced the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i change. Therefore, the presence of carbohydrate-enriched flagellar proteins involved in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i regulation may be a common feature among animal sperm.</p><p><bold>Infection &amp; Immunity</bold></p><p><bold>050: Keynote Lecture: Genes affecting glycosylation of human IgG show pleiotropy with autoimmune diseases and haematological cancers</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Gordan Lauc</underline></bold><bold>;</bold> University of Zagreb, Zagreb 10000, Croatia</p><p>glauc@pharma.hr</p><p>Glycosylation of immunoglobulin G (IgG) influences IgG effector function by modulating binding to different Fc receptors. To identify genetic loci associated with IgG glycosylation, we quantitated N-linked IgG glycans in plasma of 2,247 individuals from four European populations. After isolating IgG from human plasma, N-glycans were released and analyzed by ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC). Genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified 9 genome-wide significant loci (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 2.27 × 10−9). Four loci contained genes encoding glycosyltransferases (ST6GAL1, B4GALT1, FUT8 and MGAT3), while the remaining 5 contained genes that have not been previously implicated in protein glycosylation (IKZF1, IL6ST-ANKRD55, ABCF2-SMARCD3, SUV420H1, and SMARCB1-DERL3). However, most of them have been strongly associated with autoimmune and inflammatory conditions (<italic>e.g.</italic>, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, diabetes type 1, multiple sclerosis, Graves’ disease, celiac disease, nodular sclerosis) and/or haematological cancers (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, and multiple myeloma). Follow-up functional experiments in haplodeficient Ikzf1 knock-out mice showed the same general pattern of changes in IgG glycosylation as identified in the meta-analysis. As IKZF1 was associated with multiple IgG N-glycan traits, we explored biomarker potential of affected N-glycans in 101 cases with SLE and 183 matched controls and demonstrated substantial discriminative power in a ROC-curve analysis (area under the curve = 0.842). Our study indicates that IgG glycosylation is regulated by a complex network of genes through still unknown mechanisms. The observed pleiotropy with autoimmune diseases and haematological cancer indicates that individual variations in IgG glycosylation affect IgG function and contribute to disease development and progression.</p><p><bold>051: Glycobiology aspects of the periodontal pathogen</bold><bold><italic>Tannerella forsythia</italic></bold></p><p><bold>Gerald Posch</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Andrea Koerdt</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Laura Neumann</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Friedrich Altmann</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Paul Messner</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, </bold><bold><underline>Christina Schäffer</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup>Department of NanoBiotechnology, NanoGlycobiology Unit, Universität für Bodenkultur Wien, Muthgasse 11, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; <sup>2</sup>Department of Chemistry, Universität für Bodenkultur Wien, Muthgasse 18, A-1190 Vienna, Austria</p><p>christina.schaeffer@boku.ac.at</p><p>Glycosylation of proteins in bacteria is becoming increasingly documented, including both <italic>O</italic>- and <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation, with bacterial glycosylation profiles exceeding by far those known from eukaryotes.</p><p>For the recently investigated periodontal pathogen <italic>Tannerella forsythia</italic> glycobiology plays a pivotal role, affecting the cellular integrity of the bacterium, its life-style, and its virulence potential<italic>.</italic> The bacterium possesses a unique Gram-negative cell envelope with a glycosylated surface (S-) layer as outermost decoration.

The neoglycolipid (NGL)-based oligosaccharide microarray system is among the relatively few in the world that are beyond proof-of-concept. The ability to readily broaden glycan libraries by incorporating both natural and chemically synthesized oligosaccharides, and the clustered and flexible presentation of non-covalently immobilized lipid-linked probes with an element of mobility, are key advantages that render the NGL system powerful in providing information on the molecular basis of the virus-host interactions. The NGL system has the versatility not only in that it lends itself well to analyses of the carbohydrate-mediated interactions of whole viruses, virus-like particles and recombinantly-expressed viral attachment proteins, but also in that the NGLs can be incorporated into live cells for infectivity assays to corroborate the biological significance of <italic>in vitro</italic> binding data. There have been contributions to a number of receptor-binding studies of human pathogenic viruses, such as the pandemic 2009 H1N1 and H5N1 ‘avian’ influenza viruses isolated from infected humans, and the human polyomavirus JCV which, in immunocompromised individuals, causes a fatal demyelinating disease, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.</p><p>This communication will be focused on recent applications of the NGL-based microarray system in pinpointing the oligosaccharide receptors for the capsid proteins of viruses that belong to the reoviridae and the polyoma families. In contrast to the haemagglutinin of influenza virus that can bind to a broad spectrum of sialyl-glycans, these viral proteins exhibit narrow specificities for sialylated oligosaccharide sequences, among around 120 in the microarrays. I will highlight the discovery of the ganglioside GM2 glycan as a receptor for the attachment protein Sigma 1 of reovirus strain type 1 Lang (T1L). New findings with B-lymphotropic polyomavirus (LPV) and several recently discovered polyomaviruses will also be described. These findings using microarrays, together with protein structural data, are providing information crucial to our understanding the viral tropisms, and also opportunities for the design of anti-viral agents.</p><p><bold>053: Interaction of lectins from pathogens with bacterial surfaces visualised by fluorescence microscopy</bold></p><p><bold>Lenka Malinovská</bold><sup><bold>1,2</bold></sup><bold>, Lenka Adamová</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, </bold><bold><underline>Michaela Wimmerová</underline></bold><sup><bold>1,2,3</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup>CEITEC – Central-European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Kamenice 5, 625 00, Brno, Czech Republic, <sup>2</sup>National Centre for Biomolecular Research, Fac of Science, Masaryk University, Kamenice 5, 625 00, Brno, Czech Republic, <sup>3</sup>Department of Biochemistry, Fac of Science, Masaryk University, Kamenice 5, 625 00, Brno, Czech Republic</p><p>michaw@chemi.muni.cz</p><p>Lectins are of non-immune origin occurring in all organisms and executing various functions.

However, the role of ficolin-2 in viral infection remains elusive. In this study, we found that ficolin-2 inhibited and neutralized HCV cell culture (HCVcc) infection to Huh7.5.1 cells, blocking HCVcc attachment to the receptors of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and the scavenger receptor (SR-B1), but weakly interfered with attachment to CD81, and did not interfere with attachment to the claudin-1 and occludin receptors. C-terminal fibrinogen domain (113-313aa) of ficolin-2 was the critical binding region of HCV E1E2 N-glycans and played a critical role in anti-HCV activity. In addition, we found ApoE3 could block the interaction between ficolin-2 and HCV through competitively binding to HCV-E1E2 heterodimers but not by directly interacting with ficolin-2. Extrogenous ApoE3 blocked ficolin-2’s effect, while knockdown of endogenous ApoE3 decreased HCV infection and increased L-ficolin-mediated anti-viral activity. This is the first report demonstrating the beneficial therapeutic effects of ficolin-2 against HCV infection. Our findings provide new insights into the important role of ApoE3 in blocking the anti-viral activities of the lectin ficolin-2 and the immune escape mechanism mediated by ApoE3 during HCV chronic infection.</p><p><bold>055: Keynote Lecture: Role of Glycolipids in Innate Immune Response</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Kazuhisa Iwabuchi</underline></bold><sup><bold>1,2</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup>Infection Control Nursing, Graduate School of Health Care and Nursing, Juntendo University, Urayasu 279-0023, Japan, <sup>2</sup> Institute for Environmental and Gender-Specific Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Juntendo University, Urayasu 279-0021, Japan.</p><p>iwabuchi@juntendo.ac.jp</p><p>The innate immune system is the first line of defense against pathogenic microorganisms<italic>.</italic> Professional phagocytes, such as neutrophils and macrophages, are essential for this system. It used to be thought that the innate immune system comprised mechanisms to defend the host from infection by microorganisms in a non-specific manner. However, recent studies indicate this to be untrue. The mechanism of the innate immune system involves interactions of specific molecules. Host cells express several kinds of glycolipids on their surfaces. Because of their physicochemical characteristics, glycolipids tend to form clusters with cholesterol as membrane microdomains on plasma membranes. Membrane microdomains have been shown to be involved in several biological functions. Despite the role of the microdomains in activation of these biological functions, host membrane microdomains, especially glycolipids, are targeted by intracellular pathogens at different points in the infective process as gateways for entry into the cell in order to create environments in which to replicate avoiding host immune responses. In this light, glycolipids are the main players among the microdomain components in host-microorganism interactions.</p><p>Here I would like to introduce the role of glycolipids in innate immuno responses of neutrophils. Microorganisms are engulfed by neutrophils <italic>via</italic> PRRs under non-opsonized conditions. Engulfed microorganisms are internalized within intracellular vacuolar compartments called phagosomes; thereafter, these phagosomes sequentially fuse with lysosomes, which contain proteolytic enzymes. Pathogenic mycobacteria, such as <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, have been shown to avoid fusion with lysosomes, resulting in their escape from killing by phagocytes. A neutral glycolipid, lactosylceramide (LacCer) has been shown to bind specifically to several types of pathogenic microorganisms, including <italic>Escherichia coli, Bacillus dysenteriae,</italic> and <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. LacCer is highly expressed on human phagocytes, and forms membrane microdomains coupled with Src family kinase Lyn on plasma membranes of those cells as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). LacCer has been demonstrated to mediate neutropihl chemotaxis, phagocytosis and superoxide generation. Recently, we found that neutrophils phagocytosed mycobacteria <italic>via</italic> the carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions between LacCer-enriched microdomains and lipoarabinomannan (LAM) expressing on mycobacteria under non-opsonized conditions. Importantly, pathogenic mycobacteria utilized LacCer-enriched microdomains to arrest phagolysosome formation.</p><p><bold>056: Reveal the molecular basis of N-glycan core chitobiose modifications</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Shi Yan</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Sonia Serna</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Niels-Christian Reichardt</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Katharina Paschinger</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold> and Iain B.

Whereas in vertebrates, α1,6-linked fucose is the sole core modification of N-glycan, studies have shown that the “lower organisms” tend to produce even complicated core structures with multiple fucose and galactosylated fucose residues. The core chitobiose of sheep parasite <italic>Haemonchus contortus</italic> displays up to three fucoses, including an usual α1,3 fucose moiety linked to the distal GlcNAc; the same modification is present in the free-living model organism <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> as well as the pig parasites <italic>Ascaris suum</italic> and <italic>Oesophagostomum dentatum</italic>. To date, <italic>C. elegans</italic> core α1,3 fucosyltransferase-1 (FUT-1) and core α1,6 fucosyltransferase-8 (FUT-8) are proven to strictly modify the proximal GlcNAc, and no FUT has been found responsible for the distal GlcNAc fucosylation. Since the core α1,3 fucose is immunogenic to mammals, α1,3 fucosylation on the distal GlcNAc might enhance the immunogenicity of any parasite glycoproteins. Therefore, it is of interest to identify the “third” core FUT. We employed MALDI-TOF MS and a glycoarray platform with 22 immobilised glycan structures to investigate the enzymatic activity of recombinant FUTs from <italic>C. elegans</italic>. A homologue of core α1,3 fucosyltransferase was identified, which is capable to fucosylate the distal GlcNAc of the trimannosyl N-glycan core. In combination with other FUTs and hexosaminidase, sequential modifications on a chemically synthesised N-glycan yielded a tri-fucosylated structure; NMR data showed this structure is modified with α1,3 fucose and α1,6 fucose on proximal GlcNAc, and α1,3 fucose on the distal GlcNAc. We also proved that certain biosynthesis pathways have to be followed to achieve a tri-fucosylated N-glycan core.</p><p><bold>057: A Trick of Galectins Interaction with Influenza Virus</bold></p><p><bold>Evgeny S.

Of note, the viral neuraminidase generates an enormously high density of terminal galactose residues on the surface of virions. Thus, an interaction of the influenza virus with mammalian gelatins (gals) is a possibility. Six virus strains, three cell lines (as host cells), and panels of human and chicken gals were studied. Gals indeed promote virus binding in a dose-dependent manner, but they do not influence the internalization stage. Gals are able to restore the ability of influenza virus to infect desalinated cells up to the level of completely sialylated surfaces. The extent of adhesion increase depends both on glycan structure and gal nature. The most intriguing yet is the strong inhibition by gals on natural anti-influenza virus antibodies: functional activity of viral haemagglutinin and neuraminidase was not blocked by loaded gals, whereas antigenic determinants were masked.</p><p><bold>058: The galactic CvGal1 from the eastern oyster (</bold><bold><italic>Crassostrea virginica</italic></bold><bold>) binds to blood group A oligosaccharides on the hemocyte surface</bold></p><p><bold>Chiguang Feng</bold><sup><bold>‡</bold></sup><bold>, Anita Ghosh</bold><sup><bold>§</bold></sup><bold>, Mario A.

The parasite’s mechanism(s) for entry into the host’s blood cells (hemocytes) have been largely unknown. We identified and characterized in oyster hemocytes a galactic (CvGal1) of unique carbohydrate-recognition domain organization that, unlike most mammalian gelatins, recognizes both endogenous and exogenous carbohydrate ligands. CvGal1 displays four CRDs in which conserve seven of the nine amino acid residues that bind ligand in bovine galectin-1. The carbohydrate specificity of CvGal1, previously analyzed by hemagglutination-inhibition studies, was further characterized by a glycan array (Consortium for Functional Glycomics) and confirmed that CvGal1 binds preferentially to glycans containing non-reducing terminal N-acetylgalactosamine, fucosylated (α1-2) galactose, and particularly blood group A oligosaccharides. Antibodies specific for CvGal1 showed that attached and spread hemocytes released soluble CvGal1, some of which specifically binds to the hemocyte surface. Glycomic analysis of the hemocyte surface revealed the presence of blood group A oligosaccharides. CvGal1 binds to a variety of microorganisms and phytoplankton components, but preferentially to <italic>Perkinsus</italic> spp trophozoites. Pre-treatment of oyster hemocytes with anti-CvGal antibodies reduced trophozoite uptake, revealing that CvGal1 is a phagocytic receptor for <italic>P. marinus</italic>.

Their role and origin are still poor understood. Blood-group related antigens, tumor-associated and xeno-antigens are well-known counter-part of human nAbs. Anti-glycan nAbs pattern of healthy donors have been investigated with help of PGA. It was shown that about half of typical mammalian glycans bound human serum IgG and IgM, most of the specificities are not described yet. Discrete PGA data about anti-glycan nAbs of other mammals as well as birds were summarized (most of them are available from <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.functionalglycomics.org" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.functionalglycomics.org</ext-link>), and detailed analysis was performed.

Note that all examined species have own features in nAbs repertoires which reflect their individual immunological “history” as humans have.

All GPI-anchored proteins and glycoproteins have their polypeptide C-termini linked to the conserved phosphoethanolamine moiety. GPI-anchored proteins and glycoproteins play a critical role in various biological and pathological processes. To study these events, it is essential to have access to GPIs and GPI-anchored proteins and glycoproteins in homogeneous and structurally well-defined forms, which is a significant challenge. Our research aims at developing methodologies for the synthesis of natural and functionalized GPI anchors and GPI-peptide, glycopeptide, protein and glycoprotein conjugates, as well as studying GPI biology using synthetic GPIs and GPI conjugates.</p><p>We have developed a highly convergent strategy for GPI anchor synthesis utilizing a phospholipidated pseudodisaccharide as the common key intermediate, and applied it to the synthesis of many GPIs and GPI analogs.

We have also developed chemical and enzymatic methods for the synthesis of structurally defined GPI-linked peptides, glycopeptides, and proteins. For the chemical synthesis, extensively protected GPIs with free conserved phosphoethanolamine moiety and peptides or glycopeptides having free <italic>C</italic>-termini were regiospecifically coupled by a conventional condensation reaction. For the enzymatic synthesis, free GPI anchors and peptides, glycopeptides and proteins were effectively ligated by sortase A, a transpeptidase used by bacteria to anchor surface proteins to the cell wall. We have demonstrated that sortase A could accept GPIs having one or multiple glycine residues attached to the conserved phosphoethanolamine moiety as substrates and couple them with peptides, glycopeptides or proteins. Sortase A could also cyclize peptides and glycopeptides to form macrocyclic peptides and glycopeptides or attach proteins to liposomes. The synthetic GPIs, functionalized GPIs, and various GPI conjugates have been used to study how bacterial toxins interact with GPIs and how GPIs distribute in membranes, and to study the structure-activity relationships of GPIs and cell surface GPIomics as well.</p><p><bold>061: Engineering of Cyclodextrin Glucanotransferase as an</bold><bold><italic>O</italic></bold><bold>-Glycoligase</bold></p><p><bold>Chao Li</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Hee-Jeong Ahn</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Jin-Hyo Kim</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, </bold><bold><underline>Young-Wan Kim</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup>Department of Food and Biotechnology, Korea University, Sejong, 339-700, Korea; <sup>2</sup>Chemical Safety Division, National Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Rural Development Administration, Suwon, 441-701, Korea</p><p>ywankim@korea.ac.kr</p><p><italic>O</italic>-Glycoligase approach has been reported as a new category for the enzymatic synthesis of <italic>O</italic>-glycosidic linkages using a retaining glycoside hydrolase mutant whose hydrolysis activity is markedly reduced by the mutation of its general acid/base catalytic residue but its transglycosylation activity still maintained. In this study, a cyclodextrin glucanotransferase mutant with an alanine residue at its general acid/base catalyst position (CGT-E284A) was constructed, and thus no obvious hydrolytic function but significant transfer activity was detected using α-maltosyl fluoride (αG2F) and 4-nitrophenyl β-D-maltoside (4-NPβG2) as the substrates.

Through thin-layer chromatography analysis of the reaction mixtures, two mutants were screened; One is a mutant with a glycine residue at Glu284 (CGT-E284G) showing better activity than the original alanine mutant, and the other is a mutant with a serine residue (CGT-E284S) with severe hydrolytic activity. Kinetic analysis revealed that the transglycosylation activities of CGT-E284A and CGT-E284G were inhibited at high substrate concentrations of acceptor sugars above 0.8 mM.

Cell’s glycophenotype changes with the cellular growth, development and differentiation as well as in the pathological state such as inflammation and cancer. In the growing glycomics field, there is a need for the development of new strategies for detecting and identifying the glycan moieties associated with the cellular status. The glycan chains are synthesized by a large family of enzymes called Glycosyltransferases (GT) that transfer a sugar moiety from a sugar nucleotide donor to an acceptor molecule. The structural information on GTs from our laboratory has shown that there are flexible loops that undergo marked conformational changes upon binding of metal ion and sugar-nucleotides and simultaneously create at the C-terminal region of the flexible loop an oligosaccharide acceptor binding site that did not exist before. The loop acts as a lid covering the bound donor substrate. Furthermore, there are few residues in the catalytic pocket of GTs that determine their sugar donor specificity. Mutation of these residues broadens their donor sugar specificities, including towards the sugars carrying a chemical handle such as keto or azido group at C-2. Furthermore, the N-acetyl group of the donor sugars, e. g GalNAc and GlcNAc, binds in a cavity of their respective glycosyltransferases that can also accommodate a sugar analogue with a chemical handle. The transfer of a modified sugar residue that has a chemical handle by the mutant or wild type GTs to a specific sugar residue on a glycoconjugate has made it possible to develop a highly sensitive chemoenzymatic method for detecting and isolating glycan biomarkers. The mutant and wild type glycosyltransferases, currently being produced in our laboratory, are turning out as powerful tools for investigating the cell’s glycophenotype with high specificity.</p><p><bold>066: High-throughput screening for discovering glycosidase from metagenomic libraries using droplet-based microfluidics</bold></p><p><bold>Xiaohui Wang</bold><sup><bold>1, 2</bold></sup>, <bold><underline>Runtao Zhong</underline></bold><sup><bold>1, 3</bold></sup><bold>, Bingcheng Lin</bold><sup><bold>1, 3</bold></sup><bold>, Yuguang Du</bold><sup><bold>*1, 3</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup>Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian, 116023, China; <sup>2</sup>University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China; <sup>3</sup>Research Center of Lab on a Chip, Dalian, China</p><p>duyg@dicp.ac.cn</p><p>Glycoside hydrolases (also called glycosidases) catalyze the hydrolysis of the glycosidic linkage to release smaller sugars. They are extremely common enzymes with roles in nature including degradation of biomass, in anti-bacterial defense strategies, in pathogenesis mechanisms and in normal cellular function. Together with glycosyltransferases, glycosidases form the major catalytic machinery for the synthesis and breakage of glycosidic bonds. Metagenomics has emerged as an alternative approach to conventional microbial screening that allows exhaustive screening of microbial genomes in their natural environments. It has been proven to be a powerful tool to isolate new enzymes and drugs of industrial applications. However, searching for desired traits from metagenomes is often problematic because of the lack of ultrahigh-throughput and cost-effective screening approaches.</p><p>This work aims to establish a general ultrahigh-throughput screening platform using droplet-based microfluidics that overcomes the limitations mentioned above. To demonstrate its performance, we have been identifying new types of chitinases exhibiting more efficient and specific enzymatic activity of breaking down glycosidic bonds in chitin. Transformed <italic>E.coli</italic> cells in a metagenomic library obtained from deep sea were encapsulated individually into aqueous picoliter-volume droplets, dispersed in inert carrier oil and then cultured off chip. After expression of the encoded enzymes, fluorogenic substrates were added into each droplet and incubated with the contents in the droplet. Finally, the droplets were sorted based on their own fluorescent intensities, which represent the activities of the expressed enzymes, and the sequences of the functional genes can be recovered from the <italic>E.coli</italic> cells contained in collected droplets. The droplet-screening frequency is in the range of hundreds to thousands of droplets per second. Compared to screening using microtiter plate-based systems, the volume and cost of the reagents are reduced by almost 10<sup>4</sup>~10<sup>5</sup>-fold, allowing the screening of 10<sup>6</sup>~10<sup>7</sup> genes using only microliter-scale reagents.</p><p><bold>067: Keynote Lecture: N-GlcNAc and O-GlcNAc Modification of Plant Proteins: Origin and Function</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Neil E.

The self-assembly of DNA and proteins make a significant contribution to our lives and they have been employed to make functional self-assembled materials recently. Compared to the development of DNA and proteins, our knowledge and manipulation to the self-assembly of carbohydrates as well as their functionality is quite limited. The major obstacle for our understanding of carbohydrates is their complicated chemical structure of oligosaccharides and perplexing glycoforms and microhetrogeneity on proteins, which currently is a problematic and long-term task. Under this circumstance, macromolecular self-assembly might provide an alternate insight to this problem. Many of the biological functions of carbohydrates are related to their binding ability to proteins, especially for the sugars on the cell surface, which are called glycocalyx. By using our macromolecular self-assembly method, vesicles with a heavy layer of glycopolymers on their outer surface and inner surface were obtained, which could mimic the structure and function of glycocalyx. Besides, the molecular recognition of lectin and sugars were employed to construct self-assembled nanoparticles as well.</p><p><bold>073: Two-step Hydrolysis for Preparing Low- and High-molecular Weight β-1,3-glucan Oligosaccharides from Curdlan</bold></p><p><bold>Jing Li </bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Li Zhu </bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Zhi-Yong Zheng </bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, </bold><bold><underline>Xiao-Bei Zhan</underline></bold><sup><bold>1, 2, *</bold></sup><bold>, Chi-Chung Lin </bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Hong-Tao Zhang</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup> Key Laboratory of Carbohydrate Chemistry and Biotechnology of Ministry of Education, School of Biotechnology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214122, China; 2 Jiangsu Rayguang Biotech Co.

A putative structure of the curdlan insoluble particles in acid suspension is proposed. It is hypothesized that the curdlan particle consists of exposed and relaxing exterior surface susceptible to acid hydrolysis and compact and water-insoluble core hindering hydrolysis.

For galectin-3, the structure and dynamics of complexes with small ligands have been analyzed by NMR-spectroscopy, ultra high resolution (~0.85 Å) X-ray-crystallography and neutron crystallography.</p><p>Mechanism. The conserved galactic-defining amino acid motif provides a preorganized binding site for interaction with galactosides, but an increase in conformational entropy of the protein upon ligand binding is also a newly discovered contributor to the affinity, as large as the enthalpy contributed by the previously well-known hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interaction. Interactions in neighboring sites may enhance or decrease the affinity in different ways for different gelatins, and it is possible to alter fine specificity by mutagenesis. Selectivity and affinity of gelatins for natural glycoproteins, such as found in human serum, is much higher than expected from the structure of their glycans. This suggests that the interaction also involves the specific context of the glycan in the protein and possible interaction with protein parts.</p><p>Functions and relationship to physiological regulation and disease. Different aspects of galactic fine specificity appear to be important in different contexts, for example, the tolerance of galectin-3 for 2-3 sialylated galactosides is not required for its activation of neutrophils but it is for its binding to serum glycoproteins. Galectin fine specificity determines intracellular traffic of the galactic itself and of bound glycoproteins, as shown for transferrin and haptoglobin-hemoglobin complexes, after their uptake into their respective target tissue cells.

Although an increase in α2,6-sialylation is observed in hepatocellular carcinogenesis (HCC), the regulation mechanisms and roles involved remain unclear. Caveolin-1 is a major structural protein of caveolae and involved in many biological processes including protein glycosylation. Hca-F and Hepa1-6 are mouse hepatocarcinoma cell lines with high and low malignant potential, respectively. This study showed that caveolin-1 overexpression in Hepa1-6 cells up-regulated sialyltransferase ST6Gal-I expression and activated FAK-mediated adhesion signaling, and down-regulation of ST6Gal-I attenuated caveolin-1-induced increase in the cell adhesive ability to fibronectin. Conversely, caveolin-1 knockdown in Hca-F cells inhibited ST6Gal-I expression and FAK signaling-mediated cell adhesion to fibronectin. Re-expression of wild-type caveolin-1 or ST6Gal-I rescued the decreased ST6Gal-I expression and adhesion of Hca-F cells caused by caveolin-1 silencing. Further studies demonstrated caveolin-1 up-regulated cell surface α2,6-linked sialic acid <italic>via</italic> stimulating ST6Gal-I transcription. Cell surface α2,6-sialylation was required for integrin α5β1-dependent cell adhesion to fibronectin, and an increase in α2,6-linked sialic acid on α5-subunit facilitated fibronectin-mediated FAK phosphorylations. Taken together, these results indicate for the first time that caveolin-1 can up-regulate ST6Gal-I expression and integrin α2,6-sialylation, and further contribute to promoting mouse hepatocarcinoma cell adhesion to fibronectin. This study provides new insights into the biological functions of caveolin-1 and the significance of sialylation modification for integrin α5β1 in HCC metastasis.

Up-regulation of NEU3 is also of importance for the promotion stage of colorectal carcinogenesis <italic>in vivo,</italic> from experiments using NEU3 transgenic (2) and <italic>Neu3</italic>-deficient mice (3), possibly <italic>via</italic> activation of EGF signaling. These results suggest that alteration in the sialidase expression thus may be a crucial defining factor in malignancy. We then analyzed whether and how NEU3 contributes to cancer promotion as well as to progression. When NEU3 was transfected into NIH3T3-cells, NEU3 exhibited significant increase in colonogenic growth, clonogenicity on soft agar and <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor growth in the presence of EGF, as compared with vector control. Although endogenous level of EGFR in the cells is extremely low, NEU3 enhances markedly its phosphorylation, and probably mostly determines EGFR activation. In the cells, NEU3 also stimulated ERK and Akt, whereas the NEU3-mediated activation was largely abrogated by PP2 (a src inhibitor) or AG1478 (an EGFR inhibitor), suggesting that NEU3 is indeed involved in tumorigenesis through EGFR/src signaling pathway. Furthermore, NEU3-silencing in colon cancer cells resulted in significant decrease in clonogenic growth, chemosensitivity to oxaliplatin, clonogenicity on soft agar and <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor growth, along with down-regulation of stemness genes and Wnt–related genes. Further analyses revealed that NEU3 enhanced phosphorylation of the Wnt receptor LRP6 and consequently β-catenin activation by accelerating complex formation with LRP6 and recruitment of GSK3β and Axin, whereas its silencing exerted the opposite effects. These results suggest that NEU3 contributes to tumorigenic potential of cancer cells by regulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling and/or EGFR signaling. The detailed relationship between these signaling pathways remains to be solved.</p><p>(1) Kawamura, S. <italic>et al.

More recently they have been shown to directly activate cells resulting in downstream effects functioning in a variety of diseases thereby making them novel targets for drug development. We rationally designed a small molecule glycomimetic antagonist based on the bioactive conformation of the native ligand (sialyl Le<sup>x</sup>) in the E-selectin carbohydrate recognition domain combined with a sulfated domain required for optimal binding to L- and P-selectins. The resulting pan selectin antagonist (GMI-1070) showed efficacy in many animal models including vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease where the selectins are known to play a critical role. GMI-1070 strongly blocks E-selectin-mediated activation of neutrophils as determined by inhibition of expression of high affinity CD18 with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.5 μM, a value about 10 fold lower than the IC<sub>50</sub> (5.5 μM) required to inhibit cell adhesion in a flow chamber. E-selectin also functions in thrombus formation and GMI-1070 dosed at 20 mg/kg BID potently inhibits the weight of thrombus formed at day 2 (90.6 %, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and day 6 (83.6 %, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) post injury in a venous thrombosis mouse model.</p><p>Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) exhibit elevated biomarkers of adhesion, neutrophil activation (Mac-1, LFA-1), and thrombosis (TF, TAT). These E-selectin-mediated mechanisms play roles in the life-threatening vaso-occlussive crises (VOC) periodically experienced by SCD patients. GMI-1070 was administered in a Phase 1 study to SCD patients (<italic>n</italic> = 15) not in VOC with an IV loading dose of 20 mg/kg followed by a second dose 10 h later at 10 mg/kg.

Cytokine bath with interleukin 6 (IL-6) secreted mainly by activated Kuffer cells (KCs) in local liver microenvironment dominates inflammatory response of hepatocytes during chronic hepatitis. Previous studies have indicated the crucial role of IL-6 upregulation in hepatocarcinogenesis due to HBV infection. However, alterations in stimulatory response to IL-6 of hepatocytes undergoing chronic HBV infection remain obscure. In this study, we found that HBV infection sensitized hepatoma cells to IL-6 stimulation, which was dependent on membrane retention of glycoprotein 130 (gp130) on hepatoma cells due to HBV X protein (HBx) expression. Moreover, HBV infection and HBx expression were found to increase gp130 membrane stability due to MGAT5-mediated N-glycosylation. HBV infection and HBx expression could also upregulate MGAT5 transcription through ERK/Ets-1 signal activation. More importantly, HBV infection could confer hepatoma cells with tumor stemness and sorafenib resistance <italic>via</italic> N-glycosylation-mediated gp130 activation. Genetic ablation and pharmacological inhibition of MGAT5/gp130/STAT3 pathway decreased tumorigenicity and sorafenib resistance of hepatoma cells with HBV infection and HBx expression. Immunohistochemial staining in clinical hepatoma samples showed that MGAT5/gp130/STAT3 activation interlinks HBV infection with hepatoma stemness and poor overall survival in HCC patients. Our results reveal that HBV infection sensitizes IL-6 stimulation and confers sorafenib resistance <italic>via</italic> N-glycosylation-mediated gp130 membrane retention in hepatocellular carcinoma, which identifies MGAT5/gp130/STAT3 signal activation as potential therapeutic targets for personal intervention with HBV-associated HCC patients.</p><p><bold>084: Serum glycome profiling - a biomarker for diagnosis of ovarian cancer</bold></p><p><bold>Karina Biskup</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Elena I.

Glycosylation has been shown to change during cancer initiation and progression. Ovarian cancer is mostly diagnosed after the development of metastases. As a consequence, prognoses and overall survival are very poor. In the case of Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC), the common clinically used tumor markers such as CA-125 are known to have poor sensitivity as they often fail to detect the disease at its early stages. Therefore there is a high need for more suited biomarkers. The aim of the work was to analyse the serum N-glycome of EOC patients in order to identify a new potential serum biomarker.</p><p>N-glycans were released from serum glycoproteins by PNGase F digestion, purified in a solid phase extraction, permethylated und subsequently analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. 87 samples from preoperative EOC patients and 33 samples from age-matched healthy women were enrolled in this study.

Aβ is generated from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the actions of β- and γ-secretases. In addition to Aβ deposition in the brain parenchyma, deposition of Aβ in cerebral vessel walls, termed cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), is observed in more than 80 % of AD individuals. The mechanism for how Aβ accumulates in blood vessels remains largely unknown. In the present study, we show that brain endothelial cells expressed APP770, a differently spliced <italic>APP</italic> mRNA isoform from neuronal APP695, and produced Aβ40 and Aβ42. Furthermore, we found that the endothelial APP770 had sialylated core 1 type O-glycans. Interestingly, Ο-glycosylated APP770 was preferentially processed by both α- and β-cleavage and secreted into the media, suggesting that the O-glycosylation and APP processing involved related pathways. By immunostaining of human brain sections with an anti-APP770 antibody, we found that APP770 was expressed in vascular endothelial cells. We then established sandwich ELISA system to detect sAPP770 in human serum samples. We observed that inflammatory cytokines significantly enhanced sAPP770 secretion by endothelial cells. Furthermore, we unexpectedly found that sAPP770 was rapidly released from activated platelets. Our finding showing that plasma sAPP770 is significantly higher in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patiens raise the possibility that sAPP770 can be a useful biomarker for ACS.</p><p>References</p><p>1. <bold>S.

Sialin is a lysosomal membrane sialic acid/acidic amino acid transporter, also important in CNS myelination. HP59 has a transcription initiation site 300 bp upstream of the Sialin Gene SLC17A5, and only in humans encodes 41 additional amino acids at the Amino-terminus of Sialin. In humans, there is a functional upstream transcription initiation site and an alternate start codon for HP59, incorporating the entire Sialin gene product. An uniquely human capillary endothelial lumen-expressed form of Sialin was termed HP59/SP55 by Hellerqvist, <italic>et al.</italic>, discovered independently as the receptor for Group B streptococcal 270 kDa polysaccharide toxin, (GBS Toxin, CM101). CM101 binds HP59/SP55 on the luminal face of anoxic driven capillary membranes as a lectin receptor of unknown specificity and function. HP59, having 7 or 12 transmembrane domains, is expressed in the neonate lung in the first 5 days after birth. GBS Toxin (CM101), secreted during sepsis, is the etiologic agent for “Early Onset Disease, to which the neonate is sensitive 5 days post partum during rapid anoxic driven lung vascularization. The CM101-HP59 lectin complex activates complement C3b, initiating an inflammatory cytokine cascade which recruits CD69+, activated granulocytes to destroy HP59 capillaries and surrounding lung tissue causing a 50 % mortality. Post partum in humans, rodents, canines, equines and primates later than 5 days, HP59/SP55 (Sialin) is expressed in wound healing and tumor angiogenesis. Sialin is also expressed on Salivary Acinar Cells plasma membranes, transporting nitrate, and in Aspartergenic Synaptic Vesicles transporting aspartate. The homologous Sialin form SP55 is in the genomes of all mammals. Ungulates and felines express HP55-sialin in lung capillaries, susceptible to GBS toxin as adult animals. CM101 has been shown in a published Phase I, FDA-IND-approved clinical trial to have clinical safety and 33 % effectivity on select stage IV cancer patients, specifically targeting tumor vasculature. Endothelial involvement of CM101 binding to HP59 is indicated by levels of Soluble E Selectin.

Immunostaining revealed that both α-amylases are located at the BBM in the porcine duodenum. The binding was inhibited by mannan but not galactan, indicating that α-amylases bind carbohydrate-specifically to BBM. The ligands for α-amylase were identified by combining ligands purified by a PPA-Sepharose column, PAGE, and LC/MS/MS. The ligands identified for PPA in BBM included sucrase-isomaltase (SI) and Na+/glucose-cotransporter 1 (SGLT1), both of which take part in assimilating glucose. Bindings of SI and SGLT1 in BBM to PPA were dose-dependent and inhibited by mannan. Assays using freshly prepared BBM vesicles revealed functional changes in PPA and its ligands: the starch-degrading activity of PPA and maltose-degrading activity of SI were enhanced 240% and 175%, respectively, while Glc uptake by SGLT1 was markedly reduced by PPA at high, but physiologically possible, concentrations after eating food.

Our team has developed novel Glycomics technologies that facilitate the discovery of glycoproteins and glycans that can serve as stage-specific or disease-specific biomarkers, which can then be further investigated to determine possible functional significance. We have identified a glycan that is expressed on cells of various lineages after human or mouse embryonic stem cells or iPS cells are induced to differentiate. Blocking expression of this glycan inhibits or blocks differentiation. In addition, we have developed methodologies for targeted glycoproteomics that have identified markers for several types of cancers, including invasive breast, pancreatic, and ovarian carcinomas. In the case of pancreatic cancer, we have identified a unique glycan epitope with high sensitivity and specificity for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In preliminary experiments we can detect this epitope in blood from patients with this cancer. For invasive ductal breast carcinoma, we have identified a novel glycoform of periostin that is expressed during the EMT. During breast ductal carcinoma oncogenesis, periostin is secreted and functions in the matrix as a niche substituent for cancer stem cells. Moreover, stromal cells surrounding the breast tumor cells are induced to produce periostin, providing an amplification step. Initial experiments suggest that serum levels of this specific glycoform of periostin may serve as an accurate biomarker of invasive breast carcinoma and can distinguish serum from cancer patients and those that are non-diseased or have fibrocystic breast disease.</p><p><bold>090: Mapping the glycome of Erythropoietin</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Sureyya Ozcan</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Myung Jin Oh</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Rudolf Grimm</bold><sup><bold>1,2</bold></sup><bold>, and Hyun Joo An</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup>Graduate School of Analytical Science and Technology (GRAST), Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Republic of Korea <sup>2</sup>Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, California 95052, USA,</p><p>sureyya.ozcan@gmail.com Tel: 82-42-821-8547, Fax: 82-42-821-8551</p><p>Erythropoietin is heavily glycosylated therapeutic glycoprotein that stimulates red blood cell production. Increasing role of complex therapeutic proteins in immune based therapies requires further characterization in many aspects. The quality, safety, and potency of recombinant erythropoietins are determined largely by their glycosylation. Small variations in cell culture conditions can significantly affect the glycosylation, and therefore the efficacy, of recombinant erythropoietins. We have determined the glycosylation sites and glycan heterogeneity with isomer-specific and quantitative glycomic analysis of recombinant erythropoietins isolated from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and mammalian cells. The platform was used to profile native N and O-glycans from three production batches of darbepoetin alfa (aka NESP), a common form of recombinant erythropoietin and three production batches of epoetin alfa. Glycosylation sites of corresponding glycoproteins are also profiled to show extensive glycan heterogeneity. Results were verified by independent orthogonal analysis with both MALDI-TOF and nano-LC/Q-TOF MS. We found multi-antennary N-glycans with high levels of sialylation, O-acetylation, and dehydration in CHO cell. The detailed structures of these oligosaccharides were successfully characterized by tandem MS. This platform may be applied to quality control and batch analysis of not only recombinant erythropoietin but also other complex, glycosylated biotherapeutics and biosimilars.</p><p><bold>091: Glycomics analysis using solid-phase glycan extraction on chip and chipLC-MS</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Shuang Yang</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Yan Li</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Hanching Chiu</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Shadi Toghi Eshghi</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Don L.

Aberrant glycosylation is reported to associate with many diseases such as cancers and immune disorders. Unlike the protein synthesis, the glycans attached to glycoproteins are enormously complex due to the non-template dependent synthesis of glycans. As a result, the comprehensive analysis of glycans from biological or clinical samples is an unmet technical challenge. Development of the high-throughput method will facilitate the glycomic analysis.</p><p>In this study, we developed a novel method for the high-throughput analysis of glycans from glycoproteins using Solid-Phase Glycan Extraction (SPGE) on chip, coupling with chipLC-mass spectrometry (MS) in an integrated microfluidic system. Proteins were immobilized on a solid support and other non-conjugated molecules were removed. Sialylated glycans were acetylated on solid support to enhance their stabilization and hydrophobicity. N-Glycans were then enzymatically released by PNGase F and then separated in a microfluidics device that was packed with porous graphitized carbon particles; O-glycans were then chemically cleaved by β-elimination and separated by chipLC. The glycans were analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS) and verified by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). We applied this technology on human serum and showed high glycan coverage, specificity, and sensitivity.</p><p>This method was used to analyze glycans from mouse heart and serum.

The changes of glycosylation on proteins or lipids, thus, caused or occurred by the abnormal conditions of biological system such as disease. Genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics enable to draw a big picture of human biological network, yet a huge part of their dynamic interactions or regulations are not completely understood. Despite the necessities to elucidate the structural and positional information of glycosylation, the progress on high throughput analysis of glycans has been hindered by the heterogeneity and complexity of glycosylation site or isomeric structure. Nonetheless, recent advancement in mass spectrometry can routinely provide various information of glycan such that a compositional glycan profile in a single analysis or a quantitative isomeric separations in combination with porous graphite carbon column. Aiming to link the mass spectrometric data of glycosylation in human specimen to their systemic figures within the biological context, we start build up the database called <underline>Hu</underline>man <underline>G</underline>lycom <underline>A</underline>tlas (HUG-A). N-glycan in human serum was chosen for the first target since the quantitative and qualitative changes of glycosylation has been reported to reflect the host medical conditions.</p><p>Total N-glycan was released from the serum of 100 controls (non-cancer) and 100 lung cancer patient followed by the fractionation using PGC cartridge. Three fractions (release by 10 %, 20 %, and 40 % acetonitrile each) were then analyzed by MALDI-TOF/TOF for overall profile and nanoLC/Chip Q-TOF for isomeric separation. Overall, 108 glycans were identified based on their accurate mass and isomeric separations and the glycan synthetic correlation enabled drawing a serum N-glycan map that similar to the metabolic network. Among them, 17, 9 and 11 glycans were major glycan that comprise 90 % of total peak intensity of 10 % 20 % and 40 %, respectively. Several major glycans were showed more than one fraction, however, the nanoLC Chip Q-TOF confirmed that they have same chemical structures.

Here, we present the development of a cell-specific metabolic glycan labeling strategy using azidosugars encapsulated in ligand-targeted liposomes. The ligands are designed to bind specific cell-surface receptors that are only expressed or up-regulated in target cells, which mediates the intracellular delivery of azidosugars.

These include gel electrophoresis, capillary electrophoresis (CE), or its miniaturized technology, chip electrophoresis. Membrane electrophoresis such as paper electrophoresis is now largely obsolete. However, cellulose acetate membrane electrophoresis is widely used for a clinical laboratory test even now as a simple and robust method. Unlike modern electrophoresis such as 2D-electrophoresis and CE, the membrane electrophoresis does not require skilled techniques and any expensive instruments. That might be one of the reasons why this method has been widely used in clinical labs even though the resolving power is low.</p><p>Recently, we have developed a novel membrane electrophoresis, termed supported molecular matrix electrophoresis (SMME), in which hydrophilic polymer such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) soaking into porous poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) membrane is used as separation medium. Although SMME is as easy and cheap as cellulose acetate membrane electrophoresis, it has several advantages arising from the use of the PVDF membrane as follows: compatible with glycan analysis following β-elimination, direct immunostaining the membrane just after electrophoresis, resistant to various chemical treatments, low electro-osmotic flow, and lectins are attachable through hydrophobic interaction.</p><p>As application of SMME, we here report human serum fractionation and compare the results with that obtained by cellulose acetate membrane electrophoresis. Moreover, analysis of glycans of each fraction is demonstrated. Additionally, we have reported that SMME could also be used for analysis of mucins and mucopolysaccharides. Alcian blue can sensitively stain these acidic molecules but not mucins with low acidic glycan content, such as porcine gastric mucin (PGM). To overcome this problem, we developed a novel staining method, succinylation-Alcian blue staining. In this method, the glycans of the mucin molecules are modified with succinic anhydride, thereby enabling them to be stained with Alcian blue. Furthermore, we demonstrate the compatibility of this novel staining procedure with glycan analysis using PGM as a model mucin.</p><p><bold>096: Expression and purification of recombinant single-subunit oligosaccharyltransferase from</bold><bold><italic>Leishmania braziliensis</italic></bold></p><p><bold><underline>Toshihiko Kitajima</underline></bold><bold>, Markus Aebi;</bold> ETH Zürich, Zürich, 8093, Switzerland</p><p>kitajima@micro.biol.ethz.ch</p><p>Oligosaccharyltransferases (OSTs) mediate the <italic>en bloc</italic> transfer of N-glycan intermediates onto asparagine residue of nascent protein in glycosylation sequons (Asn-Xaa-Thr/Ser, Xaa≠Pro).

While using an FITC labeled octapeptide, including the above five derivatives, other three derivatives (UDP-GlcNPh, UDP-GlcNBu, UDP-GlcNGc) could also be accepted by sOGT, suggesting that (1) sOGT is ambiguous in recognizing sugar donor derivatives, and (2) the sugar donor-sOGT recognition could be affected by different acceptor substrates. Moreover, ncOGT and sOGT could recognize different panel of sugar donor derivatives. UDP-GlcNPh and UDP-GlcNTFA could be accepted by sOGT and ncOGT, respectively.

It is abundantly clear, that a large portion of function resides within properly positioned valence epitopes on the exposed surfaces of lipids and proteins. Protocols to isolate and confirm such structures are lacking, and contemporary analytical applications rarely match that needed for a comprehensive understanding. Accurate mass compositions, chromatographic separations and profiles annotated with undefined cartoons fail to meet the qualitative needs of bioengineers aspiring to design blocking analogs or vaccines to control a disease process. Additionally, an absence of these critical features misses the mark when trying to follow disease progression and metabolic outcome. Such conjugates possess a plethora of isomers, both structural and stereo, details which embody the major obstacles to an understanding of sequence. The literature abounds with chromatographic and MS strategies to unravel carbohydrate structural details and the approaches are largely variations in chromatography, MS ionization and activation. Operationally, the pursuit and expectation that all components of structure can be assigned in a one or two dimensional MS approach may be short-sighted, especially when considering the diverse bond energies and the need to unravel stereo and isomeric complexity. Somewhat ironically, a mass measuring instrument, operating in a sequential manner, can be exploited to resolve structural details better than any current chromatographic system, and thereby provides a different type of resolution, based on ion fragments and their relationships. With these tools we now focus directly of the valance epitopes that drive glycomic function. Given the awareness that these are responsible for most biological interactions, it seems that strategies focused on finding and assigning these substructures would provide a more direct focus on the actual components defining progression in numerous diseases and in developmental processes. Fortunately, these substructures are pendant through relatively labile, N-acetyl-hexosaminyl linkages, a lability and subsequent rupture that allows intact substructure (composition) to be observed as a B-type fragment at earlier stages of disassembly. These tactics open new doors to epitope structural detail.</p><p><bold>099: Experimental and theoretical approaches to understand the conformational differences in isomeric glycan pairs</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Yoshiki Yamaguchi</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Kana Matsumoto</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Kenji Hirose</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Wataru Nishima</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Suyong Re</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, and Yuji Sugita</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup>Structural Glycobiology Team and <sup>3</sup>Theoretical Molecular Science Laboratory, RIKEN, Wako-shi, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan; <sup>2</sup>Nihon Waters K.K., Osaka, Japan</p><p>yyoshiki@riken.jp</p><p>The oligosaccharide moieties have many important biological roles, including protein quality control, cell-cell recognition and protection from proteolysis.

However, the comprehensive analyses of their substrate structures have not been really conducted because of the lack of pure chemically synthesized PGN fragments.

In order to introduce the PGN fragments to the array, a linker with terminal amine was successfully attached to the PGN fragments. PGN array was then built up by attaching synthesized PGN fragments on the carboxyl covered solid surface of a carbon platform using amide formation. The array could be used to detect the PGN’s receptors and recognition proteins and measure the binding properties of these proteins. For evaluation of the binding property of the array, two series of proteins were used, which are wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) with fluorescence label and human PGRP-S with combination of fluorescence labeled antibody. PGRP-S showed stronger affinity with tetrasaccharide tripeptide (GMGM3P), which is identical with our previous report using SPR study.

The structural components of pectin that regulate its activity are unclear. We prepared various pectins, fragments and oligosaccharides from ginseng pectin, modified citrus pectin (MCP) and potato galactan, and studied their inhibitory activities on galectin-3 using several galectin-3-mediated cell assays. A rhamnogalacturonan I-rich ginseng pectin fragment, RG-I-4, was identified as potent inhibitor of galectin-3. Comparative studies showed that RG-I-4 had better activity than MCP and potato galactan, which were two well-established galectin-3 ligands. RG-I-4, MCP and potato galactan had dissociation constants of 22.2 nM, 143 nM and 2,590 nM, respectively, consistent with their relative activities determined by surface plasmon resonance analysis. The structure-activity of RG-I-4, MCP and potato galactan was further investigated by modifying the structure through various enzymatic and chemical methods followed by activity tests. The results showed that β1,4-galactan side chains were pivotal to the activity. The activity of a linear β1,4-galactan chain was proportional to its length up to 4 Gal residues. All long chains with ≥4 Gal residues had similar activities that were slightly better than lactose. Thus, a chain of four Gal residues meets the basic need for maximum activity. Galectin-3 appeared to recognize terminal tetrasaccharides. RG-I-4 contained mainly short β1,4-galactan side chains, consisting of less 4 Gal residues. However, it had 40- to 1000-fold higher activity than a single chain. Extensive structure-activity correlation studies indicated that the high activity of RG-I-4 resulted from the cooperative action of multiple short side chains. However, the existence of multiple side chains did not guarantee cooperative action. Potato galactan, containing multiple side chains, had similar activity to a single long side chain. The inhibitory activity of pectin should be related to the backbone, side chains and even whole molecule conformation.</p><p><bold>103: Analysis of Glycosphingolipids by LC-MS</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Akemi Suzuki</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Hideshi Fujiwaki</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, and Yoshikatsu Umemura</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup>; <sup>1</sup>Institute of Glycoscience, Tokai University, Hiratsuka, 259-1292, and <sup>2</sup>Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, 604-8511, Japan</p><p>akmszk@tokai-u.jp</p><p>Recent advances in mass spectrometry make our view of glycosphingolipids (GSLs) completely different from the previous one. LC-MS is applicable to GSL mixtures in a small amount, and provides structural information of carbohydrate chains and ceramides and possibly quantitative results in the presence of appropriate internal standards. However, several subjects remaining to be carefully clarified are the establishment of analytical conditions for obtaining fragmentations useful for structural characterization, the preparation of standard or isotope-labeled GSLs for quantitation, and the establishment of required informatics including data base construction, collection of MS spectra, and search engine creation. We report here our resent progress in our attempt for solving above requirements.</p><p>We have tested several matrices for neutral GSLs and acidic GSLs (gangliosides) in the analysis of negative ion mode. Negative ion mode provides more fragment ions derived from carbohydrate chains and ceramides. Matrices used for LC analysis with a C30 reversed phase column of neutral GSLs, such as ammonium formate, formic acid, ammonium acetate, and acetic acid, give adduct ions and the ratios of molecular ions [M - H]<sup>-</sup> and adduct ions are different among molecular species of GlcCer as the simplest neutral GSL. Ammonium bicarbonate containing solvents give lesser amount of adducts and can be used for comparing changes of molecular species of neutral GSLs produced by the different conditions of cultured cells or comparing neutral GSLs of different subsets of cells isolated from living organisms. In the analysis of gangliosides, GM1(NeuGc), GD1a and b, GT1b, and GQ1b were detected as double-charged ions. We detected GM1(NeuAc) as single-charged ions [M – H]<sup>−</sup>, and GM1(NeuAc) exhibits the highest m/z value among these gangliosides, resulting in that detection efficiency of GM1(NeuAc) becomes very low. We found that this result depends on pH of elution solvents which also effect electrospray ionization. This finding helps to detect GM1(NeuAc) in a better sensitivity. We are now compiling MS, MS/MS, MS/MS/MS spectra of gangliosides.</p><p><bold>104: Interactions of carbohydrates with biomolecules</bold></p><p><bold>Role of the CH/π interactions</bold></p><p><bold>Michaela Wimmerová</bold><sup><bold>1,2,3</bold></sup><bold>, Stanislav Kozmon</bold><sup><bold>1,2</bold></sup><bold>, Josef Houser</bold><sup><bold>1,2</bold></sup><bold>, Radek Matuška</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, </bold><bold><underline>Jaroslav Koča</underline></bold><sup><bold>1,2</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup>CEITEC – Central-European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University (MU), Kamenice 5, 625 00, Brno, Czech Republic, <sup>2</sup>National Centre for Biomolecular Research, Fac of Science, MU, Kamenice 5, 625 00, Brno, Czech Republic, <sup>3</sup>Department of Biochemistry, Fac of Science, MU, Kamenice 5, 625 00, Brno, Czech Republic</p><p>jkoca@ceitec.cz</p><p>Molecular recognition plays crucial role in many biological processes, such as bacteria-host identification. Some of these recognition processes are performed by proteins called lectins, which are able to bind saccharides in a very specific way. In our study we have focused on RSL lectin from world-wide distributed bacteria <italic>Ralstonia solanacearum</italic> causing lethal wilt in many agricultural crops and the AAL lectin from <italic>Aleuria aurantia</italic>. Both above mentioned bacteria interact with hosts through their lectins, binding predominantly L-fucose. In this paper, we are interested in the role of the CH/π interaction in binding abilities of these two lectins.</p><p>In the RSL lectin, we have attempted for the first time to quantify how the CH/π interaction contributes to a overall carbohydrate—protein interaction. We have used an experimental approach, creating single and double point mutants, combined with high level computational methods. The structure contains three monomer units of the lectin with six almost identical binding sites, where three of them are intramonomeric and the other three are intermonomeric. Experimentally measured binding affinities were compared with computed carbohydrate-aromatic acid residue interaction energies. Experimental binding affinities for the RSL wild type, phenylalanine and alanine mutants were −8.5, −7.1 and −4.1 kcal.mol−1, respectively. These affinities agree with the computed dispersion interaction energy between the carbohydrate and aromatic amino acid residues for RSL the wild type and the phenylalanine mutant, with respective values of −8.8 and −7.9 kcal.mol−1, excluding the alanine mutant where the interaction energy was −0.9 kcal.mol−1. Molecular dynamics simulations show that discrepancy can be caused by creation of a new hydrogen bond between the α-L-Me-fucoside and RSL. Observed results suggest that in this and similar cases the carbohydrate-receptor interaction can be driven mainly by a dispersion interaction. The AAL lectin contains five different binding sites for L-fucose. However, the main motifs of the binding sites are similar to the RSL ones. Therefore, we have attempted to analyze the impact of dispersion interaction to total binding potency also for AAL.</p><p><italic>This work was funded by the European Community’s Seventh Framework Programme under the European Regional Development Fund (CZ.1.05/1.1.00/02.0068) and Capacities specific programme (286154).

While the sequence of the decorin core protein is determined by the gene encoding its structure, the structure of its GAG chain is determined in the Golgi. The recent application of modern mass spectrometry (MS) to bikunin, a far simpler chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, suggests that it has a single or small number of defined sequences. On this basis, a similar approach to sequence decorin’s much larger and more structurally complex dermatan sulfate/chondroitin sulfate GAG chain was undertaken. This approach resulted in information on the consistency/variability of its linkage region at the GAG chain’s reducing end, its iduronic acid-rich domain, glucuronic acid-rich domain, and non-reducing end. A general motif for the porcine skin decorin GAG chain was established. A single small decorin GAG chain was sequenced using MS/MS analysis. The data obtained in the study suggests that the decorin GAG chain has a small or a limited number of sequences.</p><p><bold>Fri-Cell Biology</bold></p><p><bold>107: Keynote Lecture:</bold><bold><italic>O</italic></bold><bold>-GlcNAcylation on Transcription Factor Mef2c Regulates Terminal Differentiation of Skeletal Myogenesis</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Jin Won Cho</underline></bold>, <bold>Hanbyeol Kim, Jürgen Roth;</bold> Department of Integrated OMICS for Biomedical Science, Yonsei University, Seoul, 120-749, Korea</p><p>chojw311@yonsei.ac.kr</p><p>O-GlcNAc modification is one of the post-translational modifications found in nucleus and cytosol. This modification which can compete with phosphorylation is dynamically regulated by O-GlcNAc transferase(OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA). UDP-GlcNAc, a final product of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway is a substrate for OGT. More than 1,800 proteins have been identified as O-GlcNAcylated proteins. O-GlcNAcylation is reported to associate with the development of skeletal muscle atrophy and with muscle metabolism. Particularly, terminal differentiation of skeletal muscle is repressed by increased O-GlcNAcylation. We observed that the expression of myogenin, a key regulator for skeletal muscle terminal differentiation, decreased after treatment of NButGT, an inhibitor of OGA. In addition, we confirmed that the promoter activity of myogenin decreased after NButGT treatment. To find the promoter region affected by O-GlcNAc, we used shorter length promoter gene and found that at least 169 base pair upstream region of myogenin is affected by O-GlcNAc. We also found that Mef2c protein can be an important transcription factor regulated by O-GlcNAc <italic>via</italic> avidin-biotin complex DNA binding assay on 169 base pair upstream region. We performed immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry to confirm that Mef2c is O-GlcNAcylated and to find O-GlcNAcylated sites on Mef2c.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying O-GlcNAc induced the disruption of E-cadherin complexes is still unclear.

However, what modulates the association between ribosome and RACK1 is little understood. Herein, we show that ribosomal RACK1 is modified and stabilized by O-GlcNAc glycosylation in HCC. Moreover, hypoxia promotes the O-GlcNAc modification of RACK1, leading to the enhanced association between ribosome and RACK1 and IRES-mediated translation under hypoxic conditions.

TGF-β activated kinase 1 (TAK1)- binding protein2 (TAB2), binding partner of TAK1, plays important roles in the regulation of various pro-inflammatory signaling pathways including TNF-α and IL-1β-mediated activation of AP-1 and NF-κB. Here, we report that the global changes of O-GlcNAc affected the IL-1β and TNF-α induced IκB degradation and NF-κB activation signaling. TAB2 is identified as a highly O-GlcNAc modified protein. TAB2 reacted with a O-GlcNAc specific antibody CTD110.6 and the antibody reactivity was diminished by treatment of CPNag J. TAB2 was found to be susceptible to labeling with beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (GalT). We demonstrate that TAB2 can form a complex with OGT using co-immunoprecipitation approach in both directions. OGT <italic>in vitro</italic> labeling assay showed that TAB2 is a direct substrate of OGT. Using mass spectrometric methods, we validated the O-GlcNAcylation of TAB2 and localized O-GlcNAc sites on 3 separate sequences (GTSSLSQQTPR, TSSTSSSVNSQTLNR, and VVVTQPNTK). Site-directed mutagenesis of identified sites (T164, S165, S166, S168, T348, S349, S350, T351, S352, S353, S354, T456) confirmed these sites to be modified.

To study the impact of cerebroside sulfation on integrin levels, we investigated the sulphated cerebroside regulation of the integrin αV subunit expression in comparison with cerebroside. Exogenous sulphated cerebroside, rather than cerebroside, elicited a dose- and time-dependent stimulation of integrin αV subunit mRNA and protein expression in hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HCC). Through a comparison of treatments with cerebroside, ManN propanyl perac, and cyclo-ManN propanyl perac, only the cells treated with sulphated cerebroside produced a high expression level of the integrin αV subunit. Furthermore, the stable transfection of cerebroside sulfotransferase (<italic>CST</italic>) into the cells led to high expression of integrin αV, and a knockdown of <italic>CST m</italic>RNA showed down-regulation of integrin αV.

In contrast, early diabetes is found to increase 26S proteasome functionality in vasculature resulting in enhanced degradation of certain proteins key to the vascular homeostasis. We wonder whether endothelial NO synthase (eNOS)-derived NO functions as a physiological inhibitor of the 26S proteasome in vasculature. To test this, we exposed proteasome reporter (Ub<sup>G76V</sup>-GFP)-expressing vascular endothelial cells to NO and monitored proteasome functionality by detecting the polyubiquitinated-GFP reporter proteins. We also generated Ub<sup>G76V</sup>-GFP-expressing eNOS-knockout mice to determine the role of eNOS-derived NO in whole animal. Like the selective NO donors, NO derived from the activated eNOS (either by pharmacological or genetic approach) induced (poly)-Ub<sup>G76V</sup>-GFP accumulation in cultured endothelial cells, which was associated with increased O-GlcNAc modification of the proteasome regulatory complex (PA700/Rpt2) and reduced proteasome chymotrypsin-like activity (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, <italic>n</italic> = 5/group). Conversely, siRNA knockdown of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), the key enzyme for O-GlcNAcylation, abolished the NO-elicited effects. Consistently, adenoviral overexpression of O-GlcNAcase, the enzyme responsible for O-GlcNAc removal, mimicked the effects of OGT knockdown. Finally, compared to the control Ub<sup>G76V</sup>-GFP mice, eNOS-deleted mice exhibited accelerated Ub<sup>G76V</sup>-GFP degradation in isolated aortas, in parallel with elevated chymotrypsin-like activity and reduced PA700/Rpt2 O-GlcNAcylation, without changing PA700/Rpt2 protein levels. Importantly, the changes were enhanced in eNOS-lacking mice when rendered diabetic with streptozotocin (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, <italic>n</italic> = 10/group). In summary, the eNOS-derived NO functions as an OGT-mediated suppressive regulator of the 26S proteasome, likely through PA700/Rpt2 O-GlcNAcylation. The lack of eNOS-derived NO may contribute to elevated vascular 26S proteasome functionality in early diabetes.</p><p><bold>116: Tumorigenic potential of MEF cells transformed with polyoma virus oncogene correlates with β-1,4-galactosyltransferase V gene dosage</bold></p><p><bold>Chiemi Tareyanagi, Takeshi Sato, Yukiha Ishikawa and </bold><bold><underline>Kiyoshi Furukawa</underline></bold><bold>;</bold> Laboratory of Glycobiology, Nagaoka University of Technology, Nagaoka, Japan</p><p>furukawa@vos.nagaokaut.ac.jp</p><p>Our previous studies showed that β-1,4-galactosyltransferase (β4GalT) V is a lactosylceramide synthase and that its gene expression increases upon malignant transformation of cells. To date, there is another lactosylceramide synthase, β4GalT VI, whose gene expression in cells appears unchanged by malignant transformation. To investigate the biological significance of the increased gene expression of β4GalT V in tumor cells, we introduced the anti-sense β4GalT V cDNA into B16-F10 mouse melanoma cells, and examined the tumorigenic and metastatic potentials of the cells. The results showed that the B16-F10 cells with decreased β4GalT V gene expression reduce remarkably their malignant properties when compared with the control cells. This suggests that the expression level of the β4GalT V gene which finally regulates the amounts of lactosylceramide and its derivatives is quite important for malignant potentials of tumor cells.</p><p>In order to investigate the above study further, we first isolated fibroblast cells from wild-type, heterozygous and homozygous β4GalT V-knockout (B4galT5−/−) mouse embryos and transformed them with polyoma virus middle T antigen gene. RT-PCR analysis revealed that three types of mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) clones contain almost similar numbers of the gene copies. When they were placed into soft agarose gels, all the clones grew in them. However, the average numbers of colonies formed were high and the average sizes of colonies formed were large both in order of B4galT5+/+, B4galT5+/−, and B4galT5−/− derived MEF clones. Furthermore, the transformed MEF clones were transplanted subcutaneously into athymic mice, and tumors were allowed to develop for 3 weeks. The average volumes of the tumors formed were large also in order of B4galT5+/+, B4galT5+/−, and B4galT5−/− derived MEF clones. These results indicate that the tumorigenic potentials of transformed MEF clones correlate with the gene dosage of β4GalT V, namely with the amounts of lactosylceramide synthesized in the cells. Since lactosylceramide is the precursor for a series of glycolipids, how lactosylceramide and/or its derivatives are important for the malignat potentials in tumor cells remains to be elucidated.</p><p><bold>117: Endoplasmic Reticulum Located ppGalNAc-T18 (GALNTL4) is Involved in Cell Survival and Apoptosis</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Yan Zhang</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, AiDong Shan</bold><sup><bold>1,2</bold></sup><bold>, Xing Li</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Wei Li</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, AiGuo Shen</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup>Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Systems Biomedicine, Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200240, China;</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Biochemistry, Medical College of Nantong University, Nantong 226001, Nantong 226001, China</p><p>yanzhang2006@sjtu.edu.cn</p><p>Mucin-type <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation is initialized by members of the UDP-GalNAc: polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (ppGalNAc-T, EC 2.4.1.41) family.

Our further study has found that T18 was up-regulated both in apoptotic neuronal cells of mouse brain after intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and in apoptotic neuron-like PC12 cells after treatment with inflammatory cytokines. Knockdown of T18 induced cells apoptosis through activating ER stress response, and overexpression of T18 protected cells against apoptosis induced by pathological stimuli. Our results indicated that T18 was an essential protein for maintaining ER functions and cells survival.

The population of the bisecting GlcNAc-containing <italic>N</italic>-glycans, which formation are catalyzed by <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-III), was substantially increased in cells cultured under dense condition in an E-cadherin-dependent manner. In contrast, perturbation of E-cadherin-mediated adhesion abolished the up-regulation of expression of GnT-III. Consistently, the induction of GnT-III was not observed in embryonic fibroblasts or E-cadherin-deficient cells, which was rescued by restoration of the expression of E-cadherin. The induction was also not observed in alpha-catenin-deficient cells, but in the restored cells with the alpha-catenin gene. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that GnT-III expression is tightly regulated by cell-cell adhesion <italic>via</italic> the E-cadherin-catenin complex. However, unexpectedly, GnT-III was up-regulated by knockdown of beta-catenin or inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, resulting in an inhibition of integrin-mediated cell adhesion. In fact, integrins undergo glycosylation by GnT-III inhibits cancer metastasis <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Beta-catenin is an essential molecule both in cadherin-mediated cell adhesion and in canonical Wnt signaling, the loss of cadherin-mediated cell adhesion can promote beta-catenin release and Wnt signaling, and then Wnt signaling in turn inhibits E-cadherin-catenin-mediated cell adhesion. Therefore, we postulate that there are positive and negative regulation pathways for GnT-III, <italic>i.e.</italic>, E-cadherin-catenin mediated cell adhesion signaling and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, and the intersection point is at beta-catenin. The GnT-III expression was down-regulated in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by TGF-beta. Conversely, <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V), which is closely related with cell migration and cancer metastasis, was up-regulated in the EMT. Furthermore, overexpression of GnT-III inhibited EMT-like changes.

Cholestyramine, a strongly basic anion-exchange synthetic resin, is an example of effective cholesterol lowering agent. It reduces cholesterol absorption by sequestering bile acid conjugates and, therefore, interrupts the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids, increases their fecal excretion and supports compensatory oxidation of cholesterol in the liver. However, cholestyramine also binds anionic drugs, vitamins, and salts, and the competition for its binding sites in the digestive tract decreases the binding capacity for bile acids. As a result, large doses are required for the effective sorption that may cause serious side effects for some patients.</p><p>Another way of cholesterol level lowering is the consumption of dietary fibers that can also remove bile acids from the digestive tract. The combination of cholestyramine with such well-tolerated polysaccharides is effective in the treatment of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. Hydrophobic modifications may increase cholesterol lowering effect of polysaccharides. Alkyl- or acyl-substituted polysaccharides are amphiphilic polymers with a polar sugar backbone and non-polar hydrocarbon side chains. Hydrophobically modified polysaccharides have a potential value as drug carriers and sorbents for removing non-polar compounds from aqueous media and as potential agent for intestinal sorption of cholesterol, fats and bile acids.</p><p><italic>N</italic>-octadecylamides of highly methylated (HM) citrus pectin and methylesters of cellulose derivatives (monocarboxy oxidized cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose) were obtained by amino-de-alkoxylation with <italic>n</italic>-octadecylamine. <italic>N,O</italic>-palmitoylchitosan was prepared by reaction of chitosan with palmitoyl chloride.

It was found that the long alkyl/acyl modified polysaccharides, but not initial ones are able to bind bile acids and cholesterol effectively and thus can be used as cholestyramine replacers. However, by contrast to cholestyramine, these polysaccharide derivatives preferably adsorb cholesterol than cholate that could be explained by their significant hydrophobicity. <italic>In vivo</italic> feeding experiments on rats with high cholesterol level diet confirmed that hydrophobically modified HM pectin significantly altered cholesterol homeostasis in these animals and might be considered as a clinically effective hypocholesterolemic agent; preliminary experiments on the alkylated cellulose derivatives achieved similar results.</p><p><italic>This work was supported by the Czech Science Foundation (project No 503/11/2479)</italic></p><p><bold>120: The mechanism underlying uptake of polysaccharides</bold><bold><italic>via</italic></bold><bold>Clathrin/Dynamin/Eps15 and Rab5 dependent pathway</bold></p><p><bold>Wenfeng Liao, Dianxiu Cao, Ying Wang, </bold><bold><underline>Kan Ding</underline></bold><bold>*;</bold> Glycochemistry &amp; Glycobiology Lab, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 555 ZuChong Zhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China</p><p>kding@mail.shcnc.ac.cn</p><p>Polysaccharides play multitudinous and important role in many biological processes such as in the immune system, fertilization, pathogenesis prevention, blood clotting, and system development.

Here, we firstly employed the Caco-2 model to test the <italic>in vitro</italic> permeability of several polysaccharides extracted from plants and fungus. The results show that the apparent permeability coefficient (<italic>P</italic><sub>app</sub>) values of all the polysaccharides are more than 10 × 10<sup>−6</sup> cm/s. Interestingly, molecular size of polysaccharides is not changed significantly before and after they across the Caco-2 monolayer. Subsequently, the rat intubation surgery was employed to study the pharmacokinetics of the polysaccharides. The results indicates that the bioavailability of GFPBW1 (1,3-linked glucan), WGE (1,4-linked glucan) and Lentinan is 69.47 %, 73.91 % and 63.89 %, respectively. In addition, the polysaccharides even do not degrade significantly in plasma within at least 10 h. Using FITC-labeled polysaccharides, we found that various linked polysaccharides can internalized into Human Intestine Mucosa Epithelial Cell (HIMC cell) and co-localize with Clathrin, Dynamin, Rab5 and Eps15. Blocking Clathrin-mediated endocytosis either by the selective inhibitor Pitstop-1 or using small interfering RNA can reduce the internalization of the polysaccharides. Furthermore, silence of Dynamin-1, Dynamin-2 and Rab5 in HIMC cells by small interfering RNA or mutant Eps15 can also abolish polysaccharides internalization. These data suggest that polysaccharides may enter intestine cells by a Clathrin/Dynamin/Eps15 and Rab5-dependent pathway.

Mechanisms that regulate this universal feature of animal development remain largely unknown. With increasing attention focused on describing cellular, tissue, and organismal glycomes, there is hope that patterns may become recognizable within glycan diversity, potentially revealing nodes of regulation. Although its small size might be thought to preclude detailed glycomic analysis, as a model system the embryonic, larval, and adult stages of Drosophila offer unique opportunities to investigate glycan expression. Advances in the sensitivity and robustness of mass spectrometry over the last few decades have made it possible to harvest large amounts of information from small amounts of tissue, allowing a comprehensive analysis of the Drosophila glycome. Dominated by high mannose structures, the N-linked glycome of the Drosophila embryo is also populated with minor glycans of significant complexity, even glycans bearing sialic acid. The O-linked glycome includes structures seen in vertebrate species but also glycans containing novel composition and linkage. Therefore, both the N- and O-linked glycome of the Drosophila embryo are characterized by some similarity to vertebrate glycomes as well as some novelty, providing a fertile domain in which to investigate the regulation of glycan expression. To that end, we have undertaken genetic screens and reverse genetic manipulations in order to identify key genes that control the expression of neural-specific N-linked glycans and of O-linked glycans relevant for developmental signaling pathways. Our combined genetic and glycomic analyses have demonstrated an important role for intercellular signaling, mediated by toll-like receptors and facilitated by specific adaptor proteins and by specific post-translational modifications, in regulating the organization and function of the Golgi apparatus. Furthermore, altered expression of a glycosyltransferase that caps O-linked glycans leads to catastrophic loss of female fertility, but only in a specific genetic background—one that has otherwise been considered wild-type for most of the past century. Thus, Drosophila glycobiology is revealing the importance of signaling networks, subcellular organization, and the complex interplay of genetic background in regulating glycan expression in animals.</p><p><bold>124: Sialoglycoconjugates in Organ Development: A Study in Mouse and Zebrafish</bold></p><p><bold>Anja-Katharina Muenster-Kuehnel, Wiebke Schaper, Birgit Weinhold, </bold><bold><underline>Rita Gerardy-Schahn</underline></bold><bold>;</bold> Institute for Cellular Chemistry, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany</p><p>Gerardy-Schahn.Rita@mh-hannover.de</p><p>The acidic nine-carbon sugar sialic acid (Sia) terminates the bulk of oligosaccharide chains present on cell surface components and circulating glycoproteins.

JCGGDB project is the glycan part of the Integrated Database Project in Japan. We have surveyed available resources for glycol-science fields in the world for adopting glycoscience data to the Semantic Web technologies in 2011, and felt that international collaboration is necessary for this purpose. Then, we have call up a meeting to glycoscience researchers who hold databases by themselves at 2012. ACGG-DB3 meeting has been successfully held in Okinawa, Japan. 25 attendees from 17 research institutes in 7 countries or areas have discussed actively glyco-informatics and the need for collaborations in a global framework (PMID: 23271684).

In the next-generation of the Web, it is expected that a new technology will be able to utilize various data on the Web as a huge database. In order to use the data effectively, it is necessary to develop a method to represent the carbohydrate structure with the same meaning. This new linear notation can represent ambiguous and incomplete carbohydrate structures as unique character strings. Furthermore, anyone can generate WURCS with the same character strings related to the equivalent carbohydrate structure in glycobiology. For example, lactose is represented by the character strings of “[12112h|1,5]1:1,4:2[X2122h|1,5]”.

These techniques can produce extremely large amounts of data, and only a small portion of this data is usually reported in publications or databases describing the results of glycomics or glycoproteomics experiments. Members of the glycomics community have agreed that defining a minimum set of information regarding the techniques used to obtain these experimental results would allow scientists to better appreciate the depth and scope of each analysis and to reproduce the results. Therefore, an initiative to develop an international standard for the Minimum Information Required for A Glycomics Experiment (MIRAGE) was established at the 2<sup>nd</sup> Beilstein Symposium on Glyco-Bioinformatics in Potsdam Germany in June, 2011. The MIRAGE working group (<ext-link xlink:href="http://glycomics.ccrc.uga.edu/MIRAGE/" ext-link-type="uri">http://glycomics.ccrc.uga.edu/MIRAGE/</ext-link>) has recently finalized and published the glycomics MS guidelines and is currently working on guidelines for other experimental techniques, such as Glycan Array analysis, LC, HPLC and CE. The aim of MIRAGE project is not to constrain how experiments should be performed but rather to provide guidance regarding the information that is required to adequately describe each type of experiment. By listing the essential information to be provided, these guidelines are of great importance not just for authors and reviewers of publications but also for software and database developers. Developers can profit from the MIRAGE guidelines in that they serve as a foundation for defining technical specifications for applications or databases that generate or consume key information. However, the extensive set of information specified by the MIRAGE guidelines requires intelligent implementation strategies to simplify data annotation and submission.</p><p><bold>131: Informatics Tools for Glycoscience Research</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Kiyoko F.

One of the first data mining tools for analyzing glycan structure patterns is called Profile PSTMM. This model augmented the linear Markov model originally used for amino acid sequences to include branched structures that had dependencies between siblings. Thus wider-range patterns that were expected to be found in glycan structures could be extracted rather efficiently. Another tool is the Glycan Miner Tool, which mines large numbers of glycan structures to find common substructures of sufficient size and diversity. There is also the Glycan Pathway Predictor (GPP) which is based on a mathematical model for predicting <italic>N</italic>-glycan biosynthesis for a number of glycosyltransferases.

Zelinsky Institute of Organic Chemistry, Leninsky prospekt 47, Moscow, 119991 Russia</p><p>netbox@toukach.ru</p><p>Nowadays, the orientation in a currently acquired volume of glyco-related information is impossible without special features of informatics. Therefore, the progress of glycobiology strongly depends on a presence of an information environment including data on structures, properties and functions of carbohydrates, as well as on taxonomy and properties of their biological sources. The main approach to create such environment is development of carbohydrate databases. In contrast to genomics and proteomics, informatization of glycomics is still suffering from incompatibility between the existing projects. In the present mini-review I report a comparative analysis of currently active carbohydrate databases, with Russian Carbohydrate Structure Databases<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> (CSDBs) emphasized.</p><p>Glyco-databases providing wide coverage are most demanded, among them meta-database GlycomeDB, GLYCOSCIENCES, GlycoSuiteDB, CFG Glycan Database, KEGG, JCGGDB, GlycoBase-Dublin, UniCarbKB, Bacterial&amp;Archaeal CSDB, and Plant&amp;Fungal CSDB (currently in development) and other. Historically first carbohydrate database, CCSD (Carbbank) pretended to have complete coverage of structures published before 1996, when its support was ceased. Collection and digitizing of primary data are the most time-consuming stages of a database development, and therefore almost all modern projects somehow use the Carbbank data.</p><p>Analysis of the distinctive features of various projects allows to establish the criteria of database evaluation: types of data stored, completeness of coverage, data quality, functions provided to users, interface (usability, stability and performance), integration with other projects, and database architecture. Although the last criterion is invisible to users, it has a strongest impact on a database usefulness, since architectural mistakes hamper maintainability, upgradability and error control, and continuously increase the cost of a project.</p><p>The minimal types of data stored and processed in a glyco database are a primary molecular structure and taxonomical and bibliographic annotations. Many databases store analytical data, such as NMR or MS spectra. Storage of biochemical, genetic, medical and other related data is often supported, but their coverage remains poor. Of major carbohydrate databases, KEGG lacks for taxonomical annotations, and GlycomeDB for bibliographic annotations. The databases with stored NMR spectra provide a spectral coverage of 5– 25 % of the published data.</p><p>Higher coverage significantly increases the value of a database, since even a negative answer to a search request presents valuable scientific information. Restricted potential of automatization of a search for suitable publications limits the acquisition of primary data and, therefore, the coverage. Nowadays only Bacterial CSDB reports almost complete (&gt;75 %) structural coverage within a chosen compound class, namely glycans from procaryotic microorganisms. Since 2005 it has accumulated ca. 10 000 structures assigned to 5 000 microorganisms in 4 000 publications.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> Newly established Plant&amp;Fungal CSDB aims at achieving this level of coverage in 2016, and currently deposits re-annotated data published before 1996.</p><p>To keep the coverage actual, periodic updates are needed, which assumes one- or two-year lag between publication and deposition of data. A universal solution for keeping the data actual is a requirement of obligatory upload of every published structrure to a database prior to publication with subsequent provision of the obtained IDs to an editorial. Such approach has been realized in genomics for long but is still missing in glycomics. One of the reasons for that is an insufficient standardization of glycan description languages originating from high chemical variativity of carbohydrates. This problem, as well as limited cross-project compatibility, can be overcome by source-independent data framework, such as RDF. Several databases, including CSDB, GlycomeDB, UniCarbKB and other provide export of data as RDF triples according to an experimental version of GlycanRDF ontology formulated at Biohackathon 2012, Japan.</p><p>The process of data posting can hardly be automatized not only at the level of publication selection but also at the level of article interpretation. As a result, all chemical and biological databases contain errors. These errors originate from (in occurrence-descending order): annotators’ failures, other imported databases, original publications, architectural inconsistencies, bugs in import and auto-annotation software. According to our investigation,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3">3</xref> most records in Carbbank contain errors, and more than one third of records contain two or more errors. The most abundant error type is an incorrect taxonomical annotation of a structure. Significant gaps in the Carbbank coverage were also discovered. As most of the modern projects use the Carbbank data, these errors are being reproduced. Some of them can be revealed and sometimes corrected automatically. Such control is present in a number of databases; however, only a retrospective expert analysis of publications can provide really high data quality. Two thirds of CSDB budget is devoted to manual literature processing.</p><p>Database functionality is its capability to process various search requests, combine and refine them using diverse logics and other types of queries. <italic>E.g.</italic>, “<italic>find all structures published from 2001 to 2005, that contain either an α-Gal(1</italic>--&gt;<italic>3)KDO fragment or a monosaccharide-bound lysine or alanine, except synthetic structures or those found in gamma-proteobactertia, and display their</italic><sup><italic>13</italic></sup><italic>C NMR spectra</italic>”. In contrast to a search for bibliography, taxonomy, keywords, text fragments and similar data, a search for structural fragments in bigger molecules (as well as for structures or spectra resembling a specified one) requires more meticulous programming and computational power, making the inner database architecture critical for the performance of such queries. In the mid-2000s, developers of GLYCOSCIENCES.de formulated “Ten golden rules of carbohydrate database development”, which summarized the experience of the German and Russian groups. The key points of this document include usage of a connection table for inward structure representation, maximal possible indexation, minimum of free text data (which, regretfully, are present in virtually every project), and unambiguously controlled vocabularies for as much data types as possible. An attempt to separate the monosaccharide vocabulary from glyco-databases was made within MonosaccharideDB. Nowadays it provides full coverage on monosaccharides present in mammalian glycans.</p><p>Possibility of correct processing of structural data is directly related to the format of both internal and user structure descriptions. Incapabilities and inter-incompatibility of glycan description languages have been limiting the progress of glycoinformatics for decades. The main criteria of carbohydrate language efficiency are: 1. unambiguity and uniqueness of every chemically distinct structure, including non-carbohydrate moieties; 2. support of all structural features of carbohydrates and glycoconjugates (single and multiple repeats, cyclic and combined glycans, glycolipids, glycoproteins, non-carbohydrate and untypical constituents, phospho- and sulfo-linkages, cyclic esters, amide and ether linkages, <italic>etc.</italic>); 3. support of underdetermined structures at the level of monomers and their configurations, stoichiometry, substitution positions, and chain topology; 4. computer-readability with no need for ambiguous parsing, as in the case of Extended JUPAC, and human-readability required for tracking of errors that appear during human processing of data dumps; 5. compatibility with other formats (presence of converters that help language learning and cross-database operations), <italic>e.g.</italic> monomer vocabulary widely recognized by glycobiologists. The CSDB Linear and GlycoCT languages possess most of these features. However, the former does not support nested repeats and have limited aglica support, and the latter is not human-readable and supports carbohydrate moieties only. Glycomics still lacks a standard language except the JUPAC, which is highly imperfect.</p><p>The functionality can be extended by carbohydrate-related services, such as conformation map simulation, spectra prediction, search for structural motifs <italic>etc.</italic> CSDB project provides a generator of structural variety restricted by user constraints determined from simple experiments (<italic>e.g.</italic> number of residues per repeat and other data). This approach is a gateway to theoretical structural elucidation and ranking based on experimental data, and can be applied to this or to any other glycan database. Every structure in the generator output is a subject to either database-driven averaging or fully theoretical simulation of properties. Among these properties are the NMR spectra. As realized in CSDB, <sup>13</sup>C NMR simulation combines both environment-dependent database search and statistical processing, and empirical incremental prediction of chemical shifts. To find a chemical shift in a database a twelve-step generalization of atomic environment is applied. As well as the other related projects (CASPER, BIOPSEL), this feature is aimed at dramatic simplification of natural carbohydrate structural studies.</p><p>Modern quality standard in informatics implies that both user and administrative interfaces are intuitive, well-documented and freely accessible <italic>via</italic> Internet. Intuitiveness includes structure input and output formats, which users should not have to study. Standalone services for structure input and visual editing are of extreme usefulness, as they allow users of any database to stay within the interface which they got used to. Cross-project integration implies not only common interface of search requests but also automated data interchange <italic>via</italic> API. It concerns interactions with non-carbohydrate databases as well, at least with NCBI Taxonomy and NCBI Pubmed. First two projects that reported protocols for automated data exchange were GLYCOSCIENCES.de and Bacterial CSDB, and since then the development of glyco-related web-services has intensified.</p><p>Within the Bacterial CSDB project, we tried to develop the database architecture and to realize it in software free of disadvantages of other glyco-databases. Since then Bacterial &amp; Archaeal CSDB has been maintained and regularly updated. In 2012, we started its expansion to plant and fungal carbohydrates, being the pre-last step to creation of a complete database of natural glycans, which, we hope, will ideologically replace Carbbank.</p><p><bold>WorkshopII : Proteoglycans</bold></p><p><bold>134: Keynote Lecture: Exploiting the heparan sulphate interactome: from biology to synthetic chemistry to therapeutic applications</bold></p><p><bold><underline>J.

They have variant structures which represent a molecular code that is a subset of the glycome called the ‘heparanome’. These sulfation patterns confer the ability to interact selectively with a wide interactome of proteins that influences many cellular processes important in the development, regulation and repair of tissues. Understanding the chemical biology of these enigmatic molecules is now becoming possible through a variety of tools, reagents and approaches including saccharide libraries, microarray methods and novel sequencing approaches. We are developing and exploiting semi-synthetic and synthetic chemistry strategies to produce targeted libraries for activity screening to decode the molecular basis of the functional diversity of HS. This has yielded new insights into this code in a variety of biological contexts, including neural development, degeneration and repair, and cancer metastasis. This has led to a translational pathway of biomedical applications, including discovery of novel drug leads for Alzheimers disease and cancer metastasis, and potential interventions to improve neural cell transplantation for nerve repair.</p><p><bold>135: Synthesis of Heparan Sulfate Hexa- to Dodecasaccharides as Inhibitors of the Alzheimer’s Disease Target β-Secretase</bold></p><p><bold>Ralf Schwörer</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Jeremy E.

The structural basis of these interactions however remains elusive, and chemical synthesis of defined structures represents a challenging but powerful approach for unravelling the structure-activity relationships of their complex sulfation patterns. HS has been shown to function as an inhibitor of the beta-site cleaving enzyme β-secretase, a protease responsible for generating the toxic A-beta peptides that accumulate in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with 6-O-sulfation identified as a key requirement. Here we demonstrate a novel generic synthetic approach to HS oligosaccharides applied to production of a library of 16 hexa- to dodeca-saccharides, targeted at β-secretase inhibition. Screening of this library has provided new insights into structure-activity relationships for optimal β-secretase inhibition, and yielded a number of potent non-anticoagulant inhibitors with potential for development as leads for treatment of AD through lowering of A-beta peptide levels.</p><p><bold>136: Developing an enzymatic approach to synthesize heparin and heparin</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Jian Liu</underline></bold><bold>;</bold> Division of Chemical Biology and Medicinal Chemistry,Eshelman School of Pharmacy; University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599</p><p>Heparan sulfate is a sulfated glycan that exhibits essential physiological functions, and heparin is a clinically used anticoagulant drug. Interrogation of the specificity of heparan sulfate-mediated activities demands a library of structurally defined oligosaccharides. Synthesis of heparan sulfate using enzymes provides a promising approach because of the high regioselectivity of heparan sulfate biosynthetic enzymes. The synthesis of heparan sulfate involves 15 different enzymes, including sulfotransferases, an epimerase and glycosyltransferases. Up to now, a number of oligosaccharides with different sulfation patterns and sizes were synthesized. These oligosaccharides are now used to probe the biosynthetic mechanism of heparan sulfate and heparin, improving the synthesis of heparin drugs, and understanding the interaction of heparan sulfate with proteins. The availability of structurally defined heparan sulfate oligosaccharides will significantly advance the ability to understand the biology of heparan sulfate.</p><p><bold>137: RAGE: A proteoglycan-associated receptor</bold></p><p><bold>Ding Xu</bold><sup><bold>*1</bold></sup><bold>, Jeffrey Young</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Kevin D.

Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors form 2:2:2 complexes with heparin and FGF ligands. Based on crystallization studies, the non-reducing end of each heparin chain docks with one FGF and a canyon defined by the two receptors. In contrast, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors depend on heparan sulfate for activity presumably due to interaction with a heparin-binding coreceptor, such as neuropilin-1, or for stabilization of receptor oligomers induced by ligand binding. In this system, interaction of the ligand with heparin is not required. Recently, we described a third model based on the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), which also requires heparan sulfate for activity. Here we show that RAGE undergoes a heparin-dependent, ligand-independent oligomerization, generating a stable hexamer of the RAGE extracellular domain. Site-directed mutagenesis mapped two separate heparan sulfate-binding sites in the Ig-like V and C1 domains of RAGE. A hydrophobic dimeric interface essential for the formation of hexamer was also identified in the V domain. Crystallization of RAGE V-C1 in the presence of a heparin dodecasaccharide revealed a hexameric structure in the crystal lattice, consistent with complex composed of a trimer of dimers. A solution structure consistent with a hexamer was also observed by small angle X-ray scattering. Mechanistically, the data suggests that heparan sulfate binds to a positively charged cleft created by two subunits of the dimer, stabilizing an otherwise weak hydrophobic dimeric interface and promoting dimer formation and assembly into a hexamer. A monoclonal antibody targeting the hydrophobic interface blocks receptor signaling, demonstrating that oligomerization is required for signaling. Thus, RAGE defines a third mode of interaction in which heparan sulfate is a subunit of the holoreceptor.</p><p><bold>138: Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE) Functions as Receptor for Sulfated Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs): Anti-RAGE Antibody or Sulfated GAGs Inhibit Lung Metastasis of Tumor Cells</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Kazuyuki Sugahara</underline></bold><bold>, Jun Takahashi, Shuji Mizumoto;</bold> Hokkaido University Graduate School of Life Science, Sapporo, Japan 001-0021</p><p>k-sugar@sci.hokudai.ac.jp</p><p>Altered expression of chondroitin sulfate (CS) and heparan sulfate (HS) at the surfaces of tumor cells plays a key role in malignant transformation and tumor metastasis. Previously we demonstrated that a Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC)-derived tumor cell line with high metastatic potential had a higher proportion of E-disaccharide units, GlcUA-GalNAc (4,6-<italic>O</italic>-disulfate), in CS chains than low metastatic LLC cells and that such CS chains are involved in the metastatic process. The metastasis was markedly inhibited by the pre-administration of CS-E from squid cartilage rich in E units or by pre-incubation with a phage display antibody specific for CS-E. However, the molecular mechanism of the inhibition remained to be investigated.</p><p>In this study the receptor molecule for CS chains containing E-disaccharides expressed on LLC cells was revealed to be receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), which is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily predominantly expressed in the lung. Interestingly, RAGE bound strongly to not only E-disaccharide, but also HS-expressing LLC cells. Furthermore, the colonization of the lungs by LLC cells was effectively inhibited by the blocking of CS or HS chains at the tumor cell surface with an anti-RAGE antibody through intravenous injections in a dose-dependent manner. These results provide the clear evidence that RAGE is at least one of the critical receptors for CS and HS chains expressed at the tumor cell surface and involved in experimental lung metastasis and that CS/HS and RAGE are potential molecular targets in the treatment of pulmonary metastasis.

The failure in treatment of this disease is our inability to prevent and control PCa growth and metastasis. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying PCa pathogenesis will greatly enhance our effort to cure this life-threatening disease. Heparan sulfate (HS) is a linear, sulfated polysaccharide, and expresses abundantly in prostate and PCa tissues. Intriguingly, the HS content and sulfation modifications appear to increase when the prostate becomes malignance, suggesting that HS may critically modulate PCa pathogenesis. In current study, we specifically ablated Ext1, the enzyme that initiates HS biosynthesis, in mouse prostate at late development stage. The Ext1 ablation does not affect prostate development and function, instead, it protects the mice from tumorigenesis and invasion in a spontaneous PCa mouse model. Tissue staining showed that the Ext1 deficiency attenuated PCa cell proliferation, increased apoptosis, and blocked PCa stem/progenitor cell differentiation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The Ext1 deficiency PCa tissues also showed significant attenuation of fibrinosis, inflammation, MMP-9 expression and hypoxia. In summary, our studies demonstrate that HS functions via multiple mechanisms to promote PCa tumorigenesis and invasion, and also reveal that targeting HS may represent a novel and effect approach to cure PCa.</p><p><bold>140: Role of high endothelial venule-expressed heparan sulfate in chemokine presentation and lymphocyte homing</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Hiroto Kawashima</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold> and Koichiro Tsuboi</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup>Laboratory of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Shizuoka, Shizuoka 422-8526, Japan</p><p>kawashih@u-shizuoka-ken.ac.jp</p><p>Lymphocyte homing to peripheral lymph nodes (PLNs) is mediated by multi-step interactions between lymphocytes and high endothelial venules (HEVs).

The residual lymphocyte homing to PLNs in cKO mice was completely abrogated by pertussis toxin which inactivates Gi subunit-coupled heterotrimeric G proteins involved in chemokine receptor signaling, suggesting that soluble chemokines detected in the sera and PLN organ culture supernatants of cKO mice are involved in the residual lymphocyte homing. Furthermore, contact hypersensitivity responses were also partially diminished in the cKO mice. These results suggest that chemokine presentation by HS on the surface of HEVs facilitates lymphocyte homing and immune responses but is not absolutely required for chemokine function.</p><p><bold>WorkshopIII-Young Glycoscientists’ Symposium</bold></p><p><bold>141: Structural glycobiology of influenza virus receptors in respiratory tissues of humans and other animal models</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Nan Jia</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, John M.

The seasonal flu has been a public health concern for years and has the potential to cause global pandemics. Additionally, infected animals are slaughtered to prevent further spreading of the disease, leading to great economic loss. Although the exact mechanism by which the influenza becomes transmissible in human populations and between animal reservoirs remains incompletely understood, the initial interaction between the virus and the host cell is crucial. More specifically, it is the binding between viral surface proteins hemagglutinin and sialic acid residues displayed by glycoproteins and glycolipids that are expressed on the host plasma membrane, which triggers cellular recognition, attachment and viral entry events.</p><p>Sialic acids link to their adjacent monosaccharides <italic>via</italic> α2, 3 or α2, 6 glycosidic bonds and this linkage difference together with the change from Neu5Ac to Neu5Gc, are key factors defining the species barrier. The regional distributions of the two types of the glycosidic bonds along the respiratory tract, which is the infection site of mammalian species, have been demonstrated mostly by lectin staining studies. To better understand the functionality of host glycan receptors, we carried out complementary studies where structural information was extracted from animal tissues. Samples were processed to yield purified N- and O- linked as well as glycolipid derived glycan molecules, which were subsequently analysed by mass spectrometric instrument. Additional linkage information was further acquired by enzymatic digestion and GC-MS experiments.</p><p>We have produced glycomic profiles of several respiratory tissues, such as lung and trachea from different animal species. The ultimate aim of the study is to investigate how the receptor tropism present by different hosts could affect the infectivity of various influenza strains. Moreover, our structural data provides fundamental information of cellular receptors, based on which the structural heterogeneity of glycans along the respiratory tract can be compared among different animal models and which can be used for the production of glycan arrays that resemble the spectrum of glycans present in the respiratory tract.</p><p><bold>142: Improved O-glycan Analysis Methods</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Radoslaw P.

Although many techniques for O-glycan release have been developed, in our hands, the hydrazinolysis method has proven to be the best for producing O-glycans with free reducing termini in high yield. This release technique allows the glycans to be labelled with a fluorophore and analysed by fluorescence detection. Under the hydrazinolysis release conditions, an unwanted side reaction is observed which causes the loss of monosaccharides from the reducing terminus of the glycans. This side reaction is known as peeling. The reduction of this glycan degradation step is necessary in order to obtain information on the initial oligosaccharide composition. Using bovine fetuin and bovine submaxillary gland mucin (BSM) we demonstrated that peeling can be greatly reduced when the sample is buffer exchanged prior to hydrazinolysis with either solutions of 0.1 % trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) or low molarity (100, 50, 20 and 5 mM) ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The presented technique for sample preparation prior to hydrazinolysis greatly reduces the level of undesirable cleavage products in O-glycan analysis and increases the robustness of the method.</p><p>We further evaluate the use of O-glycans obtained by hydrazinolysis from various biological sources for the preparation of natural O-glycan arrays. To this end, O-glycans released from BSM and porcine stomach mucin (PSM) and human saliva are labelled with 2-aminobenzamide, fractionated by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) UPLC with fluorescence detection, and characterized by MALDI-TOF(/TOF)-MS. When necessary, O-glycan fractions are subjected to a second-dimension reverse phase separation to obtain homogeneous fractions. Subsequently, O-glycans are printed onto epoxy-activated glass slides and probed with well-characterized carbohydrate-binding proteins for the detection of structural determinants as well as for the evaluation of lectin specificities.</p><p><bold>143: Quick and convenient diagnostic method for Guillain-Barré syndrome using sugar-chain immobilized fluorescent nano-particles</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Hiroyuki Shinchi</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Nobuhiro Yuki</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Hideharu Ishida</bold><sup><bold>3</bold></sup><bold>, Koichi Hirata</bold><sup><bold>4</bold></sup><bold>, Masahiro Wakao</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Yasuo Suda</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup>Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Kagoshima Univ., Kagoshima, 890-0084, Japan; <sup>2</sup>Development of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, 117599, Singapore; <sup>3</sup>Faculty of Applied Biological Science, Gifu Univ., Gifu, 501-1193, Japan; <sup>4</sup>Dokkyo Medical Univ., Tochigi, 321-0293, Japan</p><p>k9561067@kadai.jp</p><p>Guillain-Barré syndrome ranks as the most frequent cause of acute flaccid paralyis, often being misdiagnosed as having stroke.

Immobilization of sugar chain onto the nano-particle was confirmed by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS).</p><p>The prepared SFNPs were then used for the detection of anti-ganglioside antibodies in sera from patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome.

After centrifugation of the mixture, fluorescent precipitates were observed only in the Guillain-Barré syndrome patient’s serum. It was confirmed by SDS-PAGE that the precipitate contained IgG, suggesting the specific complex of SFNP with anti-ganglioside antibodies. Since our developed method detects serum anti-ganglioside antibodies in a few hours, it can be utilized as a rapid and conventional diagnostic method.</p><p><bold>144: NMR analyses of conformational dynamics and interactions of oligosaccharides by employing paramagnetic probes</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Ying Zhang</underline></bold><sup><bold>1,2,3</bold></sup><bold>, Takumi Yamaguchi </bold><sup><bold>1,2,3</bold></sup><bold>, Sayoko Yamamoto </bold><sup><bold>1,3</bold></sup><bold>, Yoshinori Uekusa</bold><sup><bold>1,3</bold></sup><bold>, Maho Yagi-Utsumi </bold><sup><bold>1,3</bold></sup><bold> and Koichi Kato </bold><sup><bold>1,2,3</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup>Institute for Molecular Science and Okazaki Institute for Integrative Bioscience, National Institutes of Natural Sciences and <sup>2</sup>Department of Functional Molecular Science, The Graduate University for Advanced Studies (SOKENDAI), 5-1 Higashiyama, Myodaiji, Okazaki, 444-8787, Japan, <sup>3</sup>Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, 3-1 Tanabe-dori, Mizuho-ku, Nagoya, 467-8603, Japan</p><p>yzhang@ims.ac.jp</p><p>Oligosaccharides play important physiological and pathological roles in biological systems. For better understanding the molecular basis of the mechanisms underlying oligosaccharide functions, it is quite desirable to describe their conformational dynamics and interaction systems at atomic level. However, these are still the remaining challenges, because high conformational flexibility of oligosaccharides hinders the application of conventional analytical methods such as X-ray crystallography.</p><p>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has immense potential to deal with such dynamics issues in various ranges of spatial and time scales. For conformational characterization of flexible oligosaccharides, their structures should not be dealt with as a single well-defined global free energy minimum but as an ensemble of low energy conformers. To overcome the major limitation of traditional NMR methods for the insufficiency of conformational information of oligosaccharides provided by nuclear Overhauser effect data, we have been developing an NMR methodology for evaluating a dynamic ensemble of oligosaccharide conformations by employing paramagnetic effects in conjunction with molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Paramagnetic effects were induced by unpaired electron providing long-distance information on conformations and dynamics of oligosaccharides.</p><p>By applying this approach, we have successfully characterized the 3D structure of flexible GM3 trisaccharide (αNeu5Ac-(2-3)-βGal-(1-4)-βGlc) and branched GM2 tetrasaccharide (βGalNAc-(1-4)-[αNeu5Ac-(2-3)]-βGal-(1-4)-βGlc) which share the common core structure of gangliosides forming an integral part of cellular membranes. The interbranch interactions responsible for the distinct conformational ensembles between the GM3 and GM2 oligosaccharides were elucidated by the paramagnetic-assisted NMR analyses in conjunction with MD simulations. The results demonstrated that this methodology offers a valuable tool for the characterization of flexible oligosaccharides conformational dynamics. Furthermore, we extended this methodology to analyze oligosaccharides interaction systems, such as carbohydrate-carbohydrate and carbohydrate-protein interactions. For example, the weak interactions between gangliosides were observed through the analyses of inter-molecular paramagnetic effect offered by NMR measurements. This methodology opens a new prospect for conformational analyses of dynamic structures of oligosaccharides toward decoding glycocodes from the 3D structural aspects.</p><p><bold>145: Expression and characterization of the first snail-derived UDP-</bold><bold><italic>N</italic></bold><bold>-acetyl-α-D-galactosamine: polypeptide</bold><bold><italic>N</italic></bold><bold>-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Christopher Taus</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Chantal Lucini</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Takeshi Sato</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Kiyoshi Furukawa</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Reingard Grabherr</bold><sup><bold>3</bold></sup><bold> and Erika Staudacher</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup> Department of Chemistry, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna, Austria, <sup>2</sup>Laboratory of Glycobiology, Nagaoka University of Technology, Nagaoka, Japan, <sup>3</sup> Department of Biotechnology, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna, Austria</p><p>Christopher.Taus@boku.ac.at</p><p>Mucin-type O-linked protein glycosylation is initiated by the UDP-<italic>N</italic>-acetyl-α-D-galactosamine: polypeptide <italic>N</italic>-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (ppGalNAcT) enzyme family.

Using sense and antisense degenerated primers designed to highly conserved sequences of the ppGalNAcT enzyme family, a corresponding fragment from snail origin could be amplified by homology-based PCR. Within three experimental steps we could isolate the full-length ppGalNAcT gene. The snail glycosyltransferase has high homology to other ppGalNAcTs and contains all domains common to this enzyme family. Based on the amino acid sequence, there is no N-glycosylation site, whereas O-glycosidase treatment prior to lectin blot analysis indicates the occurrence of O-glycosylation. The novel ppGalNAcT shows a pH-optimum at pH 6.0-6.5, divalent cations are required, with manganese being optimal at 10 mM, and 37 °C as best incubation temperature. All tested acceptor peptides were glycosylated immediately with one but during extensive incubation also with more GalNAc residues.

Several different functions of Gal-8, like its role in angiogenesis and a pro-apoptotic effect on lymphoctes, have been described so far. But knowledge about the influence of the linker region on the biological activity is sparse. We investigated the functional role of human recombinant Galectin-8 (hGal-8) with regard to its two different isoforms. We report that the human short, but not the long linker isoform may play a regulatory role in angiogenesis. In an <italic>in vitro</italic> angiogenesis assay (tube formation assay), hGal-8S in contrast to hGal-8L was able to enhance angiogenesis of human endothelial cells (HUVEC) on a feeder layer of human fibroblasts in combination with VEGF. In comparison, hGal-1 and hGal-3 only displayed small positive effects in this angiogenesis assay. With regard to its effect on lymphocytes, we could now show that hGal-8L in contrast to hGal-8S exerts a pronounced pro-apoptotic influence on human B leukemic cells of pre-B-cell origin (REH and Nalm-6). The different functional effects could at least partly be due to the fact that these isoforms vary in their ability to multi- or dimerize in solution. Using microscale thermophoresis measurement to quantitatively measure interactions of two molecules in solution, we were able to show that hGal-8L has a significantly stronger ability to dimerize in solution than hGal-8S. These observations may point to the fact that the length of the linker between the two CRDs influences the biological action of hGal-8. It has to be elucidated whether these findings can also be applied for other tandem-repeat galectins like for example human Galectin-9.</p><p>This work is funded by the “Deutsche José Carreras Leukämie-Stiftung”.</p><p><bold>149: GD1a activates MAPK pathway</bold><bold><italic>via</italic></bold><bold>calcium signaling to suppress NOS2 expression in mouse osteosarcoma cells in an EGFR-independent manner</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Xiao-Yan Yang</underline></bold><bold>, Lan Zhang, Xiao Zhang, Sadako Yamagata and Tatsuya Yamagata;</bold> Laboratory of Tumor Biology and Glycobiology, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 WenHua Rd, Shenyang, 110016 China</p><p>yangxiaoyan.syphu@gmail.com</p><p>Inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) has been shown to increase during inflammation and tumor progression. Our previous work revealed that NOS2 was responsible for the malignant nature of murine osteosarcoma FBJ-LL and that NOS2 expression was enhanced by silencing ERK1 that mediated the suppression of NOS2 by ganglioside GD1a cells (Cao T, <italic>et al.</italic>, Ganglioside GD1a suppression of NOS2 expression <italic>via</italic> ERK1 pathway in mouse osteosarcoma FBJ cells. <bold><italic>J Cell Biochem</italic></bold><bold>, 110</bold>, 1165–1174, 2010). In the present work, we will show that GD1a in FBJ-LL cells suppresses NOS2 expression through calcium signaling that activatesgrowth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) followed by MAPK pathway activation. In untreated cells, NOS2 expression was suppressed through MAPK pathway that is activated by EGFR, whose signal is mediated by GRB2, but in GD1a-activated cells, the GD1a signal did not include EGFR activation. When we investigated molecules involved in MAPK pathway, we found that silencing MEK2, but not MEK1, augmented NOS2 expression in untreated FBJ cells and impaired the GD1a signal. Furthermore, silencing (GRB2) resulted in an increase in NOS2 in untreated cells and abrogated the GD1a signal. In addition, EGF suppressed NOS2 expression through activation of EGFR, GRB2, and MEK2 in FBJ-LL cells. However, the GD1a suppression of NOS2 was not cancelled by treating cells with the EGFR inhibitor, AG 1478, or by silencing EGFR; though these treatments cancelled the effects of EGF on NOS2 suppression. An anti-GRB2 antibody precipitated phosphorylated EGFR in the sample from EGF-activated cells, but not in the sample from GD1a-treated cells. These results indicated that, in FBJ-LL cells, GD1a stimulated an unidentified signaling molecule to stimulate calcium influx that activated the GRB2/MEK2/ERK1 pathway and could suppress NOS2 without EGFR involvement. In contrast, in untreated cells, EGFR mediated the activation of GRB2/MEK2/ERK1, which then suppressed NOS2 expression. We have also shown that in murine Lewis lung carcinoma cells GD1a suppressed NOS2 expression <italic>via</italic> EGFR-independent signal pathways.</p><p><bold>150: Characterization of Cell Surface Glycosylation in Ovarian Cancer Leads to Identification of Dysregulation in</bold><bold><italic>MGAT3</italic></bold><bold>and</bold><bold><italic>ST6GAL-1</italic></bold><bold>Gene Expression</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Merrina Anugraham</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Sheri Nixdorf</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Francis JACOB</bold><sup><bold>3</bold></sup><bold>, Viola Heinzelmann-Schwarz</bold><sup><bold>3</bold></sup><bold>, Nicolle H.

Understanding the function of kinases is of an outstanding interest for biomarker discovery and also necessary for the development of agonists and antagonists for the use in disease therapy. O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAcylation) is a post-translational modification known to regulate different aspects of a proteins function including localization, activity, and stability. Like phosphorylation, O-GlcNAcylation, which modifies serine and threonine residues on nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, is a ubiquitous, reversible process that regulates numerous cellular processes. Recent evidence indicates that site-specific crosstalk between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation and the O-GlcNAcylation of kinases play an important role in regulating cell signaling. Hence, it is very important to investigate the O-GlcNAcylation of the kinome. Previously, we identified 42 kinases that are substrates for O-GlcNAcylation using an <italic>in vitro</italic> OGT assay with [H<sup>3</sup>] radiolabel on a functional kinase array. However, using [H<sup>3</sup>] has serve senstitive limiations suggesting a more sensitive approach is needed to probe large libraries of proteins.

In this study, we have synthesized disulfide- and terminal alkyne- modified magnetic silica particles (DA-MSPs) and developed a novel method for enrichment of azido labeled glycopeptides based on bioorthogonal chemistry. In our results, the adsorption capacity of these particles is calculated to be over 4 pmol/mg, and the enrichment recovery rate is over 40 %, and specific enrichment can be realized when the ration of interference BSA peptides to targeting standard glycopeptide is 100:1.

Several critical aspects of the basic biology of these cell lines remain unknown, including the composition of their plasmalemma surface proteome and extracellular glycocalyx, and how these cell surface molecules interact with pathogens and respond to their environment. Here, we focused on analyzing the surface glycoproteins of two important human liver cell lines: HC-04, which has been shown to support human malaria liver stage development and HepG2, a widely-used cell line that will not support infection with human malaria parasites. Although the determinants of susceptibility to malarial infection are unknown, we hypothesize that a differential response to culture conditions are likely to modulate surface protein expression density and repertoire, which may influence susceptibility. The HC-04 and HepG2 surface glycoproteins were labeled and enriched by DIBO-AHA pull-downs prior to SDS-PAGE separation and in-gel digestion. To overcome technical limitations due to the small amount of surface glycoproteins, we developed a highly sensitive online integrated system, and in a proof of principle study, analyzed the surface <italic>N-</italic>linked glycoproteomes of the HC-04 and HepG2 cell lines in response to titrated concentrations of hepatocyte growth factor.

In comparison with the conventional offline method, the total analysis time was shortened from days to several hours, and the sample amount for each analysis was reduced to 1 ~ 2 micrograms. Furthermore, the contamination risk was reduced since all preparation steps were online after in-gel digestion. In addition, we captured aglycosylated peptide fragments during ERLIC enrichment, which could be used for glycoprotein quantification analysis by the label-free method developed in our previous work. The differentially expressed glycoproteins identified between the HC-04 and HepG2 cell lines provide insight into the impact of growth conditions on surface glycoproteomes of these important hepatocyte lines.</p><p><bold>159: Characterization of</bold><bold><italic>O</italic></bold><bold>-Glycans of Ovomucin Isolated from Hen Egg White Based on the One-pot Procedure by Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Weibo Xing</underline></bold><bold>, Chengjian Wang, Xiaohua Li, Zhongfu Wang, Linjuan Huang;</bold> Educational Ministry Key Laboratory of Resource Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Life Science College, Northwest University, Xi’an 710069, China</p><p>huanglj@nwu.edu.cn</p><p>Mucin-type glycans of glycoproteins are extensively believed to play important roles in many biological processes, such as immune responses, protection of the gastrointestinal tractus, and egg-sperm interaction.

The multivalent hydrazide functionalized particles were demonstrated to enrich glycopeptides with high sensitivity from a peptide mixture of Bovine Fetuin and Bovine Serum Albumin at a mass ratio of 1:100. The recovery of glycopeptide was investigated to be 73 %, and the glycopeptides binding capacity was proven to be 25 μg/mg. Finally, the novel hydrazide functionalized particles were applied to enrich N-linked glycosylated peptides from 50 μg mouse liver tissues.

Hence, in-depth profiling of the sialylated glycoproteome may improve our knowledge of this modification and its effects on protein functions. Here, we systematically investigated different strategies to enrich the SA proteins in human plasma using a newly developed technology that utilizes titanium dioxide for sialylated N-glycoproteome profiling by mass spectrometry. Our results showed that using a combination of a filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) method, TiO2 chromatography, multiple enzyme digestion and two-dimensional reversed-phase peptide fractionation led to in-depth profiling of the SA proteome. In total, 982 glycosylation sites in 413 proteins were identified, among which 37.8 % were newly identified, which established the largest database of sialic acid-containing proteins from human plasma.</p><p><bold>162: Multiplex Profiling of Glycoproteins Using Novel Bead-based Lectin Array</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Hong Li</underline></bold><bold>, Hong Wang, Wei Zhang, Liming Wei, Hongxiu Yu, Pengyuan Yang;</bold> Fudan University, Shanghai, 200032, P.R.

A subtype of MODY is caused by mutations in HNF1A, a nuclear transcription factor which appears to be one of the key regulators of metabolic genes. Recently we showed that deleterious coding mutations in HNF1A have profound effects and that antennary fucosylation of plasma proteins is significantly decreased in HNF1A-MODY patients. The proportion of HPLC peak DG9 in the sum of DG8 and DG9 (HAFU index) roughly indicates the level of antennary fucosylation of triantennary glycans in plasma. Low values of this index appeared to be very indicative of HNF1A-MODY. HNF1A-MODY patients could be nearly completely separated from Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, GCK-MODY and general population on the basis of the HAFU index with Receiver-Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves approaching 90 % specificity at 90 % sensitivity.

Over the years, we have worked on mAb-based affinity capture and other biophysical enrichment methods to target specific subsets of glycopeptides including the sulfated glycopeptides, investigated various modes of glycopeptide sequencing, and automated data analysis through development of software suites. We aim to determine if terminal glycotopes mapping can be more or equally effective at such a shotgun glycoproteomic level compared with glycomics. Through applications to single isolated glycoproteins, we demonstrated that novel glycosylation sites could be identified when data analysis is not constrained by inputs of predicted sites. On many occasions, unpredicted proteolytic cleavages produces peptide cores not matching anticipated peptide pools and therefore cannot be identified unless <italic>de novo</italic> sequenced. In general, either a software-driven two-tiers MS2/MS3 on ion trap or a combined HCD/ETD coupled with database search provides the most objective, non-biased high throughput analysis, which can be used in complementary. Likewise, a combination of two-step orthogonal enrichment is often more effective in producing the desirable glycopeptide pools. Analysis of sulfated sialylated glycopeptides remain daunting, which can be facilitated by chemical derivatization. We highlight here several aspects of technical advances and progress we have made over the last few years in glycoproteomics, exemplified by a diverse range of applications including one on endogenous EGFR from several lines of primary lung cancer cells.</p><p><bold>165: Development of glyco-biomarker for liver disease</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Makoto Ocho</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Akira Togaychi</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Hiroyuki Kaji</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Atsushi Kuno</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Etsuko Iio</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Maki Sogabe</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Yasuhito Tanaka</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Yuzuru Ikehara</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Masashi Mizokami</bold><sup><bold>3</bold></sup><bold>, and Hisashi Narimatsu</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup>Research Centre for Medical Glycoscience (RCMG), National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science And Technology (AIST), Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8568, Japan; <sup>2</sup>Department of Virology and Liver, Nagoya City University Medical School, Nagoya, 467-8601, Japan; <sup>3</sup>Research Centre of Japan, Hepatitis and Immunology, Kohnodai Hospital, International Medical Centre, Ichikawa, 272-8516, Japan</p><p>makoto.ochou@aist.go.jp</p><p>Identification of new glyco-biomarkers predicting the liver disease progression and the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been attempted.

Since the definitive CC diagnosis relies on invasive methods such as biliary cytology and biopsy, a noninvasive assay with high diagnostic accuracy has been keenly required. We previously reported that <italic>Wisteria floribunda</italic> agglutinin (WFA) is the best probe lectin which reliably distinguishes between the non-cancerous and cancerous region in tissue sections of CC by the lectin microarray and histochemical analysis. Here our aim is the development of a novel glycoprotein marker for reliable CC diagnosis by WFA-based glycoproteomics approach. We identified several WFA binding glycoproteins by immunohistochemistry and mass spectrometry analysis. Then, we verified these WFA-positive glycoproteins as the diagnostic marker candidates for CC using bile and serum specimens. Sialyl-MUC1, recognized with a specific monoclonal antibody, MY.1E12, was the primary candidate identified as one of the WFA-positive glycoproteins. A WFA-coated MY.1E12 sandwich ELISA was constructed for validation with bile and serum, and this marker could distinguish CC from other patients in bile specimens (Matsuda A., <italic>et al.</italic>, <italic>Hepatology,</italic> 2010). L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) was the second candidate by the WFA-assisted glycoproteomics from surgical CC tissue sections. We confirmed that WFA-positive L1CAM expressed specifically in the CC tissues and bile, and the amount was significantly different between the bile specimens of CC and benign bile duct disease. The combined use of WFA-sialyl MUC1 and WFA-L1CAM sufficiently improved the accuracy of CC (overall accuracy = 0.84, AUC = 0.93) in the biliary diagnosis. As the ultimate goal of this study is the serological diagnosis, we are performing further verification of these markers using serum by immunodetection and lectin microarray analysis. This combination assay using WFA-sialyl MUC1 and WFA-L1CAM will possibly be a useful serological test with enhanced reliability.</p><p>This work was supported a grant from New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) in Japan.</p><p><bold>167: Glycoproteomics of serum proteins in hepatitis B and hepatitis C induced liver cirrhosis</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Gautam Mondal</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Yogesh K Chawla</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Hirokazu Yagi</bold><sup><bold>3</bold></sup><bold>, Koichi Kato</bold><sup><bold>4</bold></sup><bold>, Bishnu P Chatterjee</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>†</bold><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup>Department of Natural Sciences, West Bengal University of Technology, Salt Lake, Kolkata-700064, India, <sup>2</sup>Department of Hepatology, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh -160012, India, <sup>3</sup>Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, 3-1 Tanabe-diri, mizuho-ku, Nagoya 4678603, Japan, <sup>4</sup>Institute for Molecular Science and Okazaki Institute for Integrative Bioscience, National Institutes of Natural Sciences, Okazaki Institute for Integrative Biosciences, 5-1 Higashiyama, Myodaiji, Okazaki-444-8787, Japan</p><p>cbishnup@gmail.com</p><p>Glycosylation is one of the most important events of post translational modification in many serum proteins which can provide information about the onset and progression of disease. Both hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis B virus (HCV) cause acute and chronic liver infection and most chronically infected individuals remain asymptomatic for many years. Although biopsy is the gold standard method for both hepatitis B virus induced liver cirrhosis (HBV-LC) and C virus induced liver cirrhosis (HCV-LC), it has several disadvantages. Therefore, a non-invasive, simple test would be highly desirable. During inflammation and other related disorders altered glycosylation patterns are observed in several acute phase proteins besides their alteration in expressions. Our aim was to monitor the changes in the expression level and glycosylation pattern of serum glycoproteins of hepatitis patients which could be used as serological markers for diagnosis. Alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AGP) was isolated from the albumin depleted sera of HBV-LC and HCV-LC patients by affinity chromatography on mononclonal anti-AGP column. The unbound fraction by 2D gel electrophoresis gave several protein spots, which were identified by MALDI-TOF-MS. Database search of MS-MS spectra identified six significantly altered serum glycoproteins: haptoglobin alpha 2 (Hp-α2) chain, haptoglobin beta 2 (Hp-β) chain, apolipoprotein A-1(ApoA-1), alpha-1 antitypsin (AAT), vitamin D binding protein (BTDBP) and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGHA) respectively. This result was further validated by immunoblot using monoclonal antibody indicating possible increased expression of AAT and decreased level of Hp-α2 and Hp-β chain in both hepatitis patients with respect to control. Lectin blots showed decreased level of sialic acid and increased of fucosylation of serum glycoproteins which was assessed by <italic>Maackia amurensis</italic> agglutinin (MAA) and <italic>Lens culinaris</italic> agglutinin (LCA) respectively. The alteration of glycosylation in AGP from two groups of hepatitis patients was determined by HPLC mapping method followed by mass spectrometry and GALAXY database search. N-glycans released from AGP by hydrazinolysis were labeled with 2-aminopyridine and separated by three successive HPLC columns, <italic>viz.,</italic> DEAE, ODS and amide silica. We found decrease or absence of sialic acid in HBV-LC and increased fucosylation of neutral N-glycans in both hepatitis patents.

To monitor the changes in the abundance and structure of the glycan moieties of various glycoproteins, quantitative glycomics based on stable isotope labeling coupled with mass spectrometric analysis represents an emerging and promising technique. However, this technique is undermined by the time-consuming post-processing steps and the complexity of the mass spectra of isotope-labeled glycans arising from the presence of multiple metal ion adduct peaks, which result in a decrease of detection sensitivity and an increase of difficulties in data interpretation. In this study, a facile strategy for the relative quantitative analysis of <italic>N</italic>-glycans using the stable isotope label Girard’s reagent P (GP) has been developed. This procedure features efficient labeling of reducing glycans with protium- or deuterium-substituted (d0/d5-) GP under non-reductive conditions and subsequent direct detection by mass spectrometry (MS) without any post-processing steps. The obtained intensity ratio between the MS peaks of the d0- and d5-GP derivatives of each glycan allows rapid and high-throughput relative quantitative analysis. More importantly, the GP-derivatives exhibit only [M]<sup>+</sup> type ion peaks in their MS profiles, excluding the interference from multiple complex ion adduct peaks such as [M+H]<sup>+</sup>, [M+Na]<sup>+</sup> and [M+K]<sup>+</sup> and simplifying exceedingly the interpretation of their MS data. We have demonstrated the reliability and high sensitivity of the method using lactose as a model glycan by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS).

One is the nonspecific adsorption of proteins, which could reduce the enrichment selectivity and the recovery of glycoproteins. The other is the limited enrichment capacity owing to the low surface area of monoliths.

In contrast to other strategies, TOSIL, which incorperates three <sup>18</sup>O atoms into the heavy labeled glycopeptides during tryptic and N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) mediated hydrolysis, could obviously improve the distinguishment of glyco- and nonglyco-peptides, and also the isotope distribution overlapping between differently labeled glycopeptides. However, the false positive rate of the quantification results might be increased by the limited <sup>18</sup>O-labeling efficiency, back exchange of <sup>18</sup>O and interference of residual active trypsin that incorporates <sup>18</sup>O into peptides during PNGase F deglycosylation.</p><p>Herein, we presented a new tandem dimethyl and solid-phase <sup>18</sup>O stable isotope labeling strategy (TDSOSIL), by which glycopeptide pairs were first labeled with light/heavy dimethyl after selectively enrichment, and then labeled with light/heavy oxygen atoms during deglycosylation by PNGase F immobilized enzymatic reactor (PNGase F IMER), generating enlarged 6, 10 or 12 Da difference between the glycopeptide pairs. It was demonstrated that the developed PNGase F mediated solid-phase <sup>18</sup>O labeling could dramatically minimize the back exchange of <sup>18</sup>O labeled peptides, and overcome the spontaneous nonenzymatic <sup>18</sup>O labeling. In combination with the high-efficient dimethyl labeling, the accuracy of N-glycosylation quantitication and qualitation was improved. By such strategy, 146 N-glycosites were quantified with equal amount syngeneic mouse hepatocarcinoma ascites (HCA) cell digest labeled with light/heavy isotope, and 97 % of which had the H/L ratios in the range of 0.50–2.00 with RSD &lt;30 %, indicating the great promise of TDSOSIL strategy for N- glycosylation quantitation. This strategy is now being applied for the differential glycoproteome analysis of highly and lowly metastatic typed HCA cell lines, the result of which will provide important technical support for the revealment of metastatic mechanism and the further discovery of potencial biomarker for desease diagnosis and drug therapy.</p><p><bold>Poster Session I-Glyco(bio)technology</bold></p><p><bold>177: Analysis of highly complex glycan mixture derived from human fluid by MALDI-TOF/TOF, nano-LC/Chip Q-TOF and UPLC-Triple Quadruple Mass Spectrometry</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Su Hee Kim</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Bum Jin Kim</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Jae Han Kim</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold> and Hyun Joo An</bold><sup><bold>1*</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup>Graduate School of Analytical Science and Technology, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Korea, <sup>2</sup>Department of Food and Nutrition, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Korea</p><p>sugar@cnu.ac.kr</p><p>Depending on the ionization methods and the type of mass analyzer, various mass spectrometric analyses have been developed. Due to their unique analytical advantages, appropriate mass spectrometric method has to be chosen practically depending on the purpose. While MALDI-TOF enables the quick view of whole glycan profile in the samples, nanoLC/Chip Q-TOF can provide the insight of isomers which MALDI-TOF is intrinsically ignored. UPLC-Triple Quadruple offers fast and quantitative analysis comparing with nano-LC/Chip Q-TOF, however, relatively low mass accuracy and resolution are disadvantages. Although the use of appropriate MS is crucial for the efficient analysis of complex glycan mixtures, data comparability between each MS has to be evaluated prior to the MS data interpretation and comparison. In this study, we assess the qualitative and quantitative comparability of each mass spectrometry using human milk oligosaccharides (HMO). HMO is a highly complex glycan mixture with a similar structure to the O-glycan. Extraction of free oligosaccharides was performed by following steps including the removal of lipids by Folch method and ethanol protein precipitation. To get rid of αand βisomers, free oligosaccharides were reduced to alditols. Extracted free oligosaccharides were further purified by solid phase extraction enriched 20 % and 40 % (in 0.05 % TFA) ACN fraction<underline>.</underline> Through an efficient analytical method, we found 64 free oligosaccharides by MALDI-TOF MS and 110 free oligosaccharides from nano-LC/Chip Q-TOF MS. The validity of the quantitative data was confirmed by analysis using the UPLC-Triple Quadrupole MS with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Following this analytical method we have wide application various dairy streams, such as goat milk, unprocessed milk and low-fat bovine milk. In the dairy industry, this study can be applied as an analytical platform to composition profile and isomer specific glycan quantify free oligosaccharides using suitability Mass Spectrometry.</p><p><bold>178: SimianTools: A software suite for the interpretation of high throughput glycomics mass spectrometry data</bold></p><p><bold><underline>René Ranzinger</underline></bold><bold>, Ki Tae Myoung, Mindy Porterfield, Michael Tiemeyer and William S. York;</bold> Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA</p><p>rene@ccrc.uga.edu</p><p>Over the last decades the approaches for analyzing and identifying glycan structures using mass spectrometry have evolved from the study of single purified glycans towards the analysis of complex mixtures. However, most interpretation of the resulting datasets is still done manually. But comprehensive analysis of complex biological samples, producing several thousand mass spectra, consumes significant amount of time which consequently reduces the number of samples that can be analyzed. Therefore, development of high-throughput glycomics analysis software is crucial to efficiently tackle the large amount of data produced. SimGlycan® is a commercial software system which facilitates the interpretation of MS based glycomics data. However, the output of this product is not amenable to high-throughput studies designed to compare glycomics changes across many samples. Therefore we have developed a suite of programs that build on the SimGlycan® functionality and extend the usefulness of this tool.</p><p><italic>SimGlycanDatabaseBot</italic> is a program that enables the generation of customized SimGlycan® databases which can subsequently be used for the interpretation of experimental data. The large, publicly available glycan databases that contribute to the database utilized by SimGlycan® contain many redundancies and partial erroneous structures that can result in invalid annotations. Our software allows the user to create a database by importing own structures or by selecting a subset of GlycomeDB structures to be imported into the new database. <italic>SimianTools</italic> is a program we have developed to enhance the evaluation of results generated by SimGlycan®. After importing annotations generated by SimGlycan®, <italic>SimianTools</italic> generates graphical glycan representations and adds several statistical measures and specific identifiers to assist users in the evaluation of the total dataset. The program also supports side by side comparisons of results from several different analyses, making it a useful tool to find changes in glycan expression. All results can be exported in Excel format to allow post-processing of the information using third-party programs.</p><p><bold>Poster Session I-Structural &amp; Chemical Glycobiology and Glycomics</bold></p><p><bold>179: Cell-Selective Metabolic Glycan Labeling Based on Ligand-Targeted Liposomes</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Ran Xie</underline></bold><bold>, Senlian Hong, Lianshun Feng, Jie Rong, and Xing Chen;</bold> Department of Chemical Biology, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China</p><p>xingchen@gmail.com</p><p>Cell-surface glycans play key roles in mediating various molecular recognition events; aberrant glycosylation is implicated in disease progression. Therefore, probing the dynamic changes of glycan biosynthesis and structures is of great importance for augmenting our understanding of glycobiology and improving disease diagnosis and therapeutics. The metabolic glycan labeling was an appealing approach to incorporate specially designed carbohydrate analogs into the glycans, which enables the detection and imaging of the glycans in cells and living animals. However, one major bottleneck of this method is cell-type selectivity.</p><p>Herein, we present the cell-specific metabolic glycan labeling using ligand-targeted liposomes to deliver unnatural sugars to target cells in a cell-surface receptor dependent manner. In this strategy, sugar analogs are encapsulated in ligand-targeted liposomes. The ligands bind to specific cell-surface receptors that are only expressed or up-regulated in target cells, which mediate the intracellular delivery of azidosugars <italic>via</italic> endocytosis. The delivered azidosugars are metabolically incorporated into cell-surface glycans and detected or imaged using a bioorthogonal reaction. The application of this strategy includes the facile introduction of myriad alternative ligands, as well as the cell-specific or tissue-specific imaging and detection of glycosylation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Acknowledgements</p><p>We thank Prof. P.

Proteins were visualized by fluorescent dye SYPRO Ruby protein blot stain (Bio-Rad).</p><p>1. Both LS described and L-GC/GC-L interactions were adaptive to the test systems (soluble surroundings and solid phase used). L specificity as well as ranging GC depended on the choice of testing: agglutination (activation) or adhesion (stabilization), cell type (human or microbial), natural or artificial, heterogenic or homogenic. GC ranging depended on non-aggregated or aggregated L state. In the latter case EPO specificity to sialylated GC was appeared. 2. In case of PB molecular protein associates on the blot, at least three different layers (mask, protein and subprotein) were detected; LS mosaics within protein distributions were registered as strain and GC dependent. 3.

Herein we demonstrate that covalent coupling of antibiotics to cationic polymers (chitosan) can efficiently break down established biofilms and prevent biofilm formation, and as a result, make biofilm bacteria more susceptible to antibiotics. This conjugation is suitable to treat biofilms formed by a broad spectrum of gram-positive, but not gram-negative organisms. Mechanistic insight demonstrates chitosan conjugation renders antibiotics access into biofilms, thereby available to interact with biofilm bacteria. It appears that the amount of antibiotics, the specialized molecular size and highly positive charge in the conjugate are the key for maintenance of high anti-biofilm efficiency. Thus, this work represents an innovative strategy that antibiotics covalently linked to carbohydrate carriers can overcome antibiotic resistance to biofilms, and might provide a comprehensive solution to combat biofilms in industrial and medical settings.</p><p><bold>184: Metrology for the characterization of Biomolecular Interfaces for Diagnostic Devices (BioSurf)</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Véronique Blanchard</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Aryaline Kamalakumar</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Rudolf Tauber</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Wolfgang Unger</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold> and Paul Dietrich</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup>Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Pathobiochemistry, Charité Medical University, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353 Berlin, Germany, <sup>2</sup>BAM -Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und -prüfung, Unter den Eichen 44-46, 12203 Berlin, Germany</p><p>veronique.blanchard@charite.de</p><p><italic>In-vitro</italic> diagnostics are vital for the drive for cost effective healthcare, point of care monitoring and personalized medicine.

The <italic>aga</italic>G4 gene, cloned from the genome of the agarolytic <italic>Flammeovirga</italic> strain MY04, encodes a 503-amino acid protein AgaG4.

Heterologously expressed AgaG4 (rAgaG4) was determined to be an endo-type <italic>β</italic>-agarase. The protein degraded agarose into neoagarotetraose and neoagarohexaose at a final molar ratio of 1.5: 1. Neoagarooctaose was the smallest substrate for rAgaG4, whereas neoagarotetraose was the minimal degradation product. Removing the extra fragment from the GH module led to the inability of the mutant (rAgaG4-T57) to degrade neoagarooctaose, and the final degradation products of agarose by the truncated protein were neoagarotetraose, neoagarohexaose and neoagarooctaose at a final molar ratio of 2.7: 2.8: 1. The optimal temperature for agarose degradation also decreased to 40 °C for this mutant. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that tyrosine 276 within the extra fragment was a candidate active site residue for the enzymatic activity.

In terms of glycosylation, plants offer certain advantages compared to other organisms as the <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation pathway of plants can easily be modified towards the generation of homogenous human-type <italic>N</italic>-glycans and a typical mammalian mucin-type <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation pathway does not exists at all. In this project, we focus on the generation of customized <italic>O</italic>-glycan structures on recombinant proteins produced in plants. By transient expression of human erythropoietin fused to an IgG heavy chain fragment (EPO-Fc) in leaves of <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> plants together with mammalian glycosyltransferases we were able to produce the cancer-associated Tn, T and STn antigens as well as the di-siaylated core 1 structure on the single <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation site of EPO-Fc. For the generation of sialylated <italic>O</italic>-glycans, we introduced an entire mammalian biosynthetic pathway into <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, comprising the coordinated expression of the genes for (i) biosynthesis, (ii) activation, (iii) transport, and (iv) transfer of Neu5Ac to <italic>O</italic>-linked GalNAc. The formation of the different <italic>O</italic>-linked-glycans on EPO-Fc was confirmed by LC-ESI-MS. Notably, engineering of the <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation pathway did not interfere with the formation of <italic>N</italic>-linked glycans on EPO-Fc and by combining our approaches for customized <italic>N</italic>- and <italic>O</italic>-glycan engineering we were able to produce multi-sialylated EPO-Fc <italic>in planta</italic>. In summary, our studies demonstrate that <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> are amenable to <italic>N</italic>- and <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation engineering and are a valuable platform to produce glycoproteins with defined glycans for therapeutic use and structure-function studies.</p><p><underline>References:</underline></p><p>Castilho, A., Neumann, L., Gattinger, P., Strasser, R., Vorauer-Uhl, K., Sterovsky, T., Altmann, F., Steinkellner, H.

The effects of COS on growth, antibacterial properties and drought resistance of crops have been investigated. Recently, it has been demonstrated that COS has the effect on improving cold resistance in wheat. In test field, the wheat seedlings treated with COS suffered less damage after late spring coldness compared to the control. The samples of COS treament group in test field show a increased activity of multiple enzymes and the content of the total chlorophyll up to 10 %. In the lab research, wheat seedlings suffered zero degrees Celsius temperature stress, and the COS treament group show a lower growth in electric conductivity and MDA level to control, while total chlorophyll, water solutble sugar (WSS) and reducing sugar increased. But no significant changes in the concentration of proline among different treatments has been detected. By accumulating the secondary metabolites production, COS enhances the resistance ability of wheat seedlings to low temperature stress. The concentration of chitosan oligosaccharides at 75 mg/L show the most effective results. The obtained results prove that COS could promote photosynthesis and metabolism and provide safety for low temperature cold damage in crops. Moreover, COS is friendly to environment, and the crops treated with the COS have no side effects to human.</p><p><bold>191: Heterochitooligosaccharides: Enzymatic Preparation and Analysis by MALTI-TOF MS</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Yong Zhao</underline></bold><bold>, Jianping Zhang, Yuguang Du;</bold> Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Science, Dalian, 116023, China<italic>.</italic></p><p>zy1805@dicp.ac.cn</p><p>Oligosaccharides derived from chitin and chitosan exhibit various biological functions and have been attracting more and more attentions.

Qualitative and quantitative analysis of structurally diverse glycans of various glycoproteins can provide a basis for the investigations into their complex structure-function relationships. However, the glycan analysis is usually troubled with tedious sample processing steps prior to detection, including deproteination, desalting and removal of some other impurities, which result in a considerable sample loss and increase the difficulties of quantitative analysis. Herein we report a facile and versatile procedure for the specific and quantitative capture of reducing glycans from complex samples using sulfonyl hydrazine-functionalized polystyrene (SHPS) beads. This method allows efficient covalent conjugation of the aldehyde group of reducing glycans with the active sulfonyl hydrazide group of the SHPS beads under anhydrous conditions, resulting in the formation of a sulfonyl hydrazone bond. The unreactive non-glycan components in the samples, such as proteins, salts and some other impurities, can be completely removed in one step by washing the glycan-coated SHPS beads repeatedly. The regeneration of the reducing glycans can be performed <italic>via</italic> a mild hydrolysis of the sulfonyl hydrazone bond on the washed SHPS beads based on reversible hydrazide chemistry. The suggested procedure is compatible with all of the current techniques for the derivatization or detection of reducing glycans. We have obtained the fundamental data of this method, including the optimized reaction conditions, the glycan recovery ratio, the quantitative capability and the reproducibility. Additionally, the method was successfully applied to the glycan analysis of a series of complex biological samples, such as milk, human blood plasma and fetal bovine serum, demonstrating the good applicability of this novel procedure.</p><p><bold>193: Production of human saposin B with mannose-6-phosphate-type</bold><bold><italic>N</italic></bold><bold>-glycans in the methylotrophic yeast</bold><bold><italic>Ogataea minuta</italic></bold></p><p><bold>Toru Watanabe</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Ikuo Kawashima</bold><sup><bold>2,3</bold></sup><bold>, Yuki Takaoka</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Akihiko Kameyama</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Seiji Matsuda</bold><sup><bold>4</bold></sup><bold>, Hitoshi Sakuraba</bold><sup><bold>3,5</bold></sup><bold>and</bold><bold><underline>Yasunori Chiba</underline></bold><sup><bold>1,3</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup> Bioproduction Research Institute, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Ibaraki 305-8566, Japan; <sup>2</sup> Molecular Medicine Project, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo 156-8506, Japan; Departments of <sup>3</sup>Clinical Genetics and <sup>5</sup>Analytical Biochemistry, Meiji Pharmaceutical University, Tokyo 204-8588, Japan; <sup>4</sup>Division of Anatomy and Embryology, Department of Integrated Basic Medical Science, Ehime University School of Medicine, Ehime 791-0295, Japan.</p><p>y-chiba@aist.go.jp</p><p>Saposin B is a small and non-enzymatic proteinaceous cofactor that mediates degradation of sulfatide by arylsulfatase A and globotriaosylceramide by α-galactosidase A in lysosomes, where saposin B extracts the targeted sphingolipids from membranes and forms a soluble protein-lipid complex that is recognized by the enzymes.

Neu5Ac can most commonly be found on glycoproteins as a terminal sugar linked to β-galactose residues with either α-2,3- or α-2,6-linkage. Influenza viruses which bind Neu5Ac are probably the most studied pathogens due to the easy spread among humans causing a great number of hospitalizations and economic losses each year.

A colorimetric method based on an indigo-derivative formation has been established. Upon incubation of these substrates with an active neuraminidase an indolyl compound is released in the presence of β-galactosidase which quickly undergoes oxidation to form 5,5′-dibromo-4,4′-dichloro-indigo.

Issues with glycans have caused great financial, legal and regulatory problems for those companies who have not dealt effectively with their product’s glycosylation. Regulatory authorities are now tightening the requirements for biopharmaceutical companies to characterise, control and compare the glycosylation of their therapeutics. However, measurement and control of drug glycans can be difficult to achieve due to their complexity and heterogeneity. Consequently, changes in glycosylation are the major cause of batch variability for most glycoprotein therapeutics.</p><p>At Ludger we use a systematic approach to greatly reduce the risks of suffering from problems with glycosylation.

For example a wide range of complementary methods may be required for initial characterisation of glycosylation and identification of the GCQAs, but once they have been identified a simpler, faster method may be sufficient for quality control. To reduce regulatory problems it is crucial that reliable, robust, validated methods are used. We present here some straightforward strategies that drug developers and biomanufacturers can use for detection and quantification of common biopharmaceutical GCQAs such as sialylation, core fucosylation, antennary composition, lactosamine extensions, alpha-galactose and <italic>N</italic>-glycolyl-sialic acid.

However, analysis of cell surface glycans requires difficult and laborious processes for the isolation of plasma membrane from other cellular components. Especially, efficient removal of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi membranes are required since the high amount of high-mannose type glycans mainly located in ER has hampered the analysis of complex-type glycans on the cell surface. In the present study, we employed the simple adhesion-based method for the isolation of plasma membrane to analyze the <italic>N</italic>-glycans coating on the cell surface efficiently. The purity of the isolated plasma membranes was evaluated by fluorescence imaging using organelle-specific probes and optimal isolation conditions were established to minimize the contamination of ER and Golgi fractions. Cell surface <italic>N</italic>-glycans of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells obtained by this adhesion-based plasma membrane isolation method were analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight and high-performance liquid chromatography, which were compared to <italic>N</italic>-glycan profiles derived from the corresponding total cell fractions. Complex-type <italic>N</italic>-glycans capped with terminal sialic acids were observed as major populations in plasma membrane fractions whereas high-mannose type glycans mainly detected in the profiles of total cells. Moreover, when compared with widely used plasma membrane isolation methods based on ultracentrifugation or cell compartment kit, our adhesion-based method showed the highest efficiency to detect complex-type <italic>N</italic>-glycans with the smallest amount of high-mannose type glycans. All these results indicated that the adhesion-based plasma isolation provides easy, rapid and efficient preparation method for the analysis of cell surface glycans, which will contribute to elucidating the biological implications of their changes in cell-cell communication, differentiation and development.</p><p><bold>202: Enhancement of N-glycan Isomer Separation for Glycomic Characterization of Biotherapeutics and Biosimilars</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Min Kyung So</underline></bold><bold>, Myung Jin Oh, Serenus Hua and Hyun Joo An</bold><sup><bold>*</bold></sup><bold>;</bold> GraduateSchool of Analytical Science Technology, ChungnamNationalUniversity, Daejeon, Korea</p><p>hjan@cnu.ac.kr, Tel:82-42-821-8547,Fax:82-42-821-8541</p><p>Glycosylation is largely influenced by the quality, safety, and potency of biopharmaceutical products.</p><p>Isomer separation for proper characterization of glycans in biotherapeutics, such as EPO (erythropoietin) or mAbs is particularly important because different isomers lead to different biological functions. PGC (porous graphitized carbon) is widely employed for effective isomer-specific separation and enrichment of glycans based on polarity, size, and three-dimensional structure. PNGase F treatment releases N-glycans as aldehydes. However, PGC separates aldehyde sugars into α and β anomers, increasing the complexity of isomer-specific separations. Here, we aimed to optimize glycan reducing conditions to get rid of α and β anomers by reducing aldehydes to alditols using sodium borohydride. Glycans released from ribonuclease B (high–mannose type), IgG (complex type), fetuin (highly sialylated) and EPO were used to optimize reducing conditions for all glycan types. After releasing N-glycans using PNGase F, released glycans were purified by SPE (solid phase extraction) and reduced by sodium borohydride. Reduced glycans were purified and enriched by SPE. Reduced N-glycans were easily identified by MALDI/TOF MS due to the two Da mass increase resulting from conversion of the reducing terminal to an alditol. To obtain isomer-specific information, glycans were analyzed before and after reduction using chip-based PGC nano-LC/MS. We found less peaks in chromatograms after reducing N-glycans,suggesting the removal of α and β anomers. For example,in common N-glycan[Hex]<sub>5</sub>[HexNAc]<sub>4</sub>[Fuc][NeuAc]<sub>2</sub>, four chromatographic peaks were observed before reducing. After reduction, only two chromatographic peaks were observed, both at different retention times from the previous four peaks. Isomer-specific MS/MS also revealed different fragmentation patterns associated with each chromatographic peak. There are a number of biosynthetic explanations for the different isomers; for example, the fucose may be attached to either the N-glycan core or one of the antennae; or, the sialic acids may be either alpha-2,3 or alpha-2,6-linked.</p><p>We successfully applied and demonstrated the feasibility of our reducing method with various biopharmaceuticals products including EPO or mAbs.

The structural analysis of oligosaccharides attached on the surface of the glycoprotein is essential for understanding the vital process and developing efficacious drugs as well as antibodies. Exoglycosidase digestion coupled with matrix-assisted laser desportion/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS), all through the way, has been demonstrated to be an effective method for oligosaccharides sequencing. But the major disadvantage of the sequential digestion is that it requires the repeated isolation, which not only waste much more time and efforts, but the incubation of enzyme and oligosaccharides mixture takes a dozen hours.</p><p>To address the circumstances mentioned above, we report a novel method for oligosaccharides sequencing, which combines enzymatic digestion with microfluidic devices. The mixture of digestion reaction is compartmentalized into aqueous picoliter-volume droplets, dispersed in inert carrier oil. Each droplet is an enzymatic reaction vesssel with highly efficient hydrolysis (~37 °C) due to rapid mixing and enhanced mass transfer within microdroplets, as well as high uniformity of droplet size and temperature. After enzymatic digestion, the products are recovered and characterized by matrix-assisted laser desportion/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). By performing microfluidic droplet-based reaction, the time required for glycosidase digestion could be shortened to several hours, which is very important for oligosaccharides sequencing and analysis.</p><p><bold>205: Inactivation of the gene</bold><bold><italic>rmla</italic></bold><bold>remodels</bold><bold><italic>Burkholderia kururiensis</italic></bold><bold>exopolyssacharide reducing ability to promote rice growth and colonization</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Letícia Hallack, F</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>; Priscila A.V.

Anti-I and anti-i recognize branched and linear sequences of poly-<italic>N</italic>-acetyllactosamine type, respectively, and they are unique reagents for detection of un-substituted forms of these sequences. This presentation will be concerned with neoglycolipid (NGL)-based arrays to define more precisely the sizes of the I and i antigens and apply these antibodies as immuno-sequencing reagents.</p><p>In the original studies of Ten Feizi and colleagues, the specificities of several anti-I and -i antibodies were elucidated in a succession of analyses that in essence involved <italic>inhibition of binding,</italic> using as inhibitors structurally-defined synthetic or natural oligosaccharides, and also glycolipids. Methodologies included quantitative inhibition of precipitation or haemagglutination, and inhibition of binding in radioimmunoassays. These antibodies proved to be invaluable in monitoring changes that occur in the branching patterns of carbohydrates in the course of embryonic development, cell differentiation and malignancy. Among the antibodies, anti-I Ma has been studied in greatest detail. On the branched poly-<italic>N</italic>-acetyllactosamine chains, it recognizes the trisaccharide domain Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-6R (where R is Gal or GalNAc). Anti-I Ma is the prototype of one group of anti-I. A second group recognize mainly the Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-3 domains of branched chains, with individual antibodies differing in their additional requirements for all or part of the Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-6 branch.

To detect such changes in glycosylation, all of the currently available glycomics techniques (<italic>e.g.</italic>, mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography, capillary electrophoresis) require at least 3 h of sample preparation before analysis. Alternative technologies based on a lectin–antibody sandwich assay had been proposed for detection of proteins bearing disease-specific glyco-alterations. Most of them detect the changes in fucosylation of <italic>N</italic>-linked glycans, which are well-known to be associated with liver disease. However, the fucose-binding lectins force us the essential of preliminary enrichment of the target protein, and thus are inappropriate in practical use for serological diagnosis. In this study, we present a new methodology with two technical advances to overcome these problems in glycodiagnosis associated with clinical implementation: (1) We adopted a microarray-based method with a unique subtraction process for easy selection of the most robust lectin. In fact, the method efficiently led us to WFA to establish the direct measurement system. (2) We selected M2BP as a potential glycobiomarker that shows a fibrosis-related glyco-alteration which we proved for the first time. The diagnostic utility of M2BP is greatly owing to a favorable density and orientation of the disease-related glycan on the homomultimer resembling a “sweet-doughnut”. These characteristic structures contribute to a major increase of the avidity of M2BP for the plated WFA in ELISA. The resulting glycan–lectin interaction (<italic>i.e.</italic>, WFA-M2BP interaction), which is remarkably strong and specific, made it possible to develop the rapid (17 min) and highly sensitive assay and realized “on-site diagnosis”. This unique methodological approach is applicable to develop other glycodiagnostic tools, thus it will revolutionize the use of glycodiagnosis in clinical medicine and potentially provide a framework for the development of a new generation of biomarker assays.</p><p>This work was supported by a grant from New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) of Japan.</p><p><bold>208: Molecular cloning and functional expression of lectin from</bold><bold><italic>Datura stramonium</italic></bold><bold>seeds</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Suguru Oguri</underline></bold><bold>, Kaori Tanaka, Keisuke Nishimoto, Takahiro Murakami, Hikaru Sakamoto;</bold><sup>1</sup>Department of Bioproduction, Fuculty of Bioindustry, Tokyo University of Agriculture, Hokkaido, 099-2422, Japan</p><p>S-oguri@bioindustry.nodai.ac.jp</p><p>The <italic>Datura stramonium</italic> agglutinin (DSA) is a chitin-binding lectin purified from Jimson weed (<italic>D. stramonium</italic>) seeds. DSA binds selectively to the branch structure on complex-type N-glycans containing N-acetyllactosaminyl structures. It has been used to analyze structural changes of sugar chains during oncogenesis. Thus, DSA has been used for an essential tool in glycobiology. DSA is a dimer composed of two subunits linked by disulfide bonds. It was reported that an affinity-purified DSA fraction was a mixture of three different isolectins which arise from AA, AB and BB combination of the both subunits. The A- and B-subunits had similar but not identical <italic>M</italic>r values (32,000 and 28,000, respectively). At present, cDNA of DSA had not been isolated and its molecular structure remains unknown. In order to isolate the DSA gene, we analyzed the N-terminal and the internal amino acid sequences from the isolated B subunit of DSA (DSA-B). Based on the sequences, the degenarate primers were designed and RACE was conducted. The isolated lectin cDNA (<italic>dsa-b</italic>) contained an open reading frame encoding 279 amino acids, including peptides that were sequenced. The deduced sequence consisted of two distinct motifs: (1) a Cys-rich carbohydrate binding domain composed of four conserved chitin-binding domains; (2) an extensin-like domain of 37 residues containing 4 SerPro4-6 motifs inserted between the second and third chitin-binding domains. Although each chitin-binding domain contained 8 Cys residues at the conserved positions, only the second chitin-binding domain contained an extra Cys residue, which may participate in dimerization through an intra-disulfide bridge formation. The molecular mass of the native DSA-B was determined as 68,821 Da by MALDI-TOF MS. The molecular mass of the isolated subunit of DSA-B was 37,593 Da and that of the deglycosylated form was 26,320 Da, as pyridilethylated derivatives. This correlated with the estimated molecular weight of the deduced sequence. Transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants overexpressing <italic>dsa-b</italic> possessed hemagglutinating activity. The recombinant DSA was produced as a homo-dimeric glycoprotein with similar molecular mass compared to native one. Moreover, N-terminus of the purified recombinant DSA was identical with that of the native DSA-B. These findings confirmed that the cDNA encoded DSA-B.</p><p><bold>209: Unique gangliosides synthesis by sialyltransferases from marine bacteria</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Hisashi Kamimiya</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Yusuke Suzuki</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Anila Mathew</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Shinobu Watarai</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Toshiki Mine</bold><sup><bold>3</bold></sup><bold>, Takeshi Yamamoto</bold><sup><bold>3</bold></sup><bold>, and Yasunori Kushi</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup>College of Science and Technology, Nihon University, Tokyo, 101-8308, Japan; <sup>2</sup>Graduate school of Life and Environmental Science, Osaka Prefecture University, Osaka, 599-8531, Japan; <sup>3</sup>Product Science Division, Japan Tobacco Inc., Kanagawa, 227-8512, Japan.</p><p>h.kamimiya@gmail.com</p><p>Sialyltransferases (ST) are enzymes that transfer <italic>N</italic>-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc) from the common donor substrate cytidine 5′-monophospho-NeuAc (CMP-NeuAc), to acceptor substrates. Many STs and the genes encoding them have been obtained from various sources including mammalian, bacterial and viral sources. Recently, we had discovered new bacterial STs from marine bacteria belonging to genus <italic>Photobacterium</italic> and closely related to genus <italic>Vibrio</italic>, both of which are gram-negative bacteria. One of the authors have previously cloned these STs and enzymatically characterized them using fluorescence-labeled oligosaccharides, and they were found to be β-galactoside α2-3 or α2-6ST, which catalyzes the incorporation of NeuAc from CMP-NeuAc into the terminal galactose residue in carbohydrate chain at position 3 or 6.</p><p>To further characterize these STs, we tested ganglioside synthesis by STs using various glycosphongolipids (GSLs) as substrates. Bacterial STs showed affinity to neolacto- and lacto-series GSLs, particularly in neolactotetraosyl ceramide (PG, nLc<sub>4</sub>Cer, Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4Glcβ1-1’Cer). Gangliosides synthesized from nLc<sub>4</sub>Cer by α2-3 and α2-6ST were structurally characterized by several analytical and immunological methods, and they were identified as IV<sup>3</sup>αNeuAc-nLc<sub>4</sub>Cer (S2-3PG) and IV<sup>6</sup>αNeuAc-nLc<sub>4</sub>Cer (S2-6PG). In addition, these STs also showed affinity to asialoganglio-series GSLs. As a results, GA1 (Galβ1-3GalNAcβ1-4Galβ1-4Glcβ1-1’Cer) abd GA2 (GalNAcβ1-4Galβ1-4Glcβ1-1’Cer) were found to be good substrates for these STs. Ganglioside generated by the catalytic activity of α2-3ST was identified as GM1b (NeuAcα2-3Galβ1-3GalNAcβ1-4Galβ1-4Glcβ1-1’Cer). On the other hand, when enzyme reaction by α2-6STs were performed using substrates GA1 and GA2, very unique gangliosides were generated. By using several analytical procedures, the generated gansgliosides were identified as NeuAcα2-6GA2 (S2-6GA2) and NeuAcα2-6GA1 (S2-6GA1), respectively. Furthermore, the above synthesized ganglioside, S2-6GA2, showed binding activity to the influenza A virus {A/panama/2007/99 (H3N2)} at a similar level to purified S2-3PG and S2-6PG from mammalian sources. These results suggest that bacterial STs have unique features, including substrate specificities restricted not only to neolacto-series, but also to asialoganglio-series GSLs, and catalytic potentials for unique ganglioside synthesis. This demonstrates that effective <italic>in vitro</italic> ganglioside synthesis could be a valuable tool for selectively synthesizing NeuAc modifications.

Compelling evidence indicates that aggregates of amyloid-beta (A<italic>β</italic>) peptides plays a central role in the in the development of AD due to a cascade of harmful event that cause cellular dysfunction and neuronal death. Therefore, inhibition A<italic>β</italic> accumulation is thought to be an effective strategy for the prevention and/or treatment of patients with AD. Recent studies reported that several polysaccharides from Chinese medicinal herbs had a neuroprotective effect against the toxicity of A<italic>β</italic> peptides, such as these from <italic>Antrodia camphorate</italic>, <italic>Nerium indicum</italic> and <italic>Lycium barbarum</italic>. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying their bioactivity. In the present study, a homogeneous polysaccharide, named as LJW0F2, with an average molecular weight of 37.1 kDa was purified from <italic>Lonicera japonica Thunb</italic>, by anion-exchange chromatography and gel permeation chromatography. Using monosaccharides composition analysis, methylation analysis, IR and NMR spectroscopy, LJW0F2 was elucidated to an alpha-D-(1→4)-glucan with an alpha-(1→4) linked branch attached to C-6 position. Its inhibitory effect on A<italic>β</italic>42 aggregation was monitored by fluorescence spectroscopic analysis with thioflavin T (ThT) and the morphological changes were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results showed that LJW0F2 could significantly inhibit A<italic>β</italic>42 aggregation in a dose-dependent way, where LJW0F2 inhibited more than 90 % of aggregation at the concentration of 100 μg/ml. AFM showed that regular fibril aggregates formed by A<italic>β</italic>42 significantly decreased in the presence of polysaccharide LJW0F2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing that the exogenous plant-derived polysaccharides can directly target A<italic>β</italic>42 and block A<italic>β</italic>42 aggregation, which maybe a potentially therapeutic agent for Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p><bold>216: Structural Characterization of polysaccharides from</bold><bold><italic>Lonicera japonica Thunb</italic></bold><bold>and their protective effects on islet β cells</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Peipei Wang</underline></bold><bold>, Lina Lu, Qin Liu, Kan Ding*</bold><bold>;</bold> (Glycochemistry &amp; Glycobiology Lab, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai,201203,China)</p><p>kding@mail.shcnc.ac.cn</p><p>Abstract: Flos lonicerae is the flower of <italic>Lonicera japonica Thunb</italic> and has been commonly used as traditional Chinese medicine with heat-clearing and detoxifying effects. Polysaccharides isolated from those flowers of <italic>Lonicera japonica Thunb</italic> have been shown many biological activities, <italic>e.g., antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory.</italic> However, only few polysaccharides with those bioactivities were homogeneous and their structure activity relationships (SAR) were still unknown. To further exploit and utilize of this medicinal herb, the fine structure of polysaccharides from those flowers of <italic>Lonicera japonica Thunb</italic> will be necessarily investigated. In the present study, two homogeneous polysaccharides, LJW2F1 and LJW2F2 were isolated from those flowers of <italic>Lonicera japonica Thunb</italic> with hot water extraction and further purified by ion-exchange chromatography and gel permeation chromatography, respectively. Using monosaccharide analysis, methylation analysis, IR and NMR spectroscopy, their structures were evaluated. LJW2F1 had a very complex structure, containing galactose, rhamnose, arabinose, xylose, glucose and galacturonic acid. LJW2F2 was elucidated to be a linear poly-(α1→4)-a-D-galactopyranosyluronic acid with an average molecular weight of 7.2 kDa. Bioactivity test indicated that the acid pectic polysaccharides, LJW2F1 and LJW2F2 could remarkably protect islet β cell-line INS-1 from high glucose induced cell apoptosis. Furthermore, the protective effect of LJW2F2 was more significant than that of LJW2F1. These results suggested that the content of uronic acid had significant effect on this bioactivity of polysaccharides. This is the first report of the fine structure of polysaccharides from those flowers of <italic>Lonicera japonica Thunb.</italic> However, their protective mechanism of INS-1 cells needs further study.</p><p><bold>217: Preparation and Antitumor Activity of Sulfated Polysaccharides</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Qun Dong</underline></bold><bold>, Xinyan Ni, Kan Ding</bold><bold>;</bold> Glycochemistry and Glycobiology Lab, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 201203, China</p><p>qdong@mail.shcnc.ac.cn (Q.

They can be obtained either by isolation from biological tissues or by chemical modification of non-sulfated polysaccharides. Sulfated polysaccharides have been reported to show different biological activities, such as antiviral, antitumor, anti-angiogenesis, immune activation/inhibition, and antioxidation, <italic>etc.</italic> Although the antitumor activity of some sulfated polysaccharides has been reported in different pharmacological models, the mechanism and the structure-activity relation remains largely unknown. Sulfated polysaccharides can inhibit tumor growth <italic>via</italic> several different pathways: directly inducing apoptosis of cancer cells, inhibiting tumor angiogenesis, or activating immune response against cancer. In this study we prepared different types of sulfated polysaccharides by chemical modification of non-sulfated polysaccharides, including Aga-S from agarose, Dex-S from dextran, ALGH-S from alginate, CFAA2-S from galactomannan, CFBB2-S from homogalacturonan, CRAA2-S from amylose, and CRAB1-2-S from amylopectin. Then their antitumor activity was examined against different cancer cell lines, and their immunomodulatory activity was also tested on NF-κB activation/inhibition experiments. The results showed that sulfated amylopectin exhibited a strong NF-κB activation, while sulfated alginate exhibited NF-κB inhibition. According to <italic>in vitro</italic> antitumor tests, the sulfated polysaccharides showed different degree of inhibition to different cancer cells. For PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells, significant inhibition activity was observed in the order: CFAA3-S&gt;CFBB2-S &gt;CRAA2-S &gt;ALGH-S&gt; Dex-S. Aga-S showed no inhibition on PANC-1 but it can inhibit other pancreatic cancer cell lines, such as BXPC-3 and ASPC-1. All these sulfated polysaccharides showed no significant inhibition against proliferation of SMMC 7721 liver cancer cells. The results indicated that the immunomodulatory and antitumor activity of sulfated polysaccharides are strongly dependent on the types and structure of polysaccharides,while the action of the polysaccharides showed cell specificity response. Further study is still urgently needed for understanding the complex relationship between the structure of sulfated polysaccharides and their antitumor activity.</p><p><bold>218: Immunological Effects and Chemical Structure of</bold><bold><italic>Antrodia cinnamomea</italic></bold><bold>Polysaccharides</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Feng-Ling Yang</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Shih-Hao Zhan</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Yu-Liang Yang</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Kuo-Feng Hua</bold><sup><bold>3</bold></sup><bold>, Jung-Feng Hsieh</bold><sup><bold>4</bold></sup><bold>, and Shih-Hsiung Wu</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup>Institute of Biological Chemistry, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; <sup>2</sup>Agricultural Biotechnology Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; <sup>3</sup> Department of Biotechnology and Animal Science, National Ilan University, Ilan, Taiwan; <sup>4</sup> Department of Food Science, Fu Jen Catholic University, Taipei, Taiwan</p><p>yang111@gate.sinica.edu.tw</p><p><italic>Antrodia cinnamomea</italic> is used as traditional Chinese medicine.

Two homogenous water-soluble polysaccharides (TPSR4-2B and TPSR4-2C) were obtained from the recycled residue of green tea. Their average molecular weights were estimated to be 41 kDa and 28 kDa, respectively. A combination of composition, methylation and configuration analysis, as well as NMR spectroscopy, indicated that both TPSR4-2B and TPSR4-2C were poly-(1-4)-α-D-galactopyranosyluronic acid in which 30.5 ± 0.3 % and 28.3 ± 0.5 % of uronic acid existed as methyl ester respectively.

The anti-complementary assay showed that Sul-R4-2B and Sul-R4-2C demonstrated a stronger inhibitory effect (CH<sub>50</sub>: 5.4 ± 0.6 μg/mL for Sul-R4-2B; CH<sub>50</sub>: 5.2 ± 0.4 μg/mL for Sul-R4-2C) on the complement activation through the classic pathway, compared to that of heparin (CH<sub>50</sub>: 8.9 ± 0.3 μg/mL). In contrast, native TPSR4-2B and TPSR4-2C had no such effects. These results suggested that the sulfated derivatives of homogalacturonans from green tea residue might be considered as a promising candidate of an anti-complement agent in the treatment of many diseases with characteristic of excessive activation of complement system, such as system lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.</p><p><bold>220: Top-down synthesis of a library of high mannose-type glycans: preparation of various high mannose glycans from a tetradeca-saccharide precursor by glycosidase digestions</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Akira Seko</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Ichiro Matsuo</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Yoichi Takeda</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Akihiko Koizumi</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Masakazu Hachisu</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Maki Takatani</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Junichi Aikawa</bold><sup><bold>3</bold></sup><bold>, and Yukishige Ito</bold><sup><bold>1,3</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup>JST, ERATO, Wako, 351-0198, Japan; <sup>2</sup>Gunma Univ, Kiryu, 376-8515, Japan; <sup>3</sup>RIKEN ASI, Wako, 351-0198, Japan</p><p>seko@glt.jst.go.jp</p><p>High mannose-type glycans play important roles in assisting in proper folding of nascent glycoproteins in the ER quality control (QC) system. The glycans serve as a signal reflecting folding states of attached polypeptide chains. To clarify molecular interaction of the glycans with various QC-associated proteins, it is necessary to provide a series of structurally definite high mannose-type glycans. Here we show top-down synthesis of a library of high mannose-type glycans, which features trimming of the common precursor, a synthetic tetradeca-saccharide precursor by various glycosidase digestions.</p><p>This method is based on chemical synthesis of a tetradeca-saccharide precursor that consists of Man9-oligosaccharide, capped with sugar residues at the three non-reducing termini, and fluorescent BODIPY residue at the reducing terminal. The capping sugars were chosen to be α1,3-linked Glc, β1,4-linked Gal, and β1,6-linked GlcNAc at the termini of A-, B-, and C-arms, respectively. These capping enabled selective cleavage of five α1,2-linked Man residues by <italic>Aspergillus saitoi</italic> α1,2-mannosidase (α1,2-Man’ase). In order to cleave these capping selectively, we examined several glycosidases, and found that the α-Glc, β-Gal, and β-GlcNAc capping were selectively removed by rat liver α-glucosidase-II (G-II), <italic>Aspergillus oryzae</italic> β-galactosidase (β-Gal’ase), and jack bean β-<italic>N</italic>-acetylhexosaminidase (β-HexNAc’ase), respectively. For the trimming of single α1,2-linked Man on the A-arm, which contains two sequential α1,2-linked Man residues, we used Golgi-resident, <italic>Branchiostoma floridae</italic> endo-α-mannosidase (endoMan’ase) under the presence of α1,3-linked Glc residue. This enzyme could be produced in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells in a high yield. Simply by chenging the order of glycosidase digestions, we could separately prepare glycan isoforms. For example, M8A was prepared by the sequential digestions of β-HexNAc’ase, endoMan’ase, and β-Gal’ase, while M8B was prepared by those of β-Gal’ase, α1,2-Man’ase, β-HexNAc’ase, and G-II. So far, thirty-one high mannose-type glycans have been successfully prepared from the common precursor. The library of high mannose-type glycans will be applied to various studies for binding specificities of lectins and substrate specificities of glycosidases and glycosyltransferases involved in the QC system in the ER.</p><p><bold>221: The Presence of Immunoglobulin Specific for N-linked Glycan without Terminal Galactose in Rheumatoid Arthritis</bold></p><p><bold>Xiukun Xu,Yanping Wang,</bold><bold><underline>Yunsen Li</underline></bold><bold>*;</bold> Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Tumor Immunology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, Institutes of Biology and Medical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, China</p><p>yunsenli@suda.edu.cn</p><p>Previous studies have reported that altered N-glycosylation occurs in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), particularly the reduction in galactose residues in IgG. To further observe the N-glycans in RA disease, we showed profiling approaches to N-glycan of total immunoglobulin from RA and normal serum, employing electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Through comparing the N-glycans from 25 RA patients and 21 healthy controls, we identified about 55 N-glycans and found that the most significant change seen in RA was decreased levels of mono-galactosyl bi-antennary N-glycans, which is also consistent with the previous reports focusing on the N-glycan in IgG. For instance, many articles have proved many anti-antibodies specific for IgG0 are presence in RA serum, so our hypothesis was that there may exist some antibodies or immonogloblins that are specific for redundant N-glycans without terminal galactose. Therefore, high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) with both ultraviolet and fluorescence detector was used for further detection of co-culture of total immunoglobulin and standard N-glycans with PA labeled, and our result confirmed our former hypothesis. We speculate that our preliminary results will provide a promising method both for studies of RA mechanisms and diagnosis.</p><p><bold>222: Preparation and characterization of guluronic acid oligosaccharides degraded by a rapid microwave irradiation method</bold></p><p><bold>Ting Hu</bold><sup><bold>a</bold></sup><bold>, Chunxia Li</bold><sup><bold>a,b</bold></sup><bold>,</bold><bold><underline>Xia Zhao</underline></bold><sup><bold>a,b*</bold></sup><bold>, Guangsheng Li</bold><sup><bold>a</bold></sup><bold>, Guangli Yu</bold><sup><bold>a,b</bold></sup><bold>, Huashi Guan</bold><sup><bold>a,b</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>a</sup>Key Laboratory of Marine Drugs, Ministry of Education, School of Medicine and Pharmacy, Ocean University of China, Qingdao 266003, China <sup>b</sup>Shandong Provincial Key laboratory of Glycoscience and Glycoengineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao 266003, China</p><p>Guluronic acid oligosaccharides (GOS) with degree of polymerization (DP) ranging from 1 to 10 were prepared by a rapid and non-acidic microwave degradation method.

The combination of homogalacturonan (HG) and RG-I-rich pectins exerted stronger effect than either HG- or RG-I-rich pectin alone. Further studies revealed that the effects of HG- and RG-I-rich pectins were dependent on pretreatment of the cells using pectin samples.

The experimental results that L-929 cells expressed little galectin-3 (Gal-3) and that lactose, an inhibitor of Gal-3, did not block the activities of HG- and RG-I-rich pectins, implicated that cell migration inhibited by pectin did not correlate to Gal-3.</p><p><bold>227: Anti-HRP epitopes in lower eukaryotes</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Stefan Mereiter</underline></bold><bold>, Alba Hykollari, Birgit Schiller, Katharina Paschinger, Shi Yan and Iain Wilson;</bold> Department of Chemistry, University of Natural Sciences and Applied Life Sciences, A-1190 Vienna, Austria</p><p>stefan.mereiter@boku.ac.at</p><p>HRP (horseradish peroxidase) is a well characterized plant protein carrying N-glycans with beta-1-2-xylose and alpha-1-3-fucose on its core region. Those Anti-HRP antibodies which are specifically binding this N-glycan epitope are also cross-reacting to similar structures and are therefore a standard tool for analyzing N-glycans in other organisms. It already has been shown that anti-HRP is capable of cross-reacting with neurons in Drosophila melanogaster due to its core-fucose. We have now shown that HRP-epitopes are as present in other lower eukaryotes, due to the presence of either a beta-1-2-xylose, in the case of the unicellular parasites Acanthamoeba and Trichomonas, or an alpha-1-3-fucose in the N-glycan core region as in Dictyostelium discoideum and Caenorhabditis elegans. A mix of Western blotting, HPLC and mass spectrometric approaches have been used to define the presence of these glycan modifications in these organisms.

Xyloglucan structure consists of a backbone of β(1,4)-linked <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranosyl residues with frequent and regularly situated side-chains. Nearly twenty side-chain structures with lengths up to four glycosyl residues have been described to date. The biological and functional significance of this diversity and complexity is largely unknown. The physical and chemical recalcitrance of plant cell walls creates additional hurdles for the extraction and analysis of its components. Consequently, xyloglucan analysis poses many challenges that are common in the field of glycobiology, including the generation and purification of homogenous preparations for functional assays from complex matrices. Well-defined oligosaccharides are indispensable tools for functional analyses and would greatly advance the analytical possibilities in xyloglucan analysis, and in understanding many aspects of xyloglucan biology, including synthesis, turnover, localization, and interactions with other components in the plant cell wall. We have undertaken a task to generate, mostly by enzymatic hydrolyses, a large library of xyloglucan-derived oligosaccharides that can be used as standards in various chromatographic and mass spectrometry applications as well as in validating substrate specificities of xyloglucan-active glycosyl transferases and glycosyl hydrolases, and defining the epitopes recognized by xyloglucan-binding monoclonal antibodies. We show that it is possible to generate diverse library of oligosaccharides and to purify them in preparative amounts for analytical purposes. We then demonstrate several analytical applications for this oligosaccharides collection. First, we utilize the oligosaccharides to analyze the epitopes of nearly thirty monoclonal antibodies that were generated against xyloglucan polymers from various plant sources. The characterized monoclonal antibodies show clear differences in their binding specificities towards the oligosaccharides and thus are useful probes of xyloglucan structure in various experimental applications, including glycome profiling and <italic>in muro</italic> immunofluorescence experiments. Additionally, we utilize the oligosaccharides to explore mass spectrometric, chromatographic and spectrophotometric methods as quantitative tools in oligosaccharide analysis.</p><p><bold>229: Changes in content, density and localization of gangliosides in obstructive cholestatic rat livers and the influence of activity of heme oxygenase-1</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Smid Vaclav</underline></bold><sup><bold>1,2</bold></sup><bold>, Petr Tomas</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Vitek Libor</bold><sup><bold>1,2</bold></sup><bold>, Smid Frantisek</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Muchova Lucie</bold><sup>1</sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup>Institute of Medical Biochemistry and Laboratory Diagnostics, <sup>2</sup>4th Department of Internal Medicine – Gastroenterology and Hepatology, General Teaching Hospital and First Medical Faculty, Charles University in Prague, 121 08, Czech Republic</p><p>venca.smid@gmail.com</p><p>Accumulation of bile acids in cholestasis is linked to liver alternation through mechanisms comprising oxidative stress, bile induced apoptosis as well as inflammatory cell-mediated liver cell necrosis.

In Singapore, it is the 4th most frequently occurring and third most fatal cancers in males. If untreated, most patients do not survive beyond 6 months after diagnosis. Surgery is the only treatment that allows for a reasonable survival beyond 5 years. However, most liver cancers are diagnosed at advanced stages when it is usually too late for surgery. As a consequence of late detection, the general prognosis for liver cancers is poor. Glycosylation changes are a universal feature of malignant transformation and tumor progression, possible readouts for changes in the expression of genes during oncogenic transformation and progression which may underlie alterations of intracellular signaling occurring as cells gradually lost control in proliferation, adhesion and apoptosis.</p><p>A genetically knockout mice were generated and found to be more prone to develop chemically induced HCC. In this study, we profiled the N- and O-linked glycans extracted from the liver tissue from this knockout mouse and compared it to that of the wild type mouse so as to help understand the glycosylation changes occurring in HCC which may lead to better appreciation of the onset of HCC. For that, we have developed in the institute a glycomics platform which allows us to do glycan profiling starting from tissue. With optimized sample preparation protocol and MALDI-TOF MS analysis, we are able to profile the N-linked glycan structures of the liver tissues from both wild type and genetically knock-out mice. Some of the ions identified correspond to possible glycan structures not reported in previous literature. The more abundant species among them were subjected to tandem MS analysis for further structural elucidation while attempts for comparative liver glycomics are being made to pinpoint salient differences in the glycan profiles between the wide-type and knock-out mice.</p><p><bold>231: Betel nut lectin: quantum dot nanoconjugate in the identification of serum glycoproteins</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Urmimala Chatterjee</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Partha P Bose</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Shuvendu Singha</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Gautam Mondal</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Bishnu P Chattejee</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>*;</bold><sup>1</sup>Department of Natural Sciences, West Bengal University of Technology, Salt Lake, Kolkata-700064, India <sup>2</sup>Department of Biotechnology, National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Hajipur, Bihar-844101, India</p><p>*cbishnup@gmail.com</p><p>Betel nut (<italic>Areca catechu</italic>) extract was found to contain two lectins of different carbohydrate specificities.

Anti-oligo/polysialic acid antibodies have DP-dependent antigenic specificity, and such antibodies are widely utilized in biological studies for the detection and differentiation of oligo/polysialic acids. Although a murine monoclonal antibody mAb735 has a preference for long polysialic acid, the atomic details of polysialic acid recognition mechanism of this antibody still remain unclear. Here we report the crystal structure of mAb735 single chain Fv fragment (scFv735) in complex with octa-sialic acid at 1.8 Å resolution. In the asymmetric unit, two scFv735 molecules cooperatively grab one octa-sialic acid. In each complex, all the complementarity determining regions except for L3 interact with three sequential sialic acid residues out of eight residues. A striking feature is that ordered water molecules bridge the gap between antibody and ligand. The dihedral angles of the three sialic acid residues interacting with scFv735 are not uniform, indicating that mAb735 does not favor the previously suggested helical conformation. Importantly, both reducing and non-reducing ends of the bound ligand are completely exposed to solvent. We suggest that mAb735 gains its apparent high affinity for long polysialic acid chain by recognizing every three sialic acid unit within it.</p><p><bold>235: Synthesis of</bold><bold><italic>Mycobacterium</italic></bold><bold>Peptidoglycan (PGN) Fragments Containing</bold><bold><italic>N</italic></bold><bold>-Glycolylmuramic Acid</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Qianqian Wang</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Fukase Matsuo</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Yukari Fujimoto</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Koichi Fukase</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup>Graduate School of Science, Osaka University, Osaka, 560-0043, Japan;</p><p>yukarif@chem.sci.osaka-u.ac.jp</p><p>Peptidoglycan (PGN) is a glycoconjugate that constitutes bacterial cell wall, which has been known as a potent immunopotentiator and an adjuvant for antibody production.

Previously, we have established a viable workflow for sulfoglycomic analysis based on optimized sample preparation, detection by MALDI-MS mapping and MS/MS sequencing. To progress further, nano-ESI-MS and MS/MS are now shown to afford a more comprehensive MS/MS analyses and detection of multiply sulfated glycans without losing the extra sulfates during MS ionization. A series of diagnostic fragment ions for precise location of sulfates was identified based on either MALDI-MS/MS or HCD-MS/MS analysis of a panel of chemically synthesized sulfo-glycan standards. In recent applications to peripheral lymph nodes from different sulfotransferase knockout mice, we have successfully identified the location of sulfate, their carriers, as well as discovering novel sulfated glycotopes. These findings attest to the practical utility of our sulfoglycomic approach, which will be presented here.</p><p><bold>239: Total cellular glycomics: a glycomic approach to describe cells and streamline the discovery of cellular biomarkers</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Yasuro Shinohara</underline></bold><bold>, Naoki Fujitani, Jun-ichi Furukawa, Jinhua Piao</bold><bold>;</bold> Graduate School of Advanced Life Science and Frontier Research Center for Post-Genome Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 001-0021, Japan</p><p>yshinohara@sci.hokudai.ac.jp</p><p>Cell surfaces are coated with a variety of intricately arranged glycoconjugates such as glycoproteins, glycolipids and proteoglycans. Therefore, elucidating the expression profiles of glycans derived from various classes of glycoconjugates is important to understand cellular glycosylation homeostasis and systems biology glycomics. We have established a series of methodologies for the analysis of N- and O-glycans derived from glycoproteins, glycosphingolipid glycans, glycosaminoglycans, and free oligosaccharides using mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography. Procedures to analyze each class of glycan were then combined to visualize the entire complement of sugars in the cellular glycome, so-called total cellular glycomics. As an example, analysis of total cellular glycomics analysis of the wild-type CHO cell line and its lectin-resistant mutant (Lec 1 and Lec 8) was performed. Perturbation of a glycan synthetic pathway(s) can cause unexpected glycan expression profiles, which may be difficult to predict without the use of glycomics. When this technique was applied to various human cells including embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells and various cells derived from normal and carcinoma cells, total cellular glycomes were found to be highly cell type-specific, demonstrating their utility as unique cellular descriptors. Total cellular glycomics can streamline the discovery of cellular biomarkers as demonstrated by the identification of known pluripotency biomarkers as well as novel candidate biomarkers.</p><p>References</p><p>1.

For many TCSs the stimulus is a ligand of unknown chemical nature. Pseudomonas aeruginosa utilizes the closely related RetS and LadS sensor kinases to switch between acute and chronicinfections. These sensor proteins antagonistically mediate biofilm formation through communication with a central TCS, GacA/GacS. Recently, it was shown that RetS modulates the GacS sensor activity by forming RetS/GacS heterodimers. LadS and RetS are hybrid sensors with a signalling domain consisting of a 7-transmembrane (7TMR) region and a periplasmic sensor domain (diverse intracellular signalling module extracellular 2, DISMED2). The 2.65 Å resolution crystal structure of RetS DISMED2, called RetSp, reveals three distinct oligomeric states capable of domain swapping. The RetSp structure also displays two putative ligand binding sites. One is equivalent to the analogous site in the structurally-related carbohydrate carbohydrate binding module (CBM) but the second site is located at a dimer interface. These observations highlight the modular architecture and assembly of the RetSp fold and give clues on how homodimerization of RetS could be modulated upon ligand binding to control formation of a RetS/GacS heterodimer. Modelling the DISMED2 of LadS reveals conservation of only one ligand binding site, suggesting a distinct mechanism underlying the activity of this sensor kinase.</p><p><bold>Poster Session II-Biosynthesis &amp; Metabolism of Glycoconjugates</bold></p><p><bold>242: N-glycosylation of β-1,3-glucanosyltransferases is vital for cell wall synthesis in</bold><bold><italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic></bold></p><p><bold><underline>Zhao Wan</underline></bold><bold>and Jin Cheng</bold><bold>;</bold> State Key Laboratory of Mycology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, CHINA</p><p>jinc@sun.im.ac.cn</p><p>Gel1p and Gel2p have been described as β-1,3-glucanosyltranferase working with β-1,3-glucan synthase (Fks1p) to synthesize β-1,3-glucan chains in <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>.

The availability of structure variety of nucleotide sugars is particularly important for the characterization study on glycoconjugates and glycosyltransfersases. Enzymatic synthesis of these nucleotide sugars displays more advantages than chemical method. Therefore, finding enzymes with highly active and broad substrates specificity become a key factor to obtain these nucleotide sugars. In this study, a promiscuous USP (AtUSP) was cloned from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>; a UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GalUSpe4) and a galactokinase (GalKSpe4) were cloned from <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> TIGR4 and were successfully used to synthesize UDP-sugars and their derivatives in an efficient one-pot reaction system. The properties of the one-pot reaction were annotated. GalKSpe4 had relaxed activity towards galactose derivatives with modifications on the C-6, 4- or 2-positions. Additionally, GalKSpe4 can also tolerate glucose while glucose derivatives with modifications on the C-6, 4- or 2-positions were unacceptable. More interestingly,GalKSpe4 can phosphorylate L-mannose in moderate yield (43 %), while other L-sugars such as L-Gal cannot be recognized by this enzyme. AtUSP has different tolerance for C4 and C2 derivative of Gal-1-P compared to GalUSpe4.

Going now for the corresponding glycosyltransferases is an extra challenge as only few sequencing data exist from mollusk origin. Starting with cDNA libraries of several snail species (<italic>Arion lusitanicus, Achatina fulica, Biomphalaria glabrata</italic>) we could identify a fucosyltransferase involved in N-glycosylation and enzymes involved in O-glycosylation, a T-synthase and a polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (for more information about the latter one see the presentation of Ch.

Oppositely, it was significantly decreased after the treatment of 10<sup>−5</sup> M of ATRA (<italic>all-trans</italic> retinoic acid) for 72 h. To elucidate the enzymatic mechanism of the altered expression of PolyLacNAc, five glycosyltransferases related to the synthesis of PolyLacNAc were studied, including β6/β4-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-V/IVb (GnT-V/IVb), the branching enzymes in <italic>N</italic>-glycan synthesis; β4-galactosyltranferase-5 (β4GalT-5), the main enzyme transferring the galactose residue at the outside of the β6 branched <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine; as well as β3-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-2 (β3GnT-2) and β4-galactosyltransferase-1(β4GalT-1), two enzymes participated in the synthesis of [Galβ1,4Gnβ1,3]n in H7721 cells (this cell line does not express β3GnT-8, which is considered as the main enzyme for PolyLacNAc synthesis in other carcinoma cells such as column cancer). It was found by RT-PCR method that the expressions of GnT-V and GnT-IVb were elevated about 3 or 2 fold after the treatment of EGF, while they were declined apparently after treated with ATRA. β4GalT-5 was also up- or down-regulated by the treatment of EGF or ATRA respectively as GnT-IVb. The expression of β3GnT-2, the rate-limiting enzyme in PolyLacNAc synthesis, was approximately doubled after EGF and decreased to very low level after ATRA, while the expression of β4GalT-1 was changed slightly with no statistic significance after both EGF and ATRA treatment.

The treatment with TGF-β1 resulted in a decrease in E-cadherin expression and GnT-III expression as well as its product, the bisected N-glycans, which was confirmed by E4-PHA lectin blot in human MCF-10A and mouse GE11 cells. To understand roles of GnT-III expression in EMT, the MCF-10A cell was stably transfected with GnT-III. Of particular interesting, overexpression of GnT-III partially, but did inhibit EMT induced by TGF-β1, which were confirmed by cell morphological changes of phase-contrast, immunochemical staining patterns of E-cadherin and actin. In addition, GnT-III modified E-cadherin, which contributed to prolong E-cadherin turnover on cell surface examined by biotinylation and pulse-chase experiments. Consistently, GnT-III expression inhibited β-catenin translocation from cell-cell contact into cytoplasm and nucleus. Furthermore, the transwell assay showed that GnT-III expression suppresses TGF-β1-induced cell motility. Taken together, these observations are the first to clearly demonstrate that GnT-III plays important roles in EMT, and explain a molecular mechanism for inhibitory effects of GnT-III on cancer metastasis.</p><p><bold>249:</bold><bold><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic></bold><bold>Rv1096, a novel peptidoglycan deacetylase</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Shufeng Yang</underline></bold><sup><bold>1, 2</bold></sup><bold>, Jian Kang</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Wenli Zhang</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Yufang Ma</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup> Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalian Medical University, Dlian, 116044, China; <sup>2</sup> Department of Microbiology, Dalian Medical University, Dlian, 116044, China</p><p>yufang_ma@hotmail.com</p><p>Tuberculosis is a major chronic infectious disease in the world and caused by pathogen <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>.

Although many studies have revealed the importance of sialylation in prokaryotes and higher animals, sialylation in invertebrates has not been well studied. The objective of this study is to gain insights into sialylation in insects, focusing on the CMP-Sia synthetases (CSSs), which catalyze the synthesis of donor substrates for sialyltransferases. The following results have revealed new features of insect CSSs in their activity and intracellular localizaion: (i) The CSS cDNAs were cloned from <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> (red flour beetle), <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (yellow fever mosquito), and <italic>Drosophilla melanogaster</italic> (fluit fly). Amino acid sequence alignment of these CSSs showed that they share high sequence identities with the vertebrate CSSs in the N-terminal catalytic domain, while they lack the extra C-terminal domain common to vertebrate CSSs; (ii) The bacterially expressed recombinant insect CSSs had no <italic>in vitro</italic> activity to Neu5Ac, Neu5Gc, or Kdn. In contrast, the <italic>in vivo</italic> activity was detected with these insect CSSs using a CSS-impaired CHO mutant cell line LEC29.Lec32, which is negative in the surface expression of polysialic acid (polySia). The transfectant LEC29.Lec32 cells with the insect CSS cDNA plasmids were changed to be polySia-positive; (iii) To determine the intracellular localization of insect CSSs, the Azami-Green fluorescent protein-conjugated CSSs (AG-CSSs) were expressed in CHO cells.

The enzyme was purified to an apparent homogeneity mainly by sonic disruption of cells, ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE-Sepharose column chromatography and chromatofocusing, with a final recovery of 3.2 % and a specific activity of 2.142 U/mg protein. The purified enzyme (tentatively named FNase S) appeared as a single band on Native PAGE gels with a molecular mass of approximately 130 kDa. However, the SDS-PAGE gels gave 3 separate protein with molecular masses of approx. 130 (designated as S1), 70 (S2) and 60 (S3) kDa, respectively, suggesting a multi-protein complex nature of this enzyme. The first 10 N-terminal amino acid sequences of S1 (SXPEAASLPG), S2 (SPQFDVVXIG), and S3 (SLQFDVVVIG) showed high homology (over 80–90 identity) with the N-terminal regions of ATPase, core domain (EGF 27867), carbohydrate kinase, PfkB family protein (YP003854323) and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (ZP08017938), suggesting that these three proteins may delineate a new family of glycoside hydrolases. The optimum conditions for enzyme activity on MF were pH 6.0–7.0 and 40–45 °C. The activity was stable within pH 5.5–8.0 and most stable at 40–45 °C for 1 day at pH 6.0. The enzyme was activated by Mn<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> at the concentration of 1 mM.

In mammals the presence of SiaS has been demonstrated in bovine gastric glycolipids and human and mouse tissue homogenates. However, nothing has been known about the biosynthesis and biological functions of SiaS. We have thus sought to understand biological significance and biosynthetic pathway of SiaS residues. In this study, we first developed chemical and immunochemical detection methods of SiaS: The DMB labeling-based fluorometric high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, and immunochemical detection using two monoclonal antibodies: mAb.3G9 specific for the 8-O-sulfated Neu5Ac (Neu5Ac8S) residue, and mAb.2C4 specific for the Neu5Ac8S/Neu5Gc8S residues. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting showed that SiaS was present in various human and mouse tissues. On the fluorometric HPLC, not only NeuAc8S/9S and Neu5Gc8S/9S, but also Kdn8S/Kdn9S were detected in certain mouse and rat tissues. These results indicate that various SiaS residues ubiquitously occur in mammals. To understand the biosynthesis of the SiaS, we are now searching for the sialate sulfotransferase (SulT-Sia) by direct purification from sea urchin gametes, PCR cloning based on the motif structures of sulfotransferases, and expression cloning using mAb.3G9. Preliminary results showed the presence of a critical gene for expression of cell surface Neu5Ac8S residues.</p><p><bold>257: Systematic identification of</bold><bold><italic>in vivo</italic></bold><bold>target proteins specific for a glycosyltransferases isozyme, β1,4-galactosyltransferase-I</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Daisuke Sugahara</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Hiroyuki Kaji</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Kazushi Sugihara</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Masahide Asano</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Hisashi Narimatsu</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup>Research Center for Medical Glycoscience (RCMG), National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8568, Japan; <sup>2</sup>Division of Transgenic Animal Science, Advanced Science Research Center, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 920-8640, Japan.</p><p>d-sugahara@ks.kyorin-u.ac.jp</p><p>Recently, as a major focused issue in the glycobiology study field, clarification of the biological role of glycans is receiving specific attention.

The morphology and pathology of hand joint cartilage of KBD children were examined by light microscopy and the expression of proteoglycans was determined by histochemical staining. A panel of well-characterized antibodies that recognize glycosaminoglycan or protein (linear or neoepitope) sequences was used to detect proteoglycans, such as aggrecan and glycosaminoglycan or the small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) family proteins biglycan, decorin, karatocan in cartilages using immunohistochemistry.</p><p>R<bold>esults:</bold> There was lesser amounts of toluidine blue staining and aggrecan in the extracellular matrix of the articular cartilage of KBD.

We here show distinct down-regulation of miR-223 in cancerous tissues verse matched adjacent non-tumor tissues in 57 patients with HCC. In highly metastatic MHCC97H cells miR-223 was expressed at a lower level than low metastatic MHCC97L cells. Ectopic expression of miR-223 had a negative effect on cell migration. Further experiments identified that Sp1 was a direct target of miR-223.and selectively stimulated the mRNA synthesis from integrin αV subunit gene whose promoter contains functional recognition sites for Sp1. Sustained expression of miR-223 suppressed the level of Sp1 and integrin αV expression. An inverse correlation between miR-223 and integrin αV was observed in HCC samples from 57 patients. Intriguingly, expression of miR-223 was suppressed by sulfatide, leading to Sp1 and integrin αV expression. The suppression of miR-223 by sulfatide was associated with reduced histone H3 and C/EBPα recruitment to the promoter of miR-223 gene. <italic>In vivo</italic> tumorigenicity and metastasis assays, miR-223 was proved to effectively inhibit HCC growth and metastasis in nude mice.

However, the mechanism underlying the regulation of angiogenesis by WSS25 is not well understood. Using microRNA (miRNA) microarray analysis, 25 miRNAs are found to be upregulated and 12 downregulated by WSS25 in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1), including microRNA-210 (miR-210) and microRNA-885-3p (miR-885-3p). Interestingly, Dicer, a key enzyme for miRNA biosynthesis, is downregulated by WSS25 in HMEC-1 cells. Further studies indicate that HMEC-1 cell tube formation and miR-210 are suppressed while Ephrin-A3 is enhanced by the silencing of Dicer. In contrast, HMEC-1 cell tube formation and miR-210 are induced while Ephrin-A3 is suppressed by Dicer overexpression. Moreover, miR-210 is downregulated while Ephrin-A3 is upregulated by WSS25 in HMEC-1 cells. HMEC-1 cell migration and tube formation are arrested, while Ephrin-A3 expression is augmented by anti-miR-210. In addition, HMEC-1 cell tube formation is significantly attenuated or augmented when Ephrin-A3 is overexpressed or silenced, respectively. Nevertheless, the tube formation blocked by WSS25 is partially rescued by manipulation of Dicer, miR-210, and Ephrin-A3. The above data indicates that WSS25 inhibits angiogenesis <italic>via</italic> suppression of Dicer, leading to downregulation of miR-210 and upregulation of Ephrin-A3. We also show that miR-885-3p dramatically suppresses angiogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. MiR-885-3p inhibits Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation and downregulates DNA-binding protein inhibitor ID-1 (Id1), a proangiogenic factor, by targeting bone morphogenetic protein receptor, type IA (BMPR1A), leading to impaired angiogenesis. Overexpression or silencing of BMPR1A affects angiogenesis in a Smad/Id1-dependent manner. Furthermore, miR-885-3p impairs the growth of HT-29 colon cancer cell xenografts in nude mice by suppressing angiogenesis through disruption of BMPR1A and Smad/Id1 signaling. These results support a novel role for miR-885-3p in tumor angiogenesis by targeting BMPR1A, which regulates a proangiogenic factor. In summary, our research provides the first demonstration concerning the role of Dicer and miRNAs probed by polysaccharide in mediating angiogenesis. These findings add to new evidences that WSS25 not only modulates angiogenesis factors, but also influences miRNAs function. This study advances our understanding of the actions of WSS25 in angiogenesis and even provides further insight into potential WSS25-based new drug development in terms of miRNAs.</p><p><bold>265: Stereoselective synthesis and biological evaluation of 2-deoxy-α-glycosides and oligosaccharides</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Guofang Yang</underline></bold><bold>, Qingbing Wang, Jiafen Zhou, Xiaosheng Luo, Jianbo Zhang* and Jie Tang</bold>; Department of Chemistry, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, China</p><p>jbzhang@chem.ecnu.edu.cn</p><p>2-Deoxy glycosides and oligosaccharides has recently received considerable attention because of many natural products composed of 2-deoxysugars are known to exhibit antimicrobial, anticancer, and antibiotic activities. For example, 2, 6-dideoxy hexopyranoses are common structural units of antitumor agents or antibiotics, such as chromomycin (1) and olivomycin (2). The synthesis of 2-deoxy glycosides; however, can be difficult to achieve due to the lack of directing group at the C-2 position and the acid lability of the resulting 2-deoxy glycosides. Thioglycoside, activated oxygen derivatives, glycosyl halides, and glycals have been used as donors in the formation of either α- or β-2-deoxyglycosides. These glycosyl donors work well in the glycosylations with excellent anomeric selectivities in indirect strategy, which involves the introduction of a temporary directing group such as halides, phenylseleno, and sulfenyl derivatives at C-2, and the reductive removal of the group after the glycosylation step has been completed. Obviously, additional steps are needed and toxic reagents were often applied in the removal step. Compared with the indirect strategy, using 2-deoxyglycopyranosyl donors in a direct way for the formation of 2-deoxyglycosyl linkages would be more efficient and desirable. Early works in this area employ glycosyl halides, glycosyl phosphites, and trichloroacetimidates as donors for the formation of β-selective glycosylation in the presence of mild activators. On the other hand, α-2-deoxyglycosides have been obtained under acid-catalyzed activation of glycals, anomeric ethers, anomeric esters, glycosyl halides, thioglycosides and glycosyl ortho-alkynylbenzoates. Despite a variety of methods available, the direct synthesis of 2-deoxyglycopyranosides from 2-deoxyglycosyl donors, with high stereoselectivity, still remains a challenge because the above methodologies often demand specified donors, promotors or harsh reaction conditions. An efficient and mild method for stereoselective synthesis of 2-deoxy-containing glycosides and oligosaccharides has been developed in our group. Stable and convenient donors, 2-deoxy glucosyl and galactosyl acetates were reacted with phenols, alcohols, thioalcohols and glycosyl acceptors in the presence of catalytic TMSOTf at 0 °C with excellent α-selectivity (4:1 to above 19:1) and high yields (up to 99 %). Trisaccharides were obtained in one-pot synthesis. The structure and stereochemistry of all the glycosidation products were characterized by high resolution NMR and MS data. Preliminary biological evaluation revealed some of the oligosaccharides have good anticancer bioactivity against human cancer cells lines (K562, A549, MM7721).</p><p>The authors gratefully thank financial supports from the Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai (11ZR1410400).</p><p><bold>266: GM3 but not GM2 interaction with tetraspanin CD82 leads to inhibition of EGFR-phoshorylation –dependent colon cancer cell sw620 motility</bold></p><p><bold>Xiaohua Huang</bold><sup><bold>1#, 2</bold></sup><bold>, Ying Li</bold><sup><bold>1#</bold></sup><bold>, Jianing Zhang</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Yuefei Xu</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Yuxiang Tian</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>,</bold><bold><underline>Keli Ma</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold>*</sup>; <sup>1</sup> Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116044, China; <sup>2</sup> Department of Clinical Biochemistry, College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University,Dalian 116044, China</p><p><sup>1*</sup>Corresponding author: makeli666@yahoo.com.cn Tel: +86-411-86110311(O), 86-15998663363(mobile), Fax: +86-411-86110309</p><p><italic>1 #These authors contributed equally to this work</italic></p><p><italic>*This work was supported by Grant from the National Program on Key Basic Research Project 973</italic></p><p>It has been documented that the metastasis suppressor CD82/KAI with gangliosides can exert synergistic inhibitory effect on cell mobility and migration. However, the precise mechanism has not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we want to known whether the EGFR signaling is involved in the mechanism by which CD82 and gangliosides synergistically inhibit the motility and migration of SW620 cells. SW620 cell is colon cancer cells with a high lymph node metastatic potential and a low expression of CD82, and a maior ganglioside composition GM2. By alteration of the ganglioside composition with P4 (D-1-threo-1-phenyl-2-palmi-Toylamino-3- pyrro-idino-1- propanol, an specific inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthesis), and/or addation of exogenous gangliosides, and/or overexpression of CD82 by transferring of CD82 cDNA, we found that (i) GM3 alone suppressed the EGF- stimulated cell motility and migration but GM2 didn’t; CD82 alone dramatically inhibited the EGF- stimulated cell motility and migration; GM3 can enhance the inhibitory effect of CD82 on cell mobility and migration but GM2 didn’t. These results suggested that, in this cell line, GM3, but not GM2 with CD82 synergistically inhibit the cell motility and migration.(ii) GM3 alone suppressed the EGF- stimulated phosphorylation of EGFR at the Tyr845 and Tyr1173; Overexpression of CD82 alone inhibited the EGF- stimulated phosphorylation of EGFR at the Tyr 1045. Addation of GM3 as well as overexpression of CD82 inhibited the EGF- stimulated phosphorylation of EGFR at the Tyr845, Tyr1173 and Tyr 1045. These results suggested that the mechanism for GM3 inhibiting cell migration and phosphorylation of EGFR is different from that of CD82. (iii) GM3 alone suppressed the EGF- stimulated phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 and Thr308; Overexpression of CD82 alone inhibited the EGF- stimulated phosphorylation of ERK; these demonsdrated that CD82 combined with GM3 can reduced EGF- stimulated activity of PI-3K/AKT and ERK signaling pathway.</p><p>Taken together, all the exparimental data suggested that the synergistic inhibitory effect of GM3 and CD82 on cell mobility and migration involve the inhibition of phosphorylation of EGFR and the activity of PI-3K/AKT and ERK signaling pathway.</p><p><bold>267: Modular Synthesis Methodology for the Generation of Heparan Sulfate Oligosaccharides</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Ralf Schwörer</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Jeremy E.

A marked decrease in FUT8 activity and elevated matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 activities were observed at an early stage of exposure.

Although FUT8 activity increased with age among the at risk patients, this association was not clearly observed in the case of COPD patients. A faster annual decline of the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) was significantly associated with lower FUT8 activity. Patients with lower FUT8 activity experienced exacerbations more frequently.

It is clear that the single step of β-1, 4-galactosylation is performed by a family of β-1, 4-galactosyltransferases (β-1, 4-GalTs), and that each member of this family may play a distinct role in different tissues and cells. In the present study, Real-time PCR revealed that the β-1, 4-GalT V mRNA reached peaks at 2w after sciatic nerve crush and 1w after sciatic nerve transection. Combined <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization for β1, 4-GalT V mRNA and immunohistochemistry for S-100 showed that β1, 4-GalT V mRNAs were mainly located in Schwann cells after sciatic nerve injury. In conclusion, β1, 4-GalT V might play important roles in the regeneration and degeneration of the injuried sciatic nerve. In other pathology, such as inflammation, we found that LPS administration affects β-1, 4-GalT V mRNA expression in sciatic nerve in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and β-1, 4-GalT V mRNA expressed mainly in Schwann cells. These results indicated that β-1, 4-GalT-V play an important role in the inflammation reaction induced by intraperitoneal injection of LPS. Similarly, we found that β-1, 4-GalT-V in Schwann cells and the binding with RCA-I on the Schwann cell surface <italic>in vitro</italic> were affected in a time- and concentration dependent manner in response to LPS stimulation, and the trend of the binding with RCA-I on the cell surface was similar to the trend of β-1, 4-GalT V. All these results suggest that β-1, 4-GalT V and Gal β1-4GlcNAc containing glycan structure plays an important role in inflammation. In addition, β-1, 4-GalT V production and overall lectin binding were drastically suppressed by U0126 (ERK inhibitor), SB203580 (p38 inhibitor), or SP600125 (SAPK/JNK inhibitor), which indicated that Schwann cells regulated expression of β-1, 4-GalT V and galactosylation of membrane glycoproteins after LPS stimulation were <italic>via</italic> ERK, SAPK/JNK, and P38MAP kinase signal pathway.</p><p><bold>270:</bold><bold><italic>Helicobacter Pylori</italic></bold><bold>Infection Leads to Gastric Cancer with the coexpression of Lewis Y and CA724</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Faisal Aziz</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Xuesong Yang</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Xiaoqi Wang</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Yan Qiu</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup>; <sup>1</sup>Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalian Medical University, Liaoning Provincial Core Lab of Glycobiology and Glycoengineering, Dalian 116044, China; <sup>2</sup>Department of Dermatology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60611, USA</p><p>yanqiu63@126.com</p><p><italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> (<italic>H. pylori</italic>), the gram-negative bacteria pathogen, is known as a major causative agent for the induction of chronic gastritis and gastroduodenal ulcer disease as well as gastric adenocarcinoma.

Here,we report the therapeutic effects of Gu-4, a lactosyl derivative, in sepsis and the underlying mechanism that related with HMGB1.</p><p>On an experimental rat model of sepsis caused by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), <italic>in vivo</italic> treatment of Gu-4 prominently attenuated lung ingjury and improved the survival of the animals, which was closely related with the decrease of serum HMGB1 level. Data from our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments showed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced HMGB1 cytoplasmic translocation and release in RAW264.7 macrophages was significantly suppressed by Gu-4 treatment. Moreover, HMGB1-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), was significantly decreased by Gu-4 treatment. Further studies by flow cytometry and Western blot analysis demonstrated that Gu-4 could effectively inhibit HMGB1-stimulated activation of CD11b and NF-κB signaling pathways.</p><p>Taken together, our results suggested that Gu-4 could exert therapeutic effects in experimental sepsis model, and the underlying mechanisms of which might lie in: 1) Gu-4 inhibits LPS-induced HMGB1 release; 2) Gu-4 suppresses proinflammatory activity of HMGB1.</p><p><bold>272: Effect of dietary Chitooligosaccharides on the Reproduction and Embryo development in the mouse</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Lun X.

The current study was to test the effect of dietary COS on the litter size and embryonic development in the mouse. [Method] The Kunming female and male mouse at 1 month after birth were fed with or without COS in the diet, which included COS group (300 mg/kg), SPM group (100 mg/kg COS, 100 mg/kg Jerusalem artichoke powder, and 100 mg/kg Polysaccharide yeast),and Control group (basal diet). The female was caged with male mice (1:1) when they were sexually mature. Litter size in successive two generations and embryonic development including total number of embryos and litter weight were recorded. [Result] In the first parity, both SPM supplement and COS supplement improved (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) total litter size compared with that in Control group (13.40 ±3.00/13.50 ±1.83/11.33 ±3.11, SPM group/COS group/Control group). In the second parity, SPM supplement significantly improved total litter size compared with that in Control group (13.75 ± 2.45/11.56 ± 2.96). COS supplement improved one more litter compared with Control group (12.56 ± 1.51/11.56 ± 2.96), although there was no significant difference between them. In addition, COS supplement improved (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) both total numbers of embryos (15.83 ± 1.94/11.71 ± 0.95) and total numbers of live embryos (15.00 ± 1.67/10.86 ± 1.35) compared with Control group. COS supplement improved (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) both litter fetus weight (19.33 ± 2.43/14.94 ± 2.39) and litter placental weight(1.79 ± 0.33/1.36 ± 0.19) compared with Control group.

Histological and immunohistochemical staining was used to investigate the expression and distribution patterns of CS/DS GAG and different CSPGs including aggrecan, versican, biglycan and decorin in the tissues.

Our further immunohistochemical staining results showed an elevated CSPG expression including aggrecan, versican, biglycan and decorin in the HCC tissues when compared with the control group, although their positive staining patterns were different. Interestingly, there was no positive staining for lumican and keratocan in liver tissues from both HCC and control groups. Quantitative PCR and Western blotting results demonstrated that there was a significant increase in aggrecan, versican, biglycan and decorin gene and protein expression in HCC tissues when compared with the normal liver tissues (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05).</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> HCC liver tissues showed an altered expression and distribution patterns in these CSPGs in comparison with the normal liver tissues.

Since RP215 was shown to induce apoptosis and inhibit tumor growth in nude mouse models, effects of RP215 and antibodies against immunoglobulins as well as T-cell receptors (anti-antigen receptors) were investigated on the gene regulations of cultured ovarian as well as cervical cancer cells. By using semi-quantitative RT-PCR, changes in expressions of a number of selected genes involved in proliferation, protein synthesis, cell cycle regulations as well as the innate immunity were analyzed upon various antibody treatments of cultured cancer cells. RP215 and anti-antigen receptors were found to regulate similarly a number of genes (<italic>n</italic> = 12) including NFκB-1, IgG, P21, Cyclin D1, ribosomal P<sub>1</sub> and c-fos. Among toll-like receptor genes (TLR-2, -3, -4, -6, -7 and -9), the expressions of TLR-3, TLR-4 and TLR-9 were highly detected. RP215 and anti-antigen receptors were found to up-regulate TLR-3, whereas those of TLR-4 and TLR-9 were down-regulated. Based on these observations, it can be concluded that apoptosis of cultured cancer cells was induced similarly by either RP215, anti-human IgG or anti-T cell receptors through the regulations of the same set of genes with few exceptions. The innate immunity of cancer cells can also be affected by RP215, anti-human IgG or anti-T cell receptors through the unidirectional mediations of certain toll-like receptors. Therefore, the anti-cancer therapy of RP215 Mab is in part, directly related to surface bound immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors, the expressions of which may be involved in the growth and proliferation of cancer cells. The linkage relationship of toll-like receptors in gene regulations of cancerous immunoglobulins as well as NFκB-1 transcription factor and others was first demonstrated in this study.</p><p><bold>276: Synthesis of</bold><bold><italic>N</italic></bold><bold>-acyl and Ureido Derivatives of Diosgenyl Glycoside with Potent Antifungal and Antibacterial Activity</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Daria GRZYWACZ</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Henryk MYSZKA</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Malgorzata DAWGUL</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Wojciech KAMYSZ</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup>; <sup>1</sup>Faculty of Chemistry, University of Gdansk, Gdansk, 80-952, Poland; <sup>2</sup>Faculty of Pharmacy, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdamsk, 80-416, Poland</p><p>E-mail: plaskiew@chem.univ.gda.pl</p><p>Saponins are natural glycosides which possess a wide range of pharmacological properties.

These moieties are found as constituents of nucleic acids, bacterial, parasitic, and fungal cell wall polysaccharides, as well as other natural products. Importantly, oligosaccharides involving furanosyl constituents are present in various microorganisms whereas these are absent in the mammals glycans. This fact suggests that the enzymes involved in the metabolism of such sugars in bacteria, fungi and protozoa would constitute a good target for the design of new drugs.</p><p>The conformational preferences of oligosaccharides composed of furanose moieties are not well understood. This is due both to a lack of experimental data on oligofuranosides and the significant flexibility of the five-membered ring. To understand the conformational preferences of oligofuranosides it is necessary to well understand the conformational preferences of the single furanose ring. By understanding the conformational preferences of these smaller components, it is hoped that an understanding of the secondary and tertiary structure of the large biomolecules will also be attained.</p><p>Conformations of furanosides in solution are hard identified by NMR techniques because these are equilibrating rapidly and averaging of coupling constants occurs. However, when a furanoid ring is conformationally restricted, <italic>e.g.</italic> by a rigid second skeleton, it is possible to predict its conformation. Therefore, to study conformations of a furanoid ring we synthesized series of furanoses and furanosides having bicyclic structures with the five-membered rings fused at carbons C3-C4, C2-C3, and C1-C2, respectively (Fig. 1). The NMR studies of the synthesized compounds point that spectra of each groups of furanoses and furanosides are very characteristic and indicative of one specific conformation or configuration (Fig. 1).<fig id="Figl" position="anchor"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10719_2013_9474_Figk_HTML.gif" position="anchor" id="MO12"/></fig></p><p><bold>Fig. 1</bold></p><p><bold>278: The Inhibitory Effect of Marine Oligosaccharide Sulfate OMS against Influenza a H1N1 Virus</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Wei Wang</underline></bold><sup><bold>1,2</bold></sup><bold>, Shi-Xin Wang</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Chun-Xia Li</bold><sup><bold>1,2</bold></sup><bold>, Guang-Li Yu</bold><sup><bold>1,2</bold></sup><bold>, Hua-Shi Guan</bold><sup><bold>1,2</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup> Key Laboratory of Marine Drugs, Ministry of Education, Ocean University of China, Qingdao 266003, PR China; <sup>2</sup> Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Glycoscience &amp; Glycoengineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao 266003, PR China</p><p>wwwakin@ouc.edu.cn</p><p>Marine oligosaccharide sulfate OMS is a low molecular weight compound which obtained from alginate polysaccharide by acid degradation, fractionation and sulfated modification.

According to the aglycon skeleton, they are classified into two basic types: the spirosolans and solanidans, which contain oxa-azaspirodecane and indolizidine subunit, respectively. The studies have shown that glycoalkaloids display various biological activities such as antitumor, antiheptatoxicity and molluscicide. A cream containing solansodine glycosides mainly composed by solamargine and solasonine has been marketed as “Curaderm” for solar keratosis. So far the syntheses of glycoalkaloids have been sporatically documented.

Acyl protected solatriosyl imidate was prepared from D-galactose, D-glucose and L-rhamnose following protection, deprotection and functional group manipulations as usual.

The blood glucose of patients could be controlled in a normal level under the treatment of commercial agents. However, all the hypoglycemic drugs have shown some side effects. It is reported that, due to oxidative stress, beta-cell dysfunction or reduction occurs both in type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Thus, it is more worthy of finding new hypoglycemic agents which can improve or promote the proliferation of beta-cells, especially with the natural original. Polysaccharides are well documented to have antioxidant capacities. We have scanned 10 kinds of polysaccharides from different hypoglycemic herbs. A water-soluble polysaccharide (ALP) was extracted from the leaves of <italic>Apocynum venetum</italic>. ALP could specifically promote the pancreatic beta-cells proliferation (INS-1 and RIN-m5F), but no effect on human colon carcinoma cells (HT29 and HCT116). Afterwards, ALP was further fractionated into ALPAP and other two fractions, using a combination of ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography. Beta-cells proliferation assay showed that ALPAP presented stronger promotion than the other two fractions. HPLC analysis results indicated that ALPAP was homogenous with molecular weight of 18 kDa. The structural features of ALPAP were elucidated by periodate oxidation, partial acid hydrolysis, IR spectra and <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopy. The results indicated that ALPAP is a homogalacturonan (HG) -rich pectin with RG-I domain. ALPAP stimulated beta-cells growth in a bell-shaped dose–response curve from 50 μg/ml to 5 mg/ml. After 1.0 mg/ml of ALPAP treatment for 48 h, the cell proliferation rate could reach up to 70 % compared with control. Flow cytometry data showed that ALPAP could elevate mitochondrial membrane potential of beta-cells, but no influence on cell cycle. All the results indicated that HG-rich pectic ALPAP was the main active fraction to stimulate beta-cells proliferation, which is probably mediated through enhancement on mitochondrial function.</p><p><bold>283: Intracellular Localization and Phosphorylation of Galectin-4 is Controlled by Src Family Kinases</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Hiroko Ideo</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Ikue Hoshi</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Katsuko Yamashita</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, and Masaru Sakamoto</bold>; <sup>1</sup>Mol.

Galectin-4 is expressed abundantly in the epithelium of the alimentary tract and has 2 carbohydrate-recognition domains. Galectin-4 is a cytosolic protein that lacks a signal sequence but is externalized and binds to 3-<italic>O</italic>-sulfated glycoconjugates extracellularly. There is abundant evidence for the extracellular roles played by galectins as modulators of cell adhesion and signaling, although the secretion mechanism is not yet understood. Galectin-4 is also localized on the cell surface and binds to sulfated glycosphingolipids and CEA, thereby modulating the adhesion of the cells. However, the mechanism of subcellular localization and externalization of galectin-4 has not yet been determined. It has been reported that galectin-4 recruits apical glycoproteins, including MUC-1, CEA, <italic>etc.</italic>, in DRMs, because these glycoproteins are depleted in DRMs isolated from galectin-4-knockdown HT-29 5M12 cells. This implies that galectin-4 plays an important role in trafficking by functioning as the carrier of these proteins.</p><p>A preliminary experiment using pervanadate (PV) showed that galectin-4 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in cells and suggested that Src kinases are involved. Cell transfection with galectin-4 and active Src plasmids showed that galectin-4 can be tyrosine phosphorylated by members of the Src kinase family. The C-terminal peptide YVQI of galectin-4 was found to play an important role in its tyrosine phosphorylation, and the SH2 domains of Src and SHP2 were found to bind to this peptide. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that the sub-membrane area of Src-activated cells was intensely stained by anti-galectin-4, indicating that Src kinase activity is important for subcellular localization of galectin-4. Furthermore, MUC1 derived from NUGC-4 cells was observed to bind to galectin-4, and externalization of the bound molecules from the cell to the medium increased in the hyperphosphorylated condition. These results suggest that localization of galectin-4 can be regulated by signaling molecules and that it may function intracellularly as an adaptor protein serving to modulate the trafficking of glycoproteins</p><p><bold>284: Epigenetic modulation of HeLa cell membrane N-glycome by epigenetic inhibitors and reversibility of inhibition effects in a drug-free environment</bold></p><p><bold>Tomislav Horvat</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Darko Barišić</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Martina Deželjin</bold><sup><bold>3</bold></sup><bold>, Ana Mužinić</bold><sup><bold>4</bold></sup><bold>, Maja Herak Bosnar</bold><sup><bold>3</bold></sup><bold>, Gordan, Lauc</bold><sup><bold>2,4</bold></sup><bold>,</bold><bold><underline>Vlatka Zoldoš</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup> University of Zagreb, Faculty of Science, Horvatovac 102a, Zagreb, Croatia; <sup>2</sup> University of Zagreb, Faculty of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Zagreb, Croatia; <sup>3</sup> Rudjer Boskovic Institute, Division of Molecular Medicine, Bijenicka 54, Zagreb, Croatia; <sup>4</sup> Genos Ltd, Glycobiology Laboratory, Planinska 1, Zagreb, Croatia</p><p>vzoldos@biol.pmf.hr</p><p>Deregulation of glycosylation occurs in a wide range of multifactorial diseases and aberrant glyco-phenotypes have been associated with specific pathophysiological states. Glyco-genes are one of the groups of cancer-associated genes since changes in glycan structures are hallmarks of many cancers. Cancer-specific changes in glycan biosynthetic pathways are resulting from aberrant expressions of glycosyltransferases and glycosidases, which is often a result of epigenetic changes including DNA methylation and/or histone modifications (acetylation, methylation or phosphorylation). The aberrant gene expression pattern can be potentially restored using various epigenetic inhibitors. To test potential therapeutic usefulness of DNA methylation inhibitors, zebularine and 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine, and histone deacetylation inhibitors, trichostatin A and Na-butyrate, in inducing a reversal of undesired glyco-phenotypes, we developed an HPLC- based method for the analysis of glycan structures from HeLa cells embedded in polyacrylamide gels. In addition, we specifically investigated the preservation of altered glycan profiles over a prolonged period of time in a drug-free environment. Our results emphasize the importance of epigenetic control in the regulation of N-glycosylation, but also suggest the stability of complex biosynthetic pathways responsible for the establishment of glycan profiles in human cells in culture.</p><p><bold>285: Dissecting the impact of</bold><bold><italic>O</italic></bold><bold>-GlcNAc modification on insulin action using different OGA inhibitors</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Chin Fen Teo</underline></bold>* <bold>and Lance Well</bold><bold><italic>s</italic></bold><bold>;</bold> Complex Carbohydrate Research Center and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, the University of Georgia. 315 Riverbend Road, Athens, GA 30602, USA.</p><p>cfteo@uga.edu</p><p><italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification is a ubiquitous and reversible glycosylation found on intracellular proteins. The spatial and temporal presence of <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc is orchestrated by a pair of cycling enzymes, <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and β-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminidase (OGA), in response to a variety of cellular and environmental stimuli. Given that UDP-GlcNAc, the end product of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP), is an obligatory donor substrate of OGT, <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc is posed as an effector of excessive glucose flux through the HBP which in turn can lead to the development of insulin resistance, a hallmark of type 2 diabetes. Toward this end, previous studies have utilized PUGNAc, the first reported OGA inhibitor, albeit that can inhibit lysosomal hexosaminidases as well, to increase global <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc levels and observed a correlation of elevated <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc with the development of insulin resistance. This notion has been recently challenged by results from the Vocadlo’s group, in which elevated global <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc levels using a more selective OGA inhibitor, NButGT, did not lead to insulin resistance in cell culture or <italic>in vivo</italic>. In this study, we evaluated the impact of the <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification on the pro-survival action of insulin under serum-deprivation induced apoptosis using three different OGA inhibitors, GlcNAcstatin-g (GNSg, another OGA selective inhibitor), thiamet-G (TMG, a derivative of NButGT), and PUGNAc. We found that while PUGNAc inhibits the protective action of insulin, neither GNSg nor TMG negates the anti-apoptotic action of insulin. To address whether inhibition of the lysosomal hexosaminidase activity <italic>via</italic> PUGNAc, which would elevate global GM2 ganglioside levels, leads to its unique characteristic in blocking insulin action, we also examined the pro-survival role of insulin in the presence of a selective lysosomal hexosaminidase inhibitor, INJ2. We established that neither INJ2 alone nor the combination of OGA selective inhibitors with INJ2 mimic the inhibitory effect of PUGNAc. These results strongly suggest that the defect in insulin action upon PUGNAc treatment does not derive from its inhibition of OGA or lysososomal hexosaminidases, and that there is a third, yet unknown, target of PUGNAc that is the likely culprit in inhibiting the protective effect of insulin from apoptosis.</p><p><bold>286: Structure and Immunological Activities of Mannogalactoglucans from</bold><bold><italic>Lentinus edodes</italic></bold><bold>Fruiting Bodies</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Iteku B.

We previously demonstrated NEU3 to be markedly up-regulated in various human cancers including colon cancer, associated with augmented malignant properties including increased cell migration, invasiveness and cell survival. Here, we have found a molecular link between Wnt/β-catenin signaling and NEU3 expression in colon cancer cells by analyzing cancer stem-like characteristics and tumor initiating capability. NEU3-silencing in HT29 and HCT116 colon cancer cells resulted in significant decrease in clonogenic growth, chemoresistance to oxaliplatin, clonogenicity on soft agar and <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor growth, along with down-regulation of stemness genes, Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2, and Wnt–related genes Lgr5, Wnt 1 and Wnt3a. Analyses further revealed that NEU3 enhanced phosphorylation of the Wnt receptor LRP6 and consequently β-catenin activation by accelerating complex formation with LRP6 and recruitment of GSK3β and Axin, whereas its silencing exerted the opposite effects. As the null-activation mutant of NEU3, N88D and Y370C, could not accelerated the LRP6 phosphorylation, indicating that the glycolipid changes as results of catalytic reaction of NEU3 likely need for the acceleration. Indeed, analysis of lipids extraction of the cells by the Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC), lactosylceramide (Lac-Cer) was decreased in NEU3-silenced HT29 cells, and exogenous addition of the Lac-Cer accelerated the LRP6 phosphorylation. Under sphere-forming condition, when stemness genes were up-regulated, endogenous NEU3 expression was significantly increased, whereas NEU3 silencing suppressed sphere-formation. In fact, NEU3-silenced spheroids demonstrated reduced <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor formation in NOD-SCID mice, with down-regulation of stemness-and Wnt- related genes. Interestingly, microarray analyses in NEU3-silenced HT29 revealed that NEU3 affects Cripto-1 expression, that is primary target of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and directly regulated by Nanog and Oct4 in embryonic stem cells and colon carcinoma cells.

Causes are known to be multiple, genetic and environmental factors. However, the overall mechanism leading to schizophrenia remains unclear. A number of reports have shown the relationships between impaired expression of polysialic acid (polySia) and schizophrenia. PolySia is a homopolymer of sialic acid with a degree of polymerization of 8–400, and has anti-adhesive effects on cell-cell interactions due to its bulky polyanionic nature when present on neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). Recently, we demonstrated that polySia functions not only as an anti-cell adhesion molecule, but also as a reservoir scaffold for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a neurotransmitter (Dopamine) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), which are biologically active molecules in neurogenesis and neural function. In 2006, Arai and his colleagues reported single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of ST8SIA2/STX in schizophrenic patients. We focused on a SNP of the ST8SIA2/STX gene, SNP7 (421G&gt;A) on exon 4, which has been identified in a schizophrenic patient in their report because structural features of the polySia-NCAM in any case of the schizophrenia patients have not been clarified. Therefore, our objective is to gain an insight into the relationship between structure and function of polySia-NCAM biosynthesized by ST8SIA2/STX. In this study, we analyzed the enzymatic activity of the mutated ST8SIA2/STX toward membrane-bound and secreted forms of NCAM, and chemically evaluated the polySia-NCAM biosynthesized by the mutated ST8SIA2/STX. In addition, we investigated the ability of polySia to bind BDNF and FGF2, using a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based method. We showed that polySia-NCAM biosynthesized by the mutated ST8SIA/STX contained less polySia with shorter chain length and that it exhibited impaired reservoir function for BDNF and FGF2 as compared with that synthesized by wild-type ST8SIA2/STX. Our findings suggest that the quantity and quality of polySia on NCAM is important for normal neuronal functioning.</p><p><bold>290: Novel Glyco-biomarker for Epithelial Ovarian Cancer Selected by Glycoproteomic Approaches</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Maki Sogabe</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Hirofumi Nozaki</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Tomomi Kubota</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Atsushi Kuno</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Hiroyuki Kaji</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Akira Togayachi</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Hayao Nakanishi</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Toru Nakanishi</bold><sup><bold>3</bold></sup><bold>, Nao Suzuki</bold><sup><bold>4</bold></sup><bold>, Kazushige Kiguchi</bold><sup><bold>4</bold></sup><bold>, Mikio Mikami</bold><sup><bold>5</bold></sup><bold>, Yuzuru Ikehara</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Hisashi Narimatsu</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup>Research Center for Medical Glycoscience (RCMG), National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tsukuba, 305-8568, Japan; <sup>2</sup>Division of Oncological Pathology, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, 464-8681, Japan; <sup>3</sup>Department of Gynecologic Oncology, Aichi Cancer Center Hospital, Nagoya, 464-8681, Japan; <sup>4</sup>Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, 216-8511, Japan; <sup>5</sup>Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, School of Medicine, Tokai University, Isehara, 259-1193, Japan;</p><p>h.narimatsu@aist.go.jp</p><p>Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), is the leading causes of death among gynecological malignancies, and its incidence rate tends to increase is Japan.

Therefore, expression of the sialyl lewis x antigen on cancer cells is thought to enhance cancer metastasis. Because sulfation and sialylation occur at the same position of the same precursor sugar chains, overexpression of a relevant sulfotransferase, Gal3ST-2 suppresses the expression of sialyl lewis x in human lung adenocarinoma-derived ABC-1 cells, and reduces the interaction with E-selectin and the hematogeneous metastasis in a nude mouse model. Since the two major sialyl lewis x-positive protein bands turn negative parallel to the above phenomena, we hypothesize that these proteins may be involved in the metastasis mechanism. In the present study, we have purified these glycoproteins and identified them by mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis. Effects of siRNA knock down of these glycoproteins on expression of sialyl lewis x antigen and cancer metastasis by interaction with E-selectin are under study.

There are increasing evidences to indicate that integrity and balance of extracellular matrix components are essential for normal lung function and the response to injury including emphysema. The inhibitors against MMPs are promising for the treatment of emphysema, but none of the suitable inhibitors are available at present because of the lack of specificity and the strong side effects.</p><p>Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are distributed in the bronchial walls and in airway secretions. They play a key role in many biological functions. We found that one of the GAGs, keratan sulfate (KS)-disaccharide (L4) inhibited MMP-9 activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. Thus, we determined whether exogenous GAGs, including L4 and hyaluronan (HA)-oligosaccharide, prevented or corrected the early stage of elastase-induced pulmonary emphysema <italic>in vivo</italic>. We intratracheally administered KS-I isolated from bovine cornea, L4, HA-tetramer (HA4) and -dodecamer (HA12) into C57BL/6 mice. Next day, we treated with porcine pancreatic elastase by intratracheal administration to induce emphysema. On the following day, we measured the accumulation of inflammatory cells and the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and the activity of MMP-9 in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. We found that KS-I significantly attenuated the accumulation of total inflammatory cells and the production of TNF-α in BAL fluid and the MMP-9 activity was suppressed in all groups except HA12-treated group as compared with the PBS-treated group. Furthermore, we also evaluated the progression of emphysema with micro-computed X-ray tomography (micro-CT) by calculation the percentage of the emphysema area to the total lung area. The analysis of micro-CT images showed that L4 and KS-I significantly suppressed the emphysema progression at 7 and 14 days after elastase administration as compared with the PBS-treated group. These results suggested that these GAGs, especially L4 and KS-I, might be effective against the lung inflammation and the early stage of emphysema formation.</p><p><bold>294: Detection of disease associated sialoglycoconjugate specific IgG in the sera of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Sujata Ghosh</underline></bold><sup><bold>a</bold>*</sup><bold>, Sarika Kapoor</bold><sup><bold>b</bold></sup><bold>, Ram Marwaha</bold><sup><bold>b</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>a</sup>Department of Experimental Medicine and Biotechnology, <sup>b</sup>Department of Pediatrics, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh,160012, India.</p><p>suassi1@gmail.com</p><p>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy in children. With existing treatment protocols, virtually all patients achieve remission and ~ 70 % are eventually cured. However, patients in remission may have residual leukemic cells, which cannot be identified by the routine methods. Thus, the need of the hour is to develop clinically useful strategies to determine the treatment outcome and predict relapse. Change in glycosylation pattern especially aberrant sialylation in the cellular glycoconjugates is a prominent biomolecular alteration in cancer cells. The presence of disease associated glycoconjugate specific antibodies in the sera of cancer patients has been reported earlier. In the present study, we report the presence of significantly higher level of fetuin (taken as a broad spectrum sialoglycoconjugate) specific IgG (IgG<sub>A</sub>) in the serum samples of children having ALL as compared to other non-neoplastic disorders. IgG<sub>A</sub> level was found to be significantly higher as compared to the fetuin specific IgM and IgA level in the sera of ALL-patients. A remarkable reduction in the level of IgG<sub>A</sub> was detected during therapy up to 1 year. To further confirm the sialoglycoconjugate specificity of IgG<sub>A</sub>, different gangliosides [known to contain NeuAcα(2→3)Gal unit] were used and maximum specificity of IgG<sub>A</sub> was found for GM2. IgG<sub>A</sub> from the pooled sera of ALL-patients was isolated by sequential chromatography on Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B and Fetuin- Sepharose CL-4B. The purified IgG<sub>A</sub> showed strong membrane positivity with CEM-CM3 cells as well as the lymphoblasts of ALL–patients. Further, the %age of IgG<sub>A</sub> positive cells was more than 70 % in case of ALL-patients. A ~66 kDa band in the membrane fraction of CEM-CM3 cells as well as PBMCs of ALL-patients was found to interact specifically with IgG<sub>A</sub> as well as <italic>Maackia amurensis</italic> agglutinin [specific for NeuAcα(2→3)Gal/GalNAc], the intensity of which was drastically reduced in presence of GM2. Taken together, IgG<sub>A</sub> may have the potential to serve as a unique probe for detail investigation of childhood-ALL associated sialoglycoconjugate(s) present on the lymphoblasts. Further, due to high specificity of IgG<sub>A</sub> to fetuin/GM2, it may be possible to develop a simple alternative diagnostic approach (fetuin/GM2 based ELISA) for childhood-ALL.</p><p><bold>295: Potential importance of</bold><bold><italic>Maackia amurensis</italic></bold><bold>agglutinin in non-small cell lung cancer</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Rakhee Chhetra</underline></bold><sup><bold>a</bold></sup><bold>, Sangeeta Mehta</bold><sup><bold>b</bold></sup><bold>, Radhika Srinivasan</bold><sup><bold>c</bold></sup><bold>, Suresh C.

Among various types of sugar residues, sialic acids are extremely important, since increased sialylation in the cellular glycoconjugates has been found to be associated with tumour progression and metastasis. Altered sialylation in cellular glycans was reported in case of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although, drugs for treatment of NSCLC have been available for many years, but the use of such regimens are plagued by serious side effects because of their non-specific action on normal healthy cells. Thus, medical science is in need of prospective studies to develop newer targeted approaches for treatment of this life threatening disease. In this context, lectins are the potentially important biomolecules. <italic>Maackia amurensis</italic> agglutinin [specific for NeuNAcα (2-3) Gal/GalNAc] is gaining recognition as an important lectin, which can specifically distinguish cancer cells from normal cells and thereby it seems to have diagnostic potential in cancer of different origin. In the present study, we report that this lectin interacted strongly with human NSCLC cell lines as well as the tissue biopsies and cells obtained from fine needle aspirations of NSCLC patients, indicating the binding of this lectin to specific sialylated glycans on NSCLC cells. We have observed that this lectin selectively induced apoptosis in NSCLC cell lines but not in normal lung fibroblast cell line. The inhibition of <italic>Maackia amurensis</italic> agglutinin induced apoptosis in presence of GM2 and IgG<sub>MAA</sub> indicated the importance of sugar binding epitope as well as antibody binding epitope of the lectin in inducing apoptosis in NSCLC cells. Our observation was further authenticated by studying this lectin induced apoptosis in the cells obtained by the fine needle aspiration of the tumour of NSCLC patients. Moreover, this lectin induced activation of apoptotic pathway in NSCLC cells was found to be accompanied by downregulation of Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>, upregulation of Bax, release of cytochrome c and activation of procaspase-3. Further, a synergistic effect of this lectin on paclitaxel induced cytotoxicity in NSCLC cell lines was also noted.

In general, elevated CA-125 level in blood is the most robust serum biomarker for OC detection. However, CA125 can give a false positive response in benign conditions due to its low sensitivity and specificity. The aim of this work was to find additional markers for the OC diagnosis which would complement the use of CA125 by analyzing the alteration of glycan of IgG in human blood. N-glycans were released from serum IgG by PNGase F digestion, purified in a solid phase extraction, permethylated und subsequently analyzed by MALDI-QIT-TOF MS. 31 ovarian cancer patients and 22 age-matched benign tumor patients were enrolled in this study. Statistical analyses were carried out using the SPSS 17.0 software. Statistical analyses show statistic significance difference between malignant and benign patients by combining the level of serum IgG-associated N-glycans with CA125. The results indicate that combinations of changes in the IgG glycans with CA125 might improve both sensitivity and specificity for acute ovarian cancer diagnosis.</p><p><bold>297: Hydrolysis of secreted sialoglycoproteins in</bold><bold><italic>ex vivo</italic></bold><bold>and biochemical models of bacterial vaginosis</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Warren G.

As evidenced by high recurrence rates following treatment, interventions for BV are still lacking. Several hydrolytic activities, including glycosidases and proteases, have been previously correlated with BV and have been hypothesized to degrade host sialoglycoproteins that participate in mucosal immune functions. Sialidase activity is most predictive of BV status and correlates strongly with adverse health outcomes. Here we combine clinical specimens with biochemical approaches to investigate secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) as a substrate of BV-associated glycosidases and proteases. We show that BV clinical specimens hydrolyze sialic acid from SIgA, but not in the presence of the sialidase inhibitor dehydro-deoxy-sialic acid. The collective action of BV-associated glycosidases exposes underlying mannose residues of SIgA, most apparent on the heavily N-glycosylated secretory component of the antibody. Terminal sialic acid residues on SIgA protect underlying carbohydrate residues from exposure and hydrolysis by exoglycosidases (galactosidase and hexosaminidase). It is known that both IgG and SIgA are present in the human reproductive tract. We show that the IgG heavy chain is more susceptible to proteolysis than its IgA counterpart. Gentle partial deglycosylation of the SIgA secretory component enhanced susceptibility to proteolysis. Together, these data support a model of BV in which SIgA is subject to stepwise exodeglycosylation and enhanced proteolysis, likely compromising the ability of the reproductive mucosa to neutralize and eliminate pathogens.</p><p>Poster</p><p><bold>298: Inhibiting activities of chitooligosaccharides on the growth of two different tumors</bold></p><p><bold>Haige Wu</bold><sup><bold>1,2</bold></sup><bold>, Ziang Yao</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>,</bold><bold><underline>Yuguang Du</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup>; <sup>1</sup> Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Science, Dalian 116023, China; <sup>2</sup> Bioengineering College Dalian University, Dalian 116622, China</p><p>duyg@dicp.ac.cn</p><p>Anti-tumor activity of chitooligosaccharides (COS) has been reported previously, but its mechanism is not clear.

After administered with COS for 28 days, mice are sacrificed, tumor tissue are taken out and weighed, Elisa method is used to detect the contents of cytokines correlated with immunological regulation and angiogenesis in the serum of Kunming mice or hairless mice. The results show that COS can decrease the contents of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) and VEGFR (vascular endothelial growth factor receptors) in both Kunming and hairless mice. In Kunming mice, COS can increase the thymus and spleen index, the contents of IL-2 and IL-6, therefore display immunological regulation activity. COS could inhibit the growth of tumor both in Kunming and hairless mice, but the inhibiting rate on S180 tumor in Kunming mice (maximum 65 %) is greater than that of on human breast cancer in hairless mice (maximum 47 %). Maybe this is because that in hairless mice COS couldn’t display its immunological regulation activity. All the results indicate that COS have anti-tumor activity, and its anti-tumor activity is correlated with its anti-angiogenic and immunological regulation activities.</p><p><bold>299: Ginseng pectin potentiates TRAIL-induced apoptosis through upregulation of death receptors</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Hairong Cheng</underline></bold><bold>, Qi Sun, Guihua Tai, Yifa Zhou;</bold> School of Life Sciences, Northeast Normal University, 130024, Changchun, Jilin Province, China</p><p>chenghr893@nenu.edu.cn</p><p>Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), is a potent cancer cell-specific apoptosis-inducing agent with little to no effect on normal tissues. However, acquired resistance of cancer cells to TRAIL is a roadblock, allowing them to evade the pro-apoptotic effects of TRAIL. Ginseng pectin exerts significant anti-tumor effect and potentiates anti-tumor effect of a series of chemotherapeutic drugs. In the present report, we investigated the effect of ginseng pectin on cancer cell apoptosis induced by TRAIL. We found that two homogenous homogalacturonan with small percentage of type-I rhamnogalacturonan domains (WGPA-3-RG and WGPA-4-RG) and two Heat-treated homogenous homogalacturonan (WGPA-3-HG and WGPA-4-HG) not only potentiated TRAIL-induced apoptosis in HCT116 colon cancer cells but also sensitized TRAIL-resistant colon cancer cells HT-29 to the cytokine. At a mechanistic level, ginseng pectin downregulated cell survival proteins, including Bcl-2, Mcl-1 and Bcl-XL, and upregulated pro-apoptotic protein Bax and the expression of TRAIL death receptors DR5. Gene silencing of DR5 by short hairpin RNA reduced the apoptosis induced by combination treatment of Ginseng pectin and TRAIL. Induction of DR5 by ginseng pectin was independent of p53 and Bax, but was dependent on production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and sequestering of ROS abolished both upregulation of the receptor and potentiation of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our results provide the first mechanistic evidence that ginseng pectin treatment render cancer cells more sensitive to the cytotoxic activities of TRAIL, suggesting that Ginseng pectin can be given in combination with TRAIL, especially for those tumors that develop resistance to TRAIL.</p><p><bold>300: Chitosan Oligosaccharides Protect Human Monocytes U937 from LPS-induced Inflammatory Damage through Blockade p38 MAPK Phosphorylation and Increasing O-GlcNAcylation of Proteins</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Yu Li</underline></bold><sup><bold>1,2</bold></sup><bold>, Qiang Peng</bold><sup><bold>1,2</bold></sup><bold>, Qingsong Xu</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Yuguang Du</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup>Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian, 116023, China; <sup>2</sup>Graduate School of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 110864, China</p><p>articles1805@gmail.com</p><p>To investigate the effects of Chitosan oligosaccharides(COS) with different degree of polymerization(DP) on LPS-induced inflammation, U937 human monocytes were cultured with DP2-8(COS-A) and DP7-15(COS-B) respectively, which were prepared by our group.

Sch. of Med., Kyoto Univ., Kyoto, Japan</p><p>shogo@hs.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp</p><p>AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPAR) are hetero or homotetrameric complexes composed of various combinations of four subunits (GluA1-4). AMPAR mediate most of the fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the nervous system. Their cell surface expression level and abundance in postsynaptic region modulate synaptic plasticity. So far, we found that a unique trisaccharide (HSO<sub>3</sub>-3GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc), named human natural killer-1 (HNK-1) carbohydrate specifically expressed on N-linked glycans of GluA2, regulated cell surface expression level of AMPAR and spine maturation process. Since the particular carbohydrate possesses such functions to AMPAR, it is speculated that other N-linked glycans expressed on AMPAR also have a potential to regulate functions of AMPAR. In this study, to elucidate the role of N-glycans on GluA1 and GluA2 (major subunits of AMPAR), we generated a series of GluA1 and GluA2 mutants of which Asn residue in the consensus sequence (N-X-S/T) was mutated to Ser, and investigated cell surface expression levels of these mutants by using a cell surface biotinylation assay. As a result, cell surface expression levels of GluA1N63S, N363S and GluA2N370S were decreased compared with those of wild-type (WT) GluA1 and GluA2, and these mutants were mainly distributed in ER. The cell surface expression level of GluA1N363S was increased by co-expression of GluA2WT but not GluA1N63S whereas that of GluA2WT was unchanged regardless of co-expression of GluA1 mutants, suggesting that N-linked glycans at N63 and N363 on GluA1 had different roles in trafficking from ER to cell surface. In contrast, co-expression of GluA1WT had little effect on the cell surface expression level of GluA2N370S but rather GluA1WT was likely to accumulate in ER, suggesting that the trafficking of GluA1 was controlled by N-linked glycan at N370 on GluA2. These results show that the cell surface expression level of AMPAR was regulated by N-linked glycans in a different manner.</p><p><bold>307: Synthesis and antiviral activity of amino-glycoglycerolipids</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Jun zhang</underline></bold><bold>,</bold><bold><underline>Chunxia Li</underline></bold><bold>, Huashi Guan;</bold> Key Laboratory of Marine Drugs, Ministry of Education, School of medicine and pharmacy, Ocean University of China, Qingdao 266003, P.

T synthase, also named core 1 β1,3-galactosyltransferase (C1GALT1), controls the formation of mucin-type O-glycans. Although these carbohydrates play crucial roles in a variety of cancers, the expression and function of T synthase in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have never been studied. Here we showed that T synthase mRNA and protein were frequently overexpressed in HCC tumors compared with non-tumor liver tissues. T synthase expression significantly correlated with increased histologic grade and metastasis of HCC.

In addition to its function in formation of the fertilization, which serves as a block to sperm and microbes, intelectins have been studied as a mediator during pathogen surveillance. The infection by several pathogens induces a dramatic increase in the expression of Intelectin transcripts in intestinal and bronchial epithelial cells, mediated by IL-13. Reports have suggested that very low levels of recombinant int-1 could be secreted from transfected cells. Since we have shown that Int-1 is constitutively expressed in human heart endothelial cells (and not in most types of endothelial cells), we attempted to express cDNAs of human Int-1 and -2 in stably transfected H5V cells, a mouse heart capillary endothelial cultured line, to produce significant levels of secreted proteins. The recombinantly expressed Int-1 was secreted into the media. MS analysis determined that Int-1 was not a GPI-anchored protein in H5V cells. There have been some reports that Int-1 binds specifically to galactofuranose coupled to agarose; however, H5V-secreted, recombinant Int-1 bound to native agarose resin and was eluted by EDTA, similar to our report for XL35, but also by 100 mM ribose. The eluted protein fraction showed a single band in silver staining after SDS-PAGE resulting in a yield of X mg of purified Int-1/Y ml of starting culture media. Glycan binding array analysis by Core H of the CFG showed binding of Int-1 was to the synthetic glycan: GlcNAcβ1-4Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ-Sp8, which has not been reported in humans. The binding specificity for XL35 on the same array was clearly Galα1-3GalNAc, by contrast. Although Int-1 binds tightly to agarose and with low affinity to the synthetic glycan above in a calcium-dependent manner, a high affinity glycan ligand in humans or human pathogens has not yet been identified.</p><p><bold>311: GOLPH3 regulates integrin-mediated cell migration</bold><bold><italic>via</italic></bold><bold>up-regulation of sialylation of β1 integrin</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Tomoya Isaji</underline></bold><bold>, Wei Gu, Tomohiko Fukuda and Jianguo Gu;</bold> Division of Regulatory Glycobiology, Institute of Molecular Biomembrane and Glycobiology, Tohoku Pharmaceutical University, 4-4-1 Komatsushima, Aoba-ku, Sendai Miyagi, 981-8558, Japan</p><p>tfukuda@tohoku-pharm.ac.jpisaji@tohoku-pharm.ac.jp</p><p>Recently, a Golgi protein, GOLPH3 was identified as a new oncogene that is commonly amplified in human cancers. An ortholog of GOLPH3, VPS74p has been reported to be essential for glycosyltransferase activation of yeast. To investigate whether the expression of GOLPH3 was involved in the cell migration and N-glycosylation in mammalian cells, we performed a loss-of-functional study. Cell migration on fibronectin or laminin was suppressed in GOLPH3 knockdown (KD) cells, and the suppression was restored by re-introduction of GOLPH3 gene. The cell migration was abolished in the presence of neutralized anti-β1 integrin antibody. Interestingly, N-glycosylation status of β1 integrin obtained from KD cells was apparently different from those in control cells, while it was normalized in the restored cells. HPLC and LC/MS analysis showed that the sialylation level of N-glycans was specifically decreased in KD cells, and the aberrant N-glycosylation was significantly rescued in the restored cells. To explore the specific effect on sialylation by GOLPH3 expression, we examined the interactions between a glycosyltransferase and GOLPH3, and found GOPLH3 specifically associated with α2,3-sialyltransferase IV, but not β1,4-galactosyltransferase I. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic tail of α2,3-sialyltransferase IV was shown to be important for the association. Taken together, these results suggest that GOLPH3 regulates N-glycosylation status of β1integrin and it’s biological functions, which may give a new insight for the functions of GOLPH3 in cancer.</p><p><bold>312: Large protein complexes retained in the ER are dislocated by non-COPII vesicles and degraded by selective autophagy</bold></p><p><bold>Valerie Le Fourn</bold><sup><bold>1,4,*</bold></sup><bold>, </bold><bold><underline>Sujin Park</underline></bold><sup>2,*</sup><bold>, Insook Jang</bold><sup><bold>3,*</bold></sup><bold>, Katarina Gaplovska-Kysela</bold><sup><bold>1,5</bold></sup><bold>, Bruno Guhl</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Yangsin Lee</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Jin Won Cho</bold><sup><bold>2,3</bold></sup><bold>, Christian Zuber</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Jürgen Roth</bold><sup><bold>1,2</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup>Division of Cell and Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, University of Zurich, CH-8091 Zurich, Switzerland, <sup>2</sup>Department of Integrated OMICS for Biomedical Science, WCU Program, Yonsei University Graduate School, Seoul 120-749, Korea, <sup>3</sup>Department of Systems Biology, Yonsei University, Seoul 120-749, Korea, <sup>4</sup>Present address: Selexis SA, CH-1228 Plan-les-Ouates/Geneva, Switzerland, <sup>5</sup>Present address: Department of Genetics, Comenius University, SR-84215 Bratislava, Slovak Republic</p><p>* These authors contributed equally to this study.</p><p>jurgen.roth@yonsei.ac.kr, Tel:82-2-2123-7673, Fax:82-2-312-5657</p><p>Multisubunit protein complexes are assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Existing pools of single subunits and assembly intermediates ensure the efficient and rapid formation of complete complexes. While being kinetically beneficial, surplus components must be eliminated to prevent potentially harmful accumulation in the ER. Surplus single chains are cleared by the ubiquitin–proteasome system. However, the fate of not secreted assembly intermediates of multisubunit proteins remains elusive. Here we show by high-resolution double-label confocal immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy that naturally occurring surplus fibrinogen Aα–γ assembly intermediates in HepG2 cells are dislocated together with EDEM1 from the ER to the cytoplasm in ER-derived vesicles not corresponding to COPII-coated vesicles originating from the transitional ER. This route corresponds to the novel ER exit path we have previously identified for EDEM1 (Zuber et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 104:4407–4412, 2007). In the cytoplasm, detergent-insoluble aggregates of fibrinogen Aα–γ dimers develop that are targeted by the selective autophagy cargo receptors p62/SQSTM1 and NBR1. These aggregates are degraded by selective autophagy as directly demonstrated by high-resolution microscopy as well as biochemical analysis and inhibition of autophagy by siRNA and kinase inhibitors. Our findings demonstrate that different pathways exist in parallel for ER-to-cytoplasm dislocation and subsequent proteolytic degradation of large luminal protein complexes and of surplus luminal single-chain proteins. This implies that ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) has a broader function in ER proteostasis and is not limited to the elimination of misfolded glycoproteins.</p><p><bold>313: Selective autophagy receptors are involved in degradation of EDEM1</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Insook Jang</underline></bold><bold>, Sujin Park, Jin Won Cho and Jürgen Roth;</bold> Department of Biology, Yonsei University, Seoul, 120-749, South Korea</p><p>o-glcnac@yonsei.ac.kr</p><p>Misfolded and mis-assembled glycoproteins are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where they are exposed to the protein folding machinery and protein quality control. The UPR (Unfoled Protein Response) is activated in response to an accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Eventually, misfolded and mis-assembled glycoproteins are targeted for degradation by a process called ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). EDEM1 is an ERAD component that recognizes misfolded luminal glycoproteins and is routing them for dislocation to the cytosol. This is classically followed by their degradation. Although EDEM1 was initially proposed to be lectin–like and to react with Man<sub>8</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, its complex mode of interaction with substrates has become clear only recently. However, still very little is known about the turnover and degradation mechanism of EDEM1 and how this relates to the fate of its substrates. We already reported that EDEM1 becomes rapidly degraded and that this occurs by basal autophagy. Here, we provide detailed insight into the mechanism by which EDEM1 becomes degraded. After its dislocation to the cytosol, EDEM1 is apparently making complexes with the selective autophagy receptors p62, NBR1 and Alfy. We observed co-distribution of EDEM1 and selective autophagy receptors by double or triple confocal laser scanning immunofluorescence. By quantifying the relationship of EDEM1 and the selective autophagy receptors as visualized by confocal laser scanning immunofluorescence, dramatical changes were observed in HepG2 cells following inhibition of autophagy by wortmannin treatment. These changes were fully reversible upon wortmannin wash-out. In addition, we observed its ubiquitination after dislocation to the cytosol. This demonstrates that the ERAD component EDEM1 itself undergoes ERAD involving selective autophagy.</p><p><bold>Acknowledgment</bold></p><p>This work was supported by the World Class University program through the National Research Foundation of Korea funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (R31-2008-000-10086-0) and a grant from the National Research Foundation of Korea by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (2010-0027736).

However, here, we found that GnT-V expression levels were strongly reduced during EMT of human alveolar basal epithelial cells, in small cell lung cancers and non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) except squamous cell carcinomas. Further study showed that suppression of β1-6GlcNAc glycosylation by swainsonine and knockdown of GnT-V expression by stably transfected with GnT-V shRNA in A549 cell line advanced EMT-like changes, cell-ECM adhesion, cell migration and invasion potential induced by TGF-β, whereas additional expression of GnT-V reduced TGF-β-induced-EMT, invasion and metastasis. Furthermore, we found that down regulation of GnT-V expression promoted metastasis formation by enhancing TGF-β/Smad signaling, actin reorganization and TGF-β/FAK signaling, which facilitates an EMT-like switch, cells spreading, cellular adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins, thereby allowing efficient cell migration and invasion of metastatic lung cancer cells.

These vesicles play an important role as mediators in extracellular communication. They are composed of phospholipid bilayer membrane, cellular proteins, DNA, and RNA derived from their origin cells. It is also known that exosomes are involved in tumor metastasis, angiogenesis, and antitumor immunity in cancer cells. These biological functions are probably due to the glycosylation on their membrane proteins. Thus, the study of glycosylation of exosomes will be another potential source of new biomarker. However, there is a little study about the glycosylation of exosomes. Here, we targeted and analyzed N-glycans of exosomes derived from five cancer cell lines (A549, PC9, PC9/ZD, MCF-7, and MDA-MB231) using nano-LC/MS. We also have compared glycans of exosomes with glycans on their origin cell membrane to examine glycosylation correlation between origin cells and exosomes on cancer cell lines. Additionally, we have compared anticancer drug resistant cell line PC9/ZD (Gefitinib resistant) and untreated PC9 in terms of origin cells and exosomes glycan profiling <italic>via</italic> isomer separation. Exosomes and cell membranes were prepared from three lung cancer cell lines: A549, PC9, and PC9/ZD. And two breast cancer cell lines: MCF-7 and MDA-MB231. These two types of samples were isolated by ultracentrifugation. Glycans were directly released by PNGase F, and then enriched by graphitized carbon solid phase extraction. Nano-LC/chip Q-TOF MS was used for overall glycan profiling and quantitation. We successfully release and profile N-glycans from exosomes. Origin cells and exosomes of lung cancer contain high-mannose glycans in abundance. Although, exosomes have less high-mannose glycans compared with origin cells. Both origin cells and exosomes, isomer separation of sialylated glycans are different between PC9 and PC9/ZD. On breast cancer exosomes, two different metastatic samples represent quite different profiling. This is the first study of comprehensive glycan profiling of exosomes using mass spectrometry.</p><p><bold>316: Isolation and Identification of Hyaluronan-degrading Bacterial Strain and Anti-obesity Effects of Low-molecular Weight Hyaluronan</bold></p><p><bold>Chang Won Lee</bold><sup><bold>1†</bold></sup><bold>, Joo Woong Park</bold><sup><bold>2†</bold></sup><bold>, Woon Seop Shin</bold><sup><bold>3</bold></sup><bold>, Doo Jin Choi</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Jisun Lee</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Seul Lee</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Ji Won Choi</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Young Hwan Kim</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup>, <bold>and</bold><bold><underline>Yong II Park</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold>*</sup>; <sup>1</sup>Department of Biotechnology, The Catholic University of Korea, Bucheon, Gyeonggi-do 420-743, Korea, <sup>2</sup>Biostream Technologies, Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do 446-930, Korea, <sup>3</sup>The Kwandong University of Korea, Gangneung-si, Gangwon-do 210-701, Korea</p><p>yongil382@catholic.ac.kr</p><p>Hyaluronan (HA), also called hyaluronic acid or hyaluronate, is an anionic, nonsulfated glycosaminoglycan distributed widely throughout connective, epithelial, and neural tissues.

Low-molecular weight HA (LMW-HA) was produced from the high-molecular weight HA (HMW-HA, 1,922 kDa) after the reaction with a portion of culture filtrate as a crude enzyme preparation for 4 h at 30 °C. The molecular weight of the reaction product (LMW-HA) was estimated to be approximately 43.5 kDa by size exclusion HPLC (SEC). The anti-adipogenic effect of LMW-HA was evaluated using 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells. Both LMW-HA and HMW-HA did not show any detectable level of cytotoxicity on 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells at up to 200 μg/ml. Previously, we showed that LMW-HA causes a significant reduction in intracellular lipid drops by 53 % when measured by Oil Red O staining while the HMW-HA showed no effect. The mRNA expression of PPAR-γ and aP2 in 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells maintained in adipocyte-induction media with 200 μg/ml LMW-HA significantly and dose-dependently decreased by 56 % and 55 %, respectively, whereas HMW-HA treatment resulted in only negligible effect (5 % and 5 % reduction, respectively). PPAR-γ and aP2 are known as the major adipocyte differentiation specific markers. In the present study, we attempted to further confirm these observations by measuring intracellular triglyceride (TG) levels and the levels of differentiation marker proteins like PPAR-γ and aP2. When measured by TG Colorimetric Assay Kit (sigma), the TG level in LMW-HA treated cells significantly, dose-dependently decreased by 53 % at 200 μg/ml. Western blot analysis also showed dose-dependent decreases in the protein levels of PPAR-γ and aP2 in LMW-HA treated cells. Taken collectively, these results clearly suggested that the LMW-HA may have an anti-obesity effect by inhibition of the differentiation of preadipocyte cells whereas the higher molecular weight HA (HMW-HA) have no anti-obesity effect.</p><p><sup>†</sup> These two authors contributed equally to this work.</p><p><bold>317: The Identification of Nucleocytoplasmic Shuttling Mechnism of O-GlcNAcase and Its PTMs</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Yeon Jung Kim</underline></bold><sup>1</sup><bold>, Jin Won Cho</bold><sup><bold>1, 2</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup>Department of Biology, Yonsei University, Seoul, 120-749, Korea, <sup>2</sup>Department of integrated OMICS for Biomedical Science, WCU Program of Graduate School,Yonsei University, Seoul, 120-749, Korea</p><p>scientist@yonsei.ac.kr</p><p><italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcase (OGA) is the enzyme which catalyzes the removal of <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc moiety on its substrates. This enzyme has two isoforms, full OGA and variant OGA that has alternative stop codon within intron which is not spliced-out. As a result, variant OGA lacks C-terminal HAT (histone acetyl transferase) domain and it contains additional 15 amino acids. People believed that full OGA exists both in cytosol and nucleus, primarily to the cytoplasm. There were two opposite reports about the subcellular localization of OGA isoforms by different research groups. The first group figured out that full OGA localizes in cytoplasm, whereas variant OGA exists within nucleus in 2001.

Alg1 protein physically interacts with Alg2 and Alg11 manosyltransferases, which together catalyze the five mannose additions on the ER cytosolic face. To further understanding of how these mannosyltransferases function, we have undertaken a structural and functional study on eukaryotic Alg1 proteins. The <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Alg1p contains 449 amino acids (51.9 kDa) with a hydrophobic region near the N-terminal. Sequence analysis reveals its structural homology to the heterodimeric Alg13/14 UDP-GlcNAc transferase, which produces GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>-PP-dolichol intermediate before the reaction of adding first mannose by Alg1. Guided by the structural information of Alg1p, our molecular biological studies demonstrated that N-terminal hydrophobic region of Alg1 works as a transmembrane domain and is required for its ER membrane localization. Deletion of this domain clearly stabilized the Alg1 protein indicating its possibility to works as a target for protein degradation. Like the Alg13/14 complex, scAlg1p possesses a second membrane association site, which contributes to an integral interaction with ER membrane. Interestingly, human Alg1p seems lack such domain, might be due to the evolutional necessary. In the presentation, we also will discuss the protein regions of Alg1p required for the interaction with other mannosyltransferases.</p><p>* Corresponding Author</p><p><bold>320: Nuclear localization of</bold><bold><italic>O</italic></bold><bold>-GlcNAc transferase is regulated by its own</bold><bold><italic>O</italic></bold><bold>-GlcNAc modification</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Hyeon Gyu Seo</underline></bold><bold>, Ryum Joo Hwan and Jin Won Cho;</bold> Department of Systems Biology, Yonsei University, Seodaemun-gu, 120-749, Seoul, Korea</p><p>hyeongyuseo@gmail.com</p><p>It has been reported that one of the downstream molecules generated from glucose is uridine diphosphate-N-acetly glucosamine(UDP-GlcNAc) <italic>via</italic> the hexoamine biopsynthetic pathway (HBP).

Mouse thymocytes that were unadsorbed on a PNA-coated dish (PNA<sup>unad</sup> T) include mainly sialylated mature (single positive) T cells and some poorly glycosylated immature (double negative) T cells, while double-positive immature cells adsorbed on the dish. We prepared PNA<sup>unad</sup> T and analyzed the cells by flow cytometory after staining with PNA-FITC. When the cells were incubated in PBS alone, the cells were stained more intensively with PNA-FITC than before incubation, suggesting that some sialic acids were removed from the cells during incubation. Thus, PNA<sup>unad</sup> T includes cells having a sialidase on their surface. We therefore tried to identify the glycoprotein from which sialic acids were removed. We found two bands by Western-blot analysis, around 62 and 70 kDa, that were stained more strongly by PNA after incubating the PNA<sup>unad</sup> T in PBS alone than those without incubation, while we detected two new bands, 97 and 100 kDa, after incubating the cells with a soluble cytosolic fraction from the thymus. We conclude that sialic acids on PNA<sup>unad</sup> T were removed by a sialidase existing on the cell surface during incubation, not by a soluble sialidase released from dead cells. After removal of sialic acids from the cell surface by exogenous sialidase, apoptotic cell death was observed by FITC-annexin histogram analysis. We also showed that the 62- and 70-kDa bands corresponded to the bands detected with anti-CD5 antibody. CD5 is a cell surface glycoprotein expressed on T and B cells. In the thymus, CD5 is expressed in double-positive and single positive thymocytes and reported to tuning the interaction of the TCR and self-peptide:MHC complex. Really if the 62- and 70-kDa bands are CD5, this sialidase on the cell surface seems to have an important role in the thymus.

We confirmed through our study, that a decrease of glucose in media can be observed during cell culturing. Along with this change, O-GlcNAcylation level also appeared to decrease. A comparison was made between a glucose-concentration-maintained sample and a non-maintained sample, and a difference in insulin sensitivity, indicated by phosphor-Akt, was observed. GSK-3beta, a downstream target protein, was also found to be less phosphorylated under glucose maintained condition meaning the level of activated Akt decreased. These findings are evidences supporting the occurrence of the crosstalk between O-GlcNAcylation and O-phosphorylation on Akt. From these results we can also hypothesize that the signal transduction can be influences by the natural change of glucose concentration in the media during cell culturing.</p><p><bold>324: Self-Evolving Oxidative Stress With Identifiable Pre- and Postmitochondrial Phases in PC12 Cells</bold></p><p><bold>Ganlin Zhang</bold><sup><bold>1,2</bold></sup><bold>, Xiaoxin Zhu</bold><sup><bold>3</bold></sup><bold>, Morin Christophe</bold><sup>1</sup><bold>, Ping Li</bold><sup><bold>4</bold></sup><bold>, Xiaomin Wang</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Guowang Yang</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, </bold><bold><underline>Dulce Papy-Garcia</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup>; <sup>1</sup>Laboratoire CRRET, EAC CNRS 7149, Faculté des Sciences et Technologie, Université Paris Est Créteil, France, <sup>2</sup>Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, affiliated with Capital Medical University, Beijing, People’s Republic of China, <sup>3</sup>Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, People’s Republic of China, <sup>4</sup>Beijing Institute of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, People’s Republic of China</p><p><bold>Abstract:</bold> During the neurodegenerative process in several brain diseases, oxidative stress is known to play important roles in disease severity and evolution. Although early events of stress, such as increased lipid peroxidation and decreased superoxide dismutase, are known to characterize early onsets of these diseases, little is known about the events that participate in maintaining the chronic evolving phase influencing the disease pro- gression in neurons. Here, we used differentiated PC12 cells to identify premitochondrial and postmitochondrial events occurring during the oxidative stress cascade leading to apoptosis. Our data indicate that an acute and strong oxidative impulse (500 lM H2O2, 30 min) can induce, in this model, a 24-hr self-evolving stress, which advances from a premitochondrial phase characterized by lysosomes and cathepsin B and D translocations to cytosol and early mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization. This phase lasts for about 5 hr and is followed by a postmitochondrial phase distinguished by mitochondrial membrane depolarization, reactive oxygen species increase, caspase-9 and caspase-3 activations, and apoptosis. Inhibition of cathepsins B and D suggests that cells can be protected at the premitochondrial phase of stress evolution and that new cathepsins regulators, such as glycosaminoglycans mimetics, can be considered as new therapeutic prototypes for neurodegeneration. Insofar as early oxidative stress markers have been related to the early onset of neurodegeneration, strategies protecting cells at the premitochondrial phase of oxidative stress may have important therapeutic applications.</p><p><bold>Key words:</bold> neurodegeneration; lysosome; cathepsin; apoptosis; glycosaminoglycans</p><p><bold>325: HBV infection downregulates miR-122 contributes to Sorafenib resistance by targeting GALNT10 in hepatocellular carcinoma</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Qian Wu</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Jiejie Xu</bold><sup><bold>1,2,</bold>*</sup><bold>, Jianxin Gu</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup>; <sup>1</sup>Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, <sup>2</sup>Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology, Ministry of Education and Health, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China</p><p>jjxufdu@fudan.edu.cn</p><p>The pathological relevance and significance of microRNAs (miRNAs) in hepatocarcinogenesis have attracted much attention in recent years; however little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms through which miRNAs are involved in the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we demonstrated that miR-122 is frequently down-regulated in HCC and that its expression is further suppressed by hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx). Furthermore, the reduced expression of miR-122 could be rescued by over-expression of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α). GALNT10 (N- acetylgalactosamine transferase-10) was identified as the direct and functional target of miR-122 with integrated bioinformatics analysis and messenger RNA array assay. This regulation was further confirmed by luciferase reporter assays. In addition, our results, for the first time, showed that GALNT10 was frequently increased in HCC by way of immunohistochemical staining assays. The increased expression of the GALNT10 significantly inhibited, whereas knockdown of the GALNT10 markedly enhanced sorafenib induced cell apoptosis and proliferation inhibition in HBx transfected hepatomca cells. Conclusion: The newly identified miR-122/GALNT10 axis elucidates the molecular mechanism of HBV-related HCC sorafenib resistance and represents a new potential therapeutic target for HCC treatment.</p><p><bold>326: HBV promotes migration and invasion of hepatoma cells through miR-9 mediated down-regulation of GALNT4</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Yidong Liu</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Jiejie Xu</bold><sup><bold>1,2</bold>*</sup><bold>, Jianxin Gu</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup>; <sup>1</sup>Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, <sup>2</sup>Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology, Ministry of Education and Health, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.</p><p>jjxufdu@fudan.edu.cn</p><p>Recent evidence indicates that aberrant O-glycosylation may play a critical role during tumorigenesis including the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Polypeptide GalNAc-transferases are a number of enzymes which are responsible for the initiation of mucin-type O-linked protein glycosylation, in which N-acetylgalactosamine is transferred to serine and threonine amino acid residues. Here, we found that HBV down-regulates GALNT4 expression significantly in HCC cells. And over-expression of GALNT4 <italic>in vitro</italic> can attenuate HBV driving migration and invasion of HCC cells. Further studies showed that HBV activates NF-κB to up-regulate miR-9, which directly targets the 3′UTR of GALNT4 mRNA to promote its degradation, thus the deregulation of GALNT4 mediating O-glycosylation induces malignant behavior of HCC cells. Moreover, we found an inverse correlation between GALNT4 and HBV infection in HCC clinical specimens. Taken together, this study reveals a novel regulatory circuit adopted by HBV, which may contribute in part to migration and invasion of HCC cells. Hence, strategies that blockade this circuit might be developed to eliminate the metastatic potential of HCC cells conferred by HBV.</p><p><bold>327: Galectin-9 affects phagocytosis in THP-1 cells</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Chi-Shan Li</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Dan Hsu</bold><sup><bold>1,2</bold></sup><bold>, Fu-Tong Liu</bold><sup><bold>1,2</bold></sup><bold>, Huan-Yuan Chen</bold><sup><bold>1,2</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup>Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica,Taiwan, <sup>2</sup>Department of Dermatology, University of California, Davis, School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA, USA</p><p>chishan@ibms.sinica.edu.tw</p><p>Galectin-9 (Gal9), a member of the beta-galactoside-binding animal lectin family, is involved in various cellular biological events, including tumor cell adhesion, metastasis, and modulation of various immune responses.

A large body of experimental and clinical work supports the view that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a relevant target for lung cancer therapy. Somatic mutations within the tyrosine kinase domain of <italic>EGFR</italic> are the most reliable predictors of response to <italic>EGFR</italic> tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), such as Iressa (Gefitnib), in patients with NSCLC. Deletions in exon 19 and a point mutation L858R in exon 21 account for over 90 % of all sensitizing mutations and result in the constitutive activation of EGFR that promote cell proliferation and survival. Galectins are a family of evolutionary-conserved carbohydrate-binding proteins. They are distributed widely in organisms and have been implicated in many essential functions including development, differentiation, cell-cell adhesion, cell-matrix interaction, growth regulation and apoptosis. Several members of the galectin family have also been shown to be involved in cancer progression and metastasis. Galectin-1 and -3 can mediate neoplastic transformation and cell cycle progression by regulating ras activity and cell-cycle regulators expression. Our Q-PCR data indicate that galectin-1, -3 and -7 are expressed in lung cancer cells with distinct EGFR status. Galectin-1 has been reported to be an important factor to promote lung cancer progression and chemoresistance. However, role of galectin-3 and -7 are still unclear in lung cancer. In our preliminary data, knockdown of galectin-3 reduced cellular ability of migration, proliferation, colony formation and anchorage-independent cell growth in several lung cancer cells. Overexpression of galectin-7 reduced cell proliferation, invasion and migration in PC9 cells. Interestingly, overexpression of galectin-7 led to Iressa resistance in both CL100 and PC9 cells. Comparing to parental PC9 cells, higher galectin-7 level was observed in PC9-IR, an acquired resistant cell, suggesting the correlation between galectin-7 and Iressa sensitivity. Taken together, galectin-3 and -7 may play an important role in mediating lung cancer progression and resistance to TKIs therapy in lung cancer.</p><p><bold>329: Wnt/β-catenin up-regulates hFUT8 expression in hepatocarcinoma cell SMMC-7721</bold></p><p><bold>Nanyang Li</bold><sup>♣</sup><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Lijun Zhang</bold><sup>♣</sup><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Linhua Liu</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Shujing Wang</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Jianhui Fan</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>,</bold><bold><underline>Jianing Zhang</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup>*<bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup> Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Glycobiology, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116044, Liaoning Province, China</p><p><sup><italic>♣</italic></sup><italic>These authors contributed equally to this work.</italic></p><p><italic>*Correspondence to: Jianing Zhang</italic></p><p>jnzhang@dlmedu.edu.cn</p><p>Wnt signaling plays important role in determining cell fate during embryogenesis and maintaining the tissue homeostasis after birth. β-catenin is a key component of Wnt signaling and mediates canonical Wnt pathway. The protein glycosylaiton is widely exit of the organism and is closely related to the disease. Fucosylation is one of the glycosylation and is catalyzed by Fucosyltransferase. Fucosyltransferase 8 (FUT8) is only one enzyme to catalyze α1, 6-fucosylation in mammals. Up-regulation of FUT8 has been observed in several malignant cancers including liver, ovarian, thyroid, and colorectal cancers. However, the pathological role and the regulatory mechanism of FUT8 in cancers remain largely unknown. In this study, we report that FUT8 is up-regulated by Wnt signaling activator LiCl and overexpressed β-catenin in hepatocarcinoma cell line SMMC-7721. In contrast, knocking down β-catenin can down-regulates expression levels of FUT8 in SMMC-7721.

Here, we identified a novel GPI-cleaving enzyme. PGAP3 is required for the removal of an unsaturated fatty acid from GPI lipid at the Golgi apparatus, which is essential for GPI fatty acid remodeling.

PGAP6a is a transmembrane protein conserved among metazoa and was mainly localized at the cell surface. In PGAP6a overexpressing cells, surface expressions of several GPI-anchored proteins including CD55, CD59 and Sca-1 were significantly decreased.

These inhibitory effects were enhanced when CD82 is in conjunction with GM3 or particularly with GM2/GM3. (ii) Reduction of CD82 expression by RNA interference and depletion of glycosphingolipids with P4 together, significantly enhanced cell motility and increased expression of EGFR and activation of EGFR at tyr1173 stimulated by EGF; however, increased cell motility and activation of cMet at tyr1313 and tyr1365 stimulated by HGF, were not only due to the effect of decreased CD82 alone but also on account of the effect of increased GM3. Furthermore, CD82 selectively attenuated EGFR and cMet signaling <italic>via</italic> phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt,but had no affect on the activity of MAPK signaling pathway. These results suggest that the different effects of CD82 and synergistic effects with GM3 and GM2/GM3 on the phosphorylation and expression of EGFR and cMet may be associated with a mechanism by which CD82 exerts inhibitory actions on the motility and migration of Hepa1-6 cells induced by EGF and HGF <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p><bold>Poster Session II-Physiology &amp; Signalling</bold></p><p><bold>333: α1, 6-Fucosylation bidirectionally regulates TGF-β/activin-mediated signaling</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Wei Gu</underline></bold><bold>, Tomohiko Fukuda, Tomoya Isaji, Hirokazu Hashimoto, Yuqin Wang and Jianguo Gu;</bold> Division of Regulatory Glycobiology, Institute of Molecular Biomembrane and Glycobiology, Tohoku Pharmaceutical University, 4-4-1 Komatsushima, Aoba-ku, Sendai Miyagi, 981-8558, Japan</p><p>jgu@tohoku-pharm.ac.jp</p><p>It is well known that α1,6-fucosyltransferase (Fut8) and its products, α1,6-fucosylated N-glycans, are highly expressed in brain tissue. Recently, we reported that <italic>Fut8</italic>-knockout mice exhibited multiple behavioral abnormalities with a schizophrenia-like phenotype, suggesting that α1,6-fucosylation plays important roles in the brain and neuron system. In the present study, we screened several neural cell lines, and found that PC12 cells express the highest levels of α1,6-fucosylation. The knockdown (KD) of Fut8 promoted a significant enhancement of neurite formation and induction of neurofilament expression. Surprisingly, the levels of phospho-Smad2 were greatly increased in the KD cells. Finally, we found that the activin-mediated signal pathway was essential for these changes in KD cells. Exogenous activin, not transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), induced neurite outgrowth and phospho-Smad2. In addition, the α1,6-fucosylation level on the activin receptor 2A was greatly decreased in KD cells, whiles the total expression level was unchanged, suggesting that α1,6-fucosylation negatively regulated activin-mediated signaling. Furthermore, inhibition of activin receptor-mediated signaling or restoration of Fut8 expression rescued cell morphology and phospho-Smad2 levels, which were enhanced in KD cells. Considering the fact that α1, 6-fucosylation is important for TGF-β-mediated signaling, the results of this study strongly suggest that Fut8 plays a dual role in TGF-β/activin-mediated signaling.</p><p><bold>334: The effect of an alginic acid from</bold><bold><italic>Sargassum fusiforme</italic></bold><bold>on NF-κB signaling pathway</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Qifei Cong</underline></bold><bold>, Xinyan Ni, Qun Dong, Kan Ding;</bold> Glycobiology and Glycochemistry Lab.

Alginate is a linear polysaccharide containing 1,4-linked β-D-mannuronic acid (M) and 1,4-linked α-L-guluronic acid (G) in various proportions dependent on the algal species and growth conditions, arranged in either homogeneous or heterogeneous block patterns. As an effort to find immunoregulatory polysaccharides, we try to obtain the polysaccharide fractions and evaluate their NF-κB activation or inhibition activity. An alginic acid polysaccharide, 04S2P, was isolated from <italic>Sargassum fusiforme</italic>, by boiling water extraction, DEAE-Cellulose anion-exchange chromatography, and Sephacryl S-300 HR gel permeation chromatography, as well as by acid precipitation. The average molecular weight of 04S2P, as determined by high performance gel permeation chromatography, was 29.2 kDa. The sugar compositions, as characterized by high performance liquid chromatography method of pre-column derivatization with 1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone (PMP), were mannuronic acid and guluronic acid. The molar ratio of mannuronic acid to guluronic acid was estimated to be 7.5: 1.0, according to integral of anomeric proton resonances in <sup>1</sup>H NMR. According to HSQC and HMBC analysis, the mannuronic acid is found to be β-1,4-linked, while guluronic acid is α-1,4-linked, as in common alginate. The nuclear kappa B (NF-κB) pathway plays a key role in the signaling transduction in many pathological events, particularly in the innate immune response. To investigate the activity and mechanism of action of the algal polysaccharides on immune system, the effect of 04S2P on NF-κB signaling pathway was tested, and the result showed that the activation rate was close to 52 %. However, 04S2P displayed no significant activation after the sample was treated with Affi-Prep polymyxin matrix to remove endotoxin. In comparison, commercial alginate with a lower molar ratio of M/G (1.9:1) demonstrated an obvious inhibition to NF-kB even after endotoxin was removed. Therefore, the M/G molar ratio, glycosyl sequence, and the contamination of endotoxin in alginic acid all probably contribute to its activity on NF-κB signaling pathway.</p><p><bold>335: Structure characterization of a glucuronoxylan isolated from</bold><bold><italic>Cassia obtusifolia</italic></bold><bold>seeds and its effect on NF-κB signaling pathway</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Qifei Cong</underline></bold><bold>, Mingsheng Shang, Xinyan Ni, Qun Dong, Kan Ding;</bold> Glycobiology and Glycochemistry Lab.

In this study, a heteroxylan, designated as COB1B1S2, was isolated from the alkaline extract of the whole seeds of <italic>C. obtusifolia</italic>, by ethanol precipitation, DEAE-cellulose anion-exchange chromatography, and Sephacryl S-300 gel permeation chromatography. Using chemical and spectroscopic methods, the polysaccharide was elucidated to be a glucuronoxylan. Its average molecular weight was estimated to be 70.4 kDa. The polysaccharide, as determined by HPLC after pre-column derivatization with 1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone (PMP), contains xylose, glucuronic acid, in the molar ratio of 7.8: 1.0. Combined with methylation analysis and NMR spectroscopy, COB1B1S2 was elucidated to contain a poly-(1→4)-β-D-xylose backbone, with α-D-glucuronosyl residues as branches, substituted exclusively at O-2 position. Interestingly, no 4-O-methyl-D-glucuronic acid was identified, which is reported to be present in most heteroxylans, and this characterizes COB1B1S2 as a novel glucuronoxylan different from those reported previously. As one of the most important nuclear factors, NF-κB takes part in the signaling transduction in the innate immune system. To investigate the biological activity of the xylans on immune system, the effect of COB1B1S2 on NF-κB signaling pathway was tested, and the result showed that the activation rate was close to 77 %. Furthermore, the polysaccharide remains to exhibit an activation rate of 40 % even after it was treated with Affi-Prep polymyxin matrix to remove possible endotoxin contamination. In conclusion, a novel glucuronoxylan was isolated from <italic>Cassia obtusifolia</italic> seeds, and it was shown to be capable of activating NF-κB signaling pathway, indicating a potential immunostimulatory activity.</p><p><bold>336: Mice lacking fucosyltransferase 8 exhibit abnormal behavioral abnormalities associated with a schizophrenia-like phenotype</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Tomohiko Fukuda</underline></bold><bold>, Wei Gu, Tomoya Isaji, Naoyuki Taniguchi, and Jianguo Gu;</bold> Division of Regulatory Glycobiology, Institute of Molecular Biomembrane and Glycobiology, Tohoku Pharmaceutical University, 4-4-1 Komatsushima, Aoba-ku, Sendai Miyagi, 981-8558, Japan, Disease Glycomics Team, RIKEN, Advanced Science Institute, Wako 351-0198, Japan</p><p>tfukuda@tohoku-pharm.ac.jp</p><p>α1,6-Fucosyltransferase (Fut8) catalyzes the transfer of a fucose residue from GDP-fucose to position 6 of the innermost GlcNAc residue to form α1,6-fucose in hybrid and complex N-linked oligosaccharides of glycoproteins. α1,6-Fucosylated glycoproteins are abundantly present in brain tissue. We investigated the physiological functions of α1,6-fucose in brain tissue by using Fut8-deficient (Fut8KO) mice. We examined Fut8KO mice using a combination of neurological and behavioral tests. Fut8KO mice exhibited multiple behavioral abnormalities consistent with a schizophrenia-like phenotype. Fut8KO mice displayed increased locomotion compared with wild-type and heterozygous mice. In particular, Fut8KO mice showed strenuous hopping behavior in a novel environment. Novelty-induced hyperactivity has been viewed as a preclinical model of the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and of psychomotor agitation in particular. Working memory performance was impaired in Fut8KO mice as evidenced by the Y-maze tests. Deficits in social interaction are hallmarks of schizophrenia. Furthermore, Fut8KO mice showed prepulse inhibition (PPI) deficiency, which had been reported in schizophrenia patient as well as mouse models. These results suggest that reduced expression of Fut8 is a plausible cause of schizophrenia and related disorders. Because locomotor hyperactivity is commonly associated with increased monoamine tone, the effect of Fut8 deficiency on monoamine turnover was determined by HPLC. The levels of serotonin metabolites were significantly decreased in both the striatum and nucleus accumbens of the Fut8KO mice. Likewise, treatment with haloperidol, which is an antipsychotic drug that antagonizes dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors significantly reduced hopping behaviors. Based on these results, we hypothesize that the balance between dopaminergic and serotonergic signaling might be disrupted in the Fut8KO mice.</p><p>Recently, Electrophysiologic data of hippocampal CA1 region showed the long-term potentiation was decreased in Fut8KO mice, compared with Wild-type mice. Although the detailed underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear, the present study is the first to clearly demonstrate that α1,6-fucosylation plays an important role in the brain, and that it might be related to schizophrenia-like behaviors.</p><p><bold>337: GnT-V expression levels regulate colon cancer stem cells and colon adenoma progression of</bold><bold><italic>Apcmin/</italic></bold><bold>+ mice through a canonical Wnt signaling pathway</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Huabei Guo</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold>*</sup><bold>, Heather Johnson</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Tamas Nagy</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, and Michael Pierce</bold><sup><bold>1</bold>*</sup><bold>;</bold> Department of <sup>1</sup> Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, and <sup>2</sup> Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia, Athens, GA,30606</p><p><italic>*Address correspondence: Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, 315 Riverbend Rd.

Our recent results show that deletion of GnT-V, which catalyzes a specific modification of N-glycans with β(1,6) branching, reduced the size of the compartment of CSC in the her-2 mouse model, consequently leading to a inhibited tumor onset. GnT-V expression is increased during the oncogenesis of human colorectal cancer, including adenoma formation. In the present study, the regulation of colon CSC and colon adenoma development were investigated both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Overexpression of GnT-V increased anchorage-independent cell growth and tumor formation induced by injection of colon tumor cells into NOD/SCID mice, indicating a regulation of cell proliferation and tumorigenicity by GnT-V. Using Apcmin/+ mice with different GnT-V backgrounds, we found that knockout of GnT-V had no significant effect on intestine (colon) adenoma formation (number of adenoma/mouse), but adenoma size was remarkably reduced, which was accompanied by increased survival of <italic>ApcMin/+</italic> mice with GnT-V deletion (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), suggesting an inhibition in the progression of colon adenoma caused by deletion of GnT-V. Increased expression level of GnT-V up-regulated the population of colon (intestine) CSC by affecting their self-renewal, and their tumorigenicity in NOD/SCID mice. Furthermore, altered nuclear translocation of β-catenin and expression of Wnt target genes were observed after aberrant expression of GnT-V, indicating the regulation of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling by GnT-V. These results demonstrate that GnT-V expression and its branched N-glycan products effectively modulate Wnt signaling pathway that, in turn, regulates the relative proportion of colon CSC, as well as colon tumor development, thereby providing a potential therapeutic target for the inhibition of colon carcinoma progression.</p><p><bold>338: Study of Chitosan oligosaccharide inducing resistance to TMV virus on</bold><bold><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic></bold><bold>and its resistance pathway</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Qingshan Meng</underline></bold><sup><bold>1,2</bold></sup><bold>, Yin Heng</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Duyu Guang</bold><sup><bold>1</bold>*</sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup>Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian 116023 China; <sup>2</sup>Dalian Ocean University, Dalian 116023 China</p><p>dyguang@gmail.com</p><p>Many recent researches have found chitosan oligosaccharide is an effective elicitor which can induce plant to resist against pathogen.

A member of this family, ppGalNAc-T13, has been found highly and restrictively expressed in the brain and neurons. In this study, we have explored the effect of ppGalNAc-T13 on mouse neural differentiation. We found that the mRNA expression of ppGalNAc-T13 was dramatically increasing during the process of mouse brain development and the maturation of primary neuronal cultures. P19 mouse embryonal carcinoma cells can be induced by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) to differentiate into neural cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. Similarly, ppGalNAc-T13 expression was increasing from the later period of ATRA treatment to neural differentiation stage of P19 cells, accompanying with elevated <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation level. Interestingly, without ATRA treatment, overexpressing ppGalNAc-T13 in P19 cells induced the formation of projection-like structures and improved the <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation level as well.

Post-translational modifications may help archaeal proteins overcome the challenges presented by their surroundings. In Archaea, the cell wall consists solely of S-layer protein lattices, which are glycosylated by both <italic>N</italic>- and <italic>O</italic>-glycans. However, as compared with the glycosylation in eukaryotes and bacteria, less is known of the post-translational modification in archaea.</p><p>As S-layer glycoproteins have been widely used as reporter proteins to study post-translational modifications in archaea, in this study we identified the S-layer glycoprotein from halophilic archaeon <italic>Haloarcula hispanica</italic> by MALDI-TOF and confirmed its glycosylation through SDS-PAGE glycoprotein staining and chemical deglycosylation. Then glycans were released from purified S-layer glycoprotein and subjected to HPLC separation and ESI-Mass. It turned out that <italic>H. hispanica</italic> S-layer glcoprotein was decorated by neutral disaccharide containing a glucose and a galactose, moreover, acidic oligosaccharide containing a glucose and a unknown sulfurted or phosphated monosaccharide.</p><p>Furthermore, two putative genes that are invovled in glycosylation were identified in <italic>H. hispanica</italic>, namely <italic>pmt1</italic> and <italic>pmt2</italic>. RT-PCR analysis showed that both genes were actively transcripted during early log phase. Deletion of <italic>pmt1</italic> led to a complete loss of glycosylation on S-layer glycoprotein and reduced stability of the S-layer, while the mutant lacking <italic>pmt2</italic> was unable to modify S-layer glycoprotein with acidic oligosaccharide. Both <italic>H. hispanica</italic> mutants showed a retarded growth at high salt conditions as compare with the wild type. These results suggest that glycosylation may play an important role in maintaining intact and stable cell envelope in hypersaline surroundings and thus ensure survival of <italic>H. hispanica</italic> in this extreme environment. Further investigations of these two genes are undertaken.</p><p><bold>Poster Session II-Infection &amp; Immunity</bold></p><p><bold>346: CLEC-2 was involved in the phagocytosis of microglia by interacting with its ligand podoplanin</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Tao Tao</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Aiguo Shen</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup>; <sup>1</sup>Department of Immunology, Medical Colledge, Nantong University, Nantong, 226001, P.R.

Because dead neurons may both initiate and accelerate disease progression, clearing dead neurons from extracellular spaces may be critical. It is well-kown that dead neurons are quickly removed through phagocytosis by the microglia. It is reported that CLEC-2 is a phagocytic activation receptor expressed on myeloid cells and its ligand podoplanin is expressed in apoptotic cells.

Recently, intense researches have been focused on isolation and bioactivities investigation of polysaccharides from this mushroom.

In this study, two homogeneous polysaccharides named GFPBW1 (300 kDa) and GFPBW2 (27.3 kDa) were purified from the fruit bodies of <italic>Grifola frondosa</italic>. Using various methods such as IR, NMR, methylation, monosaccharide composition analysis, partial acid hydrolysis, and Smith degradation, GFPBW1 was determined to be a β-D-(1-3)-linked glucan backbone with a single β-D-(1-6)-linked glucopyranosyl residue branched at C-6 on every third residue.

Meanwhile, both of them could activate Syk and enhance TNF-α production in RAW264.7 cells overexpressing wild type but not mutant dectin-1. Furthermore, Syk/NF-κB signaling and cytokines release in resident peritoneal macrophages induced by them were significantly inhibited by a specific dectin-1 blocking reagent, laminarin. In addition, two polysaccharides also activated the transcriptional activity of NF-κB through toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 in the luciferase reporter HEK293/NF-κB cells expressing TLR2 but not TLR4 and dectin-1. Moreover, they induced antitumor activity against Sarcoma 180 allografts growth in ICR mice accompanied with increased splenic indices but not in immunodeficient nude mice. These results indicated that both GFPBW1 and GFPBW2 were effective immunomodulator and inhibited tumor growth mainly through activation of macrophages and inducing secretion of cytokines <italic>via</italic> dectin-1 and TLR2 receptors, and GFPBW1 showed a better effect than GFPBW2.

PRR downstream signaling results in production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and other mediators that define the pathogenic curse of disease. Moreover, PRR engagement in antigen-presenting cells initiates the activation of adaptive immunity. C-type lectins like galectins are conserved receptors recognizing carbohydrate structures on viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungi. C-type lectins such as DC-SIGN, langerin, and dectin-1 and galectins are expressed by dendritic cell subsets and macrophages. Pathogen recognition by those proteins triggers signaling pathways that lead to the expression of specific cytokines which subsequently instruct adaptive T helper immune responses. No systematic analysis of the interaction between PRRs and pathogens has been carried to date. Among the main human PRR systems described so far we can find the C-type lectin and galectin families. Here we present the binding profile of representative C-type lectins (langerin, intelectin-1, DC-SIGN, dectin-1 and mincle) and some galectin (1,3,4,7,8) against parasite protozoans (pathogenic and non-pathogenic) from the Kinetoplastidae family (<italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> and <italic>T. rangeli</italic> as well as several <italic>Leishmania</italic> species) as a first step to delineate the hypothesis that differential recognition by innate immune system components may lead to differential and specific responses to each parasite and subsequent pathology. The data presented suggest that indeed there is a differential recognition profile that is able to distinguish pathogenic from non-pathogenic species inside a genus and furthermore able to discriminate tissue tropism among a similar pathogenic group.</p><p><bold>349: The functional studies of</bold><bold><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic></bold><bold>Rv0431, a cell wall protein</bold></p><p><bold><underline>Guoying Deng</underline></bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Jian Kang</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Yufang Ma</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>;</bold><sup>1</sup> Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalian Medical University, Dlian, 116044, China; <sup>2</sup> Department of Microbiology, Dalian Medical University, Dlian, 116044, China</p><p>yufang_ma@hotmail.com</p><p>Once <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> is inhaled and exposed to host immune cells, the immune responses including innate immunity and adapted immunity to the pathogen occur.

This finding indicated pD-HSP90C was able to elicit the protective immune responses against systemic candidiasis by inducing the production of IgG, IgG2b, IgG1, IL-2, and IL-4 in sera of mice; pD-HSP90C reduced greatly colony forming unites (CFU) of <italic>C.albican</italic> in the kidneys of mice, which were challenged with living <italic>C. albican</italic> cells after immunization with pD-HSP90C.

More importantly, it was found that the mice immunized with pD-HSP90C/PPSB-40 μg not only had fewer CFU in the kidneys than mice immunized with pD-HSP90C, but also a statistically significant higher survival rate over PBS-injected group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) when the immunized mice were challenged with living <italic>C. albican</italic> cells. However, no statistically significant difference in survival rate was observed between pD-HSP90C-immunized group and PBS-injected group. Therefore, pD-HSP90C could be a useful candidate for the development of DNA vaccine against systemic candidiasis; PPSB can be considered as a promising adjuvant eliciting both Th1 and Th2 responses to enhance the efficacy of DNA vaccines.

Due to the involvement of MPs in the pathogenesis of this mycosis, it is important to characterize the chemical structure and the biological function of these molecules. The first step for these studies is to obtain a good amount of MPs. Thus, the aim of our work was to clone, express and characterize MP98 and MP84 on <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> yeast. A <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> mutant strain (CAP67), deficient in GXM production, was used in this study.

This suggested that the effect of exopolysaccharides production on swarming motility was due to the change of rhamnolipids production. Further investigation demonstrated that overproduction of Psl or/and Pel did decrease rhamnolipids production and the reduction occurred at post-transcriptional level. Previous reports showed that synthesis of exopolysaccharides Psl and Pel competed for sugar precursors and Psl may share sugar precursors with rhamnolipids synthesis pathway. Taking together, this suggested that the synthesis of rhamnolipids competed with exopolysaccharides Psl and Pel for the sugar precursors.
