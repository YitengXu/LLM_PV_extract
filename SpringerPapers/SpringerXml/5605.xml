Each of them contains a reaction centre that is surrounded by light-harvesting antennae, which absorb the light and transfer the excitation energy to the reaction centre where electron transfer reactions are driven. Here we report a critical test for two contrasting models of light harvesting by photosystem II cores, known as the trap-limited and the transfer-to-the trap-limited model. Oriented single crystals of photosystem II core complexes of <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> are excited by polarized visible light and the transient absorption is probed with polarized light in the infrared. The dichroic amplitudes resulting from photoselection are maintained on the 60 ps timescale that corresponds to the dominant energy transfer process providing compelling evidence for the transfer-to-the-trap limitation of the overall light-harvesting process. This finding has functional implications for the quenching of excited states allowing plants to survive under high light intensities.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">There are two common models of photosynthetic light harvesting by photosystem II cores.

In oxygenic photosynthesis, the initial charge separation and electron transfer in photosystem II (PSII) results in water oxidation and oxygen evolution in the oxygen evolving complex, thus sustaining life on earth. Both energy transfer and charge separation in photosynthesis are very fast events that occur with very high quantum efficiency. The underlying electronic and structural dynamics occurring on ultrafast and longer timescales are also very robust to support efficient energy conversion under very different conditions of illumination. This is experimentally demonstrated in this contribution through comparison of the product amplitudes with directional photoselection of very different initial photoexcited populations.</p><p id="Par4">The research of energy and charge dynamics in the PSII has been aided by the availability of high-resolution X-ray structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Recently, time-resolved X-ray crystallography has also probed structural dynamics following electron transfer, using the serial femtosecond crystallography method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Exciton dynamics and charge transfer reactions, however, require spectroscopic probes, and there is a particular need for demonstrating structurally sensitive ultrafast spectroscopic measurements of these processes in natural energy conversion.</p><p id="Par5">In the case of core complexes of PSII of <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic>, 74 chlorin pigments contribute to transient absorption signals during energy-transfer and charge-separation stages. This large number presents a problem of spectral congestion when analyzing time-resolved spectroscopic measurements of isotropic solutions of PSII. Typically, data processing uses target analysis and multicompartment analysis methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Such advanced kinetic modelling analyses the spectral dynamics and provides time domain information but lacks structural information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Alternative nonlinear spectroscopic approaches retrieve coherence and frequency–frequency correlations for coupled pigments, from which structural pathways for energy transfer have been inferred, using structure-based theory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Extension of time-domain dispersive measurements, carried out in this contribution in the mid-infrared spectral region, allows structural analysis from the macroscopic ordering.</p><p id="Par6">According to the trap-limited model, exciton equilibration in the whole PSII core complex (PSIIcc) is fast and reversible electron transfer reactions determine the slow decay time of fluorescence. In contrast, in the transfer to the trap-limited model this decay time reflects slow excitation energy transfer between the core antennae and the reaction centre (RC), where the excitation energy is irreversibly trapped. Theoretical structure-based analysis of PSII ultrafast spectroscopy must use knowledge of the specific site energies of the individual pigments in addition to explicit theory that treats light-harvesting dynamics from first principles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Based on such modelling, it has been suggested that the overall bottleneck of light-harvesting in PSIIccs is the transfer from the CP43 and CP47 subunits to the RC, where for open RCs the excitations are irreversibly trapped by primary electron transfer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. For closed RCs (having a reduced quinone <italic>Q</italic><sub>A</sub>), the primary electron transfer reaction is slowed down such that about two-third of excitons escape the RC and are transferred to the low energy states of the antennae. This escape is promoted by the large entropy of excited antenna states, which is simply a result of the larger number of pigments in the CP43 and CP47 subunits as compared with the RC and the similar site energies of the pigments. Hence, a switch occurs from a light-harvesting mode at low light intensities to a photoprotective mode at high light intensities. In the latter case, excitons equilibrate between CP43 and CP47 via the RC on a 50 ps timescale, whereas for open RCs, CP43 and CP47 are disconnected, because excitons are trapped in the RC by ultrafast electron transfer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">There are, however, alternative interpretations of kinetic data, suggesting that, instead of the transfer to the trap, the charge transfer is overall rate limiting in PSII<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The latter model is known in the literature as excited-state radical pair equilibrium (ERPE) model. In this model, the dominating ∼40–60 ps time constant for the decay of excited states in PSIIccs with open RCs was assigned to reversible electron transfer, assuming that exciton equilibration in the whole core complex occurs on a 1.5 ps timescale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Hence, there is more than an order of magnitude difference in excitation energy transfer times between the two models of light-harvesting in PSIIccs. The present technique is ideally suited to solve this problem, as ultrafast exciton equilibration should erase any orientational information that is prepared by the polarization of the pump pulse in the oriented complexes in the crystal.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Laboratory orientation of orthorhombic PSII core crystals</title><p id="Par8">The index of oriented single PSII crystals was determined using synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements. All of the tested crystals had cuboid morphology with one dimension being significantly smaller than the other two. Indexing of 17 crystals determined that for all but one the shortest dimension could unequivocally be assigned to the <italic>a</italic> axis direction and the spectroscopically accessible face corresponded to the {1 0 0} plane. Moreover, the crystals with rectangular plate morphology had their longest axis coinciding with either <italic>b</italic> or <italic>c</italic> axis. This type of morphology was chosen for polarized infrared (IR) measurements of the oriented crystals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, and the consequent spectroscopic results confirmed the conclusion of X-ray indexing. Analysis of the data from 11 rectangular plate morphology crystals identified spectral features that divide the crystals in two distinct classes. These features were used to determine the direction of <italic>c</italic> and <italic>b</italic> axes (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2319">Supplementary Methods</xref> for details.)</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Polarized fs IR measurements on oriented single PSII crystals</title><p id="Par9">The femtosecond transient infrared pleochroism measurements of PSII crystals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> were performed with visible excitation (680 nm, 100 fs, 1 W cm<sup>−2</sup>, 1 kHz, spot diameter 200 μm, approximately 2.5 photons per core complex) polarized along either of the two longest crystal edges, with PSII in the closed state. As discussed above, this corresponded to propagation along the crystallographic <italic>a</italic> axis and polarization coinciding with <italic>b</italic> or <italic>c</italic> axis. The probing light (6 μm, 100 fs, 180 cm<sup>−1</sup> bandwidth) was much weaker and was polarized either parallel or orthogonal relative to the excitation. Thus, for each crystal, four time-resolved difference spectra were acquired at every delay point. The delay between pump and probe pulses was varied from 0.1 to 1500, ps in randomized manner, and the data were checked after each scan for the signs of sample degradation. The acquired data were processed using Singular Value Decomposition and Global Analysis methods (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2319">Supplementary Methods</xref> for details, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2319">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref> for Global Analysis results). For all polarization combinations, the analysis consistently indicated the presence of three time constants, with representative values of 3, 61.5 and 832 ps. Careful analysis could not resolve subpicosecond processes, in part due to the available instrument response and time zero coherent artefacts. The multiexponential kinetics results from a mixture of contributing processes. Because also each kinetic phase represents a mixture of contributing signals, target analysis has previously been applied to model time-resolved measurements of solution samples of PSII cores, which analyses contributions from the CP43, CP47 and RC ‘compartments’ as linear combinations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Here we restrict our analysis to describing the dominant physical processes of the smallest number of time constants that can globally fit the data. The 3 ps time constant describes the decay of the initial photoexcited population and represents exciton equilibration among the pigments within the CP43, CP47 and RC subunits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Because of the high light intensities applied with an estimated 2.5 absorbed photons per core, we may also expect exciton-annihilation effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The 61.5 ps time constant corresponds primarily to energy-transfer processes between the subunits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and the P680<sup>+</sup>/Pheo<sup>−</sup> charge-separated state develops during the 832 ps phase corresponding to the average time constant of 360 ps and 12 ns reported in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19.</xref> As the P680<sup>+</sup>/Pheo<sup>−</sup> difference spectrum only has contributions from two copies in the asymmetric unit, a specific structural measurement was possible on the basis of band-fitting, which was seen to fit the X-ray coordinates well using published vibrational mode assignments for the P680<sup>+</sup>/P680 and Pheo<sup>−</sup>/Pheo contributions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2319">Supplementary Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2319">Supplementary Figs 4, 13 and 16–20</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2319">Supplementary Tables 3 and 4</xref>).</p><p id="Par10"><xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a,b</xref> shows the difference spectra of the 3 ps decay phase for two orthogonal pump polarizations coinciding with crystallographic <italic>b</italic> and <italic>c</italic> axes.

Both the visible <italic>Q</italic><sub>Y</sub> transition dipole moment (TDM) and the infrared active 13-1 keto C=O stretching TDM are in-plane modes. Their directions can be determined by time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) and DFT harmonic frequency calculations, correspondingly. For isolated Chl <italic>a</italic>, the angle between these two TDM was calculated to be 14.7° (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2319">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Thus the Chl <italic>a</italic> 13-1 keto C=O mode may act as a ‘projector’ of the visible TDM and its dichroic ratio <italic>R</italic> will be strongly determined by the photoselection by polarized excitation. However, this can only be true if the Chl <italic>a</italic> 13-1 keto C=O mode can be considered as local mode, with multiple Chl <italic>a</italic> contributing to the sub-ps dichroic amplitudes. Full simulations of the optical crystallographic photoselection of initial populations and exciton transfer demonstrate this for the PSII dimer (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e,f</xref>). Assuming a local mode character, the sum of all the isolated 13-1 keto C=O TDM of excited pigment populations under our experimental conditions (680 nm, 100 fs, <italic>E</italic>-field parallel to <italic>b</italic>; <italic>E</italic>-field parallel to <italic>c</italic>) are indeed predicted to have significant dependence on the direction of optical pumping and maximize in the direction of the visible pump polarization (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e,f</xref>). Experimentally, it was found that the dominant excited-state transient absorption at 1622, cm<sup>−1</sup> (pumping parallel to <italic>b</italic>; <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>) and 1631, cm<sup>−1</sup> (pumping parallel to <italic>c</italic>; <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>) has a polarization dependence that is qualitatively comparable to the theoretical calculations (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e,f</xref>). The correspondence between the experimental (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c,d</xref>) and calculated (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e,f</xref>) traces is further evaluated on the basis of details taken for site energies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2319">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>), limited contribution from exciton to exciton annihilation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2319">Supplementary Figs 9–12</xref>, below) and small levels of vibrational mode mixing of the 13-1 keto C=O mode.

Through photoselection, the initial populations of both copies differ at early delays while non-crystallographic symmetry is gradually developed after about 100 ps owing to the tendency to transfer energy to red pigments on these timescales. The infrared measurements of the exciton-annihilation and energy-transfer stages of photosynthesis show that <italic>b</italic>- and <italic>c</italic>-polarized excitation results in very different excited-state populations and the time-dependent analysis of the dichroic amplitudes are possible from the discovery of the local mode character of the vibrational TDMs of the keto C=O stretching mode of Chl <italic>a</italic>. The measurements also demonstrate the flexibility of the light-harvesting and charge-separation processes that enable electron transfer with very high quantum efficiency in both cases. Without structural information, it would not be possible to distinguish between the two light-harvesting/charge-transfer models solely from the fluorescence decay. In contrast, the calculation of visible pump–infrared probe spectra in the middle and bottom part of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2319">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref> reveals significant differences of the two models. Owing to the faster exciton transfer in the ERPE model, the system ‘forgets’ the polarization of the initial excitation much faster than in the structure-based transfer-to-the-trap-limited model. Consequently, the anisotropy of the pump–probe signal is practically absent in the ERPE model but clearly visible in the structure-based model. By comparing the calculated with the measured pump–probe signals (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c,d</xref>), it becomes clear that only the structure-based transfer to the trap-limited model can at least qualitatively explain the experimental data. The present experiments provide the closest approach to visualize exciton relaxation in time and space so far. Convincing evidence is obtained for 50–100 ps exciton equilibration between CP43 and CP47 subunits across the intervening RC in PSIIccs for closed RCs. In the latter case, excitation energy is proposed to accumulate at Chl 29 in CP47 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>) or at Chl 11 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>), which are situated at the periphery of the complex and might represent photoprotective sites, where the excitation energy is quenched. In the case of open RCs, excitons do not equilibrate between CP43 and CP47 but are trapped by electron transfer in the RC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The bottleneck, however, remains the same, namely, transfer between the core antennae and the RC. As noted before, this slow transfer allows the RC to trap every exciton arriving in the RC by ultrafast electron transfer. The switch of the core complex into the photoprotective mode for closed RCs is triggered by the slowing down of primary charge transfer and promoted by the large entropy of excited antenna states that gives rise to a factor three larger rate constant of energy transfer from the RC to the antenna subunits than vice versa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par24">We note that the present results are also in agreement with a recent structure-based theoretical study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> on light harvesting in PSII supercomplexes.
