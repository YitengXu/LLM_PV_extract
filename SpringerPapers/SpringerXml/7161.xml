Therefore, one of the goals of this research towards the field of nanotechnology is the application of nanotechnology in the preparation of solar cells and the provision of optimal and efficient cells. Perovskite solar cells are of particular importance because of the high efficiencies that they have achieved in recent years.

To solve these problems, the use of renewable energy such as solar energy has been studied<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Sun is a huge source of energy and solar energy is the unique renewable, convenient, and main source of all the available energy on Earth. Many efforts have been made today to exploit this great energy source. Solar cells are one way to use this energy. Nowadays, organometallic perovskite solar cells have become a powerful alternative to popular commercialized silicon solar cells due to their easy synthesis, inexpensive components, and low fabrication costs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">In the past few decades, research activities on nanomaterials have grown rapidly since materials in nanosize exhibit completely different properties as compared to their bulk properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Quantum dots (QDs) grabbed lots of attention in recent years because of their amazing characteristics in optics. The energy gap of QDs depends on their sizes and synthesis methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Quantum dots (QDs) have the advantage of tunable bandgap as a result of size variation as well as the formation of intermediate bands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Since the application of perovskite light absorber with the formula (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>) in the construction of solid-state solar cells in 2012, a lot of research work has been done in the field of perovskite solar cells, so that in a few years the efficiency of these cells to increase by 25.5%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Studies show that the research into improving the efficiency of solar cells includes introducing new compounds or new methods of preparing these cells or improving existing compounds and methods. Since the solid-state perovskite cell consists of several layers consisting of compact TiO<sub>2</sub>, mesoporous TiO<sub>2</sub>, perovskite light-absorbing layer, a hole-transport layer, and electrode (Au)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, these studies can be performed on any part of the cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Nanotechnology and nanoscale materials can be introduced in some of these layers to increase the efficiency of the solar cell.

In this regard, as an example, we will synthesize the TiO<sub>2</sub>@ZnO composite and study the electron donor properties, improve the gap band and material absorption coefficient, and its effect on the efficiency and flow-potential diagram in the perovskite solar cell. This article has been prepared in two parts. The second part of this research has discussed suitable locations for perovskite solar cells in Kurdistan province located in western Iran<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Background on nanocomposite and perovskite solar cell</title><p id="Par7">One of the goals of this research in the field of nanotechnology is to provide optimal and efficient solar cells. As an example, we will synthesize the TiO<sub>2</sub>@ZnO composite and study its electron-giving properties in the perovskite solar cell. To do this, we used the quantum dots of TiO<sub>2</sub> and ZnO. Quantum dots are semiconductor crystals in the nanoscale (1–10 nm). Semiconductors are materials whose electrical conductivity is the interface between the electrical conductivity of conductive and non-conductive materials. Titanium dioxide due to its many properties including high refractive index, Lewis acid property, semiconductor and as an absorber of ultraviolet and visible light in photocatalytic applications and cheapness, high chemical stability, and non-toxic nature among other important metal oxides has special importance. Zinc oxide is also an important semiconductor with a band gap of 3.37 electron volts and high excitation energy of 60 mV at room temperature. In recent years, zinc oxide has attracted much attention mainly due to its unique optical, electronic, and piezoelectric properties, as well as its potential application in solar cells, blue light emitting diodes, sensors, and dimmers. This material can be used in optical instruments in ultraviolet and visible regions. At the nanoscale, it is also a highly transparent semiconductor with strong luminescence at room temperature, making it an ideal choice for a variety of sensors, laser diodes, displays, and transparent electrodes. Zinc oxide is biocompatible and safe and can be used in medicine and solar cells. Composite refers to solids that have more than one component used in their structure. A composite material is a physical, not a chemical, mixture on a macroscopic scale of two or more different materials. These materials retain their physical and chemical properties, but in general, the mixture has better properties than each of its components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The bonds that small material makes with its surrounding phases are much stronger than on larger scales. Accordingly, a new branch of composites called nanocomposites has been introduced and developed. The nanocomposite is a composite material in which at least one of its constituent phases has nano dimensions (between 1 and 100 nm)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Nanocomposites have a wider range of applications compared to other composites due to their more desirable physical, mechanical, and chemical properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In general, there are three generations of solar cells, of which the perovskite solar cell is a third generation solar cell. The general formula for perovskite compounds is ABX<sub>3</sub>, in which (A) can be a mono-valent organic or inorganic cation surrounded by twelve anions. (B) Is a divalent cation of the group of four principal bonds with six anions that forms an octagon. The combination of these octahedrons has created cavities that are occupied by a cation of organic or inorganic capacity and a perovskite structure. And X represents halogen atoms. The total oxidation number of cations and anions is equal to three, which has contributed to the charge balance and stability of the crystal structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Synthesis of the MAPbI<sub>3</sub> compound performed by Weber and proposed a cubic structure for this compound and showed that the methyl ammonium group or C<sub>3</sub>v symmetry must be twisted to provide the necessary symmetry to form the facet octagon. As mentioned, in these compounds, phase change occurs with temperature change, and the combination, MAPbI<sub>3</sub>, also changes phase with temperature change from cubic to tetragonal. In addition to sensitivity to temperature and pressure, perovskite compounds are highly sensitive to moisture, which should be taken into account when preparing these compounds, so that they are not exposed to moisture because water enters the crystal structure of these compounds. These compounds change from black with the formula MAPbI<sub>3</sub> to yellow with the formula MA<sub>4</sub>PbI<sub>6</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The results of the research indicate the sensitivity of these compounds to temperature, pressure, and humidity, and this evidence suggests that when preparing these compounds, temperature and humidity control should be considered to obtain a perovskite compound with the appropriate phase.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Laboratory equipment and chemicals</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Laboratory equipment</title><p id="Par8">The products were identified using infrared spectra by Shimadzu infrared spectrometers in the form of potassium bromide tablets.

Perovskite solar cells are of particular importance because of the high efficiencies they have achieved in recent years. The use of quantum dots has also played an important role in the efficiency of these cells and their efficiency. The TiO<sub>2</sub>@ZnO composite was synthesized for the first time and the application of this composite with different ratios of TiO<sub>2</sub> and ZnO quantum points was investigated and the efficiency was determined. The efficiency of the cell was reported to be about 5% in a solar cell made of 2:1 ratio TiO<sub>2</sub>@ZnO composite, which indicates that the presence of titanium oxide is better than zink oxide and increases the efficiency and movement of electrons<bold>.</bold> There are other perovskite solar cells that have higher efficiency about 22% and higher, but certainly, our research on this new hybrid could be a good infrastructure for further studies to improve the efficiency of perovskite solar cells with the compounds of this hybrid. The whole efficiency of this solar cell, can be increased by optimizing the conditions or by composing with other materials. In order to increase the efficiency, it is possible to optimize the construction conditions of the perovskite solar cell (in terms of layering, layer thickness, rotational layering time, etc.); Improving the stability of ZnO quantum dots by composing TiO<sub>2</sub>@ZnO composites with other materials (such as PbS and materials that affect the efficiency of the solar cell) are other ways to increase efficiency. Also, the use of TiO<sub>2</sub>@ZnO composite in core–shell composites, the use of TiO<sub>2</sub>@ZnO composite in multiple (tandem solar cells), and finally locating and optimizing the establishment of solar cell fields are other ways to increase efficiency.</p><p id="Par32">All these results are the result of the work of the research team in the laboratory of Iran University of Science and Technology.
