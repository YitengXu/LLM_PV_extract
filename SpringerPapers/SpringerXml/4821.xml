The prevailing AWH systems, including condensation- or sorption-based, mostly rely on a single mechanism limited by working conditions and inferior performance. Here, we synergistically integrate multiple mechanisms, including thermosorption effect, radiative cooling, and multiscale cellulose-water interactions to improve the water harvesting performance with minimal active energy input over a relative humidity (RH) range between 8% to 100%. The proposed system consists of a scalable and sustainable cellulose scaffold impregnated with hygroscopic lithium chloride (LiCl). Cellulose scaffold and LiCl synergistically interact with water at molecular, nanometer, and micrometer scales, achieving a high yield (2.5–16 kg kg<sup>−1</sup> at 60–90% RH). The captured water in return facilitates radiative cooling due to its intrinsically high infrared emissivity. An outdoor batch-mode AWH device shows a water uptake up to 6.75 L kg<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> with a material cost as low as 3.15–5.86 USD kg<sup>−1</sup>. A theoretical model is also proposed to elucidate the synergistic AWH mechanisms among cellulose-LiCl-water-energy interaction. This AWH strategy provides a potential solution to water scarcity problems in regions with larger seasonal and climate variations, especially arid areas.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">A water harvesting strategy utilizing a hygroscopic lithium chloride impregnated cellulose scaffold yields high water harvesting rate with low energy input over a wide range of relative humidity.

Technologies, such as thermal desalination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and solar steam generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, have been developed and used to mitigate the global freshwater crisis. However, these conventional approaches demand intense energy input and, most importantly, access to water resources, such as precipitation, surface- or groundwater, or coastal water, limiting their applicability. In search of geographically independent water collection, atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) emerges as a promising candidate to harvest freshwater with drinking water quality and potential scalability.</p><p id="Par4">Atmospheric water vapor and droplets account for ~10% of the global freshwater reservoir<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. There are tremendous efforts in developing AWH systems, most of which can be categorized as either condensation- or sorption-based devices. Condensation-based AWH systems rely on cooling or mechanical compressing to induce vapor-to-liquid phase transition. Their major drawbacks include the requirement for high relative humidity (RH) &gt; 70%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> or sizeable energy input for cooling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, which are not viable for arid and developing regions. In contrast to condensation, sorption-based AWH systems can work over a much wider RH range (&gt;10% RH), exploiting the hygroscopicity of sorbents. Typical sorption materials include desiccator salts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, metal/covalent organic frameworks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, thermo-responsive gels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, and carbon-based systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Strong water affinity contributes to water capture but hampers subsequent water release. Yet to be resolved is the long-standing quest for simultaneous enhancement of water capture and release, two processes difficult to be optimized simultaneously. Also, sorption materials that are fully sustainable, cost-effective, and scalable are lacking. Recently, a radiative cooling effect of cellulose fabric is found to be beneficial to AWH because it facilitates the exothermic sorption process and lowers the saturation vapor pressure which consequently promotes condensation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. However, the reported working range and capacity are fundamentally limited by the modest hygroscopicity of cellulose alone. Integrating LiCl into porous frameworks has been a desired option for its high hygroscopicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. However, these strategies involve either complicated synthetic processes or limited scalability.</p><p id="Par5">This study aims to tackle the above-mentioned challenges by impregnating LiCl in the cellulose scaffold with a facile dip-coating method to extend the working range and boost the water harvesting ability. This is enabled by the copious hydrogen bonding in the cellulose chain for a rapid formation of hydration shells that allow a simple and stable nanoscale LiCl integration. The proposed strategy also synergistically integrates multiple mechanisms, including the thermosorption effect, radiative cooling, and multiscale cellulose water interaction, forming an integrated protocol that has not yet been explored in full detail. We demonstrate the fundamental interplay of key components in a dual-mechanism AWH system by a LiCl–cellulose radiative cooling composite and document its promising performance at both low and high RH. Moreover, we investigate a self-adaptive switch between water capture and release for multicyclic operations. Lab experiments, field tests, and theoretical modeling are conducted to elaborate on how the microscopic LiCl–cellulose–water coupling and the environmental factors synergistically affect the macroscopic material performance. The theoretical model is cross-validated with the experimental water uptake with or without radiative cooling and predicts water uptake beyond the current experimental limits. An outdoor batch-mode AWH device demonstrates water capture (water uptake) as high as 6.75 L kg<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> (70% RH, 21.6 °C) and water production up to 5.97 L kg<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> under 0.9–1.1 sun (0.9–1.1 kW m<sup>−2</sup>) after eight continuous capture-release cycles with a material cost as low as 3.15–5.86 USD kg<sup>−1</sup> (nonwoven fabric as cellulose scaffold: 1.5–2.8 USD kg<sup>−1</sup>, industrial grade LiCl: 7–13 USD kg<sup>−1</sup>). The efficient and high-performance AWH composite operating over a wide range of the RH spectrum opens opportunities for both fundamental research and practical applications to account for the seasonal and climate variation of the RH, especially in arid areas (such as the Death Valley), where RH varies between 5% and 95% most years.</p><p id="Par6">Cellulose, one of the most abundant biopolymers on earth, has many unique functional properties including robust mechanics, radiative cooling effect, strong hydrophilicity, carbon-neutrality, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Radiative cooling and sorption form a positive feedback loop (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Cooling promotes sorption while the adsorbed water molecules contribute to an even higher cooling power due to their high infrared (IR) emissivity. LiCl salt adsorbs limited amounts of water at low RH conditions (&lt;5% RH), but when the RH is raised above 11%, the deliquescence point (RH<sub>o</sub>) of LiCl, the salt will deliquesce, forming a saturated solution that can ultimately take up more than 1000% water content as the RH is elevated further<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. LiCl desiccant is also advantageous in terms of water release, as LiCl regenerates at 40 °C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, a temperature readily obtainable via solar heating. Impregnation of LiCl in the cellulose multiscale hierarchical pore network extends the working RH range and boosts the water harvesting capacity and kinetics, compared to salt-alone and cellulose-alone systems. The cellulose scaffold, in return, structurally supports LiCl and retains the water and LiCl solution (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The aggregation, agglomeration, and deliquescence commonly observed in LiCl powder (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>) are alleviated in the cellulose scaffold for a non-degraded sorption capability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. The hydrated LiCl–cellulose composite increases optical transparency across the solar spectrum and allows rapid water evaporation by solar heating with a dark substrate underneath. Cycles of radiative cooling and solar heating shift the system temperature between low and high favoring water capture and release, respectively. This yields a high harvesting capacity which has been one of the major bottlenecks in conventional ambient water harvesting systems.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>LiCl–cellulose composite demonstrates energy-efficient atmospheric water harvesting.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic of mechanisms of atmospheric water harvesting by radiative cooling LiCl–cellulose composite. <bold>b</bold> Scaffolds of LiCl–cellulose composite and complex networks show strong physical entanglements and water storage capabilities. <bold>c</bold> Molecular interaction between LiCl and water.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/44172_2023_82_Fig1_HTML.png"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Synthesis and morphology</title><p id="Par7">To fabricate the LiCl–cellulose composite, the cellulose scaffold (0.574 mm thickness fabric) is immersed in LiCl solution and then oven-dried. The LiCl ions gradually intercalate into the cellulose fiber matrix during three times of dipping-drying steps (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). Following the oven drying process, the well-dispersed ions recrystallize and bind tightly to the cellulose surfaces. Fabrication details are given in the “Methods” section. The high aspect ratio of the fiber bundle is composed of multiscale features, including microscale fiber bundles ~20 μm in diameter to nanofibers ~20 nm in diameter (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b–d</xref>, Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>). The LiCl brine solution quickly infiltrates the cellulose scaffold, and the salt ions achieve nanoscale dispersion, as indicated by the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mappings of fiber networks and cross-sections (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e–h</xref>, Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). More details of EDS analysis can be found in Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>. The hydrophilic surface as well as the numerous channels between fibers and fiber bundles, revealed in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b–h</xref>), facilitate the salt solution infiltration process. The intrinsically hydrophilic and highly porous fiber network efficiently captures and stores water. Also, the LiCl–cellulose composite exhibits higher mechanical strength than the cellulose scaffold in the dry condition in Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S5</xref>, attributed to the fiber’s aggregation after the soaking and drying process, while the difference between their mechanical strengths is hardly observed in the wet condition.

Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> exhibits the emittance over the wavelength range 250 nm–20 μm, i.e., solar spectrum and sky transmittance spectrum (IR range), of the cellulose scaffold and LiCl–cellulose composite in dry and wet states. The transmittance of the LiCl–cellulose composite indicates that 50.7% of solar radiation passes through the sample (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S6</xref>), while the presence of water increases the wet-state transmittance by 13.5%. The reflectance of the composite sample in the solar spectrum reduces to 17.3% in the wet state (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S7</xref>). In the visible and near-IR spectra, the emittance is found to be low because incident radiation with a wavelength between 0.4 and 1.5 μm is intensely scattered by the nanofibers and microfibers at the corresponding length scale. The particularly strong IR radiation of cellulose stems from the multimode vibrations of molecular chains, including C–O stretching and O–H stretching<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, where the emission wavelengths align with the atmospheric sky window (8–13 μm), permitting energy dissipation to deep space. The microfibers and larger fiber bundles (2–20 μm) contribute to amplifying and broadening the IR emittance peaks to increase the radiative energy leaving the composite. The aforementioned light–matter interactions provide the LiCl–cellulose composite a selective emittance spectrum that allows a spontaneous and rapid cooling to sub-ambient surface temperature during nighttime<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Wet samples emit more strongly in the IR range than dry ones because the additional hydrogen bonding between the OH<sup>−</sup> branches and H<sub>2</sub>O molecules complements the missing molecular vibration modes, and water occupies the original pore space providing more emitting substances. Also, bulk water itself is a good IR emitter with near-unity emissivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. These suggest that sorption and radiative cooling mutually enhance each other, forming a positive feedback loop as a merit of system design. The effective emissivity over the atmospheric window is 0.75 for the cellulose scaffold in the dry condition and is enhanced to 0.80 when coated with LiCl.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Optical and thermal characterization of LiCl–cellulose composite.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic of the principle of radiative cooling effect by the LiCl–cellulose composite. <bold>b</bold> Emittance in the ultraviolet, visible, and infrared range of the cellulose and LiCl–cellulose composite in dry and wet conditions. <bold>c</bold> Profiles of the sample surface temperatures and ambient temperature of cellulose scaffold and LiCl–cellulose composite on two different nights. <bold>d</bold> Profiles of the cooling power measured for the cellulose scaffold and LiCl–cellulose composite on two different nights. <bold>e</bold> Schematic of water release from the LiCl–cellulose composite with an underneath dark substrate. <bold>f</bold> Absorptance of LiCl–cellulose composite with and without dark substrate. <bold>g</bold> Macroscopic and IR photo of a large-scale LiCl–cellulose composite on April 30th, 2021.

The field test procedure and apparatuses are illustrated in the “Methods” section and Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S8</xref>, respectively. Water harvesting tests were carried out during nights from Nov. 2020 to May 2021 in West Lafayette, IN (40.4237° N, 86.9212° W). Radiative cooling effectively reduced sample surface temperature to 6.0–8.7 °C below ambient temperature, as shown by the representative data of April 1st, 2021, and November 11th, 2020, at an RH range of 48–82% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). The sporadic temperature surge in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> was caused by the manual measurement of the sample weight. The radiative cooling power measured by a feedback heater (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>) exhibited an average cooling power of 110 W m<sup>−2</sup> for LiCl–cellulose composite during the night of May 14th, 2021, and 82.3 W m<sup>−2</sup> for the cellulose scaffold during the night of January 21st, 2021. The cooling power difference was a consequence of different climate conditions. Although water capture by sorption or condensation was exothermic, our estimation indicated that the radiative cooling effect was not disturbed by the water-capturing process (Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>). The LiCl–cellulose composite showed a higher cooling power when the test was conducted under a higher ambient temperature and low absolute humidity during the summer. We present a theoretical model to estimate the cooling power at different ambient temperatures based on the measured optical emittance of the three samples (Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref>). The wet composite shows the highest theoretical cooling power, while the dry cellulose scaffold has the lowest one (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S9</xref>). Moreover, in the wet state, the LiCl–cellulose composite can transmit more sunlight because of a better match of the refractive indices of cellulose and water than cellulose and air (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S6</xref>). Thus, a dark substrate can be used underneath the wet composite to improve the solar absorption and raise the sample temperature to facilitate water release (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). During desorption, rapid water release can be achieved via a solar absorption of 67.7% by the dark substrate during the daytime (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>). The numerous channels and fiber surfaces serve as paths for water transport from inside to the composite surface enhancing the drying process and release of stored water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. The outdoor cellulose scaffold demonstrated a lower surface temperature of the composite due to radiative cooling, with exposure to direct solar irradiation, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Synergistic mechanisms</title><p id="Par10">To further elucidate the working mechanism of the LiCl–cellulose composite, we individually analyze and decouple the synergistic effect of the radiative cooling, hygroscopic LiCl, and cellulose fibril structure (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). At the atomistic scale, the water dipole attracts the counter-ions and breaks the ionic bonds of LiCl leading to its dissolution. Meanwhile, the polar hydroxyl groups on the cellulose chain hydrogen bond strongly with polar water molecules. The multiscale pore structure of the cellulose scaffold facilitates water harvesting with micropore filling (&lt;2 nm), mono/multilayer adsorption on pore surfaces, and capillary condensation in mesopores (&gt;4 nm). In nanoscale pores, the intermolecular interactions of the surfaces overlap, thus creating strong attraction-promoting nucleation. The adsorption can occur even at low RH. The fibers at this scale are cellulose aggregates. On the mesopore scale, a large volume of water is retained via capillary forces. Capillary condensation happens at sub-saturation vapor pressure, as described by the Kelvin equation. The porous structure at this scale denotes larger-scale fiber assemblies. Larger scale structures, such as the fiber network, transport water by wicking in the inter-fiber pores spaces, as also occurs in desert plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Single fibers consist of a bundle of cells. The enhanced water-capturing performance stems from four mechanisms (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>): 1. Physisorption of cellulose; 2. Chemisorption of LiCl, i.e., forming LiCl hydrates; 3. Sorption of water vapor into LiCl solution (here called first condensation) occurs when RH is higher than the RH<sub>o</sub>; 4. Condensation of water vapor due to vapor saturation (here called second condensation). Each of these mechanisms can be described by corresponding physical models, where the details can be found in Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S5</xref>. The physisorption of cellulose is frequently represented by the Guggenheim–Anderson–de Boer (GAB) sorption model, which describes type II sorption behavior with monolayer water uptake and energy terms of free enthalpy differences. The hydration of LiCl can be described by its phase diagram<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Isolated water condensation (second condensation) is a (quasi) linear function of time, assuming heat and mass transfer reach equilibrium. With these considerations, a theoretical model for the sorption of the composite is developed as the weighted summation of the four mechanisms (Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S5</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Synergistic effects among radiative cooling, hygroscopic LiCl, and cellulose scaffold.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic of multiscale interaction between water and LiCl–cellulose composite system. <bold>b</bold> Schematic of four sorption mechanisms for theoretical modeling. <bold>c</bold> Experimental and theoretical water uptake of LiCl–cellulose composite samples with 10–30 wt% at 0–100% RH.

The working mechanisms are identical to the field test but with precise control of the sample temperature, ambient temperature, and RH for a systematic performance evaluation. Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref> displays the water uptake curves at a 6 °C temperature drop from 25 °C ambient temperature, 10–30 wt% LiCl content. At ~8% RH, sorption surges due to the onset of salt deliquescence and the increase of effective RH by radiative cooling (inset of Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S11</xref> shows similar water uptake profiles but with a constant 9 °C below the ambient temperature. The higher water uptake profile is attributed to the enhanced cooling effect, which can be achieved by reducing the convection loss or adding an IR emissive substrate underneath that further maintains a lower sample surface temperature. Sorption dominates the water uptake until RH &gt; 60%, where condensation commences and dominates. The theoretical model quantitatively agrees with the experiments, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>. The outcome of this model also clearly demonstrates that radiative cooling substantially improved the water capture (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S12</xref>). Furthermore, the model allows us to derive water uptake based on LiCl content and RH, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>. The diagram breaks down into two regimes where one of the two mechanisms dominates performance. In sub-dew point temperature conditions, water capture is driven by the radiative cooling power to cool the scaffold compensating for the latent heat transfer due to condensation. Whereas above the dew point, it is sorption driven, and the enhancement comes from the increase of internal RH in the LiCl–cellulose composite by radiative cooling. The lab tests reveal a 2-fold and 9-fold increase in water uptake solely due to the 6 °C cooling of the composite at 30% and 70% RH, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>). The effect of radiative cooling on the water uptake is more pronounced at higher RH since condensation starts to dominate the water capturing. A comparative field test conducted using two pieces of 30 wt% LiCl–cellulose composite, with one exposed to the sky and the other shielded by non-transmissive cardboard (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S13a</xref>), also shows the radiative cooling effect on the enhancement of water uptake (Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S6</xref>, Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S13b</xref>).</p><p id="Par12">In addition to the synergistic thermosorption effect, which enhances water capture capacity at lower temperatures, water capture kinetics is also greatly expedited by dispersion, as indicated by the dynamic vapor sorption experiments (see “Methods” section, Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S7</xref>) and field tests. More specifically, in terms of the rate of water uptake, LiCl–cellulose composite has a synergistically higher rate of water uptake and outperforms the summation of LiCl powder and cellulose scaffold alone. We employ nitrogen sorption isotherms to determine the surface area of LiCl, cellulose scaffold, and LiCl–cellulose composite. The LiCl–cellulose composite has a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equivalent surface area of 0.331–0.366 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup>, while the values of cellulose scaffold and LiCl powders are 0.177 and 0.047 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup> respectively (see “Methods” section and Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S8</xref>). The impregnated LiCl is dispersed and attached to the large surface area of the cellulose scaffold, resulting in a much greater surface area for the composite that enhances sorption kinetics. The rates of water uptake of the three samples, based on the derivative of the water uptake vs. time curve without radiative cooling effect according to vapor sorption experiments (Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S7</xref>, Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S14</xref>), exhibit the rapid saturation and high kinetics of LiCl–cellulose composite’s sorption behavior (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). Also, the LiCl–cellulose composite absorbed more water compared to the sum of the cellulose scaffold and the LiCl powder in the field test (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>). The results in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f, g</xref> support our hypothesis that the synergistic effect in the composite not only enhances the water capture capacity but also accelerates the water capture kinetics.

Above material characterizations and performance demonstrations confirm that the LiCl–cellulose composite is a potential candidate for achieving efficient AWH due to its distinct advantages of high water sorption capacity at low humidity, fast water sorption–desorption kinetics, continuous sub-ambient cooling, and stable cyclability. With a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and performance of LiCl–cellulose composite, especially its noticeable portability, scalability, and high water uptake, we then model and predict the potential daily water production on a global scale using the performance characterized in the lab test. The modeling takes the global climate data from the national centers for environmental prediction (NCEP) for the year 2021 and estimates the water production rate based on the local RH, ambient temperature, and total cloud coverage (Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S11</xref>). With the consideration of key ambient factors, there is still a non-zero annual production of clean water even in the most draught region.

The samples were cooled to the boiling point (77.3 K) of the adsorbate (N<sub>2</sub>) to ensure enough adsorption. The pure nonwoven cloth and 24% LiCl–cellulose composite samples of 0.25–0.4 g were loaded into 3/8 in. tubes. The degassing process was kept at 90 °C for 13 h to remove natively adsorbed water molecules. The sample mass was recorded with an accuracy of 0.0001 g. After the tube was installed and sealed onto the instrument, the samples underwent another degassing and vacuum. The data points were taken for P/P<sub>0</sub> from 0.001 to 0.3 in a geometric series favoring the lower end of the relative pressure. The quantity of Nitrogen adsorption on the sample surface was recorded as the relative pressure ramped. The BET method fits data in the range of 0.05–0.35 relative pressure, and the slope and intercept of fitting provided the amount of monolayer N<sub>2</sub> adsorption to derive the BET equivalent specific surface area. Therefore, the results are dependent on the data being fitted. The key criteria of data selection are the intercept being greater than zero and the correlation coefficient <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> is better than 0.999 for a valid BET fitting. The BET results show the ambient free space volume of both the cellulose scaffold and LiCl–cellulose composite are 37.5 and 24.1 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>−1</sup>, respectively, which are sufficient to retain the amount of water captured.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This project is not directly funded.
