The trial was carried out in a trial plum plantation of the Fruit Research Institute and at the Microbiology Department of the Faculty of Agronomy in Cacak. The soil was treated with mineral fertilisers having a 8:16:24 + 3 % MgO formulation, as follows: variant 1 (control) – nonfertilised soil; variant 2 – 400 kg ha -1 ; variant 3 – 600 kg ha -1 ; variant 4 – 800 kg ha -1 ; variant 5 – 1000 kg ha 1 .The fertiliser effect was determined three times during the growing season and was observed by identifying the proteinase activity. Determination of the enzyme activity was made using standard microbiological methods.The investigation results showed that the soil proteinase activity was affected by the fertilisation variants employed, sampling period and research years. High mineral fertiliser rates used caused a reduction in the soil proteinase activity. Of all the fertiliser variants examined the most pronounced inhibitory effect was exhibited by the variant 5 (the variant with the highest nitrogen rate used). Conversely, lower mineral nitrogen rates had a stimulatory effect on the activity of this enzyme.The fertiliser effects mentioned were most pronounced in the third sampling period. Furthermore, a more marked effect was recorded in 2003. Key words: plum plantation, NPK-fertilization, soil proteinase Introduction As a highly important component of each soil type microorganisms are the most accountable for the majority of soil biological processes. During their lifetime they synthetise different extracellular enzymes catalysing degradation of complex organic compounds making them available for plants and microorganisms (Acosta-Martinez and Tabatabai, 2000). The processes of transformation of organic forms of nitrogen are enabled by the effect of microbiological proteases (E.E.3.4. proteases) contained in a high number of bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes. Peptides and amino acids develop in the process to be further mineralised to the ammonium form and used in plant and microorganism nutrition. The process level in modern agricultural production is, among other things, dependent on both the type and rate of mineral fertilisers used (Sims and Wander, 2002). Narrowing of the C:N ratio through nitrogen fertiliser incorporation brings about facilitation of mineralisation processes, favourably affecting the soil proteinase activity and consequently the amount of nitrogen compounds available (Solovova et al., 2001; Ragályi and Kádár, 2006; Kádár, 2007). However, increased hydrolytic capacity of the soil can lead to weakening of its physical and chemical and biological properties and to other serious environmental effects (Gostowska et al., 1998), indicating that this aspect of using mineral fertilisers should be given specific attention. Researches defining the limits of permitted soil load with these chemical compounds are of extremely high significance. This determined the objective of the research – examination of the effect of different mineral fertiliser rates on soil proteinase activity.</p><p id="Pg2">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 676 Materials and methods The field experiment and soil characteristics The research was carried out during the period of 2003-2005 in a trial plum plantation (alluvial soil) of the Fruit Research Institute and at the Microbiology Department of the Faculty of Agronomy in Cacak. Mineral fertilization (NPK 8:16:24 + 3 % MgO; product of “Zorka” Sabac, was made in autumn of 2002 in the amounts as follows (kg ha-1): a = 0 (the control); b = 400; c = 600; d = 800; e = 1000. In the next two years, residual effects of applied fertilization were tested and plum plantation was not fertilized. The trial was set up according to a randomised block design in three replications (A = fertilization = five steps ; B = sampling period = three steps, C = year = three steps). The elementary plot size was 68 m2. Common cropping practices were used during the growing season. The soil samples were taken in the terms as follows: May 12, September 17 and November 11 of each testing year, for the first, the second and the third sampling, respectively. The proteinase activity (number of gelatinolytic units per 1.0 g air-dry soil) was determined by the method described by Romejko (1969). The data obtained were processed by the analysis of variance and the significance of differences between the variants examined was analysed by the LSD-test. The experimental soil was slighty acid reaction (pH in 1nKCl = 5.9), moderate supplied with organic matter (2.65% humus) and well supplied with plant available P and K (ALmethod: mg 100 g-1 of soil = 15.0 P2O5 and 20.4 K2O). Weather characteristics Drought and the excessive warmth were main characteristics of the 2003 growing season. For example, in the7-month period May-November precipitation was for one third lower than long-term mean (LTM). At the same time, air-temperature was for 2.9oC higher (Table 1). The remaining two years were a bit warmer and regarding precipitation near to LTM. Table 1.

The year of testing (the factor C was) also an important factor of proteinase activity because in the third year of study (2005) it was for 28% (2003) and 26% (2004) lower, while difference between 2003 and 2004 were non-significant. Proteinase activity differences among terms of soil sampling were non-significant for the control, but for the applied fertilization it was significantly higher in the second sampling compared both with the first and third terms of the treatments 600, 800 and 1000 kg ha-1 of fertilizer (Table 2).

A decline in the activity in final vegetative development stages of plum resulted from decreased soil moisture, which significantly induced a reduction in the number of microorganisms accountable for the production of many enzymes including the proteolytic ones (Jemcev and Đukić, 2000; Kátai et al., 2005). The variants with lower fertiliser rates had a stimulatory effect on proportionally equal level on the proteinase activity in all three research periods. Increased proteinase activity triggered by the effect of mineral fertilisers could be attributed to soil enrichment with mineral elements required for the development of proteolytic microorganisms (Mandic et al., 2001; Németh, 2006). These fertilisers affected the mobility of soil organic matter which was subjected to hydrolysis immediately after</p><p id="Pg4">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 678 their incorporation into the soil, prior to activation of biological processes in the soil. Furthermore, a great number of authors reported that the proteinase activity increase induced by nitrogen incorporation into the soil occurred because hydrolytic processes were initiated much faster, so microorganisms started to use even the organic compounds which had previously been unavailable to them (Solovova et al., 2001). An analysis of the results obtained determined that all variants with higher fertiliser rates used had an inhibitory effect on the activity of the enzyme mentioned (Table 2). The using of the highest NPK-rate in all of the three sampling periods had produced the highest inhibitory effect on this enzyme. The tendency resulted from a change in the established soil biological equilibrium following the incorporation of high mineral fertiliser rates in the soil and activation of non-specific toxinogenic groups of microorganisms (Kandeler et al., 1999). Conclusion Based on the research results on the effect of mineral fertilisers on the proteinase activity of soil under plum plantation the following can be concluded: a) high rates (800 and 1000 kg ha-1) of the applied fertilisers and lower ones (400 and 600 kg ha-1) induced a reduction and increase in the proteinase activity, respectively; b) the most pronounced inhibitory effect was expressed by the variant using the highest nitrogen rate (variant 5), and the most marked stimulatory effect was exerted by the variant 3; c) the soil proteinase activity was the most pronounced in the second sampling period, during the entire research period (2003-2005).

Field trials were carried out on two localities of different altitude and soil conditions. Mean content of crude protein was significantly higher in tubers from organic crop management than in tubers from conventional system (11.02 and 9.83 % in dry matter, respectively). Similar result was observed in protein content (in organic 5.51% and in conventional 5.08 % in dry matter, respectively). Variety was the factor having the highest direct effect on crude protein as well as protein contents. Tubers from conventional crop management showed an increased tendency to accumulate nitrates. Keywords: potatoes, proteins, nitrates, conventional and organic crop management. Introduction Potatoes are going to be an important raw in processing industry in Serbia. According data of Satet Bureau for Statistics, potato growing areas in the country are between 90 and 100 thousand hectares. Serbian average potato tuber yields are extremely low (less than 10 t ha–1) compared to those in EU due to the lack of soil fertility management strategies. High yields can only be obtained through the application of optimal NPK doses in balanced proportions (Márton, 2002; Pepó et al., 2006; Poljak et al., 2007). The crude protein (N x 6.25) represents in tubers approximately 2 % on fresh weight basis and creates approximately 10 % of tubers dry matter. However, content of crude protein may range widely in dependence on genotype and growing conditions (Márton, 2004; Jolánkai et al., 2006; Kádár, 2007; Pepó, 2007). Crude protein comprises a number of nitrogen fractions; the most important for human nutrition are protein fraction, amides and free amino acids (Németh, 2006; Pepó and Győri, 2007). Protein fraction (pure protein) constitutes in average about 50 % of nitrogen compounds of potato tubers, with wide ranges between 34 % and 70 % (Shewry 2003; Loerke and Christiansen, 2005). Nitrates rank among basic plant nutrients and their presence in plant organs is this natural. They are harmful regarding human nutrition and health. Nitrogen has a direct effect on tubers yield and quality. In average, 50 kg of N is needed for 10 t of tubers production (Jasińska and Kotecki 1999). Nitrogen requirement is filled in conventional potato management by the external nitrogen input in form of nitrogen fertilisers. In organic crop management, the crop requirement is resolved by nitrogen balance within crop rotation and nitrogen recovery from soil organic matter (Casa et al., 2004; Németh, 2006; Rutkoviene et al., 2007; Megyes et al., 2007). The aim of the study was to evaluate the potato tuber parameters as following: crude protein, protein, free amino acids and nitrate contents growing in organic and conventional crop management systems.</p><p id="Pg6">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 680 Materials and methods The field trials with conventional (CCM) and organic (OCM) crop management system were carried out on two localities with different altitude – Čačak (262 m) and Guča (363 m), Serbia, in 2006. The five potato varieties: Adora (very early), Cleopatra (early), Liseta (early), Courage (semi–early) and Desiree (late) were evaluated. The experiments were carried out in individual small plots (plot area 6.75 m2) which were arranged in a randomized complete block design replicated four times. Mineral fertilisers with a dose of 100 kg N, 35 kg P and 60 kg K ha–1, farm yard manure application (40 t ha–1) and chemical control of Colorado beetle and late blight were applied in CCM. In OCM system 40 t ha–1 farm yard manure was applied. The sums of precipitation and average temperature during the vegetative period (April–September 2006) were 556 mm and 14.8°C for the locality Čačak and 507 mm and 13.8°C for the locality Guča. Soil is classified as smoniza sandy loam soil in Čačak and pseudogley in Guča. After hand harvest, tubers were stored three months under 4°C and then following parameters were analysed: a) crude protein content by modified Dumas method using analyzer Flash EA 1112, USA/Italy; b) protein content by BCA Protein Assay Kit, Pierce, USA; c) free amino acids content by RP–HPLC; d) nitrate content by ion– selective electrode. Content of the determined components was expressed on tuber dry matter (DM). The data were analysed by software STATISTICA, two–way ANOVA (relative variance components) and Tukey HSD test (Mead et al., 1996).

From three evaluated factors (cultivar, crop management and locality), cultivar had the highest direct effect on crude protein as well as protein contents. The effect of crop management showed itself particularly in interactions with other evaluated factors. Nitrate content was affected primarily by cultivar, but direct effect of different crop management was also noted. In seven out of ten tested treatments (Table 2), tubers from conventional system had significantly higher nitrate content than tubers from organic crop management. The highest nitrate content was determined in the very early variety Adora. Our results indicate lower nitrate accumulation in tubers produced under organic crop management and are with concordance with Kölsch and Stöppler (1990). The Serbia statutory limit of 300 mg kg–1 of nitrate on tuber fresh basis was not exceeded in organic cropping system and there seems to be an extensive reserve. The results from two localities indicate that production of potato tubers in organic crop management has a potential to obtain tubers with higher protein content and lower nitrates accumulation than tubers from conventional crop management. Conclusions The mean content of crude protein was significantly higher in tubers produced under organic crop management (11.02 % DM) than in tubers cultivated under conventional crop management (9.83 % DM). Similar findings were observed for protein and free amino acids contents. Tubers from organic system have average content of protein 5.51 % in dry matter, while tubers from conventional crop management only 5.08 % in dry matter. Tubers from conventional system had also higher nitrate content than tubers from organic crop management. The results indicate that production of potato tubers in organic crop management has potential for production of tubers with higher protein content and with lower accumulation of nitrates.

Wheat grain under conditions of Kragujevac vertisol contained considerably higher N (+26%), Ca (+13%), Fe (+32%) Cu (+64%), Zn (+2.6 fold) and Cd (+2.5 fold) compared to wheat on Novi Sad chernozem. Also, with exception of Mg, significant differences of wheat grain composition among the cultivars were found. For example, the cultivar Evropa characterized with the lowest contents of N, P, Ca, Fe and Cu. The cultivar Milica had the highest Fe and Ni contents, the lowest Mn as well. The cultivar Renesansa had the highest K, Ca, Cu and Zn, and the lowest Ni contents. The highest Mn contents in grain of the Tera and Pobeda were found. Additionaly, the Pobeda has the highest N and Mn, as well the lowest Zn contents. The Renesansa and NS rana 5 have the highest K contents in grain. Specifities of the Tera and Jarebica were the highest Mn and the lowest K, respectively. Keywords: wheat variety, grain, contents of macro– and microelements, location, interaction. Introduction The field crop properties are under influences both environmental and heredity factors (Czövek et al., 2006; Kovačević et al., 2006; Užik and Žofajová, 2006; Drezner et al., 2007; Gáspár et al., 2007; Győri, 2007; Pepó and Győri, 2007; Pepo, 2007). Micronutrient deficiencies in crop plants are becoming very important globally, being involved in severe decreases in crop production and nutritional quality of harvested products. Among the micronutrients, iron and zinc deficiencies are well-documented in crop plants, especially on calcareous soils of arid and semi-arid regions. Plant derived from seeds with low concentrations of micronutrients are highly sensitive to biotic and abiotic stresses during seed germinations and early growth stages (Cakmak, 2005). Manganese deficiency in cereals is the most important nutritional disorder in major part of Northern Europe, including Skandinavia (Husted et al., 2005). Iron deficiency is the most common nutrient deficiency affecting more than half of the world's population (about 3.5 billion). World Health Organization (WHO) attributes 800,000 deaths wordwide each year to Zn deficiency and over 20 million healthly life years lost. It is estimated that Zn deficiency affects one-third of the word's population. Taking in consideration the importance of wheat–based products in human diet and animal feeds, we wanted to improve the knowledge of the contents of biogenous elements as well as of some heavy metals, those recognized for harmful effects. For this reason, aim of this study was testing environmental and hereditary influences on nutritional status in wheat grain of seven commercial Yugoslav winter wheat varieties.</p><p id="Pg10">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 684 Materials and methods Seven domestic cultivars of winter wheat developed in Institute of Field and Vegetable Crops (Evropa, Milica, Renesansa, Tera, NS-rana 5, Pobeda and Jarebica) were grown on Novi Sad (chernozem) and Kragujevac (dedegraded vertisol) experimental fields for the 2004/05–growing season. The field trial was conducted by randomized block design in three replicates (gross of the basic plot 100 m2). Wheat was sown in the second half of October (sowing rate 600 emergeble grains per m2) in three replicates. Grain sampling was made during harvesting (beginning of July) at full maturity stage. Novi Sad loam chernozem soil characterizing favorable chemical and physical properties, while heavy texture and low available P level are main characteristics of Kragujevac vertisol (Table 1). The growing season 2004/2005 was regarding mean 9-month air-temperature in range of the long-term mean (LTM). However, at the same time precipitation in Novi Sad was for 33% higher and in Kragujevac for 13% lower compared to the LTM. The coldest month for both localities was February with the lower (comparison with the LTM) airtemperature for 1.60C and 1.20C, for Novi Sad and Kragujevac, respectively (Table 2). Table 1.

Knežević (1997) reported grain N contents in four wheat cultivars and their six F2 hybrids in ranges from 1.68% N (Jugoslavija) to 2.01% N (NS rana 2) and from 1.87% N (Jugoslavija x Žitnica) to 2.12% N (Žitnica x NS rana 2). Seed nutrient reserves are an important factor in the early growth of crops, especially on low fertility soils. Moussavi-Nik (1997) found that seed Mn contents can improve vegetative growth of wheat cultivars growing in Mn-deficient soil more effectively than application of Mn fertilizers in soil. Conclusions Further research concerning plant nutrition and plant breeding is required to increase nutrient concentrations in seed, especially Zn, Fe and Mn, to adequate levels, there by enchancing both crop production and human nutrition and health.

Both high content of silt particles or fine sand in the mechanical structure of the soil, and the frequent shallow tillage, and really been promoted the extension of soil compaction in the ploughed layer and below that. The subsoil compaction through limiting of the root penetration into the soil has significantly decreased the yield of tobacco in the last decades. In the field trial 3 ploughing variants that are to a depth of 20, 30 and 40 cm were compared. While the former pan compaction has been lasted at two variants however the deep ploughing has successfully reduced the compaction and increased the aeration in the soil. Improvement of the soil physical state has fairly contributed to the deep rooting and by this means producing a higher leaf-yield of tobacco. Key words: type of soil, soil compaction, tobacco yield and quality, tillage depth Introduction Besides the genetic potential of the variety, the yield and quality of tobacco greatly depend on soil fertility and climate conditions (Collins and Hawks, 1993; Papenfus, 1970). It is well known that flue-cured tobacco prefers loose soils with a low content of organic matter, total and mineral nitrogen and of slightly acid reaction (Turšić, 1992). For this reason, light soils of northern Croatia are suitable for tobacco growing. The tobacco has usually grown in monoculture or in biculture in consequences of the smallfarm production (Turšić et al., 2005). Today, flue-cured tobacco is grown on about 6000 ha and it is exported or used by tobacco industry in Croatia. The low content of colloids and organic matter in soils, and occurrence of fine sand and silt, cause crust formation and compaction of tobacco soils. The subsoil compaction occurrence due to repeated shallow tillage to the same depth limits root penetration into deeper layers (Birkas et al., 2006; Birkas et al., 2007). Subsoil compaction limits the nutrient and water uptake and for this reason limits tobacco yield. The objective of these investigations was to study the influence of soil tillage upon the yield and quality of flue-cured tobacco grown in the given agroecological conditions. Materials and methods Investigations were carried out on Luvic and Semigley soil at the experimental station of the Tobacco Institute in Pitomača and on Cambisol at the state plantation in Vinkovci. In the field trial 3 ploughing variants that are to a depth of 20, 30 and 40 cm were compared. Subsoiling was also used after preceding crop harvest. During the growing season, soil was loosened and pressed by row-cultivator and roll. Leaves of the tobacco were harvested (broken) by hand and suckers were treated with contact and systemic physiotropes. The results were evaluated statistically by the analysis of variance.</p><p id="Pg14">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 688 Results and discussion Field trials were carried out on three soil types, characteristics of the flue-cured tobacco growing area. Because of the unstable structure and repeated shallow tillage to the same depth, increased soil compaction occurs (Table 1.). Table 1.

The climate of the tobacco growing region in Croatia has the characteristics of moderate continental climate. The precipitation deficiency is frequently occurred in July and August requiring irrigation to conserve tobacco quality. Aridity is also more frequent in the eastern part of the tobacco growing region (Figures 1 and 2). The last minimum temperature occurs in April and the first cold days comes generally in October, which are used as the basis for planting time and the length of the growing season, that is ripening and the last harvesting tobacco.

Similar data can be found in the literature from Lipiec and Simota, 1994 and Tursic et al., 2004. However, subsoiling applied to semigley, silty loamy textured soil was beneficial on the tobacco leaf yield and quality (Table 3.). Table 3.

Nevertheless, the obtained difference relative to the unsubsoiled treatment was not significant in the case of shallow tillage which may call attention to use subsoiling repeatedly (Collins and Hawks, 1993). To increase the ploughing depth from 20, 30 and 40 cm resulted in a significant increase of the tobacco leaf yield both on all three soil types and locations (Table 4.). Table 4.

Due to the silty textured properties in the tobacco region of Croatia, both crust formation and soil compaction are frequent during the growing season as the consequence of the intensive run-off, soil settling and application of heavy machinery. Analyses of long-term trials involving cultivation rendered the required results. (Table 5.). Application of a deeper soil loosening between tobacco ridges, along with more ridge cultivation the yield was significantly increased.</p><p id="Pg16">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

The achieved results indicate that higher yields and better quality of tobacco can be reached by the application of adequate agrotechnical measures and soil naturally susceptible to compaction.

D. Obradovica 8, 21000, srdjan@polj.ns.ac.yu 2 Department for small grains, Institute for field and vegetable crops, Novi Sad 3 Department for field and vegetable crops, Faculty of agriculture, University of Novi Sad Abstract: The purpose of the study was to determine the influence of crop rotation, N fertilization and year on wheat grain yield and grain protein content (GPC) at the Experimental Field of the Institute of Field and Vegetable Crops in Novi Sad. Wheat yield varied across crop rotations, investigated years and applied N. Significantly higher yield for the investigated period was found at WSMf whereas WMuf was significantly lower compared to other treatments. GPC differed significantly between copping years (9,73-13.66%) and crop rotations (11.72-13.20%). Grain yield and GPC were inversely but not significantly correlated (r = 0,08). Although WWf had higher GPC (13.20 %) it can not be recommended to farmers due to permanent risk of production failure and somewhat lower yield. Keywords: wheat, grain yield, grain protein, long-term experiment Introduction The rotation cropping of winter wheat is a common agricultural practice. Most authors reported higher yield when rotating wheat with other crops (Berzsenyi et al., 2000), whereas yield losses in mono-cropping are attributed to the exhaustion of nutrients and soil water reserves, pathogen proliferation and lower activity of microorganisms. Crop rotation can add sustainability to a cropping system by improving yields without increased inputs and by promoting soil restoration, though improvement of soil fertility in rotation cropping has not always been followed with higher yield (Revees, 1997). Many studies emphasized N fertilization as a crucial factor in accomplishing of a higher yield (Hornok et al., 2007, Balogh et al., 2007) with sufficient quality (Gut and Bichoński, 2007). Grain protein content is a key component of the end-use wheat quality. Protein content in wheat grain is genetically controlled and influenced by an interaction of cultivar, agro-ecological conditions and crop management (Randall, 1997). The relation between yield and grain protein content has been repeatedly analyzed, however long-term comparison of wheat in mono-cropping and in rotation is not frequent. The objectives of our study were to determine how crop rotations and N fertilization affects winter wheat yields and grain protein content compared with continuous wheat at long-term field experiment. Materials and methods The present study was performed on a long-term crop rotation trial “Plodoredi” at the Rimski Sancevi Experimental station of the Institute of Field and Vegetable Crops in Novi Sad (N 45° 19`, E 19° 50`). The study treatments were: unfertilized 2-year rotation (wheat-maize) WMuf, unfertilized 3-year rotation (wheat-maize-soybean) WMSuf, fertilized wheat monoculture WWf, fertilized 2-year crop rotation (wheat-maize) WMf and fertilized 3-year crop rotation (wheat-maize-soybean) WMSf. The unfertilized plots were established 1946/47 and they have not received mineral fertilizers ever since. Fertilized plots, established in 1969/70 regularly received mineral N fertilizers at 100 kg</p><p id="Pg18">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 692 ha-1 rate for wheat (50 kg ha-1 in autumn and 50 kg ha-1 for topdressing). No fertilizers containing P, K or manure have been used in the trial from 1986, when high levels of nutrients were observed (Tab. 1). Soil analyses indicate that the fertilized plots were significantly lower in pH reaction and highest in SOC compared with unfertilized plots (Tab. 1). Significantly higher SOC was found at WWf compared with other treatments. The unfertilized plots were low in content of available phosphorus, whereas optimal content of available potassium was observed. Content of available phosphorus and potassium at unfertilized plots was statistically lower than fertilized plots where WMf and WSMf greatly exceeded optimal values for P and K for the agricultural soil.

Sowing took place in October (20-30. X) at each field (250 - 300 m2) with seeded rate of 250-270 kg ha-1. Grain yield was adjusted to 14% grain moisture. For the grain protein content (GPC) analyses from each plot three randomized replicates (samples) were taken out of the bulk grain. Grain protein content GPC (N X 5,7db) of whole meal was determined according to Kjeldahl analyses (Tecator, Höganäs, Sweden) by ICC method 105/2 (ICC 1994). In our study yearly average temperature for the investigated period was higher then the long-term average (11.2˚C). Stress condition and higher spring temperatures, occurred in 2000, 2002 and 2003 (Tab. 2). Rainfall sum varied considerably over the four studied years, two out of the four years can be considered dry (1999/00 and 2001/02), one moderately dry (2002/03), and one extremely wet (2000/01). The data were evaluated by least significant difference (LSD0.05) test and by correlation analyses using STATISTICA 7.1. Table 2.

Grain yield varied considerably in all cropping systems (Fig. 1). The investigated period (2000-2003) had lower wheat yields compared to long-term average yields following 34 years of continuous cropping. Highest yield was observed at the WSMf for the investigated period (4,27 t ha-1) and after 34 years of cropping (4,92 t ha-1). WWf demonstrated lower long-term average yield among fertilized plots, however statistically significant differences were not observed (Fig. 1). Lithourgidis et al. (2006)</p><p id="Pg19">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 693 also reported that 25 year wheat monoculture did not show significant yield reduction with time. Nevertheless, WWf showed highest reaction to the environmental condition (Berzsenyi et al., 2000) weeds and diseases. Unfertilized plots were lower in long-term average yields for the investigated period (2000-2003) with 0,62 t ha-1 at MWuf and 0,99 t ha-1 at MSWuf compared with unfertilized plots (Fig. 1). Although plants at unfertilized plots were provided with sufficient amounts of readily available potassium, phosphorus deficiency has been regularly observed after wheat emergency which contributed to lower yield, particularly in dry years (Tab. 1).

The significantly highest GPC was found at WWf (13,20%) and lower at WMSuf (11,72%). The climatic conditions had influenced GPC and hence years with highest temperature and lowest rainfall in april-jun period exerted higher GPC (Tab. 2 and 3). The higher GPC among fertilized rotation observed at WWf can be attributed to the lower grain yield and the greater presence of NO3-N in the soil as a result of annual N fertilization. Beside that, highest SOC content (Tab. 1) and favorable physical soil conditions in plow layer may facilitate N availability at WWf (Machado et al., 2007). At fertilized plots, N fertilization had favorable effect on 1000-kernels weight and test weight which consequently increase yield (Kastori et al., 2005). Omission of fertilizer at unfertilized plots (WMuf and WSMuf) lessened protein accumulation while high temperature shortened grain development period (Balla et al., 2006) and accelerated grain ripening which decreased GPC compared to fertilized plots.

Correlation between grain yield kg ha-1 and of cropping and for the investigated period (2000/03) GPC (%) for the investigated period (2000/03)</p><p id="Pg20">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 694 GPC over 11% found at unfertilized plots resulted from smaller endosperm volume associated with reduced 1000-kernels weight and test weight (Kastori et al., 2005). In drought conditions with reduced duration of grain filling period highest rates of nitrogen accumulation and lower rates of carbohydrate may be responsible for higher GPC at unfertilized plots (Panozzo and Eagles, 1999). We found negative, but not significant correlation (r = -0,08) between yield and GPC. Grain yield and GPC in wheat have been reported to be inversely associated in many studies (Daniel and Triboi, 2000; Drezner et al., 2007). In our study GPC tend to increase with yield (Fig. 2) and then diminish which could be attributed to a dilution with higher test weight and yield. In addition to that the relationship between yield and GPC could be masked by environmental effects if climatic conditions significantly vary during the grain filling period. Conclusions Grain yield of wheat varied considerably across crop rotations, investigated years and applied N. Higher yield for the investigated period was observed at WSMf (4,27 t ha-1) and lower at WMuf (0,62 t ha-1). GPC showed considerable reaction to environmental conditions and crop management. Continuous wheat monoculture had a highest GPC (13.2 %) compared with other cropping systems. For the investigated period grain yield and GPC were inversely but not significantly correlated (r = -0,08) which resulted from dilution with yield and higher test weight. Despite highest GPC at WWf it should be avoided because of high production risk and susceptibility to environmental conditions. Reference Balla K. –Bedő Z. –Veisz O. 2006.

Acid reaction (pH in 1n KCl: &lt;4.5), moderate supplies with total N (&lt;0.15% N), low in AL–soluble P and adequate in AL–soluble K (&lt;5.0 mg P2O5 and &gt;15.0 mg K2O 100 g -1 , respectively) are main characteristics of the soil. Four steps of N fertilization (0, 60, 120 and 250 kg N ha -1 ) from two surces (CAN = calcium ammonium nitrate 27% N and Urea 46% N) on the constant P (80 kg P2O5 from two sources: MAP = monoammonium phosphate 11% N and 52% P2O5 and SP = superphosphate 17% P2O5) and K (60 kg K2O in form of KCl containing 60% K2O) fertilization were used in the experiment. Annual yields in 2005 were for 28% (grain) and 19% (straw) lower than in 2001. Depended on year, mean concentrations were in the ranges from 1.72% N to 2.40% N and from 0.25% to 0.33% P (grain), from 0.41% N to 0.55% N and from 0.032% to 0.056% P (straw). Grain N and P were considerably higher in 2005 (2.40% N and 0.33% P) compared to remaining four tested years (means: 1.96% N and 0.26% P). The analogous values for straw were 0.55% N and 0.056% P (2005), 0.42% N and 0.042% P (means 2001–2004). The highest grain and straw yields for 2001 were accompanied with the lowest grain and straw N and P concentrations. N rates considerably influenced wheat nutritional status and yields. For example, yield increases of N fertilization (means three N rates) were for 65% (grain) and 35% (straw) compared to unfertilized plot (t ha -1 : 2.22 and 3.65 for grain; 3.20 and 4.33 for straw). With that regard, the optimal N rate was 120 kg N ha -1 . N fertilization considerably increased grain and straw N, while P status was similar on three rates of applied N. In general, sources of N and P were less influencing factors of wheat nutritional status and yields and mainly resulted by non–significant differences of tested properties. Keywords: winter wheat, vertisol, nitrogen fertilization, grain yield, straw yield, N uptake, P uptake. Introduction Soil nutritional status is important factor of the field crop yields. With that regard, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) supplies play are especially important role (Bergmann, 1992; Mengel and Kirkby, 2001; Németh, 2006; Pepo, 2007; Baric et al., 2007; Bertic et al., 2007; Drezner et al., 2007). Vertisol is soil of heavy texture and high capacity for absorption and imobilization of some nutrients for field crops. It is estimated that vertisol area in Serbia is about 700,000 ha or 25 % of agricultural land of the country (Živković and Djordjević, 2003). Aim of this study was testing N and P status in wheat grown on vertisol under application of different rates and forms of N and P fertilizers. Materials and methods The winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cultivar KG–56 developed in Institute for Small Cereals in Kragujevac, Serbia) was grown on degraded Vertisol of Central Serbia over the 2000–2005 period. Acid reaction (pH in 1n KCl: &lt;4.5), moderate supplies with total N (&lt;0.15% N), low in AL–soluble P and adequate in AL–soluble K (&lt;5.0 mg P2O5 and &gt;15.0 mg K2O 100 g -1, respectively) are main characteristics of the soil. Four steps of N (fertilization kg N ha-1: 0, 60, 120 and 250) from two surces (CAN = calcium ammonium nitrate 27% N and Urea 46% N) on the constant P (80 kg P2O5 from two sources: MAP = monoammonium phosphate 11% N and 52% P2O5 and SP = superphosphate 17% P2O5) and K (60 kg K2O in form of KCl containing 60% K2O) fertilization were used in the experiment. In the treatment 0 kg N ha-1 only</p><p id="Pg22">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 696 superphosphate was source of P. In the remaining N treatments with MAP as source of P was added 17 kg N ha-1 from MAP and difference of N requirements was added either by CAN or urea. The experiment was duplicated for maize–wheat rotation. The area of the basic experiment plot for P and K fertilization (100 m2) was divided into two subplots (2x50 m2) for applying two sources of N. The trial plots were arranged in a randomized block design with three replications. Wheat was sown in optimal term (mainly in the middle of October) with a seed rate of 600 kernels per m2. Usual soil and crop management practices were used for the experiment. The conventional tillage included ploughing in autumn (25–30 cm depth). The harvest was performed at full maturity stage by using the experimental small trail combine “Sampo”. Yield was calculated on 14% grain moisture basis. Straw and grain samples were collected immediately before harvesting (total 50 plants in mean sample). Straw samples were oven–dried at 60–700C to constant weight. The dried straw and grain samples were ground in an electrical mill and analyzed, using the standard chemical methods (total N by the micro Kjeldahl procedure, total P by vanadat–molybdate method. The statistical calculation of the data was performed according to Mead (1996). Table 1.

Regarding the realized yields, the growing season 2001 (year of harvest) was the most favourable for winter wheat. Variations of the field crop yield among the years for the short period is possible to explain by weather (the effects of “year”). With that regard, according to experiences from Croatia, the lower yields of wheat are mainly in connection with oversupplies of water, especially in the autumn/winter period (Josipovic et al., 2005). Results and discussion Weather characteristics for the individual growing season was important factor of wheat nutritional status and yields. Annual yields in 2005 were for 28% (grain) and 19% (straw) lower than in 2001. The harwest index was for four year (2001–2004) similar and in the range from 47.7% and 48.3%, while in 2005 it was considerably lower (44.62%). Depending on year, mean concentrations were in the ranges from 1.72% N to</p><p id="Pg23">VII.

Grain N and P were considerably higher in 2005 (2.40% N and 0.33% P) compared to remaining four tested years (means: 1.96% N and 0.26% P).

With that regard, the optimal N rate was 120 kg N ha-1. N fertilization considerably increased grain and straw N, while P status was similar on three rates of applied N (Table 3).

For example, under conditions of more fertile soils of eastern Croatia, form of applied N and distribution of N by top dressings are less influencing factors of wheat yields compared to quantities of added N by fertilization (Žugec et al., 1987). Conclusions Weather characteristics (specify of the factor “year”) and quantity of N added by fertilization were main factors of wheat yield and its N and P status. However, form of N (CAN and urea) and P (MAP and superphosphate) were with that regard less influencing factors. References Baric M. -Sarcevic H. -Keresa S. -Habus Jercic I., Rukavina I.: 2007.

Vojvoda Bojovic bb, 78000 Banja Luka, Republic of Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina; e-mail: ilija@rskoming.net Abstract: The field experiment with four rates of phosphorus (P) fertilization was conducted in spring of 2004 with treatments as follows: a) ordinary fertilization (kg ha-1: 200 N + 80 P2O5 + 120 K2O); b) a + 500 kg P2O5; c) a + 1000 kg P2O5; and d) a + 1500 kg P2O5. In the next three years (2005-2007) only ordinary fertilization was applied and residual effects of applied fertilization were tested. Drought and hightemperature stresses were main factors of maize yield dropping for the 2007 growing season because it was even 60% lower than in the previous year (means 3.41 and 7.63 t ha-1, respectively). Under these conditions it was not found effect of applied fertilization However, under favourable conditions of the 2006 growing season, residual effects of P fertilization resulted by yield increases up to 20%. Also, maize responded on the P fertilizations by yield increases up to 32% and 17%, for 2004 and 2005, respectively. Residual effects of P fertilization on leaf nutritional status was found (testing for 2006 only). For example, leaf P, K Cu, and Cd were increased (for 11% , 7%, 25% and 53%, respectively: status on the control = 0.33% P, 1.93% K, 13.1 mg Cu and 0,172 mg Cd kg-1). At the same time, leaf Mg, Mn, Cr, B, Ba and Al were decreased (for 14%, 13%, 16%, 31% ,25% and 28%: status on the control = 0.146% Mg, mg kg-1 = 37.3 Mn, 0.28 Cr,4.41 B, 2.8 Ba and 47.8 Al). For remaining tested elements (Ca, S, Zn, Fe, Mo, Ni,SR, Na and Co) differences were nonsignificant. Grain composition was less depended on fertilization and only for four tested elements significant differences were found as follows: increasing influences for S (+17%), Zn (+25%) and Ni (+54%) and decreasing influences for Sr (-15%) – status on the control = 0.78% S, 20.0 mg Zn, 0.94 mg Ni and 0.69 mg Sr kg-1). Keywords: maize, phosphorus fertilization, yield, leaf, grain, nutritional status Introduction Soils of both sides of wide Sava valley area in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&amp;H) are mainly less favorable physical and chemical properties (Okiljevic et al. 1997). Increased fertilization with phosphorus (P) are usualy recommendations for improvements of these soils (Kovacevic et al. 2004). The field experiments with increased rates of P fertilizer were conducted in the northern Bosnia (Republic of Srpska) with aim of testing of maize response. Material and methods The field experiment The field experiment with four rates of P fertilizers was conducted in term of May 7, 2004 (Medjuvodje, municipality Kozarska Dubica, RS, B&amp;H) with treatments as follows: a) ordinary fertilization (kg/ha: 200 N + 80 P2O5 + 120 K2O); b) a + 500 kg P2O5; c) a + 1000 kg P2O5; and d) a + 1500 kg P2O5. For ordinary fertilization, KAN (calcium ammonium nitrate enriched with Mg: 27% N + 4.8% Mg) and NPK 7:20:30 were applied. The triplephoshate enriched with sulphur and zinc (45% P2O5 + 1,2% S + 0,06% Zn) was used as source of P. The experiment contains four plots, each of 31.5 m2 area and four replicates. Maize was grown on the experimental plot in the four-year period 2004-2007. In the next three years (2005-2007), residual effects of P were tested and the experiment fertilized uniformly (kg ha-1: 200 N + 80 P2O5 + 120 K2O). Maize was sown at beginning of May by pneumatic sowing machine on the thoretical plant density (TPD) 54945 plants ha-1. The hybrid OsSK444 and local indurata white-grain</p><p id="Pg26">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 700 variety were grown for 2006 and 2007, respectively. In this study residual effects of the fertilization (third and fourth year of testing). The results of the first and the second years ( 2004 and 2005) were shown in the earlier study (Komljenović et al., 2006). Sampling, chemical and statistical analysis Soil sampling (0-30 cm depth: mean sample in level of treatment) was made by auger in term August 11, 2005. The ear-leaf of maize was taken at flowering stage (July 25, 2006; 25 leaves in the mean sample) and grain in maturity stage (ten cobs in mean samples) from each basic plot. The total amount of the elements in the leaf and grain samples was measured by the ICP-AES technique after their microwave digestion using concentrated HNO3+H2O2. Oil content in the grain was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy method, while protein and starch contents were determined by Near Infrared spectroscopic method on Foss Tecator ("Infratec 1241 Grain Analyzer"). Statistical analyses were made according Mead et al. (1996). Weather characteristics The growing season 2006 was favorable for maize growth, while water deficit and high air-temperatures are main characteristics of weather for 2007 growing season (Table 1). In general, the low yields of maize are in close connection with wather deficite and the higher air-temperatures, especially during July and August (Kovacevic et al., 2007; Josipovic et al., 2005).

(2006) applied four rates of NPK 10:30:20 up to 3748 kg ha-1 for maize – soybean rotation. Yield increases were up to 14% and up to 32%, for maize and soybean, respectively. However, Banaj et al. (2006) and Loncaric et al. (2005) reported low effects of ameliorative P rates on maize yields, although by previous soil test (ALmethod) moderate levels of available P were found. Conclusions By ameliorative P fertilization grain yields of maize were increased for 32% (2004), 17% (2005) and 20% (2006). Drought and high-temperature stresses were main factors of maize yield dropping for the 2007 growing season because it was even 60% lower than in the previous year and it was not found response of maize to fertilization. Nutrtional status of maize was mainly depended on fertilization, but it was in normal ranges with exception of low leaf Mg. References Banaj D., Kovačević V., Šimić D., Šeput M., Stojić B.: 2006.

YIELD László MÁRTON1 1 Agrochemistry, Research Institute for Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry, 1022 Budapest Herman Ottó Str. 15. Hungary, e-mail: marton@rissac.hu Abstract: Interrelations between NPK nutrients and precipitation were evaluated from 1971 to 2003 using pea as an indicator plant in a long-term fertilization experiment (code: OMTK A-17) was set up on calcareous chernozem soil in Nagyhörcsök in autumn 1967. In the average year the yield on control plots was 2.4 t ha -1 . In dry years the yield dropped to 1.1 t ha -1 without fertilization, a yield reduction of 54 % compared with the average year (2.4 t ha -1 ). The yields recorded in treatments with N, NP, NK and NPK (1.9 t ha -1 ) indicated that the yield loss that could be attributed to dry weather was 39 %. In the case of drought the pea yield on control plots was 54 % lower than in the average year, while this was reduced to 43.3 % in the N, NP and NK treatments and to 45.2 % in the NPK plots. In excessively wet years yield losses compared to the average years were 41.7 % on unfertilized plots, 25.7 % on N, NP and NK plots and 25.8 % on NPK plots, so fertilization was able to counteract 16 % of the negative effect of excessive rainfall. The correlations is with rainfall during the vegetation period, N, NP, NK and NPK nutrition and the yield could be described using quadratic functions for each nutrition level (0: R = 0.9388***, nitrogen: R = 0.8850***, NP: R = 0.9038***, NK: R = 0.8470***, NPK: R = 0.8747***). The results could serve as a good basis for the scientific description of the complex yield-determining effect of processes making the climate wetter or drier, on a Hungarian, EU and international scale. Keywords: pea, natural rainfall, nutrition level, yield Introduction The impact, associated with climate change lie in the interrelation of several systems with many variables that must be collectively considered (Anderson, 2000). Crop production can be defined as one of the systems, and climate the other. If these systems are treated independently, this would lead to an approach which is too fragmentary (Rosenzweig and Hillel, 1993). The issue is more global (IPCC, 2007). It is now held as likely that human activities can affect climate, one of the components of the environment. Climate in turn affects plant production (Láng et al., 2004). It must be further considered that not only climate may be changing, but that human societies and crop develop trends and constraints of their own which climate change impact studies must take into consideration. Crop production of any kind is strongly influenced by the availability of water and soil mineral nutrients (Kádár and Márton, 2007; Kádár et al., 2007). Climate change will modify rainfall, evaporation, runoff, soil moisture storage, and nutrient cycling (Várallyay, 2007). Changes in total seasonal precipitation or in its pattern of variability (drought or rainfall excess) are both important (Márton, 2004ab; 2007). The occurrence of moisture, and nutrient stress during flowering, pollination, and grain-filling is harmful to most crops, and particularly so to pea. Increased evaporation from the soil and accelerated transpiration in the plants themselves will cause moisture and nutient stress; as a result there will be a need to knows scientifically the crop responses (Palmer and Raisanen, 2002). Today, most environmental research focuses on only one, or a very few changes instead of the concomitant multiple changes occurring in pea production. Unfortunately, however, the bulk of past research has focused on one factor at a time. It is obviously the effects of all the environmental changes occurring, rather than just a geochemical element (or just other geochemical elements, or just raifall quantity and distribution, etc.), that is of importance to crop (Márton et al., 2007).</p><p id="Pg30">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 704 Although much of paper focuses on single factors. Objectives of these study was to show interaction findings related to rainfall quantity, rainfall distribution changes and N, P, K fertilization effects on pea yield formation on a calcareous chernozem soil in the “Mezőföld” experimental site at Nagyhörcsök in Hungary from 1971 to 2003. Furthermore, it was our intent to emphasize that the net effect of multiple environmental changes on pea yield is far more important than the effect of a single factor on that crop. Materials and methods The long-term NPK fertilisation experiment (code: OMTK A-17) was established on a calcareous chernozem soil in Nagyhörcsök using pea as an indicator plant in autumn 1967. The soil of the experimental area was with time deposits, formed on loess, with around 3-5% CaCO; 2.5-3.0% humus and 20-22% clay in the ploughed layer; it was originally satisfactorily supplied with N and K, but had poor supplies of P and Zn. There were 20 treatments in the pea experiments, arranged in a split-split-plot design with four replications, giving a total of 80 plots. Fertiliser application rates (kg ha-1 year -1) averaged 0, 39, 67, 99, 125 N; 0, 52, 104, 158 P2O5 and 0, 96, 152 K2O. The fertilisers were applied in the form of calcium ammonium nitrate, superphosphate and potassium chloride. The groundwater depth was 13-15 m and the area was prone to drought, with a mean annual rainfall sum of 550--600 mm. Rainfall amounts, deviation in rainfall from the average over many years (dry year -10 - -20%, drought year -20% over, wet year +10 - +20%, year with excess rainfall +20% over) and other related data were determined based on traditional Hungarian (Harnos, 1993) and Research Institute for Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (Márton, 2004) standards, and MANOVA (Multivariate Analysis of Variance) by SPSS test. Results and discussion Based on "general" (Harnos, 1993) rainfall deficiency values and on those specific for pea (Márton, 2004), the years were classified as average (1987), dry (1979, 1991, 1995), droughty (1971, 1983, 2003) and excessively wet (1975, 1999). In the average year the yield on control plots was 2.4 t ha-1, equivalent to the national average. This minimum main product yield was exceeded by 0.7 t ha-1 in the NPK treatment giving the maximum yield. However, this was not economically better than the N, NP and NK treatments, which gave a yield increase of around 0.6 t ha-1. In dry years the yield dropped to 1.1 t ha-1 without fertilization, a yield reduction of 54 % compared with the average year (2.4 t ha-1). The yields recorded in treatments with N, NP, NK and NPK (1.9 t ha-1) indicated that the yield loss that could be attributed to dry weather was 39 %. A 15 % improvement in yield could thus be achieved by means of NPK nutrition. In the case of drought the pea yield on control plots was 54 % lower than in the average year, while this was reduced to 43.3 % in the N, NP and NK treatments and to 45.2 % in the NPK plots. The yield-reducing effect of drought could thus be moderated by 10 % through NPK fertilization. In excessively wet years yield losses compared to the average years were 41.7 % on unfertilized plots, 25.7 % on N, NP and NK plots and 25.8 % on NPK plots, so fertilization was able to counteract 16 % of the negative effect</p><p id="Pg31">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 705 of excessive rainfall. The correlations is with rainfall during the vegetation period, N, NP, NK and NPK nutrition and the yield could be described using quadratic functions for each nutrition level (0: R = 0.9388***, nitrogen: R = 0.8850***, NP: R = 0.9038***, NK: R = 0.8470***, NPK: R = 0.8747***). The seed yield surplus per mm rainfall during the vegetation period and the quantity of natural rainfall used for the production of 1 kg air-dry matter ranged from 3.3-10.6 kg ha-1, and 942-3071 1, depending on the treatment and year. The results could serve as a good basis for the scientific description of the complex yield-determining effect of processes making the climate wetter or drier, on a Hungarian, EU and international scale. Conclusions Our results show that it is possible to quantify the interrelations of drought, excess rainfall, and NPK fertilization on crop production by modifiable dynamic crop models. Furthermore, presentation with our own Pea-Model illustrate how exacerbated conditions of drought and excess precipitation under climate change, arising from an increased frequency of extreme rainfall events, may add significant negative pressure on pea yields, farm production levels and farmers in the Hungary. Despite the necessity of further research development, our results clearly indicate that the corresponding additional economic costs to pea production can be significant, given the considerable losses already incurred by farmers under the current climate regime. Researching improvements are thus needed to capture and accurately represent these effects in climate change impact assessment studies.

Within the pest control the weed management has the highest priority in a way of agronomy and economy. In our research we examined different weed management technologies in a way of income considering yield and costs in corn production. Prime factors were the whole field spraying and the band spraying at sowing complemented with in-row cultivation. In the Hungarian agriculture the practice of precision farming technology is spreading. The great importance of the precision farming technology is the reduction of environmental damage and to preserve the soil productivity. The aim of this study is to make analysis about material and operational costs of the precision weed management technology according to the traditional/conventional technologies in both cases mentioned above. Keywords: weed management, precision farming, price sensitivity Introduction Information on weed species and weed coverage is required in the decision making process concerning weed management technology. The weed control with herbicides is necessary due to the significant weed coverage in the wide-spaced cultures like corn, sunflower and sugar-beet. (Német et al., 2007) There are many different ways of weed management with herbicides in the current Hungarian agricultural practice. Whole spraying is general, but brand spraying integrated with stand cultivation is also commonly applied. (Szél E., 2006) In wide spaced cultures the preemergent weed management method is used mostly in practice. Mainly the weeds growing from seeds are cleared by this technology. We should calculate with perennial weeds that could be cleared by postemergent herbicides. The precision farming technology has key role function in the planning and realization of weed management (Német et al., 2007; Reisinger-Pálmai, 2007). The highest advantage of using precision farming technology can reduce the quantity of over spread chemicals (fertilizer and herbicide), the site-specific information, like soilmaps help to reach this reduces. The lower quantity of chemicals has serious economic saves, other hands we use less chemicals, so the soil charging is also lower and reduce the hazard of the wash out. The unhealthy substances-rate in the soil not spring up. The lower environmental damage appears in the condition of the plants, the yieldpositivenes become higher, reduce the amount of the chemical remains both in the soil and in the plants. Precision weed management makes it possible to use herbicide-like micro-plots need. Precision farming technology provides a solution for decreasing input costs, while minimising the coverage of weeds and its negative effects on yield (Kalmár et al., 2004; Barkaszi – Takács-György, 2007). The well-determined weed management strategies can reduce risk of production and uncertainty of yield. Moreover, precision farming technology can reduce the material costs significantly. This change is due to modification of herbicide needs on the microplots. However less herbicide does not mean automatically more income, because the</p><p id="Pg34">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 708 site specific spraying needs special equipment which increases both the production costs and fixed costs due to the necessary investment. A basic economic principle of the application of precision weed control is that cost saving from the reduced herbicide usage has to cover the increased machine operation and technology costs (Kalmár et al. 2004). Present study examines some different weed management technologies regarding cost factors and effects on income. Materials and methods The aim of model-calculation is to examine the income in corn production with different weed management technologies. The whole field spraying (hereinafter Atechnology) and band spraying at sowing complemented with in-row cultivation (hereinafter B-technology) was examined concerning economic effects of these technologies like precision farming. The case study examines the effect of income by model-calculation which count with yields and costs information in the corn weed management. Type of soil, herbicide etc. was the same in every examined technology in the model. The basic elements were variable cost of weed management and operation cost of these technologies. Yield of whole field spraying was considered as 100%, the yield of other case was correlated to this. Price of yield was 140 EUR per ton. Higher yield is expected with the help of precision weed management (Takácsné, 2003). The yield deviation was 10% with B-technology, and 15% with A-technology in the research (Table 1). The basic data come from field experiment managed by Szegedi Gabonatermesztési Kutató Kht. in 2006. Data from the Agricultural Mechanisation Institute (Gödöllő) were used for the calculation of the operational costs. We used the machinery costs of a 76-100 KW capacity technology line, on the 2nd field and soil category. Increasing of operation costs compared to A-technology was the following (Takácsné – Barkaszi, 2005): 64% in band spraying at sowing complemented with in-row cultivation (B-technology); 84% in precision band spraying at sowing complemented with in-row cultivation (hereinafter C-technology); 20% in precision whole field spraying (hereinafter D-technology). Based on former studies we calculated the decrease in herbicide dosage and in costs by 20% compared to B-technology and by 40% compared to A-technology in the case of precision spraying. (Takácsné – Barkaszi, 2005). Price sensitivity of different weed management technologies was also examined with a simulation model. The question was how the gross margin per hectare changes if the price of yield changes.</p><p id="Pg35">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 709 Table 1.

The change of profitability shows that in economic terms the most unfavourable is the band spraying at sowing complemented with in-row cultivation (B-technology), because in this case the increase of income is less than 20% according to the whole field spraying (A-technology), while the precision band spraying at sowing complemented with in-row cultivation’s increase of income is 47% (Table 2.)

Price sensitivity of gross margin Source: Own calculation</p><p id="Pg36">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 710 As regards price sensitivity the precision whole field spraying (D-technology) was proved to be the most responsive. This technology means 15% increase of income if the price of yield increases by 10%. In the other case the precision band spraying at sowing complemented with in-row cultivation (C-technology) results only 10% increase of income by the same price fluctuation. (Figure 1.) Conclusions Both the precision whole field spraying (D-technology) and the precision band spraying at sowing complemented with in-row cultivation (C-technology) use less herbicides than the traditional weed management technologies, hereby the soil damage is lower. Come true a sort of environmental-conscious production with use precision farming technology. The band spraying at sowing complemented with in-row cultivation (C-technology) is the most reasonable in economic terms. Out of the examined alternatives, this technology can be easily adapted with low costs. The increase of operation costs and the decrease of material costs are the leading factors in this technology, since the yield changes are almost the same in every examined technology. Due to this the technology which has the highest cost change respond the least for the price change. Further on the level of income is examined in order to find the interval of weed coverage which allows the precision farming technology.

Keywords: soil-plant interrelations, land use, plant production, technological development Introduction The basic of successful agronomy, plant production, land use in practise is the harmony between the elements of soil-plant interrelation. In this harmony the knowledge regarding the technical development and efficiency can be important as well as the classical agronomical knowledge. That is what we would like to emphasise in our paper. By presenting some coherency, we indicate that the key to success can be the intention for complexity in this area as well. Materials and methods This paper focuses on the complexity in the soil-plant interrelations. We show the main elements of complex agricultural technical development based on our experiences and references. These elements and connecting philosophy can help to implementing and checking the management of soil-plant interrelations. Results and discussion Some elements of the complex technical development The main source of the agricultural production development is the technological development. This system of activity is the aggregation of continuous, complex and consistent activities, that have an impact on the elements of the agricultural production (soil, labour and capital goods) causing quantity and quality changes. By this, the production reaches a higher level and in favourable cases it becomes more efficient. The technological development has a number of economical functions besides the modernization of production. In order to help to understand the definition we have created the ’matrix model’ of the agricultural technical development. The model in the matrix expresses the relationship between the basic elements of the agricultural production and the effective factors of technical development. (Figure 1.) Based on the model an organization can specify its technical development tasks at a point where a given row meets a given column. The matrix model cannot be considered statically, it is easy to adjust it to the given external and internal circumstances and to the changes of these circumstances in two dimensions (time and space). In connection with the</p><p id="Pg38">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 712 agricultural technical development it is obvious that during the production development the ecological conditions (opportunities and givens) cannot be ignored. On one hand these can be the conditions of production development on the other hand these can restrict it as well. The agricultural technical development has to ensure that it makes the best of the ecological opportunities and that it avoids the disadvantageous effects. This question is complicated by the fact that part of the ecological factors (above all the climatic circumstances) can hardly or not at all be influenced by humans. That is why it is important to focus on those factors that can be positively influenced by human intervention. Figure 1. The simplified “combination-matrix-model” of the agricultural technical development From this list we can highlight the soil which we consider the essential element of production. It is known that Hungary’s land features and the shape of their surfaces are different in respect of the agricultural production and its automatisation. The physicalchemical composition of land, its structure and the way it can be cultivated can differ in landscapes plants regardless of administrative, plant or natural borders. The same differences can arise in respect of the surface of the land. If we consider these as objective givens we can see that the effective factors of the technological development are partially applicable considering the ecological givens and opportunities. Based on our experience the features of land and its surface influence the applicable output of machines, the speed, the width of the work area etc. We can also see that the composition of soil has an effect on how the machine should be used and how safe the machine is, how long it can be used and the deterioration period. In connection with the effective factors of technological development it is necessary to analyze the role and importance of complexity. Some practical examples prove that if the harmonization of development factors fails the expected advantages and ambitions cannot be realized. During the technical development, the effective factors need to be harmonized otherwise as a result of the ’minimum law’ the final result of development will be limited by a factor from the lowest level.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 713 technological development embedded in the innovation process is to provide an integration function between the factors mentioned above. Within the frameworks of this we have to ensure that the effective factors are optimised and that there is harmony between the development factors in time and space. Intensification vs Extensification The results of the complex agricultural technological development is well indicated by the results reached in the area of the agriculture’s intensification. As it always happens: in line with the expansion of intensive agriculture, its opponents showed up. Certain critics are confident (think) that if we correlate the production factors deriving from the industry (fertiliser, pesticide, machines, energy sources etc.) to the living labour and soil utilization, we get a high ratio that needs to be reduced in the future. Connecting with this question there are two evergreen ideas – in point of Schmitz (1991). The first: the decisions connecting with the structure of agriculture are traditionally belonging to the farmers. We have to remember this triviality of market economy regarding agriculture). In this area there are some good examples when practice differed from the principle eg in case of milk and sugar quotes, the restriction of animal husbandry, the regulations regarding quantity requirements, the extensification policy. It would be practical if the farmer’s rights to decide about the production program and the use of production factors would remain. The variegation that is necessary for economical survival could only come into existence this way by combining the factors differently in every plant, region and country and not by a central order that aims uniformity. The farmer should at least get some advice not instructions/orders. The second: in the debate of agricultural policy we come to a certain point where we have to think about the piece in connection with the environment, society and the third world. Here the economical compatibility is overshadowed. We have to see that there is a significant conflict between ecology and economy – environment and land using. The economical development, the growth of the quantity of social products and the improving standard of living will be comparable to the use of resources, the energy waste, the strain of the environment (soil, water, air) an the menace of humans, animals and plants. (Schmitz 1991.) The role of some production factors To illustrate the above mentioned here are some interesting data given by Pepó (2004) based on Landonin’s article (1999) about the role of cultivation (or production) factors in wheat cultivation. (Table 1.) According to these data it is conspicuous that on the lower level of technological development (typically in case of extensive technologies) the total ratio of soil, type and cultivation is 65% while in case of intensive technologies (where the technological development is of a higher level) this ratio is much lower, totally it is 40%. It is conspicuous that the importance (’role’) of soil is 30% less in intensive case while the effect of type is 15% bigger than in case of extensive technologies. In respect of the soil-plant relation the role of fertilization could also be important since in case of intensive technologies this factors weights the most, 30%. Knowing this, there is a risk that the use of chemicals in chemical fertilizers can grow to unlimited volumes. ’Fortunately’ the economical considerations (above all the price of chemical fertilizers) hold rational farmers down. However there are some reasonable options that could reduce the use chemicals considering complexity.</p><p id="Pg40">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

According to him in order to reduce the use of chemicals, the opportunities given by the force crop should be taken into consideration. Beside this, the areas of force crop should be ecologically optimized, plants collecting nitrogen should be grown in a bigger proportion and the use of the biomass should be more rational in order to improve the fertility of soil. (Győrffy 1991.) Pepó (2004) announced some data regarding the factors effecting the quality of wheat. According to him to reach the wished quality the weight of type should be 27% while that of soil should be 10%. (For completeness here are all the data: agronomy 41% direct factors – fertilization, plant protection 25%, indirect factors: force crop, seeding, harvest 16%. Ecological factors: 32% - weather: 22%, soil and other factors: 10%, type :27%. Total 100%) Conclusion In respect of the success of plant protection the soil-plant relation has an essential significance. We only can be efficiently successful in this area if we strive for the harmonized complexity of the effective factors. These intentions are supported by the technological development which objects to harmonize the biological, chemical, technical and human factors within the frameworks of the given ecological effects. The ’matrix-model’ helps to illustrate these ideas and systematize the duties. The approach of complexity is also important in the soil-plant relation since there exists a kind of ’minimum-law’ in this area as well so the final result will be defined by an influencing factor that is present at a minimum level. Knowing this we should enforce a complex and systematic approach. References Győrffy B.: 1991. Növénytermesztés, talajerőgazdálkodás. Magyar Tudomány No. 11. pp.: 1334-1339.

Eötvös University, Pázmány P. stny. 1/c., Budapest, H-1117, Hungary, e-mail: kalapos@ludens.elte.hu Abstract: The plantation of Pinus nigra on Pannonian dolomite slopes started in the early 20th century and continued in several waves. The main purpose of afforestation was to stop soil erosion on the slopes originally covered by grazed rock grasslands. It was also assumed that the pine improves the soil, thus makes possible the planting of other, economically more valuable tree species later on. Our work focused on the quantification of the effect of pine stands on the soil of closed dolomite grassland, a vegetation type frequently subjected to afforestation. Soil samples were taken from 3 depths (0-5, 5-10 and 10-15 cm ) at 5-5 sites, then traditional chemical variables (pH, humus %, available N-, P-, K-content, etc) were determined in the laboratory. Under pine plantation acidification was significant only in the uppermost 5 cm. Regarding the humus content the pine plantation soils never exceeded the corresponding soil layers in the closed dolomite grassland. Most soil variables (Ca 2+ , Na + , K + , SO4 2, NH4 + , etc.) had lower values in the pine plantation soil, than in the closed grassland. Soil amelioration on dolomite slopes, due to Pinus nigra plantations is not supported by our results. Keywords: Budai Mts., pine stands, rock grassland, soil chemistry, soil improvement, statistical evaluation. Introduction Since the beginning of the 20th century extension of Pinus nigra Arn. plantations increased gradually on dolomite slopes in the Hungarian Central Mountain Range (Tamás 2003). The main aim of the afforestation was to stop soil erosion (Centeri 2002) on slopes formerly covered by grazed rock grasslands. Relying on soil resilience (Várallyay 2006, 2007), it was also assumed that the pine improves the soil and thus makes it appropriate for planting other, economically more valuable tree species later on. From the results of earlier studies conducted in the Budai Mts (Járó 1996), soil improvement by pines remained unsettled. Jobbágy and Jackson (2000) also discussed that the upper 100 cm of forest soils usually do not contain more humus than that of grassland and shrubland soils, although, in forests a higher proportion of total humus content appears in the uppermost 20 cm of soil. In our case, when typical A-C soils are studied both grasslands and pine plantations can only affect the humus content of the topmost 10-20 cm of soil. If the amount of needle litter subjected to decomposition is considerably higher than the amount of decomposing litter of grasslands, then the soil of the plantations should express higher humus content and better nutrient supply (Németh 2006). A somewhat decreased pH under Pinus nigra stands can also be expected. Materials and methods An extant closed rock grassland (RG) and a large pine plantation (PP) were selected as study areas on north-facing slopes of the dolomite region of Budai Mts, Hungary.</p><p id="Pg42">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 716 Afforestation at PP site took place between 1948 and 1950, where formerly the area was covered by closed rock grassland. RG site was never afforested and supports a diverse grassland vegetation with several rare and protected species. Both sites belong to the Budai Mts Nature Conservation Area. In each study area 5-5 quadrats of 2 m  4 m size were selected (Table 1). Table 1. General geographical characteristics of quadrats selected for soil sampling on dolomite slopes.

At each quadrat four soil cores were cut (1-1 at each side of the quadrat), and in each core three soil horizons (0-5, 5-10 and 10-15 cm) were treated separate. In the laboratory, stones larger than 2 mm, roots and other debris were removed by sieving, then the 4-4 sub-samples of corresponding soil layers were merged. From the merged soil samples traditional chemical parameters were determined: sample pre-treatment, pH: MSz 21470/2-81; humus content: according to Tyurin; K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3 -, SO4 2-: water extract (1 : 5), MSz 080213-2:1978; NH4 +-, NO3 - -content: KCl-extract, MSz 20135:1999; available P (P2O5), K (K2O): Lakanen-Erviö (LE)-extract. Values of soil properties of corresponding soil layers were statistically evaluated by t-test. F-test was used to compare variances.

In the soil of pine plantations higher concentrations were measured than in the closed rock grassland soil for Mg2+ in the upper two layers, and for Ca2+, K+, NH4 + for every layers. Concentrations of available P (P2O5), NO3 - and SO4 2- were statistically identical regarding any layers. Under pine stand, acidification was detected in the upper soil layer only (pH= 7.1 ±0.1). Járó (1996) also detected relatively low pH values in the upper soil layers in some of his study sites, however, his measured values varied in a wide range (pH= 6.7-7.5). The humus content of pine stand soil never exceeded the humus content of corresponding layers of grassland soil. Additionally, in the middle soil layer (5-10 cm) humus value in the grassland was higher than that for the pine plantation. It is remarkable because the humus content of the grassland soil in this study was not very high, if compared to humus content of some other similar grassland sites (Centeri et al. 2007, Pottyondi et al. 2007). In Járó’s study, the humus content was also a somewhat higher in the rock grassland sites than under pine stands (Járó 1996), however, the varying sampling depth he used from site to site, makes the comparison difficult. Conclusions From the possible 36 pairwise comparisons of soil parameters, values were significantly higher in the closed rock grassland soil in 20 cases, and there were only two cases when the higher values characterised the pine plantation soil. This means that afforestation of grazed dolomite slopes by Pinus nigra did not result in considerable increase of the soil nutrient content. Consequently, the anticipated soil improvement by pine plantations was either missed or it only happened in soil layers deeper than 15 cm (beyond the scope of this study). The more uniform distribution of elements (lower SDs) in the pine stand’s soil was also demonstrated. It can be an additional effect (beside reduced light under pine trees) in causing impoverishment of grassland vegetation under the plantations as discussed by Csontos et al. (1996).</p><p id="Pg44">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 718 In conclusion, our results do not support the widely held assumption of soil amelioration on dolomite slopes due to the positive influence of Pinus nigra plantations. Consequently, such pine plantations possess merely negative qualities: low diversity monocultures of an alien tree species; which cause high plant protection risk and high risk of wildfires. Therefore, replacement of pine by native tree species is an urgent need, especially in nature reserves, and it also meets the aims of Uniteed Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (Ligetvári et al. 2006). Probably the best candidate for tree replacement is Fraxinus ornus L., an abundant native tree of xerothermic forests on dolomite slopes (Penksza et al. 1996), which was recommended for erosion control plantations before the introduction of P. nigra into this landscape. More recently Kalapos and Csontos (2003) reported that F. ornus often appears spontaneously under pine plantations on dolomite hills and forms a subordinate tree layer due to its wide range of ecophysiological and morphological plasticity.

Abstract: We examined and evaluated the contention of Hungarian plant producing farms in the European Union using the FADN database. The experience shows that the competitiveness of Hungarian farms compared both to the EU 25 and to other countries of similar agricultural aptitude, variation is shown in competitiveness depending on farm size and farm type. At the same time, low profitability is common for even farms with relative competitiveness. Our research points out that plant producing farms possess comparative advantages due to good soil plant interrelation, but current problems are to be searched within the volume and ratio of input, a problem that roots in the Regime-change. We propose that a rational solution to these problems needs well designed structural political and developmental actions, which center element has to be based on cooperation of farmers. Keywords: competitiveness, cost-structure, efficiency, European Union, FADN Introduction The development of the Hungarian agriculture in the past half a century lacked the developmental dynamics experienced in most of the Western European countries. First the establishment of the large holdings system then its abolishment in 1990 had been carried out in such contradictory ways that resulted in Hungary being in a specific situation, a different one even from the Middle and Eastern European countries’, despite their similar developmental path. The agrarian political actions taken after 1990 achieved ambivalent successes and could not give adequate answers to the problems, rather they only conserved the existing situation. [Takács-György – Sadowski 2005] At the same time, todays economical and political trends urge to increase the farms competitveness. [Varga 2006] Soil, as a basic agricicultural resource, significantly influences the profatibility of plant producing farms and soil influences their competiveness. The aptitude of Hungarian lands and the soil type gives Hungary comparative advantages in plant production, and the high natural efficency index indicates the existence of a good soil-plant interrelation. In order to exploit these aptidudes in farming, soil productiveness has to be maintained by agrotechnological and chemical utensils, which places significant expenses on the farms. [Barkaszi – Takács-György 2007, Husti 2006, Takács-György 2007, Magó 2006, Birkás et. al. 2007] If a farm has other expenses additionally to the above mentioned, at a more expensive ratio than the other farms’, the comparative advantage of the farm will be lost. This research examines whether economical factors streghten or weaken the existing comparative advantages in natural resources. Materials and methods During our research we relied on seconder data that came from two datebases. On the one hand we used data available from the European Union’s public database of Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). Our research was done for the year 2005, but as a</p><p id="Pg46">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 720 control we did the calculations for 2004 as well. The FADN database comprises data on the factor level for country and regional divisions, in categories of activity and economic farm size. In or research we used data on the specialist field crops farms (specialist cereals, oilseed and protein crops and general field cropping) of the 25 member states divided into 6 (+1) categories, (which are the following: (1) 0- &lt;4 ESU, (2) 4- &lt;8 ESU, (3) 8- &lt;16 ESU, (4) 16- &lt;40 ESU, (5) 40- &lt;100 ESU, (6) &gt;= 100 ESU and Total). The database comprises 152 standard variables from which we used the following variables for our research: farms represented, total output, total fixed assets and total inputs and its sub-components. The methodology used by FADN defines total input as the sum of (1.) total specific costs (like seeds and plants, fertilisers, crop protection); (2.) total farming overheads ((2.1) machinery and building current costs, (2.2) energy, (2.3) contract work); (3.) depreciation and (4.) total external factors ((4.1) wages paid, (4.2) rent paid, (4.3) interest paid). (Tab. 2) On the other hand we used the database of EUROSTAT. From the database we utilized the data of the 25 member states of the European Union for 2005. The indexes characteristically described the member states’ resource endowment (for instance: agricultural and arable field size), farm structure (for example: the number of farms by farm size and land size, the rate of utilization depending on farm and land size), and production structure (for instance: production area per plant). Made from the previous index groups, all together 38 absolute and relative indexes were used in the cluster-analysis to find out, which EU member states are the most similar to Hungary regarding their agricultural capabilities. Besides the multiple variables statistic method we used single variable methods as well in our research. Farm efficiency is an important factor of competitiveness. Efficiency can be expressed in numerous ways but we used productivity indexes to evaluate efficiency. Productivity is the yield (total output (EUR)) produced by a resource unit (total input (EUR) and total fixed assets (EUR)) used in production. Therefore input efficiency (x) is accordingly the quotient of total output and total input (EUR/EUR) and assets efficiency (y) is the quotient of total fixed assets (EUR/EUR). Using the received efficiency indexes we clustered the member states according to the following figure:           Y Yy X Xx yxP ii )( ; )( ),( where: xi , yi = the efficiency indexes of the countries; X, Y = average value of the group examined. Based on the relative deviation from the average of the examined group (I. EU 25 and II. Cluster states) we clustered the countries into 4 groups. Group 1: below average input efficient but above average assets efficient countries, Group 2: above average input and assets efficient countries, Group 3: below average input and assets efficient countries, Group 4: above average input efficient but below average assets efficient countries. Results and discussion Comparing the input efficiency of the EU 25 Field crops farms (axis x) and their assets efficiency (axis y) we managed to identify the contention of Hungarian farms.

The frittered away, heterogenic farm structure, production resource allocation problems, resource gap and the lack of horizontal and vertical integration are all operating against the efficiency of production. - To solve the highlighted problems we think that planned and sustainable structural and developmental political actions are needed, which are considerate of all the pillars of agriculture (social, ecological, economic). For the complete fruition of this, we believe that cooperation between farmers needs to be urged.

Abstract: In Bekes County in Hungary we conducted a questionnaire study complemented with interviews about the private plant producer farms’ willingness to cooperate and we examined what factors affect cooperation. The hypothesis of the statistic research was that the producers’ willingness to cooperate is in a tight correlation but in inverse ratio to farm size and technological endowment. The research proved that the willingness to cooperate, compared to the factors examined, is in negative relation to farm size and positive relation to assets deficiency. The statistic researches have not established significant correlation between the examined factors and the willingness to cooperate, they confirmed it in its tendencies. The research has vindicated the blurring effects of psychological motives on economic rationality. Our research further established that lease provider relations are the dominant relation between producers, and in the future the dominance of this quasi cooperative alternative will remain. Keywords: cooperation, private farms, web of coopreration, willingness to cooperate Introduction Soil, as the most basic natural resource, significantly influences competitiveness of plant producing farms. Hungary, based on its regional characteristics and its soil features, has comparative advantages regarding some determining arable land plants, which expresses the existing good soil-plant interrelation in high natural indexes. However, this advantage in the economic sense is lost, because during production, the structure and volume of inputs impose significant expenses on the farms [Barkaszi – Takács-György 2007, Husti 2006, Takács-György 2007, Magó 2006, Birkás et. al. 2007, Várallyay 2007]. The explanation of this phenomenon roots in the solutions chosen after the Regime Change. The fractured, heterogenic farm structures, the problems in allocating the resources of production and the resource deficiency are all adding to the inefficiency of production. We think that economically adequate answers can be given through the cooperation of farms. At present, the willingness to cooperate is weak in Hungary; therefore in our judgment it is important and crucial to identify those factors that affect the producers willingness to cooperate and also to identify those institutionalized cooperative solutions that producers accept in the framework of cooperating with other producers. Materials and methods The research was based on primary data. To examine the Hungarian producers’ willingness to cooperate and the factors influencing cooperation, we conducted a study questionnaire complemented with interviews in Békés parish in the Southern Plains region of South-East Hungary. The number (N) of the examined farms is 111, which represents 0.25% of the private farms of Békés parish and it is a 0.02% representation of private farms nation wide. The private farms were grouped according to their economic</p><p id="Pg50">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 724 size. The method used to create these groups is the same method used by the European Union, therefore the created groups according to their economic size is following: (1) 0 - &lt;4 ESU, (2) 4 - &lt;8 ESU, (3) 8 - &lt;16 ESU, (4) 16 - &lt;40 ESU, (5) 40 - &lt;100 ESU, (6) &gt;= 100 ESU. At the industrial level, 88.6% of the Standard Gross Margin (SGM) comes from field crop production of the farms examined, which means that these farms are Specialist Fieldcrops based on EU typology. The questionnaires filled in by the farmers comprised questions on the general characteristics of the farm (type of farm, range of activities, size of owned or leased area), questions on natural indicators of farming (production structure, results, machinery endowment, etc), and the questionnaires also comprised questions related to the farmers' willingness to cooperate (frequency and type of cooperation, their cognition on the institutionalized forms of cooperation). It is important to note that we used closely and widely interpreted cooperation differentiatedly. Under closely interpreted cooperation we meant deeper relations between the farmers, like the lending of machinery, assets and equipments and helping physically and mechanically. Under the widely interpreted cooperation we also included lease providing of machinery. The producers evaluated their closely interpreted cooperative willingness on a scale 1 to 4. Where 1 is –never cooperate; 2 is – very rarely; 3 is – with medium frequency; 4 is – often. To express the assets endowment of the farms, we used the assets capital (EUR•ha-1) fixed in the machinery and assets. The value of the machinery was determined in their market price. In order to be able to determine the level of mechanization of the farms and how independent they are regarding mechanization, we introduced the “need of extraneous machinery” index. This index is based on the technological need derived from the production structure of the farm and it shows the workload that a farm can not finish by its own merits and has to provide it somehow from external resources. This workload was determined by lease providing tariffs. We used assets efficiency indexes to express the efficiency of the utilization of the machinery-assets capital fixed in production. The assets efficiency index is the quotient of the value of gross production of the plant producing sectors and of the market value of the total machinery assets. The utilization of the farms’ technological resource capacity was determined by the numbers of Takács-György [1994]. The estimated utilization value was calculated based on the work done within the farm. We conducted the research using one and two variables statistic methods (calculation of average and relative deviation, calculation of correlation) and using the graphical boxplot built on the statistic methods. Using the experience from questionnaires and interviews with the farmers we examined what is the type, strength and direction of the cooperation between the farmers. To illustrate the relations revealed this way, using the example of two neighboring parishes, we composed a “web of relations”. We differentiated “clean” cooperation between farms, which comprises machinery and assets lending and helping physically, and we differentiated lease provider relationship, which can be casual or repetitive. We defined repetitive relation as regular jobs that include one or more activity every year, and we defined the casual relationship to be ad-hoc, non regular, continuous jobs. From another</p><p id="Pg51">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 725 perspective we distinguished one way (simplex) and two ways (duplex) relations. In simplex relations, one provides service to the other in return of money. In duplex relations they both provide services to each other, and squaring is based on money or clearing. Results and discussion The statistic research showed that there is correlation, even if low leveled, between farm size and the willingness to cooperate. The research shows that increase in farm area has a negative affect on the willingness to cooperate. It further showed a low leveled positive correlation with assets deficiency of the farms.

Co-operation web of farms Conclusions It can be said generally, that as the farm size decreases the willingness to cooperate of the farms increases, especially because of economic coercive factors. Although it is the smallest farms (1) that showed the largest deviation from the above statement, because due to their small economic size and peculiarities linked to it (for instance: part time) they have low level of interest. We experienced that farmers do not have knowledge of the different institutionalized forms of cooperation and their characteristics (for example: machinery rings), which also has a negative influence in the evolving of cooperation. The results show that producers refrain from any type of cooperation based on common property, and that they marked lease providing machinery acceptable as a quasi cooperational alternative.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 727 STUDY OF GENOTYPE FERTILIZER RESPONSES IN SUNFLOWER (Helianthus annuus L.) PRODUCTION János BÍRÓ1 – Péter PEPÓ2 1 Syngenta Seeds Ltd., Budapest e-mail: janos.biro@syngenta.com 2 Institute of Crop Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Debrecen Abstract: The results of our long-term experiments on chernozem soil proved that the sunflower hybrids could adapt well to the dry, warm year partially due to the favourable soil characteristics. According to our scientific results we can state, although the occurrence of Diaporthe infection (control 14-18 %, N150+PK 2128 %) and head diseases (control 7.1-18.1 %, N150+PK 16.0-32.8 %) increased, but the increasement was moderate due to the warm, dry weather. Our results proved that the hybrid-specific fertilizer response of sunflower hybrids can be described by the natural nutrient utilization ability in the control (4200-4900 kg ha -1 in 2007), the realized maximum yield (5400-5900 kg ha -1 ) and the optimum fertilizer dosage (N30-60-90+PK depending on the hybrid). Keywords: sunflower, hybrid, fertilization Introduction Sunflower production has several critical elements (sowing technology, nutrient supply, crop protection etc.). Sunflower is a crop which can utilize the natural nutrient stock of the soils well. In the case of over fertilization, the crop protection and agronomical problems can occur, while the lack of nutrients results in yield loss. The effect and efficiency of fertilization are significantly influenced by the agroecological (soil, weather) and agrotechnical conditions. The effects of year (Borbélyné et al. 2007) and global climate change (Várallyay 2007) are partially detectable in the amount of yield and yield stability (Birkás et al. 2006). The utilization of the applied fertilizers, especially that of nitrogen, is strongly influenced by the processes of the soil-plant system (Németh 2006). Hungarian and foreign experimental results have proved that depending on the conditions, the fertilizer requirement of sunflower was moderate (4060 kg ha-1 N+PK) (Stulin 1991, Taha et al. 1999, Pepó 2001), or higher (75-120 kg ha1+PK) (Malik et al. 1992, Reddy et al. 2000). However, there are very limited experimental results on the hybrid-specific nutrient supply of sunflower hybrids as compared to other crops (corn, wheat) (El Nakhlawy 1993, Vasudevan et al. 1997, Pepó et al. 2002, Pepó and Bíró 2003). Materials and methods The long-term experiment was set up in 1983 in a split-plot arrangement in four replicates on chernozem soil at the experimental station of the Crop Sciences Institute of the University of Debrecen Centre for Agricultural Sciences and Engineering, Faculty of Agriculture at Látókép. The soil has favourable water and nutrient management characteristics, the humus content of its cultivated layer is 2.6-2.7 %. The AL-soluble P2O5 (130-150 mg kg -1) and AL-soluble K2O (240-260 mg kg -1) values were medium and high, respectively. The gross size of parcels was 18 m2 . In our paper, the results of 2007 are evaluated. The forecrop was winter wheat. The applied agrotechnical elements were up-to-date. No fungicide treatment was performed. Treatments of the long-term fertilization experiment are included in Table 1.</p><p id="Pg54">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 728 Table 1.

In the experiment, the following sunflower genotypes were studied: NK Alegro, NK 55010, NK Kondi, NK Delfi, NK Ferti.

It adapts well to the relatively unfavourable weather conditions. Weather during the vegetation period of 2007 was dry and warm in almost all months from March until August. The amount of precipitation was 130 mm lower, while the average temperature of the vegetation period was 3 oC higher than the 30-year average. As a result of the dry, warm weather, the degree of leaf, stem and head diseases was low in 2007. The favourable adaptation ability of sunflower could be expressed on the chernozem soil with excellent water and nutrient management. The favourable development of the sunflower hybrids is proven by the results of plant height measurements (Table 3). The plant height of the hybrids was favourable even in the control treatment without fertilization (142-153 cm), which significantly increased in the Nopt+PK treatments (N30-90+PK) (152-171 cm). Due to the dry year, the degree of lodging (Table 3) was low. As an effect of the fertilizer treatments, especially at the extremely high dosage (N150+PK), lodging was significantly higher (15.5%-28.7%) as compared to the control (4.6-16.1 %). NK Delfi had favourable stem firmness value. The incidences of the most significant diseases are presented in Table 3. The values assessed at the end of the vegetation period (26.08.2007) for Diaporthe and head diseases were moderate due to the warm and dry weather. With increasing fertilizer dosages, the degree of diseases increased. In the control treatment, Diaporthe infection</p><p id="Pg55">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 729 was between 14 and 18 % depending on the hybrid, while in the N150+PK treatment it increased to 21-28 %. A similar increase could be detected for the head diseases also (7.1-18.1 % in the control, 16.0-32.8 % in the N150+PK treatment, respectively). Table 3.

Due to the dry and warm weather of 2007, infection by diseases was minimal in the sunflower hybrid stands, the water deficiency could be partially compensated by the water stored in the chernozem soil. Consequently, very favourable yields were achieved in 2007. The hybrid-specific fertilizer response can be characterized by several indices. There were differences in the natural nutrient utilization ability of hybrids as shown by the yields of the control treatment (4200-4900 kg ha-1 depending on the hybrid). It worth noticing that this excellent yield level could be further increased by fertilization. Yields of the hybrids in the optimum fertilizer dosage treatments varied between 5400 and 5900 kg ha-1. The maximum yield surplus due to fertilization was 1100-1200 kg ha-1 in 2007. This proved the favourable fertilizer response of the hybrids. In addition to the above, the hybrid-specific fertilizer response of the genotypes was manifested in the different optimum fertilizer dosages (N30+PK=NK 55010; N60+PK=NK Alegro, NK Delfi, NK Ferti; N90+PK=NK Kondi). In the case of HO type hybrids, the achieved genetic advancement in yielding capacity was proven by the fact that the yield of this hybrid (NK Ferti 5500 kg ha-1) was practically the same as that of the normal hybrids (NK Alegro, NK 55010, NK Kondi, NK Delfi, 5400-5900 kg ha-1).

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 731 CROPYEAR EFFECTS ON THE FERTILIZER RESPONSES OF WINTER WHEAT (Triticum aestivum L.) GENOTYPES Ágnes BALOGH – Péter PEPÓ Institute of Crop Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Debrecen, e-mail: balogha@agr.unideb.hu Abstract: Results of the long-term experiments on chernozem soil proved that cropyear, mainly via its water supply, had a major impact on the natural nutrient utilization, yield surpluses of fertilization, maximum yield and optimal N+PK dosage in the case of winter wheat varieties. In years with favourable water supply (such as 2005) and in dry years (2007), the maximum yield of varieties ranged between 7700-8500 kg ha -1 and 6300-7500 kg ha -1 , while the optimum N+PK supply dosages were N50+PK and N125+PK, respectively. Fertilization increased the level of leaf and ear diseases on the studied varieties and weakened stem firmness. The impact of fertilization on the agronomical features was modified by the cropyear and the genotype. Keywords: cropyear, wheat, genotype, fertilization Introduction Winter wheat has a decisive role in Hungarian crop production. The sowing area of wheat varies between 1.0-1.2 million ha. The national average yield of wheat was 5.05.5 t ha-1 in the 1980s but nowadays the average yield varies between 3.0-5.0 t ha-1 depending on the climatic factors of the cropyear (Pepó 2004). The climatic conditions have changed dramatically for the last century (Várallyay 2007) which had a great influence on the possibilities of crop production in the temperate zone and on yield stability (Birkás et al. 2006). Nutrient supply has a major role in wheat production (Pepó 2004, Balogh et al. 2007), nitrogen is an especially important macroelement in the soil-plant system (Németh 2006). The fertilizer response of wheat genotypes is variety-specific (Pepó 2007). Materials and methods The long-term experiment was set up in 1983 on chernozem soil at the experimental station of the Crop Sciences Institute of the University of Debrecen Centre for Agricultural Sciences and Engineering, Faculty of Agriculture at Látókép. In addition to the control, the fertilizer response of the different wheat genotypes were studied in two-, three- four-and fivefold dosages of the basic treatment of N=30 kg ha-1, P2O5=22,5 kg ha-1, K2O=26,5 kg ha -1. The experiment was set up in a split-plot arrangement in four replicates. In each year, 15-20 wheat varieties were tested. Half of the nitrogen fertilizer dosage was applied in the autumn, the other half in early spring, full dosages of phosphorus and potassium were applied in the autumn. The applied agrotechnique satisfied the requirements of modern production technology. The forecrop was sweet corn. The applied crop protection was the same in both years (weed control: Secator 0.3 kg ha-1, disease management: Falcon 460 EC 0.6 l ha-1 [at 2-3 nodi stage], Falcon 460 EC 0.8 l ha-1 [at the beginning of flowering]). Results and discussion Winter wheat is a crop with high nutrient requirements, both the higher or lower than optimal fertilizer dosages reduce the yield. The fertilizer response of winter wheat</p><p id="Pg58">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 732 varieties with different genotypes have been studied in a long-term experiment of 25 years on chernozem soil. In our paper, the recent results of two years with different weather conditions (2005 and 2007) are published and evaluated. The studied varieties were: GK Öthalom, GK Kapos, Mv Mazurka, Lupus, Sixtus and Saturnus. Weather conditions in the two years showed great differences. Weather conditions in the vegetation period of 2005, were favoruable, almost optimal for the development and yield formation of winter wheat (rainfall in vegetation period was 410,4 mm). The temperature during the vegetation period was also favourable for the vegetative and generative development of winter wheat (average temperature of the vegetation period was 6.66 oC, while the average of 30 years was 6.93 oC). On the contrary, 2007 was especially dry throughout the whole vegetation period. The amount of precipitation in the vegetation period (208.6 mm) was 50% lower than the average of 30 years (400.9 mm). The unfavourable effect of the low precipitation was further rendered by the high temperature of the vegetation period (9.96 oC, average of 30 years 6.93 oC). The specific features of the years manifested both in the yields and fertilizer responses of the wheat varieties (Table 1). In 2005 with favourable weather and water supply, the maximum yield of the studied wheat cultivars ranged between 7700 and 8600 kg ha-1, while in the dry year of 2007 it varied between 6300 and 7500 kg ha-1. That is the cropyear effect resulted in a yield reduction of 1100-1400 kg ha-1. The difference in the maximum yield of varieties between the two years reflects the adaptation ability of the given variety to different ecological stress factors. In the favourable year of 2005, GK Kapos gave the highest yield (8596 kg ha-1). The same variety proved the best also in the dry year of 2007 (7476 kg ha-1), which proves the favourable abiotic stress tolerance of the variety. Table 1.

In 2005 with a favourable water supply, the studied varieties could utilize the natural nutrient stock of the chernozem soil more effectively (3600-4900 kg ha-1 in the control treatment, average of varieties: 4400 kg ha-1 ) than in the dry year of 2007 (2600-3800 kg ha-1; average of varieties: 3200 kg ha-1). The better water supply resulted in considerably higher maximum yields in 2005 (7700-8600 kg ha-1; average of varieties: 8000 kg ha-1) than in the dry year of 2007 (6300-7500 kg ha-1; average of varieties: 6700 kg ha-1). The</p><p id="Pg59">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 733 extra yield resulting from fertilization was similar in the two years (3546 kg ha-1 in 2005 and 3483 kg ha-1 in 2007). However, there were large differences in the optimum N+PK dosage for all varieties. Due to the optimal water supply (2005), the conditions for the release and uptake of natural nutrients and the active ingredients of fertilizers were favourable in the chernozem soil, consequently the optimum N+PK dosages ranged within a very tight interval (N30-60+PK) depending on the genotype (average of varieties: N50+PK). In the dry year of 2007, the optimum fertilizer dosages were considerably higher due to the limited availability of the natural nutrients and the active ingredients of fertilizers. Depending upon the variety, the maximum yields were obtained in the N90-150+PK treatment (average of varieties: N125+PK). Table 2.

The results proved that increased fertilizer dosages increased the degree of leaf and ear diseases and lodging in both years (therefore, only the values of the control and the highest dosage, N150+PK were included in Tables 2 and 3). In addition to the fertilizer treatments, the level of leaf and ear diseases was modified also by the year and the genotype. In the year of 2005 with favourable water supply, the levels of powdery mildew infection (8-24 % in the N150+PK treatment), Fusarium ear blight infection (2-4 %) were higher, while HTR infection (11-26 %) and leaf rust infection (2-4 %) were</p><p id="Pg60">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 734 similar as compared to those measured in 2007 (powdery mildew 6-10 %, Fusarium ear blight 0 %, HTR 18-31 %, leaf rust 1-3 % in the az N150+PK treatment). Among the studied varieties, Sixtus showed a favourable tolerance to diseases in both years. There were great differences in the stem solidness of the varieties between the two years. In the year of 2005 with favourable water supply, a significant lodging was observed already in the N60+PK treatment (15-78 %) and in the highest dosage fertilizer treatment (N150+PK) lodging was complete for all varieties (100 %). In the dry year of 2007, lodging was moderate even when the highest fertilizer dosage was applied (0-32 % lodging in the treatment N150+PK). Conclusions Results of our long-term experiment proved that appropriate nutrient supply had a determining importance in increasing the yield of winter wheat also in chernozem soils with excellent water and nutrient management. The fertilizer response of winter wheat genotypes is variety-specific. Differences were observed among the varieties in natural nutrient utilization, maximum yield, extra yield of fertilization and the optimum N+PK dosage. The utilization of the natural nutrients of the soil and the active ingredients of the fertilizers was determined basically by the weather (primarily by the water supply) of the given year. In the year of 2005 with favourable water supply, the average maximum yield of the studied varieties was 8000 kg ha-1 and the optimum fertilizer dosage was N50+PK, while in the dry year of 2007, the respective values were 6700 kg ha-1 and N125+PK. The level of leaf and ear diseases and lodging of the different varieties were influenced by the nutrient supply, the year and the genotype.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 735 EFFECTS OF IRRIGATION ON YIELDS OF MAIZE (Zea mays L.) IN DIFFERENT CROP ROTATIONS Péter PEPÓ1 – Attila VAD1 – Sándor BERÉNYI2 1 Institute of Crop Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Debrecen, e-mail:pepopeter@agr.unideb.hu 2 Department of Soil Science and Agrochemistry, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Debrecen Abstract: It was studied in a long-term experiment on chernozem soil, the effect of crop rotation, irrigation, fertilization and plant density on the yield of maize in an extremely dry year in 2007. The yield increment due to irrigation was 3100-4000 kg ha -1 in monoculture, 1700-2300 kg ha -1 in biculture and 1900-2600 kg ha -1 in triculture, respectively. In monoculture, increased fertilizer dosages and plant densities resulted in a significant yield reduction in the non-irrigated treatment (2600 kg ha -1 in the control, 2100 kg ha -1 in the N240+PK treatment, at a plant density of 80 thousand plants -1 ). Without irrigation, 40 thousand plants ha -1 proved to be optimal in all crop rotations, while maximum yields were obtained at plant densities of 40-60-80 thousand plants ha -1 in mono-, bi- and triculture under irrigation, respectively. Under irrigated conditions, the optimum fertilizer dosages were N180-240+PK, N120+PK and N60-120+PK in monoculture, biculture and triculture, respectively. By optimizing the agrotechnical factors, 10-11 t ha -1 yield can be realized on chernozem soil irrespective the cropyear effect. Keywords: maize, cropyear, irrigation, crop rotation, fertilization, plant density Introduction Maize has high productivity, but it is very sensitive to the agroecological and agrotechnical conditions. In Hungary, maize is grown on 1.1-1.2 million hectares, the national average yield varies between 4 and 7 t ha-1 depending on the year and the intensity of production technology (Pepó et al. 2006). The impacts of weather factors (Huzsvai and Nagy 2005, Pepó et al. 2005), and global climate change on maize yields are of special importance (Várallyay 2007). The effect of agrotechnical elements is exerted in a complex way in the soil-plant system (Németh 2006). The effects of nutrient supply (Kovačevic et al. 2006, Izsáki 2007), plant density (Berzsenyi and Lap 2006) and irrigation (Ruzsányi 1992, Berényi et al. 2007) on the yield stability of maize are especially important. These agrotechnical factors exert their effect via interactions and not independently (Pepó et al. 2007). Materials and methods The long-term experiment was set up in 1983 on chernozem soil in the Hajdúság (eastern Hungary) by Prof. László Ruzsányi. The multifactorial experiment has been managed by Prof. Péter Pepó since 2004. Regarding the physical characteristics of the soil, the area can be classified as loam and has a nearly neutral pH value (pHKCl=6.46). It has a medium-level humus content (2.8 %) and a humus depth of about 80 cm. Its supply of phosphorous is medium and its supply of potassium can be considered good. The structure of the multifactorial experiment is as follows: - crop rotation: monoculture (maize), biculture (wheat-maize), triculture (peaswheat-maize) - fertilization: control, one-, two-, three- and fourfold amounts of the basic dosage of N=60 kg ha-1, P2O5=45 kg ha -1, K2O=45 kg ha -1 - plant density: 40 thousand plants ha-1, 60 thousand plants ha-1, 80 thousand plants ha-1</p><p id="Pg62">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 736 - irrigation: Ö=not irrigated, Ö2=irrigated with half dosage, Ö3=irrigated with full (optimum) dosage During the vegetation period of 2007, irrigation was applied in 4x25 mm and 4x50 mm dosages in treatments Ö2 and Ö3, respectively (between early May and late June). Against Diabrotica virgifera, we used soil disinfection in monoculture and we sprayed in mono-, bi- and triculture (17 July 2007, Karate Zeon 0.3 l ha-1). The other elements of the agrotechnical management factors met the requirements set by modern maize production. The hybrid Reseda (PR 37M81) was used in our long-term experiment. Results and discussion Maize is a crop sensitive to appropriate nutrient and water supply. Optimum water supply is especially important in periods critical for the growth, development and yield formation of maize. 2007 was an unfavourable year for the vegetative and generative development of maize. The amount of precipitation before and at the beginning (MayJune) of vegetation period was considerably lower than optimal and the average of many years. Therefore, it was necessary to irrigate on 04-06 May, 23-24 May, 06-08 June, 28-29 June with dosages of 25-25 mm (total of 100 mm) and 50-50 mm (total of 200 mm) in treatments Ö2 and Ö3, respectively. Treatment Ö1 was not irrigated. The lack of precipitation was accompanied by high temperature in 2007 (2 oC higher [18.80 oC] than the multi-year average temperature during the vegetation period [16.82 oC]). The effect of weather (natural water supply) and irrigation (artificial water supply) on the yield of maize was significantly influences by crop rotation, but fertilization and plant density also had an effect on yields. After a monoculture of 25 years (Table 1) without irrigation (Ö1), the yield of maize ranged between 3900-5700 kg ha -1 depending on the applied fertilizer dosage and plant density. In bi- (Table 1) and triculture (Table 1) with a favourable forecrop, the water stock of the soil decreased to a lower extent, therefore, a more favourable yields were obtained in treatment (Ö1) without irrigation as compared to the treatments of monoculture (7200-7900 kg ha-1 in biculture, 7200-8200 kg ha-1 in triculture without irrigation depending on the fertilizer dosage and plant density). In the dry year of 2007, irrigation had a good yield-increasing effect, especially in monoculture. Irrigation had a significant yield-increasing effect in both the half-dosage (Ö2) and full-dosage (Ö3) treatments. Between treatments Ö2 and Ö3, irrigation resulted in a moderate yield surpluses. The interaction of water and nutrient supply was detectable in all three crop rotations; it was especially strong in monoculture. Without irrigation (Ö1), the negative effect of the insufficient water supply was further rendered by the increasing fertilizer dosages and plant density. In monoculture (Table 1), the maximum yields were 5700 kg ha-1 (N180+PK), 4300 kg ha -1 (N120+PK), 3900 kg ha -1 (N60+PK) at 40 thousand plants ha -1, 60 thousand plants ha-1 and 80 thousand plants ha-1, respectively. In the extremely dry year of 2007 in monoculture, the high plant density (80 thousand plants ha-1) and high fertilizer dosage (N240+PK) resulted in a significant yield reduction in the non-irrigated treatment (Ö1) (the yield [2100 kg ha -1] was lower than that of the control [2600 kg ha-1]). Under irrigation in monoculture, the optimum fertilizer dosage in Ö2 was N180+PK (7200-8000 kg ha -1), and N180-240+PK in Ö3 (7700-10200 kg ha -1), the optimum plant density was 40 thousand plants ha-1 in both treatments.</p><p id="Pg63">VII.

Without irrigation (Ö1), the optimum plant density was 40 thousand plants ha-1 while it increased to 60 thousand plants ha-1 in the irrigated treatments (Ö2 and Ö3). In triculture without irrigation (Ö1) the N60+PK treatment was the optimum (favourable effect of pea), the maximum yields ranged between 7200 and 8200 kg ha-1. In the halfdosage irrigation treatment (Ö2) the fertilizer optimum remained N60+PK, while in the full-dosage irrigation treatment (Ö3) higher fertilizer dosage was necessary for higher yields (the optimum fertilizer treatment was N120+PK, maximum yields ranged between 10100-11100 kg ha-1). In triculture without irrigation (Ö1) and with irrigation (Ö2 and Ö3), the optimum plant density was 40 thousand plants ha -1 and 80 thousand plants ha-1, respectively. Conclusions Water supply had a determining effect on maize yield in the very warm and dry year of 2007. The effect of water supply and irrigation on the yield of maize was strongly influenced by crop rotation and modified by nutrient supply and plant density. Our maximum yield results in long-term experiment on chernozem soil without irrigation (Ö1) were 4132 kg ha -1 in monoculture, 7597 kg ha-1 in biculture and 7801 kg ha-1 in triculture in the average of plant densities. In monoculture without irrigation, increasing fertilization and plant density resulted in yield reduction. At a high fertilizer dosage (N240+PK) and high plant density (80 thousand plants ha -1) in the non-irrigated</p><p id="Pg64">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 738 treatment (Ö1), maize yield (2102 kg ha -1) was lower than that of the control (2573 kg ha-1), which indicates the importance of a balance between the ecological and agrotechnical factors in maize production. In the dry year, irrigation had a strong yieldincreasing effect in monoculture (3100 kg ha-1 Ö2, 4000 kg ha -1 in Ö3 in the average of fertilizer dosages and plant densities), while in biculture (1700 kg ha-1 in Ö2, 2300 kg ha-1 in Ö3) and triculture (1900 kg ha -1 in Ö2, 2600 kg ha -1 in Ö3) the effect was moderate. Optimum fertilizer dosages were determined by both water supply and crop rotation. The optimum fertilizer dosages were: in monoculture without irrigation (Ö1) and with irrigation (Ö2 and Ö3) N60-180+PK and N180-240+PK, respectively, N120+PK in all three treatments in biculture (Ö1, Ö2 and Ö3), N60+PK in Ö1-Ö2 and N120+PK in Ö3 in triculture. Optimum plant densities were: 40 thousand plants ha-1 in non-irrigated (Ö1) and irrigated treatments (Ö2, Ö3) in monoculture, 40 thousand plants ha -1 without irrigation (Ö1), 60 thousand plants ha -1 with irrigation (Ö2 and Ö3) in biculture, 40 thousand plants ha-1 without irrigation (Ö1), 80 thousand plants ha -1 with irrigation (Ö2 and Ö3) in triculture, respectively. Consequently, results of our long-term experiment proved that it is a close interaction exists between the cropyear and water supply (irrigation) and agrotechnical factors (crop rotation, fertilization and plant density). Via the optimization of agrotechnical factors, a yield of 10-11 t ha-1 can be achieved safely on chernozem soil regardless of the cropyear weather.

PRODUCTION András SZABÓ Institute of Crop Sciences, Agronomy Faculty, University of Debrecen, e-mail: szabo@agr.unideb.hu Abstract: The yield, oil content and oil yield of sunflower is determined by the interactive relationship of crop year, hybrid and crop density. The highest yields and highest oil content was obtained in relatively dry years with sufficient precipitation and favourable temperature. The smallest yields and oil yield was reported in crop years with above average precipitation. The optimal crop density was determined by the hybrids (hybrid specific methods). The oil yield was primarily determined by the grain quantity and was modified by the oil content. In the average of the hybrids and the years, the highest oil yield was obtained at 55000 ha -1 crop density (1779 kg ha -1 ). Both the increase and decrease in crop density reduced the oil yield. Keywords: sunflower, crop year, plant density, yield, oil content, oil yield Introduction Besides cereals and corn, sunflower is one of the crops with the highest acreage (Lehoczky és Sárkány 2006, Göksoy és Turan 2007, Szabó és Pepó, 2007). In Hungary, the agroecological conditions are favourable for sunflower production (Dani és Pepó, 2005). The climatic conditions became more and more extreme recently (Mikulec és Stehlova 2006, Várallyay 2007). In the different crop years (crop density, sowing time), the various agrotechnical and climatic conditions have significant effect on the productivity of sunflower hybrids (Zsombik 2006). The agroecological and agrotechnical requirements, as well as the stress resistance of sunflower genotypes are different (Borbélyné et al., 2006). Besides climatic conditions, the water supply and water management of the soil determines the average yield and yield stability (Birkás et al., 2006). Within the range of the biological optimum, the sowing time and the crop density significantly influence productivity (Zsombik, 2007). Pepó and Szabó (2005) examined the effect of the agrotechnical factors on sunflower hybrids of different densities. The results showed that in humid and cold crop years the yields were smaller, due to the higher yield loss caused by stalk- and head diseases. The optimal crop density varied according to the hybrid, proving that in humid and cold crop years the resistance of hybrids against stalk- and head diseases determined the optimal crop density. Due to the fact that the spread of diseases was slower, in dry years the infection rates were lower, which also appeared in the product yields and oil yields. Materials and methods The sunflower experiment at Látókép, the Experiment Station of the University of Debrecen, Centre of Agriculture, Institute of Crop Sciences was adjusted on calcerous chernozem soil between 1999-2005. The plant density experiments were adjusted between 35.000 and 75.000 plant hectare-1 density interval, with a grade of 10.000 plant hectare-1. In the researches ten hybrids were used. The hybrids were applied with single agro-technology generally used in practise. The moisture content of the yields was set to 8 % and the oil content set to dry matter standardized.</p><p id="Pg66">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 740 Results and discussion The agrotechnical factors all influence the product yield of sunflower hybrids. In years with high amounts of rainfall, because the attacks and damages of pathogens were more severe, the product yield significantly decreased. Due to the extreme precipitation in 2005, the product yield in the average of the hybrids and the plant density was the lowest among the research years (2821 kg ha-1). The highest yields (4237 kg ha-1, 3927 kg ha-1, 4304 kg ha-1) were obtained in dry, warm years (2000, 2002, 2003). In years with higher amount of precipitation (1999, 2001, 2004) average or lower than average yields were harvested (3616 kg ha-1, 3169 kg ha-1, 3658 kg ha-1). Between 1999-2004, the highest product yields were obtained at 45000-65000 ha-1 plant density levels. Both increasing and decreasing plant density caused the product yield to decrease. Evaluating the yield at different plant density levels in the average of the hybrids, we found that because of the precipitation in 2005, the highest yield was obtained at 35000 ha-1 plant density level, and increasing the plant density level resulted in decreased product yield. Due to the favourable weather conditions for sunflower in 2003, the product yield in the average of the hybrids (4626 kg ha-1) was highest among the research years and was reached at 45000 ha-1 plant density levels. In 1999 and 20012004 the highest average yield was obtained at 45000-55000 ha-1 plant density levels (Table 1). In the average of the crop years and the hybrids the highest yield was obtained at 45000 ha-1 plant density level. The highest average yield at 65000 ha-1 plant density level was harvested in 2000. In years with high amount of rainfall, Lympil (4680 kg ha-1), PR63A82 (4156 kg ha-1), LG 56.65 (3372 kg ha-1) gave the highest yield. In dry years Lympil (4856 kg ha-1), PR63A82 (4540 kg ha-1), Alexandra/PR (4583 kg ha-1) and Louidor (4601 kg ha-1) performed best. Table 1.

The oil content was highest in 2002 (46.31-61.28 %), and lowest in 2005 (40.63- 51.38 %). The oil content in the average of the hybrids and the crop year in years with higher amounts of precipitation (1999, 2001, 2004, 2005) was lower (49.92 %, 48.27 %, 49.01 %, 46.73 %), while in dry and warm years (2000, 2002, 2003) it was higher (50.29 %, 54.16 %, 51.31 %). Examining the oil content in the average of the hybrids we found that increasing plant density resulted in higher oil content and was highest in 1999 at 55000 ha-1 plant density level (52.24 %).

The oil content in the research year ranged between 841-2771 kg ha-1. The lowest maximum oil yield was obtained in 2005 (1544 kg ha-1). The highest oil yield was obtained in 2000 (2771 kg ha-1). In dry growing seasons (2000, 2002, 2003) the oil yield in the average of the hybrids and the plant density was higher (1970 kg ha-1, 1958 kg ha-1, 20z32 kg ha-1). In years with higher amount of precipitation (1999, 2001, 2004, 2005) oil yield was smaller (1670 kg ha-1, 1408 kg ha-1, 1648 kg ha-1, 1210 kg ha-1). In 2005, oil yield was far behind those of the other research years; because due to the wet and cold weather both oil yield and product yield were smaller (1210 kg ha-1). Between 1999 and 2004 the oil yield in the average of the hybrids was highest between 45000 ha1 to 65000 ha-1 plant density levels (1800 kg ha-1, 2200 kg ha-1, 1496 kg ha-1, 2046 kg ha-1, 2226 kg ha-1, 1758 kg ha-1). In 2005 the maximum average oil yield was obtained at 35000 ha-1 plant density level (1255 kg ha-1), which was smaller than in earlier years. In the average of the examined growing seasons and hybrids, the maximum oil yield was obtained at 55000 ha-1(1779 kg ha-1) (Table 3.). Table 3.

In dry years Lympil (2314 kg ha-1), Magnum (2274 kg ha-1), Louidor (2294 kg ha-1) performed best. Two different genotypes hybrids (Aréna/PR, Alexandra/PR) were tested by Kang’s stability analysis. We found that Alexandra/PR was most balanced at every levels of</p><p id="Pg68">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 742 plant density. Both hybrids among different ecological conditions performed most balanced at 65000 ha-1 plant density level and less balanced at 35000 ha-1 plant density level. As a result of improved environmental conditions, the yield increase of Aréna/PR was higher than Alexandra/PR (higher ecological sensibility). Conclusions The product yield of sunflower was determined by the interactive relationship of crop year, hybrid and crop density. The relatively dry crop years with sufficient precipitation and favourable temperature (2000, 2002, 2003) resulted the highest productivity of the hybrids (4237 kg ha-1, 3927 kg ha-1 4304 kg ha-1 in the average of the hybrids). The smallest product yields have been reported in years with above average precipitation (1999, 2001, 2004, 2005), (3616 kg ha-1, 3169 kg ha-1, 3658 kg ha-1, 2821 kg ha-1). As regards the product yield, in dry crop years higher (55000-65000 ha-1), in average and humid crop years smaller (35000-45000 ha-1) crop density was optimal. The optimal crop density was influenced by the hybrids (hybrid specific methods). The crop year, the hybrid and the crop density in interaction influenced the oil content and the oil yield. In the research years, the oil content increased with the increase of the crop density (48,17-50,91%), in the average of the hybrids. The oil yield was primarily determined by the grain quantity and was modified by the oil content. In 2002, the oil yield was highest at 45000 ha-1 (1880 kg ha-1) and at 65000 ha-1 (2164 kg ha-1) in 2000. In 2005 the highest oil yield was obtained at 35000 ha-1 crop density. In the average of the hybrids and the years, the optimal crop density level was 55000 ha-1 (1779 kg ha-1). Both the increase and decrease of the crop density reduced the oil yield. The hybrids with the highest oil content were Lympil, PR 63A82, and Alexandra PR. References Birkás M. – Dexter A. R. – Kalmár T. – Bottlik L. 2006.

PRODUCTION Zoltán KÁTAI Institute of Crop Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Debrecen; e-mail: kataizoltan@agr.unideb.hu Abstract: The following researches were carried out at Látókép Research Centre of University of Debrecen between 2004 and 2006. The researches covered disease resistivity, yield and yield stability of wheat varieties. Different varieties show very dissimilar disease resistivity among the three examined cropyears. We had the chance to examine both resistant and susceptible varieties. Susceptible varieties got diseases even in favourable cropyears. The examined winter wheat varieties were more susceptible to helminthosporium (21,8%) and leaf rust (16,4%). We experienced the highest level of resistance in the case of GK Kalász among the 12 examined varieties. The disease of fusarium was basically determined by the cropyear. The two ripening groups of winter wheat showed the following average yield considering the three years: 7065 kg ha -1 (early ripening varieties), 7261 kg ha -1 (middle ripening varieties). Keywords: winter wheat, variety, disease resistivity, yield, yield stability, cropyear Introduction In the arable land cultivation structure of Hungary cereals have a very important role; they cover 65-67% of the total arable land. In these days we grow wheat on 1.1-1.2 million ha, so it is the runner-up in the aspect of sowing area. Genetic variance provides an opportunity for breeders to select genotypes with better adaptability, which can be successfully produced under various ecological and site specific conditions. (Pepó Pá. et al. 2006) Many foreign and Hungarian experimental results of scientific papers proved that the climatic conditions of cropyears strongly modified the yield of the wheat and yield stability (Pepó 2007). Yield levels of winter wheat were determined mostly by climatic effects of the cropyears (Balogh et al. 2007). Pepó and Ruzsányi (1999), suggest to grow only those winter wheat varieties, of which needs can be satisfied on the highest level - if possible, perfectly. The variety has to have appropriate yield stability and be resistant or tolerant against occurrent diseases. The presence and spread dynamics of leaf- and ear-diseases that may attack wheat is determined by the forecrop, amount of nutrient supply and method of pest control. (Hims and Cook 1992, Jolánkai et al. 2002) Ágoston and Pepó (2005) found that biological bases and right selection among the bases have a very important role in the effectiveness of wheat production. According to Máté et al. (2000) there are considerable differences among most of the nationally qualified varieties in the aspect of yield and stability of yield. Materials and methods Small plot researches were carried out in University of Debrecen, Faculty of Agriculture, Institute of Crop Sciences, Látókép Research Centre. The scheme of researches: four repetition random block. Size of plot: 1.65x9.20 m (15.18 m2). In all the three years of observation (2004, 2005, 2006) optimal agricultural technical methods were applied in small plot research. The same weed-control method was applied each year and neither fungicides nor regulators were used. In the three research years winter wheat was examined in the aspect of yield and resistivity against powdery mildew, leaf rust, helminthosporium and fusarium. The research covered 6 early ripening and 6</p><p id="Pg70">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 744 middle ripening winter wheat varieties. Weather conditions in 2003/2004 were extremely favourable to the growth of winter wheat, which was visible in the yield of the varieties. In 2004/2005 the favourable weather of autumn was followed by cold winter and changeable spring which caused the decrease of yield comparing to the previous year. In the cropyear of 2005/2006 the weather was changeable which resulted in moderate level of yield. Results and discussion The most important leaf- and ear-diseases of winter cereals are powdery mildew, helminthosporium, leaf rust and fusarium. Powdery mildew infection - apart from some extremely high values - showed consistency during the three years. Among the early ripening varieties Flori 2 showed high level of infection in two years (63% in 2004, 38% in 2005), while in 2006 the level of infection was negligible (1%). Among early ripening varieties GK Kalász showed the best results (4.6% average). Level of powdery mildew infection in the case of MF Boglya and MF Kazal was several times above 20%. MF Boglya showed very high value, 54% infection in 2005. We experienced the highest level of resistivity in the case of Buzogány, as the powdery mildew infection of this variety was only 50% in the average of three years. The observed winter wheat varieties showed very similar results on the field of helminthosporium infection in all the three ripening groups. In the group of early ripening varieties the level of infection ranged from 11% to 45%, the average level of infection is about 20%. In the case of observed middle ripening varieties the level of infection was between 20.0 and 30.6%. In contrast with the first two diseases the observed winter wheat varieties showed very different results on the field of leaf rust infection during the three cropyears (Figure 1.). In the cropyear of 2003/2004 the examined wheat varieties showed favourable yield. In the group of early ripening varieties average yield was 8571 kg ha-1. In this cropyear weather conditions were favourable to vegetative and generative evolution and productivity of winter wheat. We can set up the following categories for the classification the varieties in the aspect of yield: &gt;7500kg ha-1 – excellent, 7000-7500 kg ha-1 – good, &lt;7000 kg ha-1 – medium. On the ground of this classification all the six varieties of early ripening group produced excellent level of yield in 2004. We experienced the most outstanding level of yield in the case of Flori 2, as the variety produced highly above 9 tons of yield. This is undoubtedly a noteworthy result. In the cropyear of 2004/2005 we had rather moderate results in the group of early ripening varieties (6912 kg ha-1 average). GK Tisza (7976 kg ha-1) and Flori 2 (7788 kg ha-1) achieved excellent level of yield in this year, too. The yield of GK Öthalom, GK Élet, GK Kalász and GK Attila was only medium in this year. During the three years the relatively worst result was achieved in 2005/2006. The average yield in the group of early ripening varieties was only 5713 kg/ha. In the aspect of yield stability GK Kalász was the best (33.9%) in the average of the three years. GK Tisza showed the most unfavourable yield stability (51.2%) during the three years (Table 1.). In the cropyear of 2003/2004 even middle ripening winter wheat varieties achieved excellent level of yield. The six examined varieties showed the result of 9145 kg ha-1 in average.

We realized very dissimilar yield in each cropyears, which suggests that weather conditions had considerable effect on yield. In 2004, due to the favourable weather conditions, we had outstanding yield in all ripening groups. In 2005 we carried out moderate yield because of unfavourable weather in winter. The lowest level of yield was realized in 2006 on account of tillering. One of the most important questions is the yield stability of varieties. We had extreme results on this field, too. Generally speaking we can state that both weather conditions and genetic facilities largely determine the yield. In the case of winter wheat the rate of yield fluctuation was high, moving in the interval of 33.9%-70.3%. Acknowledgements Our research partly funded by the project OMFB 00896/2005.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 747 EFFECT OF SOME AGROTECHNICAL FACTORS ON WATER BUDGET IN MAIZE (ZEA MAYS L.) PRODUCTION Fülöp Lajos DÓKA Institue of Crop Sciences, Agronomy Faculty, University of Debrecen, doka@agr.unideb.hu Abstract: In a 25-year polyfactorial long-term experiment, we have studied the effect of irrigation and plant density on the water management of the soil and on maize yield. In all three crop rotations, the water deficit was smaller in the irrigated plots than in the non-irrigated plots (monoculture Ö1:-246.4 mm, Ö3: -198.74 mm; biculture Ö1:-215.3 mm, Ö3:-162 mm; triculture Ö1:-216.31 mm, Ö3:-199.27 mm water deficit). The water deficit values reached their maximum by mid-August in all treatments, but the differences between irrigated and non-irrigated treatments in bi- and triculture were very small by this time. The difference in water deficit at 60 thousand plants ha -1 and 80 thousand plants ha -1 was 14,61 mm and 20,75 mm in biculture and 3,96 mm and 0,69 mm in triculture, respectively. Due to the dry year, the lower plant density of 60000 plants ha -1 was more favourable regarding the amount of yield than the 80000 plants ha -1 plant density. Keywords: long-term experiment, maize, irrigation, plant density, soil, water deficit Introduction The effects of climate change due to global warming are becoming stronger and the frequency of draught increases and lower precipitation having an effect on the water supply of plants (Sárvári 2005, Vágó et al. 2006, Stekauerová and Nagy, 2006). In addition to other factors, the water management determined the amount of yield in a certain area (Nagy et. al., 2007). In his 22-year experiment on medium maize hybrids, Nagy (2007) proved that yield alternation is largely dependent upon the year effect and within that on water supply. The yield of hybrids in favourable years was 10 t/ha, while in dry years, it was 2-3 t/ha. Increase in yields and yield stability could be achieved by improving the water management of soils (Birkás et. al., 2006). Hegyi et. al. (2006) studied the effect of ecological factors on maize yield and yield formation in a 3-year experiment at 5 different growing sites in Hungary. The highest average yield was obtained in 1997, when the distribution of precipitation during the vegetation period was more favourable than in the following years. In 1999, the length of cobs and the average yield of plants was significantly lower and the fertilization of the plants was weak due to stress from draught. The effect of plant density on dry matter production is low in the beginning, but it is stronger later, especially in the reproduction phase and as a result dry matter accumulation, (consequently, yield and yield stability) is reduced when a higher plant density is applied (Berzsenyi and Lap 2005, 2006, Győrffy 1976). Materials and methods The long-term experiments were carried out in 2007 at the Látókép Experimental Station of the Institute of Crop Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, Centre for Agricultural Sciences and Engineering, University of Debrecen in a polyfactorial long-term experiment set up by Prof. László Ruzsányi in 1983. The soil of the experiment was flat and homogenous, it belonged to the calcareous chernozem soil type. In the long-term experiment, three crop rotations are applied: monoculture (maize), biculture (maizewheat), triculture (maize-wheat-pea). Five fertilization – control (untreated), N60P45K45, N120P90K90, N180P135K135, N240P180K180 – and three irrigation treatments were applied: treatment Ö1 = non-irrigated, treatment Ö2 = half-dosage irrigation (4x25 mm), treatment Ö3 = full-dosage irrigation (4x50 mm)</p><p id="Pg74">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 748 (on 04.05, 23.05., 04.06., 30.06 for Ö2 and Ö3). Soil samples were collected from treatments Ö1 and Ö3. The applied plant densities were 60000 ha -1 and 80000 ha-1. Cultivation, crop protection and harvest were applied uniformly. The applied hybrid was Reseda (PR37M81). For studying water management, soil samples were collected six times in 2007 from each 20 cm layer of the plots of mono-, bi- and triculture until 200 cm depth, from replicates I. and III. with plant densities of 60000 ha-1 and 80000 ha-1 from the treatments Ö1 and Ö3. The first and last samples were collected before sowing and after harvest, respectively. Weight of the samples was measured and then they were dried at 105 oC until reaching constant weight. The dry samples were measured and a weight percentage was calculated from the dry and wet data. By using the soil characteristics, the water deficit of the soil at the specific date was calculated from the soil moisture values. Water deficit was expressed in mm.

The changes in water supply during the vegetation period for plant densities of 60000 ha-1 and 80000 ha-1 under N120P90K90 fertilization are presented in Figure 1. Our results proved that irrigation strongly reduced water deficit. An influencing effect was observed in all three crop rotations . The water stock of the soil increased as a result of the two irrigations in May (04 May, 23 May) and the irrigation on 4 June, water deficit on 4 June was smaller as compared to non-irrigated plots (in monoculture:-195.84 mm - -132.01 mm at 60000 ha-1 plant density and -201.43 mm – -137.27 mm at 80000 ha-1 plant density; in biculture: -147.27 mm – -82.23 mm at 60000 ha-1 plant density, 149.38 mm – -86.8 mm at 80000 ha-1 plant density; in triculture -147.27 mm – -82.23 mm at 60000 ha-1 plant density, -167.08 mm – -135.82 mm at 80000 ha-1 plant density in treatments Ö1 – Ö3). This increment differed among the three crop rotation systems. By the middle of August, however, there were only minor differences between the irrigated and non-irrigated treatments in biculture and triculture due to the draught and high temperatures during the summer. The difference was 14.61 mm and 20.75 mm in biculture and 3.96 mm and 0.69 mm in triculture at plant densities of 60 thousand plants ha-1 and 80 thousand plants ha-1, respectively. The higher vegetative and generative phytomass induced a higher water uptake due to which the water deficit values were the same as in the non-irrigated treatment in spite of the applied 200 mm water dosage. Among the three crop rotation systems, the highest water deficit was observed in monoculture (at a plant density of 60000 ha-1, Ö1: -337.61 mm, Ö3: -322.86 mm; at a plant density of 80000 ha-1, Ö1: -338.18 mm, Ö3: -304.24 mm).

Figure 1. Dinamic changing of water deficit of maize in mono-, bi- and triculture under N120P90K90 fertilization (Debrecen, csernozjom talaj, 2007) Our experiments proved that the water stock of the soil reduced in parallel with the increase of temperature and the reduction of precipitation, accordingly, increasing water deficit values were detected. As a result of intensive evaporation and increasing water uptake by plants, the amount of water stored in the soil was strongly reduced until the middle of August. The highest water deficit values of the season were measured at this time: in monoculture -337.61 – -322.86 mm and -338.18 – -304.24 mm, in biculture 344.4 – -359.01 mm and -369.14 – -348.39 mm, in triculture -327.8 – -331.76 mm and 326.16 – 326.85 mm at plant densities of 60 thousand plants ha-1 and 80 thousand plants ha-1, respectively, in treatments Ö1 – Ö3. The more rainy period from the third decade of August had a positive effect on the water stock of the soil in all three crop rotations, thereby reducing the water deficit values. Table 2.

Cereal Research Communications 750 obtained at the lower plant density, which indicates that under dry conditions the optimum plant density is lower in maize monoculture (Table 2). In bi- and triculture, no difference was observed and the yields were practically the same at plant densities of 60 and 80000 ha-1 (in biculture 10970 kgha-1 and 10205 kgha-1, in triculture 10679 kgha-1 and 11080 kgha-1 at 60 and 80 thousand plants ha-1, respectively). Conclusions In a 25-year polyfactorial long-term experiment, we have studied the effect of irrigation and plant density on the water management of the soil and on maize yield. Due to the draught and high temperatures during almost the whole summer, the water deficit values had reached their maximum by mid-August: in monoculture -337,61 – -322,86 mm and -338,18 – -304,24 mm, in biculture -344,4 – -359,01 mm and -369,14 – -348,39 mm, in triculture -327,8 – -331,76 mm and -326,16 – 326,85 mm at plant densities of 60000 plants ha-1 and 80000 plants ha-1, respectively, in treatments Ö1 – Ö3. The differences between the irrigated and non-irrigated treatment in bi- and triculture were negligible, as the higher vegetative and generative phytomass induced a higher water uptake, consequently, the water deficit values were similar to those measured in the nonirrigated treatment in spite of the applied 200 mm water dosage. When comparing the yields of the plots with 60000 ha-1 and 80000 ha-1 plant density, we concluded that under dry conditions, a lower plant density is more favourable for maize in the nonirrigated (Ö1) treatment in mono-, bi- and triculture. Under irrigation (Ö3), the optimum plant density was 60 thousand plants ha-1 in monoculture, while practically the same yields were obtained at plant densities of 60 and 80 thousand ha-1 in bi- and triculture.

GENOTYPES TOLERANCE TO GLYPHOSATE A. M. Abd EL-AAL Sugar Crops Res. Inst. Agriculture Research Center, 9 Gamaa st., Giza, Egypt. adelscri64@yahoo.com Abstract: Field experiment study was conducted at the Farm of Faculty of Agriculture, Debrecen Univerisity., Hungary, to investigate the tolerance of different sugar beet genotypes to glyphosate and the effect of IAA (Indol acetic acid) as seed treated in improvement of sugar beet tolerance. A randomized complete block design in three replications was used. The main effect mean squares for herbicide and genotypes were highly significant for stand count, plant dry weight, and visual injury %. However, IAA effect was significant of plant dry weight. The soaking sugar beet seeds in IAA before glyphosate application recorded significant decrease in visible injury percentage. Regarding relative rank of several genotypes tolerance to glyphosate under treatment 1 (IAA), it could be observed that Begonia, Cesira, Belinda and Alios sugar beet genotypes gave the highest values of plant dry weight with insignificant difference untreated treatment. Keywords: Sugar beet, genotypes, glyphosate, IAA (Indol Acetic Acid) Introduction Sugar beet is an important economic crop in Egypt. Over 100,000 ha were planted in Egypt in 2007. As no single herbicide is capable of controlling all the weeds which are found in sugar beet. The global climatic change has a dramatic influence on crop production including weed species (Várallyay 2007). Glyphosate is a broad spectrum, non selective systematic herbicide. It is useful on all annual and perennial weeds including broad-leaved and grasses. For sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.), a little information regarding cultivar response to herbicides has been reported. Smith and Schweizer (1983) demonstrated that sugar beet cultivars responded differently to herbicide treatments. Haaijichristodoulou (1984) and Takahashi et al. (1999) tested different sugar beet varieties and reported that varieties were significantly different for plant population and growth vigor. In weed control by herbicide usage it is important to avoid the environmental pollution (Husti 2006) and to keep the rules of food-safety (Jolánkai et al. 2006). Materials and methods Nineteen sugar beet genotypes resulted from our previous pilot research (the previous experiment was carried out to evaluate 100 sugar beet genotypes under different concentrations of glyphosate) were evaluated in field experiment at the Farm of Faculty of Agriculture, Debrecen Univ., Hungary. According to results obtained from the pilot experiment, the optimum concentration of glyphosate was 960 g ha-1 for both sugar beet and weed control sprayed at 4-true leave stage of sugar beet plants. The experiment included 19 sugar beet genotypes namely; Begonia, Cesira, Hermina and Belinda from KWS company, Florata, Profita, Goldrak SH and Longusta from HILLSHOG, Flamingo, Imprial, Velx, Baltika, Mandarin and Thifan from Danisco and Alios, Santino, Imro, Markus and Sandor from Strube company, soaking sugar beet seeds at 0 (water) and 100 ppm IAA (Indol acetic acid) for 24 hours before planting and sprayed with and without glyphosate. The treatments were arranged in a randomized complete</p><p id="Pg78">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 752 block design in three replications. Each plot consists of 3 rows 5 m long and spaced 50 cm apart. Other cultural practices throughout the growing sugar beet were used as usual. To facilitate data presentation and discussion, the sequential soaking in IAA + glyphosate application treatment will be refereed to as treatment 1, the soaking in water + glyphosate application treatments as treatment 2 and without soaking and herbicide application as untreated check or treatment 3. All experimental plots were grown under weed free conditions, thus assuring that data reflects response to herbicide without weed competition. The soil was a lime-coated chernozem with an organic matter content of 2.57% and a pH of 7.0 and the soil analysis showed that P2O5 100mg kg -1 and K2O 165 mg kg-1. Stand counts were taken randomly from 1 m section from each row of each three rows plot. Percent sugar beet injury (foliar suppression) was rated after two weeks from glyphosate applied. The scale used for percent injury ranged from 0 (no visible injury) to 100 (complete death). This injury was visually rated by determining the average percentage of different symptoms occurring in treated sugar beet plants when compared with untreated plants. Oven dry plant weights were taken after three weeks from glyphosate application (45-day after planting). Results and discussion Mean squares for the nineteen sugar beet genotypes are presented in Table 1. The main effect mean squares for herbicide and genotypes were highly significant for stand count, plant dry weight, and visual injury%. However, IAA effect was significant of plant dry weight. Genotypes differed significantly for studied characters as expected from the diverse origin of different breeding programs and their expected genetic diversity. Table. 1.

Data in Table 2 shows that visible injury %, and plant 45-day dry weight were significantly greater under untreated treatment (treatment 3) than treatment 2. However, no significant difference was noted between treatments 1 and 3. In addition, the untreated genotypes had stand equal to, or, in the case of treatment 1, greater than treatment 2. It could be noticed that, comparison of the three treatments, Treatment 1 with treatment 3, gave the highest and best values of all characters studied (Table 2).</p><p id="Pg79">VII.

Sugar beet genotype Begonia attained the lowest value in visible injury %. Glyphosate inhibits 5enolpurovylshikimate 3 phosphate synthase (EPSPS), the enzyme involved into the aromatic amino acids tyrosine, tryptophan and phenylalanine (Devine et al. 1993). During seed development, tryptophan concentrations varied inversely with free IAA and directly with conjugated IAA (Astarita et al. 2003)</p><p id="Pg80">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 754 From a speculative view to the results obtained in Table 3, it could be noted that the effect of glyphosate on foliar suppression (visual injury) of sugar beet genotypes represents a reflected mirror for its effect on other characters. Once more, the tested sugar beet genotypes significantly differed in their dry weight. From the relative rank of several genotypes tolerance to glyphosate under treatment 1 (IAA), it could be observed that Begonia, Cesira, Belinda and Alios sugar beet genotypes gave the highest values of plant dry weight with insignificant difference untreated treatment. Based on demonstration from our previous pilot experiment where it was shown that considerable genetic diversity exists in sugar beet, it can be found out that some sugar beet genotypes have tolerance to glyphosate without using genetic modification of sugar beet. Conclusions The research reported herein was designed to investigate genotype reaction to glyphosate early in the season. The most striking and perhaps significant result of this research is, the suppression of growth as evidenced by reduced early season total plant weight. Under favourable soil moisture and temperature conditions, four of nineteen genotypes showed tolerance to glyphosate. As to the interaction effects between the studied factors, it could be concluded that soaking sugar beet seeds in 100 ppm IAA for 24 hours before planting attained more tolerance to glyphosate. The existence of herbicide x genotype interaction complicates breeding and testing of sugar beet cultivars for herbicide tolerance. Such interaction, as reported herein, questionS the validity of results of field testing ON selection for tolerance.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 755 OPTIMALIZATION ASPECTS FOR SOWING TIME OF SUNFLOWER (HELIANTHUS ANNUUS L.) PRODUCTION László ZSOMBIK Institute of Crop Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Debrecen, e-mail: zsombik@agr.unideb.hu Abstract: In the case of diaporthe stalk staining and dry-rot contamination (Diaporthe helianthi) of which percent frequency has decreased to a lesser degree by an advanced time of sowing than the contamination index expressing the power of contamination. Time of sowing has an influence on the development of Diaporthe helianthi contamination. Higher index values experienced in early time of sowing means that the power of the Diaporthe helianthi contamination, and the frequency of more serious symptoms belonging to a higher range value are higher in the early time of sowing. Analysing the influence of time of sowing on yield, it can be laid down as a fact that the highest yield was in the early time of sowing averaged over years and hibrids (3913 kg ha -1 ). Crop results in an average time of sowing has slightly fallen behind (3865 kg ha -1 ). While hibrids has given a significantly low average crop in the late time of sowing (beginning of May) (3422 kg ha -1 ). Examination of the influence of time of sowing on oil content established that the given crop year considerably influenced the impression of time of sowing. Oil content was near the same in the case of early and average time of sowing; only planting in the beginning of May (late time of sowing) showed a major decrease. Keywords: sunflower, sowing time, disease, Diaporthe helianthi, infection index, yield, oil content Introduction Crop safety of sunflower hybrids are uniform, which primarily marks the tolerance to abiotic, biotic and agricultural engineering stress factors. We have to place more emphasis on critical elements of agricultural engineering factors, at which optimal cost level must be assured. While other elements need a minimum level assured. Such a critical element is planting technology; alteration of time of sowing within a biological optimum has a great influence on the development of diseases and crop results. BEARD and GENG (1982), BORBÉLYNÉ ET AL (2007), and GÖKSOY and TURAN (2007) stated with a major component and path analysis that reaction of identifically and genetically different hibrids on environmental factors (including different time of sowing) are similar to each other. According to HARPER and FERGUSON (1979) early planting advantageously influences the yield and oil content. In the survey of PRODAN et al. (1985) planting in May has caused yield decrease. Early planting promoted a higher oil content, while late planting promoted higher linoleic acid (OWEN, 1983). Diaporthe helianthi first appeared in Yugoslavia (MIHALJČEVIĆ et al., 1980), where the pathogenic was descripted (MUNTAŇOLA-CVETKOVIĆ et al., 1981). Survey (ZSOMBIK and KÖVICS, 1999; VÁGVÖLGYI et al., 1999) directed to an establishment of connection between and contamination volume has shown that contamination and stalk breaking coming of it was the highest in the earliest time of sowing. Contamination was less serious in the case of late plantings because damage was localized only to the epidermis of the stalk, the damage of medulla was slight. Materials and methods Survey was made at the Experimental Site DTTI Látókép, Centre of Agricultural Sciences, University of Debrecen. In surveys of contamination dynamics and time of sowing 10 sunflower hibrids were included. Hibrids were placed with an accidental</p><p id="Pg82">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 756 arrangement four times. Surveys for dynamical examination were carried out between 20th June and 30th August; extent of stalk breaking due to the pathogenic was laid down. Surveying of contamination a scale was established beside the rate of contaminated stocks which shows the acuteness of contamination. Results and discussion Contamination index showed a great increase between 10th July and 30th July, when its value has increased to 3.05 from 1.1. The value experienced in the beginning of August has significantly increased deriving from the significant growth of the last symptom of the disease, the stalk breaking. Stalk breaking was the most frequent in the case of very prematurity group, both in the initial and final stages. During harvesting the rate of broken stalks of very early hibrid groups has risen above other average hibrid groups with 160-200 %. Maturity group’s data prove that stronger contamination can cause magnitude greater damage in hibrids of diverse susceptibility between identical ecological conditions. This fact makes selection and growing of tolerant Diaporthe helianthi hibrids of high priority. Early outbreak of the disease can induce more serious damage in the medulla, while in later contamination the infected plaques appear on the epidermis in a lerga scale. Stalk breaking has increased significantly in the beginning of August. In 1999, a 1.5-2 week lateness can be observed in the course of contamination compared with last year. First stalk symptoms appeared in the case of bigger head diameter, so the development of well developed and heavier heads were less stunted. These larger diameter heads can easier cause stalk breaking at hibrids sensitive for that. This appeared in the yield of middle August. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 june 20 june 30 july 10 july 20 july 30 august 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Infection % in 1998 Infection % in 1999 Infection index in 1998 Infection index in 1999 Figure 1. Alteration of Diaporthe helianthi’s contamination rate and contamination in the a growth season (Debrecen, 1998-1999) We have analysed the connection between sowing time and Diaporthe contamination at 10 hibrids in 3 sowing time. The highest contamination % and stalk breaking appeared in the earliest sowing time. Even 60 % difference in contamination appeared among hibrids from the earliest and the latest sowing time. In our opinion early sowing time</p><p id="Pg83">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 757 gives greater appearance of the disease an advantage, and so a greater agricultural damage is increasing. Contamination index has become similarly to contamination %, but using the index contamination difference caused by diverse sowing times can be demonstrable to a much higher degree. Contamination index of the earliest sowing time is 2.5 times higher than the values of hibrids of the latest sowing time. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 In fe ct io n i n d e x june 20 june 30 july 10 july 20 july 30 august 10 april 6. april 21. may 5. Figure 2. The influence of sowing time on Sunflower hibrids’ s development of Diaporthe helianthi contamination index (Debrecen, 1999) Stalk breaking due to pathogens has decreased with shifted sowing time. At the earliest sowing time, the ratio of broken stalks was 7 %, while in the case of sowing in May this value hasn’t reached even 2 %. In the case of hibrids of weaker stalk strength the degree of stalk breaking was significant in low contamination as well. Yield difference due to different sowing times is not significant in the average of hibrids, but some hibrids respond differently to alteration of sowing time in favourable year. In unfavourable years the reaction of hibrids weren’t so different, every examined hibrid respond with yield decrease to the overdue sowing. From the examined years, the most favourable year was 2003, while the lowest yield was appeared in the drier 2001 year. Table 1.

Fluctuation of oil content in hibrids was the slightest in early sowing (42.3-54.1%), which increases in the average sowing time (40.1-54.2 %) and which was the highest in late sowing time (38.6-55.4 %). The highest oil content were in 2002 and 2003 in the average of hibrids and sowing times, while the lowest oil content was in 1999. Table 2.

The connection between yield and contamination proved to be closed, so pathogen control is definitely important in nowadays’ agricultural technology. Contaminations significantly deviate in different sowing times. Among these, contamination was the greatest in the case of sowing in April’ second decade. However, contamination has proved to be higher in the case of earlier sowing time. Contamination rate and strength was lower in the case of lat sowing time. References Beard, B. H. – Geng, S.

Twenty four samples of sheep feed (kernel maize, maize silage, alfalfa haylige, grass and alfalfa hay, concentrates were collected in Bakonszeg (Hungary) and were analysed for fungi contamination and mycotoxin content (F-2, T-2, DON, Ochratoxin) and the correlation among them. Various species of fungi were found in all samples. Penicillium and Fusarium species were found in highest amount. There was positive and significant correlation among propagula of mould and F-2 (0.775; LSD0.95) and T-2 contents (0.925 LSD0.99) in hay samples. DON was found in all samples and highest values of that were found in concentrate, in kernel maize and in silage (1.51.6 mg/kg). No ochratoxin was found in any of the samples. Keywords: feed, mycotoxin, fungi, soil-borne diseases Introduction Soil-plant interrelations are highly affected by processes of fungal diseases. Fungi contamination on feed plants (maize, alfalfa and hay) and the ability to produce mycotoxins (second metabolits of fungi) can cause animal diseases, feed refusal, weight loss, and mortality of animals worldwide. Mycotoxin-producing fungi may contaminate agricultural products in the field, during storage and/or processing (Charmley, 1993; Szarka-Toldi, 2006). Mycotoxin contamination of human food and animal feed poses serious health hazard (Bata, 1990; Jolánkai 2007). Some fungi may produce more than one type of mycotoxins, while some mycotoxins are produced by more than one fungal species. Often more than one mycotoxin is found on a contaminated substrate (MückeLemmen, 2004). The relationship between contamination of fungi and content of mycotoxins of feed was investigated by several authors. Similarly to others Edwards (2004) has found no correlation between them. The purpose of our study was to examine the contamination of fungi and the content of mycotoxins of different feeds and to determine correlation between them, if exists. Materials and methods Twenty four samples of sheep feed were collected monthly at Awassi Rt., Bakonszeg, Eastern part of Hungary from January-May, 2007. Kernel maize samples were collected from grain fodder tank No1 (MTA-Kostelep), concentrate samples from outer storage tank, alfalfa haylige samples from silage tower No2 (MTA-Kostelep, conserved in May, 2006), corn silage samples from clamp No1 (MTA-Kostelep, conseved in September, 2006), hay samples from hay stack (Kórogy) and alfalfa hay samples from bale (Kórogy). The mycological examinations of feed samples were performed according to national and international standards (MSZ 1993, 1998). At first, samples of feed were evaluated by human sensory tests (smell and vision). Then 50 particulums of each kernel maize and 10 particulums of each hay and silage samples were placed into sterile Petri-dishes (19 cm diameter) between two moist tissue-papers. The samples were</p><p id="Pg86">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 760 incubated in this humid condition in dark thermostat between 22 and 23 ºC to determine fungal species' potencial capability of mycotoxin production. The samples of different feeds were tested in four replications. After 5 days incubation period the fungi were identified with microscope (Zeiss, h500WILO-PRAX). In the further processes identification was based on the method of thinned arranged samples grown on potatodextrose agar and the number of fungal colonies (pieces of colonies per Petri-dish per thinnings) counting them after 3 days. After the morphological examinations of colonies microscopical preparations were made to identify the species and genus of fungi. ELISA method was used for qualitative mycotoxin laboratory analyses using commercial kits (Euro-Diagnostica Deoxynivalenol, EIA, Ochratoxin A EIA, T-2 Toxin EIA, Zearalenone EIA) with a Safax 303 Reader. After the steps of preparation and cleaning procedure on immunaffinity columns (VICAM-DON test HPLC, Ochratest, Zearalatest) the quantitative determination of mycotoxin contents were made on a HPLC equipped with fluorescence and UV detection. Statistical analyses (rank correlation) were done according to Fischer and Yates (1957). Results and discussion During the sensory test mouldy odour or any unpleasant smell were not observed. Results of the laboratory analyses, the identified fungi species and their abundance are presented in Table 1. The results show the contamination of fungi and the content of mycotoxins (F-2, T-2, DON, OTA) of different feed and also the lack of correlation between them. Figure 1. Fusarium culmorum (Photo: Fischl G) Estimating the correlation among the F-2 toxin content of different hay samples and propagulum numbers of moulds 0.775 (LSD 0.95)coefficient was found.

Cereal Research Communications 762 Conclusions Most of plant fungal diseases are soil-borne, and some of them result in mycotoxin residues (Várallyay, 2006). Contamination of food and feed with mycotoxins is a significant problem worldwide. Mycotoxins cause losses in crop production and have harmful effects on humans, and animals. Inoculum of fungi is primarily believed to be crop debris on the soil surface. Fungal infection may develop if the weather is favourable for sporulation. The concentration of toxins depends on wheather conditions during that period when plants are susceptible to the infection (Láng et al, 2004; Németh et al, 2006). Our results stated that Penicillium and Fusarium species were isolated in the highest numbers in the feed. In kernel maize, concentrates and maize silage higher levels of DON toxins were found. In our opinion there is no linear correlation between contamination of fungi and the content of mycotoxins in general, however in 2 cases strong correlations were found. The future challenge is to understand the relationship between disease severity, fungal biomass and the production of associated mycotoxins in order to minimize risks of disease damage to crop yields and threat to human health. Also there is an urgent need to enrich our knowledge regarding the role of production site in fungal diseases.

Jekatyerina KODENKO – Maria BELOVECZ Department Accounting and Finance, Szent Istvan University, Gödöllő, Hungary e-mail: kodenko.jekatyerina@gtk.szie.hu Abstract: The object of the research is the evolving of the Russian preferential national project as the basic financial resource for agricultural development. Based on the goals, resources and possible outcomes of the project we estimate the future of the country’s agriculture. Keywords: financing, preferential national project, Russian agriculture, subsidies Introduction Low profitability features the present Russian agriculture. The soil quality, weather conditions and resource endowments all have significant effects on the profitability of agriculture. However, other controllable and variable factors, like the determination of the appropriate species, securing of technical conditions, the tempo and structure of financing, have bigger effects on profitability like in Hungary. The problems of productivity and profitability under Hungarian conditions were examined by several authors who focused on the soil as main resource of agricultural production, on the level of mechanisation and capital source. (Baranyai – Takács, 2007a; Baranyai – Takács, 2007b; Takács – Baranyai, 2005; Takács, 2007; Borszéki, 2003; Borszéki, 2004) It could be stated that any changes in profitability in the sector can not be done without application of new technologies, like precision farming that has economic effects on the farming. (Barkaszi – Takács-György, 2007; Barkaszi et al., 2007) The state participation in subsidizing manifestly improves the profitability of farms. The share of crop production in the agricultural sector of Russia is substantial (more than 50%) in last five years. The continuous increasing of production volumes in crop sector (on the average 5 percent per year) ensures the improvement of competitiveness of the crop production.The preferential national project for the “Development of the agrarian sector” came into effect in the Federal Republic of Russia in 2006, which includes the most important parts of the sector. The execution of the project belongs under the scope of the Russian Ministry of Agriculture. The elements of the project are: Country Development; Reconditioning and preserving the fertility of Russian soil; Agricultural resource potency development and increase of efficiency; The stimulation of the development of the smaller elements of farming (family and farmer economies). (Проект Правительства, 2005) Materials and methods The research was based on seconder data from the data published from the Russian Ministry of Agriculture on the financing of the preferential national project. During the determination of possible outcomes, global and national conditions and tendencies were observed as well. Indexes expressed in Rubles were converted as 36 Rubles to one Euro. The profitability of agriculture is the ratio of revenues and input, the profitability of</p><p id="Pg90">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 764 agriculture disregarding subsidies is the ratio of revenues axed by the sum of subsidies, and input. Results and discussion The situation of the Russian agriculture is characterized by the following deficiencies: low efficient administration, the lack of conditions for the development of human capital, low level of competition in some sectors, time inequalities in executing regional reforms, as well as the low integration of the Russian economy in to the tendencies of global economy. Positive profitability can be secured only by state subsidizing.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 765 The main goals of the developmental project are: the creation of preconditions and to develop the countryside; to secure the development of the priority sectors of agriculture; to achieve greater financial security of the agriculture; to better the command structure of the markets of product, raw material and food. Animal breeding and plant production enjoys special priority when dividing the resources of the project. In plant production, heighten attention is paid to elite seed production, flax production, perennial cultures and increasing canola production, canola on the one side exhausts the need of feed crop in animal breeding and on the other side canola is the raw material of bio energy. The central national budget finances 40% of the project; the rest of the financing is covered by local budgets and other sources. (Figure 3.) Regional leaders decide about participation and the amount of subsidy regionally, following the national project guidelines. As a result of the execution of the project, it is anticipated that by providing equal opportunities the right contention will be achieved at the market of agricultural products, which will provide the preconditions to change the entrepreneurial mindset in the agricultural sector. other sources; 8638,9; 22,11% local budgets; 15119,4; 38,70% national budget; 15313,9; 39,19% Figure 3: Sources of the project financing, mln EUR, % (Sources: own calculations) 22% increase is anticipated in the gross income of the agriculture by 2012. (Table 1). According to the project, the volume of investments into agricultural production will reach 26,3 mrd EUR in 2008-2012. By regulating the agricultural product-, raw material- and food markets, the rate of national products in food retail will reach 70%. In the social sector, according to the project, consumer income will be doubled and there will be 3.7 times more homes bought compared to 2007. Agricultural technology will undergo positive developments: power machinery capacity will increase by 32%. Conclusions On the whole, it can be concluded that the preferential national Agrarian project has an important role in the Russian economic development. The state has a leading role in financing the project. To achieve the country’s previous might, the globalization of material, financial and other resources is crucial. The current plans on the rate of development suggest optimistic calculations in the project execution.</p><p id="Pg92">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 766 Table 1.

J. Strossmayer in Osijek, Faculty of Agriculture, Trg Sv. Trojstva 3, HR-31000 Osijek, Croatia Abstract: Field experiment with increased rates of carbocalk (39% CaO: t ha -1 = 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90) was established in autumn 2000. As affected by liming yields were increased up to 10% (maize: the 2006 growing season) and up to 40% (wheat: the 2006/2007 growing season). In general, leaf (ear-leaf at silking) and grain mineral composition of maize was more or less depended on liming. For example, the most significant influences of liming was found for leaf-P, -Mg,-Mn and –Zn (0.28 and 0.40% P, 0.13 and 0.22% Mg, 254 and 92 mg Mn kg -1 , 28 and 19 mg Zn kg -1 , for control and liming, respectively). Also, liming influenced significantly on number of ears in m 2 (490 and 595, respectively). Keywords: maize, liming, wheat, yield, grain composition, leaf composition Introduction Different types of soil degradation became serious constraint of sustainable development (Várallyay, 2006; Kádár, 2007). Some improvements are possible by adequate plant breeding program (Kovacevic et al., 2006; Pepo, 2006, 2007). Soil acidity is certainly one of the most damaging soil conditions affecting the growth of most crops. Low pH syndrome including mainly the combination of aluminium and manganese toxicities and low calcium and magnesium availability. Adverse conditions of soil acidity on crop growth were controlled by the use of liming materials. Aim of this study was testing residual effects of liming on maize and wheat. Material and methods Field experiment with increased rates of carbocalk (waste of Osijek Sugar Factory, 39% CaO: t ha-1 = 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90) was established on 8 November 2000 on arable land of Kutjevo Agricultural Holding (Pleternica, Pozega-Slavonian County). The field trial was conducted in four replicates (experimental plot of fertilization 64.3m2). Crop rotation for the 2001-2007 period on the experimental field was as follows: maize (2001) – maize (2002) – sunflower (2003) – winter barley (2004) – tobacco (2005) – maize (2006) – wheat (2007). The results of the 4-year testing (2001-2004), including soil characteristics, were shown in the previous study (Kovacevic et al., 2006). Maize (hybrid Pioneer 38A24) was sown at the beginning of May 2006 on planned plant density 54945 plants ha-1. Fertilization of the trial was as usual (kg ha-1: 157 N + 100 P2O5 + 150 K2O). Maize was harvested manualy (four 6.65 m-long internal rows from each basic plot) on 21 October 2006. Grain yields were calculated on 90% of planned plant density and 14% grain moisture basis. Wheat (cultivar Renan) was sown on 17 October 2007. For determination of grain yield and quality parameters 1.0 m2 of wheat was harvested from each plot on 28 June 2007. The ear-leaf (25 leaves in mean sample) was taken at beginning of silking stage (middle of July 2006) for chemical analysis. The total amount of individual elements in the leaf</p><p id="Pg94">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 768 samples after microwave digestion using concentrated HNO3+H2O2 was measured by the ICP-AES technique. Oil content in the grain was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy method. Protein and starch content in grain was determined by Near Infrared spectroscopic method on Foss Tecator ("Infratec 1241 Grain Analyzer"). The growing season 2006 was favorable for maize, as shown in Table 1. In general, low maize yields are in close connection with water deficit and higher airtemperatures, especially during July and August (Kovacevic et al., 2007). Also, mild winter and good distribution of precipitation have been main characteristics of the 2006/2007 growing season (Table 2). These weather conditions are favorable for wheat (Josipovic et al., 2005). Table 1. Weather characteristics for the maize growing season 2006 (Slav.

However, liming effects were considerably higher in the previous years (Kovacevic et al. 2006) as follows: yield increases up to 50% and 36% (maize in 2001 and 2002, respectively), up to 49% (sunflower 2003) and up to 30% (barley 2004). As reported by Bergmann (1992) adequate nutritional status of maize leaves (the ear leaf at silking stage) are as follows (on dry matter basis): from 0.25 to 0.50 % P, from 2.00 to 3.50 % K, from 0.25 to 1.00 % Ca, from 0.25 to 0.50 % Mg, from 25 to 70 mg Zn kg -1, from 35 to 100 mg Mn kg -1 and from 6 to 12 mg Cu kg -1.

Regarding Mg status, they were under adequate range for the control and to levels of 30 t ha-1 lime treatments. It was improved to marginal levels for normal range as affected by the higher lime rate applications. Manganese status was highly depended on liming because the Mg content was near three times dropped (mean 91.7 Mn mg kg -1 for liming treatments and 254.3 for the control). However, Mn concentrations in maize leaves for liming treatments were in adequate ranges. Zinc status in maize leaves was also highly depended on liming. It was adequate in the control and by using the lowest lime rate (mean 27.4 Zn mg kg -1), and under adequate ranges by application of the higher lime rates (mean 16.5 Zn mg kg -1). Liming was without significant effects on K status in maize. In general, liming improved P, Ca and Mg status in plants to near twofold compared to the control. At the same time, Mn and Fe status drastically declined. Nevertheless, these nutritional unbalances were without adverse effects on maize yields and grain quality (protein, starch and oil contents) parameters (Table 3). Liming effects on nutritional status of plants in our study were mainly in accordance with literature data (Bergmann, 1992; Mengel and Kirkby, 2001). In general, liming effects on grain composition were mainly similar to their effects on leaf status, but they intensities were considerably lower. However, reduction of some biogenic elements uptake in grain under liming conditions (for example, zinc) could be responsible for</p><p id="Pg96">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Liming had considerable impacts on grain yields of wheat under the 2006/2007 growing season (the seventh year of testing) conditions. For example, by application 45 t ha-1 of carbocalk wheat yield was increased for 40 % (Table 4). At same time, ears number per area unit was increased for 20 %. Also, thousand grain weights were increased by liming for 9% (48.85 g and 44.94 g, for liming treatments and the control, respectively). Table 4.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 771 AGRO-ECONOMICAL EXAMINATION OF MAIZE GROWING IN THE HAJDÚSÁG LOESS RIDGE Dénes SULYOK – Attila MEGYES - Tamás RÁTONIi – László HUZSVAI University of Debrecen, Center of Agricultural and Technological Sciences Faculty of Agricultural Sciences, Institute for Land Utilisation, Technology and Regional Development Abstract: The factual data of the organization carrying out plant growing activities on the Debrecen loess ridge are presented in this paper. The company uses 650 hectares and its main profile is plant growing. 100 hectares were used for maize production purposes both in 2006 and 2007. The average gold crown value (measurement unit of the quality of arable land in Hungary) is 43,2. The amount of fertilizer to be used was calculated by the 4M-fer fertilizer advisory system. The agro-economical examinations were carried out by 4M-eco agro-economical analyzer module. The two examined years differed from each other from the ecological point of view. In 2006 there was a favourable precipitation supply in the examined area. Drought affected yield unfavourably in 2007. Prices were affected by the fact in 2006 there was a supply market, whereas in 2007 there was an on-demand market. The favourable market price in 2007 partially counterbalanced the yield loss, thus the production could be arranged with a minimall loss (economic aim: loss minimizing), and the majority of subsidies were functioning as income producing factors. As the probability of weather extremities is increasing, we recommend to establish the ability to irrigate the areas in the given organisation, too. Keywords: agro-economical examination, yield, turnover, contribution margin, production costs, income, activity income, cost-proportionate profitability, prime cost, cost level, irrigation alternatives Introduction During their vital activities, plants take up the elements, solutions needed and the water, nutriments essential for synthetizing almost completely from the soil (Dobó et al 2006). The nutriment content of the soil and their proportion can be freely altered by interventions (Várallyay et al 2007). Nevertheless, the degree of efficiency can only be significantly increased by irrigation within our climate conditions (Sulyok-Fodor 2005, Csathó 2007, Kádár 2007). Irrigation is of basic importance in our country, as the quantity of precipitation does not fullfill the needs of plants in most years – the same goes with 2007, too. It is the biggest limiting factor among Hungary’s plant growing conditions concerning both the quantity and the quality of yield (Nagy et al 2000, Nagy 2007). Among production factors, water is of peculiar importance during the determination of growing and yield. Water has a many-sided plant physiology function. It has a role in the dissolution of mineral nutriments, the transportation of nutriments and can be found in the carbon dioxide assimilation, too. During evaporation, it protects the above the ground parts of the plant from excessive warming up and induces the plant to take up more nutriment and water (Nagy 1997,Gyuricza et al 2006). The energy shortage starting in the 1960’s had its effect all over the world. This was further increased by the oil prive explosion in the 1970’s. The increase in cost owing to this imposed bigger and bigger burdens on agricultural production, too. In the United States, 15% of total energy consumption is used for food production, and one fifth of it is utilized by agriculture (Birkás 2002, Gyuricza 2001). Sembery (1989) and Linke (1996) pointed out that cultivation is one of the most cost-demanding processes of plant growing activity. While cost savings in the field of nutritive supplementing and plant protection cannot be reached or can only be reached if the quality and the quantity of production decreases, there can be serious cost savings in the rationalization of tillage</p><p id="Pg98">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 772 (Németh 2006). The examination of the cost savings of tillage and the application of soil protecting methods were running in parallel with each other. The American and Western European researchers dealing with this issue pointed out a tight positive correlation in this topic. According to Njos (1983), it is possible to gain significant cost savings in energy needs and working hour needs, if they leave turning-type basic tillage behind. Kreytmayr (1989), Eichhorn (1991) and Birkás (1995) all pointed out that this decrease can account for 50-70% of the total tillage costs. Its extent strongly relies on production site specifications and the average values can hide serious distortions in many cases. Köller (1993) is more cautious by considering a decrease of 40-55% real concerning working hours and fuel costs. At the same time he points out that in the case of direct sowing and one round sowing with a rotary cultivator it is possible to save more costs. According to Birkás (1995), in the case of conventional tillage, 40-50 liter/hectares of fuel is needed, that can further increase by 10-25% if there are unfavourable conditions. As opposed to this, in the case of tillage systems with a reduced number of rounds, fuel consumption is 25-35 liter/hectares, that can be further increased by 25-30% within unfavourable conditions As the tillage systems differ from each other, the volume of production and the costs applied are different, too. When evaluating financial expenditures, one has to make a difference between production technologies (Nagy 2003, 2005). When examining the cost structure, we can find significant differences. This is because the same material costs are present with different weights in the different production technologies. It is also the proportion of material costs and the costs of auxiliary operations that is the highest in the case of conventional production technologies and those having a reduced number of rounds (Rátonyi 2003). We can save the most if we apply these costs in the most rational way. If there is a drastic change in these costs (few percentage rise in fuel prices), it can have a large impact on the total production costs and this way on profitability, too. Materials and methods The factual data of the organization carrying out plant growing activities on the Debrecen loess ridge are presented in this paper. The company uses 650 hectares and its main profile is plant growing. 100 hectares were used for maize production purposes both in 2006 and 2007. The average gold crown value (measurement unit of the quality of arable land in Hungary) is 43,2. The amount of fertilizer to be used was calculated by the 4M-fer fertilizer advisory system, the amounts of precipitation during the growth season (2006: 405.2 mm, 2007: XXX mm), the yields (2006: 8t/ha, 2007: 5t/ha) and the technology applied were provided by the company. The agro-economical examinations were carried out by 4M-eco agro-economical analyzer module. We considered the cost data of 2007 in both years to be able to carry out the comparison. There is two varying factor in the agro-economical examination: yield and selling price. We applied 4M-eco agro-economic simulation model developed by the University of Debrecen Center of Agricultural and Technological Sciences, Institute for Land Utilisation, Technology and Regional Development to economically analyze the agriculture carried out. Incomes (selling price of the principal product, land-based subsidies, other income, fuel reimbursement etc.), the agicultural technology applied, production technology, costs of sowing seed, fertilizers, pesticides and other material, the costs of auxiliary operations</p><p id="Pg99">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 773 and manual labour, the overhead costs arising, the insurance and farming lease fees are all based on the data of the enterprise. Results and discussion The income in 2006 was 28300 thousand HUF. We calculated with 30 thousand HUF/t selling price in 2006. In 2007 – considering an on-demand market – we considered a price of 53 thousand HUF/t. We considered the 2007 level for land-based subsidies a COP crops subsidies both in 2006 and 2007. The income in 2007 was 30800 thousand HUF. Production costs were about the same during the two years examined (2006: 193480 HUF/ha, 2007: 179570 HUF/ha). Every production technology factor was the same in 2006 and 2007. Nutritive management, plant protection, agrotechnical operations (basic tillage, seed-bed preparation, sowing, mechanical weed control, harvesting, transportation, drying, storing, etc.), farming lease fees, insurance fees and overhead costs were the same in both years. The difference between the two production costs lies in the differences between insurance fees and overhead costs. During the examination of the income, we pointed out that the income arising from the activities (only the growing) was 73180 HUF/ha in 2006, that was a year with favourable precipitation supply. The income was 93180 HUF/ha. In 2007, when there was a shortage in precipitation, maize growing showed a deficit (12900 HUF/ha). The income (6900 HUF/ha) was constituted by the national and the COP crops subsidies in this year. Contribution margins were favourable during both years due to the capacity of maize growing to cover overhead expenses. When examining cost-proportionate profitability, we had the same conclusions as those of net income. Within favourable growing conditions, cost-proportionate profitability was favourable both when calculating it from activity income and income (48.1 and 37.8 %). In the case of droughty weather (2007) the cost-proportionate profitability calculated from activity income was negative (-7,2%), whereas the one calculated from income was 3,8%. Cost level was 67,5% in 2006, whereas it was 96,3% in 2007. Prime cost was 24,2 HUF/kg in 2006 and it was 35,9 HUF/kg in 2007. The difference between the two prime costs was induced by the difference between yield values, as significant part of the costs (approx. 80%) is independent of the yield. The difference between marginal costs depends on how we distribute them among the yields. Conclusions The two examined years differed from each other from the ecological point of view. In 2006 there was a favourable precipitation supply in the examined area. Drought affected yield unfavourably in 2007. Prices were affected by the fact in 2006 there was a supply market, whereas in 2007 there was an on-demand market. The favourable market price in 2007 partially counterbalanced the yield loss, thus the production could be arranged with a minimall loss (economic aim: loss minimizing), and the majority of subsidies were functioning as income producing factors. As the probability of weather extremities is increasing, we recommend to establish the ability to irrigate the areas in the given organisation, too.

Contamination of agricultural soil with heavy metals is a major problem on industrial and defense related sites all over the world. Saccharomyces cerevisiae biomass plays an important role in the investigations in the field of heavy metal biosorption. It can accumulate metal ions in biomass (Volesky and Phillips, 1995). The purpose of the present study is to examine the tolerance of S. cerevisiae strains to toxicity of Cu 2+ , Cd 2+ , Pb 2+ or Ni 2+ . Secondly, to study how alkaline metals (Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ or K + ) correct the negative effects of heavy metals on yeast growth. Keywords: heavy metal, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, bioaccumulation, rhizosphere Introduction The main reaction for heavy metal to be combined with the microbial surface can be described as an ion-exchange reaction between heavy metal and Ca2+, Mg2+ or K+ in the cell wall. This reaction is also observed in mold, bacteria and yeast (Singleton and Simmons, 1996). Investigations conducted by several researchers demonstrated that S. cerevisiae is capable of accumulating heavy metals such as Cu, Cd, Pb, Zn, Cr and Ni ions (Huang et al., 1990; Engl and Kunz, 1995; Leusch et al., 1995; Chen and Wang, 2007). Microorganisms are more sensitive to heavy metal contamination than those plants (Bódi et al., 2006; Bódi, 2007) and animals which are present in the same soil (Giller et al., 1997; Várallyay, 2007; Birkás et al., 2006; Prokisch et al., 2007). The waste waters contain heavy metal ions in small concentration, it is necessary to treat them before any kind of utilization. The reason of this is the fact that heavy metals set in the waste water during biological processes, therefore they will present in the biomass in higher concentration (Barótfi, 2000). Biosorption which is a property of certain types of inactive, dead microbial biomass to bind and concentrate heavy metals from even very dilute aqueous solutions is one of the most promising technologies which can be used for this purpose (Veglio et al., 1996). The Ca2+ or Mg2+ ions are first bound with the cell wall, and primarily with negatively-charged functional groups present in its structure, and thereafter they can be transferred to the cell’s interior (Saltukoglu and Slaughter, 1983). Materials and methods In pot experiment and under greenhouse conditions, maize, spring wheat and alfalfa plants were grown in Nyírség soil amended with 50% (w/w) sewage sludge originated from Nyíregyháza for 50 days. The root system of each plant was carefully and sharpely cut after washing with light water for few minutes to remove all loosely adhering soil particles followed by washing with sterile 0.85% saline water. The inoculated Petri</p><p id="Pg102">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 776 dishes containing agar medium were incubated for 48 hours at 28°C. The isolation was carried out on YPDA medium. The purified selected yeast colonies were classified to various groups according to their morphology, and microscopically and morphotypes were defined. From each morphotype, one typical strain was selected and used for further identification. The most of the isolates were identified as S. cerevisiae and Saccharomyces sp. according to their morphology and growth reaction. Out of 32 identified yeast strains, six strains were selected. Two strains (NSS5099 and NSS7002) were isolated from the rhizosphere of maize. In addition, two strains (WSSG991 and WSSG992) were isolated from the rhizosphere of spring wheat and two strains of S. cerevisiae (MSSG990 and MSSG997) were isolated from the rhizosphere of alfalfa. For further investigations, the yeast strains were grown in YPD broth medium at 28°C for 2 days in orbital shaking incubator at 150 rpm and the strains were maintained at 4°C on YPDA. To examine the toxic effect of the heavy metal ions on the growth of the six strains of S. cerevisiae, different concentrations of Cu2+, Cd2+, Pb2+ or Ni2+ ions were added to the sterilized YPD broth medium in the form of metal salt solution of CuSO4, Cd(NO3)2, Pb(NO3)2 or NiSO4. Tolerance to heavy metals was determined as the MIC against the test yeasts. YPDA medium was prepared and amended with various concentrations of heavy metals to achieve the desired concentration ranging from 0 to 640 µM. The plates were incubated at 28°C for 2 days to observe the growth of yeasts on the spotted area. MIC was defined as the minimum inhibitory concentration of the heavy metal. The kinetic growth curves of the six yeast strains were studied in the YPD broth medium. The effect of the Cu2+, Cd2+, Pb2+ or Ni2+ ions in the form of CuSO4, Cd(NO3)2, Pb(NO3)2 or NiSO4 at 50 µM concentration was examined after 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66 and 72 hours on cell growth kinetic curve at 28°C. The cell growth of the two selected yeast strains (NSS5099 and NSS7002) was studied in YPD broth medium which contained (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450 or 500 µM) concentration of Cu, Cd, Pb or Ni salts at 28°C. The amount of dry biomass in the suspension was determined by samples taken at different intervals from the heavy metal amended broth medium, which were then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes and washed with phosphate buffer and then centrifuged again. The precipitate of yeast cells was collected and dried at 85°C until it reached the constant weight. The experiment was carried out as mentioned above, and the rate of the yeast cell growth was measured in the heavy metal amended medium after the application of Ca(HCO3)2, MgSO4, or K2SO4 at 50, 75, and 150 mM, respectively at 28°C. All experiments were carried out with three replicates. Results and discussion In the present investigation 32 yeast isolates were identified as S. cerevisiae strains were isolated from rhizosphere of sewage sludge amended agriculture field soil. Exposure of yeast strains to Cu2+, Cd2+, Pb2+ or Ni2+ can lead to physiological adaptation or sensitive strains or mutants and such changes may be associated with increased metal sorption capacity. The most frequently encountered yeast isolates from the rhizosphere samples of all three plants were belonging to S. cerevisiae. Representative of the S. cerevisiae were selected to determine MIC for the investigated metals. The two strains isolated from the rhizosphere of spring wheat showed relatively low tolerance to all metals in comparison to other two strains isolated from maize rhizosphere. The tolerance among</p><p id="Pg103">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 777 yeast strains was observed in order of Cu &gt; Pb &gt; Cd &gt; Ni. Results indicated that the yeast strains isolated from the rhizosphere of maize were the most heavy metal tolerant. The NSS7002 strain grown in heavy metal free culture give up the highest growth rate, followed by the growth of the strain in medium polluted with Cd2+, Ni2+, Pb2+ and Cu2+. The growth rate in the initial period was higher for NSS7002 than NSS5099, but after 24 h it was found a little slower than NSS5099. At the same time, the effect of Cu was more toxic than Pb, Cd and Ni. The stationary phase was developed for NSS5099 strain faster than for NSS7002 strain between 48 and 66 h, and it was depended on the metal ion type. The growth rate of the NSS5099 strain in medium polluted with Ni2+ and Cd2+ was higher than that in polluted medium with Pb2+ and Cu2+. Meanwhile, the growth rate of the strain in heavy metal free medium was lower than its growth rate in the medium polluted with Ni2+, Cd2+ or Pb2+. The Cu2+, Cd2+, Pb2+ and Ni2+ ions were examined in connection with inhibition of the cell growth of the two S. cerevisiae strains at concentrations higher than 300 µM of Cu2+, Cd2+, Pb2+ and 400 µM Ni2+. Here, the cell growth significantly decreased. The beginning of stronger inhibiting effect of at 350 for Cu2+, Cd2+ and Pb2+, but for Ni2+ it was at 450 µM. At 150 µM of Cu2+, Cd2+, Pb2+ or Ni2+, the effect was found to be negligible. The results showed that the studied heavy metals can be arranged in the following order according to their toxic effect on both yeast strains: Cu2+, Pb2+, Cd2+ and Ni2+. The results showed that the correction of the heavy metal toxicity was occurred by the addition of 50 mM Ca(HCO3)2 in the medium before addition of 350 µM of Cu 2+, Pb2+ or Cd2+ or 450 µM Ni2+ which show a protective action against cell death and decreased the toxicity effect. The addition of 75 mM MgSO4 or the addition of 150 mM K2SO4 reduced the toxic effect of all investigated metals by 40%. It was found that K+ had the potent to reduce the action of tested heavy metals followed by Mg2+. Ca2+ had the lowest ability to reduce the toxicity of the metals. Fig. 4. shows the mode of correction according to the application of Ca2+, Mg2+ or K+ to growth medium and toxic dose of the heavy metal. It was found that the yeast cell dry weight increased by the presence of the alkaline metal as correctors. Also, K+ improve the growth biomass of the strains with more potent than Mg2+ and Ca2+. Conclusions Our preliminary findings indicate that the selected strains of S. cerevisiae strains isolated from soil rhizosphere contaminated with heavy metals from sewage sludge have metal biosorption potential similar to that of other fungi and could be exploited for metal removal from aqueous metal solution. The results obtained in the presented study exhibit the potential of S. cerevisiae strain NSS7002 better than NSS5099 to be used for decontamination of soil containing heavy metal ions.

The application of standard geobotanical research methods with statistical data analysis. Under the present management conditions desirable meadow taxa keep their constancy; the reduction of ruderal and weed species is evident, though statistically insignificant. For the variability of species composition over time, and in particular by the location of relevés taken, the strong influence of substrate heterogeneity i.e. (in addition to exposure, humidity etc.) is inferred. Keywords: dumpsites, anthropogenic soils, land reclamation, vegetation Introduction Agricultural, forest, hydrological and other spoil-bank reclamation arising during opencast coal mining represent expensive and professionally demanding, but necessary procedures and measures leading to the regeneration and revitalisation of the landscape affected by mining operations. Spoil heaps of overburden material deposited from the overlaying rock of strip mines is one of the important subjects of botanical research, even if, from the habitat point of view, they generally do not have favourable qualities for plant growth (Lacová and Stekauerová, 2007). A botanical (as well as zoological) evaluation of the herb and forest stands was carried out at selected locations of these anthropogenic formations with the aim of monitoring the dynamics of their development (Kádár, 2007), from which it is possible to infer and deduce the plants’ proportional representation in the future. Materials and methods In the period of 2000-2007 meadow vegetation was studied on a significant part of the spoil heap ´Radovesická´, situated in the North Bohemian region. This spoil heap, with an area of about 1 500 ha, is one of the largest in Central Europe. 750 million square metres of overlaying rock soil up to an average height of 50 to 80 m has been deposited on original cretaceous and gneissose bedrock, with volcanic bedrock here and there. The object of research was a single-mow meadow (central point: 50°33'10.832"N, 13°48'52.689"E) in a reclaimed part of the spoil heap created predominantly by Miocene clays and sands with an approximately 20 cm thick irregular top soil layer. Standard geobotanical research methods were applied; a description of the vegetation by means of a 7-member combined scale of abundance and dominance (for example Bejček and Šťastný, 2001), statistical data analysis using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) utilising the weighted averages method (Lepš and Šmilauer, 2003).

Cereal Research Communications 780 relevés in a 5 m transect, the evaluation in squares of 1 m2, 14 relevés in total. Species nomenclature is in accordance with Kubát et al. (2002). Results and discussion A single-mow mesophyte meadow community with a relatively high representation of weed and ruderal taxa and with the potential for their propagation. During the present minimum meadow management there is no demonstrable increase in the abundance and possible expansion of the undesirable species present – Cirsium arvense, Calamagrostis epigejos, Tussilago farfara, Artemisia vulgaris and Chenopodium sp.; but the present management with a single mowing annually is evidently not sufficient to suppress them more. Festuca arundinacea, Festuca rubra, Arrhenatherum elatius, Trisetum flavescens and Trifolium pratense more or less preserve their constancy, even if phytocoenosis is not completely stable. As canopy closure of the growth closes, a reduction of weed and ruderal taxa is evident, though not statistically significant. The effect of time on growth composition (Fig.1) is significant (p=0,0020), but explains only 8,5% of data variability. DCA explains more than 20% of the variability, which indicates the existence of another stronger gradient. For example time’s influence is clear in both Melilotus sp. or Taraxacum sect.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 781 From the potential existence of another influential gradient in vegetation development at the monitored locality, influenced by relevés and time, can be assumed that there is the strong effect of substrate composition (in addition to exposure, moisture conditions, etc.). The spoil heap is formed from a heterogeneous and irregularly mixed mixture, in particular infertile soil and then reclaimable as well as accidentally admixed soils. In such a case it is necessary to infer a sufficiently distinct and long-term effect of this influence in addition to meadow management; see e.g. relevés 1-6, releve 7 (Fig.2). -1.0 1.0 -0 .6 1 .0 Alop pr Arct sp.

The effect of time on the stand’s composition in the given period was found to be significant, but it explains just 8.5% of data variability. An increase of ruderal and weed species does not occur, numerous meadow taxa preserve their constancy; species dependence on singlemowing stand management was not significant in the given period. Species composition variability is influenced by the relevés; another relatively strong gradient can be inferred (relevés together with time explain more than 60% of the variability). In this respect it can be presumed the substrate composition has a distinct effect, in addition to other factors – exposure, moisture etc. Acknowledgements The article was financially supported by the research grant of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic no. 6046070901 and the „Ředitelství vodních cest České republiky, a.s.“.

An intraspecific classification of Papaver somniferum L. cultivars; 4 basic clusters (groups) with white-seeded cultivars (cluster 1) and darkseeded (clusters 2 – 4) were established. Cluster analysis and the k-means method was applied. An evaluation was made of the similarities and differences between the cultivar clusters on the basis of the capsule’s size and shape, seed coloration intensity in relation to soil conditions. A significant influence of habitat, particularly soil conditions of the experimental localities on the classification of the given clusters of poppy cultivars when applying the hierarchical clustering was not found. Examples of usage are the selection of parent material for breeding and the selection of appropriate varieties for given cultivation conditions. Keywords: Papaver somniferum L., cultivars, traits, morphological variability, classification Introduction The opium poppy (Papaver somniferum L.) is one of the oldest and most cultivated cultural plants with an innumerable amount of cultivars. The reason for the considerable intraspecific variability is, in addition to various cultivation conditions, agricultural practises, etc., the multifunctional use of the species with different long-term breeding aims – the production of pharmaceutically valuable alkaloids (morphine, codeine, etc.), oil and seed for the food industry and use as ornamental plants. The problems of intraspecific chemical taxa (chemovarieties, chemotypes) were particularly dealt with by Tétényi (1997). Certain traits and their values, further used for cultivar evaluation, are used i.e. for establishing the degree of the cultivars’ suitability or other gene resources for inclusion in the breeding processes and they facilitate the selection of the parent materials during breeding, by analogy Hadi (2007). Materials and methods The aim was to evaluate relationships between the monitored cultivars of Papaver somniferum L. in selected traits and establish groups of cultivars similar in characteristic traits, of which certain traits influence production quality and quantity. The study of yield components is generally important (Kozak and Madry, 2006). Sixty cultivars provided by the Czech Oil Plant Genebank in Opava have been assessed, and this for selected traits on the basis of the poppy classifier (Havel et al., 1999). The cultivars were grown on two localities (“Cerveny Ujezd” and “Suchdol” in Central Bohemia) differing in the soil conditions (for their characteristics see Table 1). The values of traits are 1-9; these values represent the data averages achieved from three years of cultivation (2005-2007), always at two experimental localities. It proceeded in accordance with the methodology of agri-biodiversity study according to IS EVIGEZ – The Documentation of Plant Genetic Resources in the Czech Republic (Dotlačil, 2004).</p><p id="Pg110">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 784 For evaluating the similarity between cultivars cluster analysis in the Statistica 8.0 software was applied. For defining the differences between clusters the k-mean method was used. It is a formal intraspecific classification enabling practical usage without having to respect the standpoint of relationship and phylogenetic significance. Table 1.

The cultivars with the highest degree of seed coloration are present in the second cluster (in proportion to the cultivars in clusters 3 and 4). The cultivars in clusters 2 and 3 feature higher values for capsule size, for clusters 1 and 4 values are substantially lower; cluster 4 markedly differs in capsule shape. With regard to the stigma shape values are low for varieties in clusters 2 and 4. Conclusions During a study of intraspecific variability and similarity in Papaver somniferum L. using cluster analysis, 60 cultivars of this species were divided into 4 clusters (groups), predominantly on the basis of capsule traits and seed coloration, these are also significant traits from the viewpoint of production. Soil habitat conditions did not influence the hierarchical classification of poppy cultivars into the given clusters. In the first, exceptional, cluster white-seeded cultivars were included. The second cluster is formed by dark-seeded cultivars with the highest intensity of seed coloration. The darkseeded cultivars of the third cluster do not show any extreme values in the traits used. In the fourth cluster there are dark-seeded varieties with a markedly higher value for capsule shape. The stigma shape was also evaluated as well as other traits of lower importance.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 787 SPRING PHENOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT OF PERENNIAL RYEGRASS AND ITS RESPONSE TO ANNUAL WEATHER CONDITIONS Géza NAGY Department of Rural Development, Faculty of Agroeconomics and Rural Development Debrecen University Abstract: This paper presents some detailed results on spring growth of perennial ryegrass (PRG) based on field investigations between 2004-2007. Extended shoot height, number of leaves and number of dead leaves per shoot were increasing during primary growth. Number of active leaves and sum of active leaf lamina length were first increasing than decreasing. Index of leafiness was decreasing through the investigation periods. The weather conditions were different in experimental years. The spring growth of PRG primarily showed positive response to annual precipitation. Keywords: perennial ryegrass, phenological development, primary growth Introduction Harvestable grass yield during the defoliation of primary growth in spring is constituted basically from the stems (vegetative or generative) and leaves (sheath and lamina). In the case of late utilization, these are supplemented with inflorescence. Spring development of these grass parts on a tiller shows a well known pattern (Robson et al., 1988; Nelson and Moser, 1995). After a tiller has been differentiated and starts to grow, the vegetative stems remain short (consisting of nodes and very short internodes) hidden under the leaves’ sheaths and new leaves are developing consistently from the nodes within certain periods of time (e.g. in 7-10 days at the height of the growing season, Alberta and Sibma, 1968). The leaves which now develop have a limited life span (e.g. 3 weeks) after which they die and are replaced by the new leaves (Robson et al., 1988). This means that the number of active/live leaves on tiller is constant; a typical grass shoot may bear three live leaves per tiller at the height of the growing season (Alberta and Sibma, 1968). This procedure is terminated by the generative development, whereas the vegetative shoot elongates, overgrows the last leaf sheath, and finally differentiates into the reproductive structure, the inflorescence. This overall pattern of spring grass phenological development is well represented in grassland science, but less has been published on the genetically determined species-specific morphological details of it. The phenological development of grasses is also influenced by the environment, including weather conditions. These were the reasons why a basic research programme was conducted at Debrecen University, to quantify some morphological characteristics of spring grass phenological development and to search the effects of weather conditions on them. Five grasses were involved in the field experiment. This paper presents the results of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). Perennial ryegrass is common both in natural as well as in cultivated grasslands in Hungary. It is a species from mezophyl (moderate water) conditions. Morphologically it is a medium size grass; its tiller is less leafy, compared to some other commonly used temperate grasses in the country. Materials and methods Morphological measurements of perennial ryegrass were made under field conditions at the demonstration garden of Debrecen University, Agricultural Centre. Existing</p><p id="Pg114">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 788 ecological conditions on the site: soil structure is high fertility loam (chernozem); average climatic conditions (last forty years) to the middle of June – precipitation 227.1 mm, T-sum of mean daily temperatures 1244.5 °C, sum of sunny hours per day 889.2 hours. Individual shoots of perennial ryegrass (n=30) were randomly selected from pure stand of the cultivar “G 658” and tagged with a plastic ribbon. Leaves on the shoot were numbered upwards from ground level; the plastic ribbon tags were placed between the last dead and the first live leave on the first day of measurement. The measurements were then repeated seven times (altogether 8 measurements per year) in weekly intervals during the primary growth between mid-April and early June. Primary data recorded on each shoot and on each occasion were: extended shoot height/length (ESH), number of dead leaves (NDL) (a leaf was considered dead if more than half of the leaf lamina from the tip was withered), lamina length (LL) of the live leaves (cm). During the evaluation procedure, secondary data were generated from the primary data: number of leaves (NL) per shoot developed to date (pieces), number of dead leaves (NDL) per shoot on each date (pieces), number of active leaves (NAL) per shoot on each date (pieces), sum of active/live leaf lamina (SALL) lengths on the shoot (cm) on each date, index of leafiness (IL) ratio of SALL to ESH, which is used as an indicator for the leafiness of a grass. For the evaluation of the existing weather conditions during the investigation periods of time, the climate index for grass growth (Vinczeffy, 1991) has been calculated. It is a ratio of annual precipitation to annual temperature sum (both accumulated from the 1st of January) expressed as mm C°-1. The annual dynamics of climate index in the experimental years is compared to the average of the last 40 years. Detailed analysis of weather conditions primarily influencing spring grass growth and development refers to the relative availability (%) of the investigated weather conditions based on the last 40 year average. Special attention is paid to annual precipitation, as consistent water supply is more essential in herbage production than in grain production where, only a few periods of time is crucial in phenological development of graminae plants (Németh et al., 2005). Data of the investigation were statistically analyzed by General Linear Model of the SPSS 13.0 for Windows (2004) software. Result and discussion The extended shoot height (ESH), the numbers of leaves per shoot (NL) and dead leaves per shoot (NDL) were increasing through the investigation period and amounted to 53.67 cm, 5.27 pieces and 2.72 pieces, respectively (Table 1). On average, there were 3.58 active/life leaves per shoot during the investigation period of primary growth. However, in the beginning it was increasing to 4.08 leaves per shoot, than was decreasing to 2.55 leaves per shoot by early June. The sum of active leaf lamina length was increasing in the beginning and amounted to 64.76 by the middle of the investigation period. Later on, it was decreasing to 42.87 cm. The index of leafiness was decreasing through the investigation period.</p><p id="Pg115">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 789 In the chronology of emergence of leaves the lamina length (cm) was 12.7 (s=3.5), 16.3 (s=4.4), 18.2 (s=5.5), 16.8 (s=6.8), 15.6 (s=6.0), 13.1 (s=5.6) and 10.1 (s=6.0), for the leaves 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th on the shoots from the ground, respectively. Data show that the successive leaves in the beginning of primary growth were bigger and bigger until leaf size culminated. Later on successive leaves decreased in size. The last leaf (7th) was only 55% the size of the biggest leaf (3rd one). Table 1. Morphological characteristics of perennial ryegrass (2004-2007) during primary growth.

Detailed analysis of climatic conditions, primarily influencing spring grass growth and development showed that annual precipitation had the greatest differences between years (Table 2). The experimental years may be considered as rainy, somewhat rainy, extremely rainy and reasonably dry for 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. Temperature conditions and the sunny hour accumulation were more balanced than rainfall in the experimental years. However, both sum of temperature and sum of sunny hours were remarkably higher in 2007 compared to the other experimental years. Table 2.

In many cases there were significant differences in grass morphology among experimental years. Extended shoot height was remarkably high (51.64 cm) in 2006 and outstandingly depressed (24.57 cm) in 2007 (Table 3). The number of leaves developed was outstandingly high (5.94) and remarkably depressed (3.61) for 2006 and 2007 respectively. The number of active leaves was outstandingly depressed in 2007. Similar results were found for the SALL per shoot as well, having less than half of the four year mean sum of live leaf lamina length in 2007. The favourable and depressed vegetative growth in 2006 (extremely rainy) and 2007 (reasonably dry), respectively, supports the research results of Szász et al.

Recently some others (e.g. Ragályi and Kádár, 2006) also reported wet years as very favourable for herbage production, which is consequently the result of good spring phenological development of grasses.

Trojstva 3, 31000 Osijek, e-mail: lsumanovac@pfos.hr; dkis@pfos.hr; dragok@pfos.hr 2 A student at the Faculty of Agriculture in Osijek, e-mail: ivica.spajic@vu.t-com.hr Abstract: The article gives insight into the dynamics, deposit, and coverage of wheat leaves by spray droplets in case of three different types of TeeJet nozzles and at five different levels of spraying pressure. An average level of coverage was determined (expressed in percentage) as well as an average surface density of droplet traces (1/cm 2 ) both on the upper and lower leaf sides. The quality of the deposit of disintegrated spray was established by catching droplet traces on water sensitive leaves. The highest average level of coverage was achieved in case when TeeJet 11006 nozzle was used (27.247%), and somewhat weaker results were achieved by TeeJet 11004 nozzle (24.755%) and TeeJet 11002 (22.355%). The average coverage of the lower leaf side was not satisfactory since the spray was present only in traces. The achieved coverage of the lower leaf side by TeeJet 11006 and TeeJet 11004 was 6.392% and 3.629% respectively, whereas the poorest result was achieved by TeeJet 11002 and it was 0.272%. Higher spraying levels generally resulted in a better coverage of both upper and lower leaf sides and at the same time it resulted in a higher level of droplet disintegration except for TeeJet 11002 and TeeJet 11004 but only in regard with the lower leaf side. Keywords: spraying pressure, nozzle, disintegration, droplet, sprayer Introduction The main task of a sprayer is to disperse the liquid jet into droplets of a specific size, and to spread them uniformly across the target area. The disintegrated droplets, which are a result of pressurized atomisation, get dispersed, and due to the surface contact they deposit onto the surface. The geometrical form of the surface changes, i.e. the droplet form changes from a sphere into a spherical calotte, (Velisková 2006). The calotte occupies a significantly bigger area compared to a sphere, which means that the coverage of a target area is significantly better. A coverage level depends on the tension area, droplet viscosity, area quality assessment, area inclination, droplet spectre, and similar, (Varga et al. 2007). m Figure 1. Spray droplet as a spherical model and forces acting upon it Droplet deposition speed onto the target area is an important factor for spray application efficiency assessment (pesticide dissolved in water). The following formula is used for z G r m Fu Fw α</p><p id="Pg118">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 792 calculation of the droplet deposition speed and it is a result of the following analysis (Figure 1.). A spray droplet as a spherical model falls through the air due to the action of mass G . The downward movement of the drop is opposed by lift force uF and air resistance force wF . In the beginning, the mass is bigger than both lift force and air resistance, so that the drop moves downwards with acceleration. As the drop speed increases resistance force increases as well, and after a certain time both lift and resistance forces become equal to the drop mass. The result of this is a constant droplet speed from now on. The constant speed can be computed on the base of the forces equilibrium acting on the droplet. wu FFG  (1) or vrgmmg z 6 (2) i.e. vrgrgr z  6 3 4 3 4 33  (3) and after the final arrangement; )( 9 2 2 z gr v    (4) where: v – droplet speed, ms-1; r – droplet diameter, m; g – Earth acceleration, ms-2;  – fluid (spray) dynamic viscosity coefficient=0,00172 Pa·s,;  – spray density, kgm-3; z – air density, kgm -3;  – spraying angle. George Stokes, an Irish mathematician and physicist defined a formula for force resistance which is rvFw 6 based on the assumption that a sphere moves at a low speed in viscous fluid. It is obvious from the formula (4) that the movement speed of disintegrated droplets is in proportion with the mean coefficient value. A smaller diameter implies a smaller speed and a bigger danger of missing the target, i.e. an undesirable deposition, (Ľubomír et al. 2007). Spray disintegration is under the influence of the nozzle orifice as well as the pressure level. Higher pressure disintegrates drops more strongly. The disintegration (dispersion) is stronger at the initially lower spraying pressures. Jets with smaller droplet spectre cover the target area significantly better than bigger droplet jets. The most favourable drop size applied to in plant protection is 100-500 µm, which is due to the fact that smaller drops are inclined to evaporation and drift, whereas bigger ones drip off from target plants causing soil and underground water pollution (Jolánkai et al. 2006). Materials and methods The protection of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) from plant diseases is performed by a RAU-2000 sprayer on the fields of Mednik Company in Županja, Eastern Slavonia, the Republic of Croatia. Alto Combi 42 preparation is used. 0.5 lha-1 is mixed with 200 lha-1of water. The research is performed for the following spraying pressures: 0.1; 0.2; 0.3; 0.4; and 0.5 MPa in relation with the three TeeJet nozzle types (11002, 11004,11006) during wheat spike formation. The experiment is performed at an air temperature of 26°C in semi-cloudy windless weather. The spraying speed is 6-7 kmh-1. Water sensitive paper is used to assess the spray deposition quality. The papers are set</p><p id="Pg119">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 793 apart at a meter’s distance transversally to the sprayer. They are at 60-70 cm above the ground. The average height of wheat is 85cm. Five papers are set horizontally on the upper and lower leaf sides for each repetition of the experiment. The papers are fastened to the wheat leaves by paper clips. The collected data are processed by an image analyser OPTOMAX V equipped by appropriate measuring devices at the Institute for Hop Growing in Žalec, the Republic of Slovenia An average coverage (%) as well as average area impact density are assessed (l/cm2) both for the upper and lower leaf sides of the SANA winter wheat sort. Based on technical reasons no analysis is performed in relation with the water-sensitive papers used for the assessment of the performance of a sprayer operating at 0.5 MPa and applying TeeJet 11004 nozzles as well as TeeJet 11006 nozzles. Namely, experimental papers were inundated so that it was not possible to determine either the coverage or surface density. Results and discussion In Tables 1. and 2. you can find the gathered and processed data; X represents the arithmetic mean value, x is a standard deviation and C.v. (%) represents a variability coefficient. An analysis of the leaf coverage shows a very high variability in case when TeeJet 11002 nozzle is used at different spraying pressures. The coverage level ranges from 12.008% at 0.1 MPa to 43.566% at 0.5 MPa. The variability of the area density of droplet impacts (cm-2) is significantly smaller and ranges from 46.842% at the spraying pressure of 0.2 MPa to 71.082% at 0.4 MPa. The lower leaf side coverage is insignificant. It ranges from 0.121% to 0.400% for TeeJet 11002 nozzle. On the other side the area density of droplet impacts is very variable (cm-2). Table 1.

The last refers to the lower leaf side. TeeJet 11004 and TeeJet 11006 performed a significantly better upper leaf spray coverage than a lower leaf coverage, which proves to be true especially when the spraying pressure is increased. It results in a better disintegration of droplets, which means that they are smaller and based on that fact they leave an increased number of traces per a square centimetre.This finally results in proportional improvement wheat leaf coverage.TeeJet 11006 achieves the best coverage</p><p id="Pg120">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 794 on average during spray application, and it reaches 27.247% for the upper leaf side and 6.392% for the lower leaf side. Somewhat weaker results are achieved by TeeJet 11004 nozzle. In this case the coverage of the upper leaf side is 24.755%. TeeJet 11002 achieves the weakest results and the coverage is 22.355%. The coverage of the upper leaf side ranges within the limits of 2.759% at 0.1MPa (TeeJet 11006) to 43.566% at 0.5 MPa (TeeJet 11002). The upper leaf coverage is unsatisfactory since it ranges from only 0.121% at 0.5 MPa (TeeJet 11002) to 21.258% at 0.4 MPa (TeeJet 11006). The research results are shown in Tables 1. and 2. Table 2.

(%) 19.780 104.86 35.871 111.300 65.767 75.198 Conclusions The obtained results concerning the spray deposition quality applied by a RAU-2000 sprayer at the present pressure levels are satisfactory as far as the upper leaf surface and on the assumption that a constant operating speed of 6-7 kmh-1 is maintained. The achieved coverage for TeeJet 11006 ranges from 2.759% at the spraying pressure of 0.1 MPa to 43.566% at 0.5 MPa for TeeJet 11002 nozzle. The upper leaf coverage at the spraying pressure of 0.4 MPa is significantly lower than expected. This should be paid special attention to in future researches in order to give the reasons for this difference. Pesticide deposition on both leaf sides at all researched pressures and for all types of nozzles is insufficient, which is of great importance for the control of plant diseases. In most cases a disease occurs on lower leaf surfaces, but a disintegrated spray is hardly applied to this side of a leaf, which decreases the phytotherapeutical effect and results in an unsatisfactory protection level.

The effect of PV on water balance of the soil is not known, therefore an experiment was set up in precision weighing lysimeters to determine the evapotranspiration of three sorghum hybrids. We could not figure out a significant transpiration moderating effect of PV, but detected a positive effect on the yields. Furthermore the higher transpiration was accompanied by more effective utilization of water. The water use efficiency index proved to be better in most cases, PV-treated hybrids needed 10 – 30 mm less water to generate 1 kg biomass compared to the untreated controls. Keywords: water balance, lysimeter, Penatakeep-V, water use efficiency Introduction Photosynthetic processes of plants are mainly determined by external factors (Balla et al., 2006), but can be influenced by adding special substances. Pentakeep-V (PV) is a special foliar fertilizer containing 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) which is a natural precursor of chlorophyll and heme in plants, and its application has been associated with increased photosynthetic activity, overall vegetative growth enhancement, increased production of reproductive organs, and enhanced tolerance to salinity and suboptimal temperature exposure in several agronomic, horticultural, and wood species (Bindu Roy and Vivekanandan, 1998; Drazic and Mihailovic, 1998; Wang et al., 2004; Yoshida et al., 2003). ALA has a wide range of utilisation, it has been used as a biodegradable herbicide (Rebeiz et al., 1984), an insecticide (Rebeiz, JUVIK, and Rebeiz, 1988), and as a growth regulator in plants (Watanabe et al., 2000). According to the literature the impact of PV is complex, and the resultant of numerous natural processes is not easily predictable, therefore well established experiments had to be carried out to monitor and quantify water balance of the soil and the plant. High precision weighing lysimeters were applied for that purpose. Materials and methods The effect of PV-treatment on the water balance of the soil and the plants (three sorghum hybrids) was studied by determining the evapotranspiration of the lysimeter units. Three different sorghum hybrids were tested, each of them was with high sugar content: Róna-1, a sugar-type silage hybrid with medium long vegetation period and the highest potential yield; Sucrosorgo, a silage hybrid with characteristic panicle; Cellu, silage hybrid with medium short vegetation period. The date of sowing was 2nd May 2007. The same number of seeds was sown, the proper number of plants per lysimeter unit was set subsequently. The treatments of the experiment are listed in Table 1.</p><p id="Pg122">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 796 Table 1.

The sugar content was intended to be increased by applying further treatments during sugar accumulation of sorghum. Under field conditions the latter applications are highly limited, but under lysimeter circumstances the foliar spraying could be carried out. A standard dose (400 ml PV/ha in 5 000 l/ha water) was applied in the lysimeters (2 m2). The first application was on 17th July 2007, then two further treatments were applied biweekly. Altogether three sprayings were used. The PV treatment was managed by manual spraying in the early morning hours. Irrigation in droughty summer periods was necessary to fulfill the water demand of the crops. All the six lysimeter units got the same amount of input water (natural precipitation + irrigation water) during the investigated period (after 18th July 2007). Results and discussion Evapotranspiration The evapotranspiration from the different lysimeters show the same dynamics, if the whole vegetation period (May - October) is analyzed, though some differences are obvious, as soil water regime is strongly correlated to external factors like natural precipitation (FARKAS et al., 2005) that can not be ensured to be totally even under lysimeter circumstances. The similar tendency in water loss shows that the plants, irrespective of the PV treatment, reacted in the same way to the water inputs and also proves that the external circumstances were the same. In the beginning there was no considerable difference between the water balances of the lysimeter units, which is normal if we take into account that evaporation from the bare soil surface must have been very similar in each lysimeter unit as there was no difference in soil treatment. Before the first PV application (middle of July) the cumulative evapotranspiration values were almost the same in the lysimeter units, which provided a good basis for the further comparison to reveal the effect of the treatment. The first characteristic differences in the evapotranspiration could be detected even in July. To reveal the differences between the water balances due to the PV-treatment a shorter period directly after the treatment was analyzed in details. We expected lower evaporation values in the cases of the treated plants in correspondence with the mechanism described in the introduction part. Figure 1. shows the evapotranspiration values calculated for the twomonth-long period directly after the application of PV. Contrary to the expectations higher evaporation values characterize all the three hybrids treated with PV, the highest</p><p id="Pg123">VII.

Evapotranspiration from the lysimeters after the application of PV Yields On 27th October 2007, the plants were harvested manually from each lysimeter, the total biomass production was weighed and the sugar content was determined by refractrometry, respectively. The yields are summarized in Table 2. Table 2.

Nevertheless in the cases of the other two hybrids significant extra yield due to the PV-treatment can be reported. This extra yield was 26 % in the case of hybrid Róna-1 and almost 40 % in the case of hybrid Sucrosorgo. We could not figure out a transpiration moderating effect of PV, but detected a positive effect on the yields. A question was raised, whether the higher transpiration results in a more effective utilization of water or not. In other words, if the gain in yields exceeds the extra water consumption, the PV-treatment would have a positive effect on plant production. An index was calculated to express the efficiency of water use by dividing the total water input by the total biomass. The water use efficiency values are indicated in Figure 2. The PV-treated hybrids needed 10 – 30 mm less water to generate 1 kg biomass, compared to the untreated controls. The behaviour of Cellu is different again. Due to</p><p id="Pg124">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Water use efficiency of sorghum hybrids in the lysimeter units Conclusions The research of the effect of Pentakeep-V fertilizer on the water balance and yield of three different sorghum hybrids resulted in some remarkable information: contrary to the expectation PV increased transpiration, but this increased transpiration was accompanied with higher yield, higher sugar content and better efficiency of water utilization. These latter three effects are very favourable in plant production. References Balla K. – Bedő Z. – Veisz O.: 2006. Effect of heat and Drought stress on the photosynthetic processes of wheat.

Four treatments, replicated four times, were studied: i) healthy fruit, ii) injured fruit, iii) healthy fruit including one monilinia infected fruit, and iv) injured fruit including one monilinia infected fruit. Our results clearly demonstrated that fruit loss during storage is highly influenced by health and injury status of stored fruits in all storage methods. In both years, the lowest and largest fruit decays occurred under the ULO and traditional storage conditions, respectively. Fruit decay was fully suppressed in ULO storage except in the injured fruit treatments. Under CA and traditional storage conditions, when healthy fruit were stored, fruit decay was significantly lower compared with treatments of injured fruit including one monilinia infected fruit. Half of the fruit decay was caused by M. fructigena in CA and traditional store rooms. Our study was the first to demonstrate that if injured and infected fruits present at the beginning of storage, they greatly reduce the disease suppressing ability of CA store rooms and almost destroy all fruits under traditional store conditions. Large proportions of M. fructigena infections in the treatments also emphasised the essential importance of fruit injury prevention at harvest and during post-harvest manipulating processes. Keywords: fruit rot, Monilinia fructigena, ULO, CA, apple, storage Introduction Among several factors, extreme weather conditions during the season (Várallyay, 2007), severe pathogen infections/abiotic disorders (Horváth et al., 2006, 2007, Moor et al., 2007) and Ca content of the plant (Nagy et al., 2006, 2007; Vágó et al., 2007) are shown to have detrimental influence on long-term storability of agricultural products and affect our ability to suppress postharvest diseases (Barkai-Golan, 1990). Several fungal pathogens cause losses in fruit during storage such as Alternaria spp., Cylindrocarpon heteronema, Gloeosporium spp., Phomopsis mali, Venturia inaequalis, Botrytis cinerea, Penicillium expansum, Phytophthora cactorum, Trichotecium roseum, Rhizophus stolonifer, and Monilinia fructigena (Kállay and Rozsnyai, 2005). Controlled atmospheres (CA) have been demonstrated to reduce fungal growth on fruits (e.g. Sitton and Patterson, 1992; Ahmadi et al., 1999). Tian et al. (2001) found that growth of brown rot, both in artificial media and in detached cherry fruit, declined significantly with increased CO2 concentrations. Storage under atmospheres containing &lt; 1 kPa O2, referred to as ultra-low oxygen (ULO), has been shown to suppress development of pathogenic fungi (Barkai-Golan, 1990; Shellie, 2002) by suppressing pathogen growth and by maintaining resistance of the host to infection. The authors highlighted the importance of low temperature in combination with ULO for optimum suppression of plant pathogens. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of storage methods (CA, ULO and traditional) on the suppression of fruit decay and Monilinia fruit rot on healthy, injured and partly diseased apple fruits during a five-month storage period.</p><p id="Pg126">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 800 Materials and methods A two-year study was conducted in the store rooms of Balker-Coop BV, Ömböly, Hungary as well as in a traditional store room in Ömböly, Hungary. Cultivar Florina was used for the study in 2005 and cv. Idared in 2006. Fruits were stored on 10 November in both years for a duration of five months. Three storage methods were used: CA, ULO, and traditional. Four phytopathological treatments, replicated four times, were studied for the three storage methods: i) 50 healthy fruit, ii) 50 injured fruit, iii) 50 healthy fruit including one monilinia infected fruit, and iv) 50 injured fruit including one monilinia infected fruit. In treatment 2 and 4, fruit injury was artificially prepared, symbolizing mechanical injury during harvest. In treatments 3 and 4, each monilinia infected fruit was placed in the middle of boxes for evaluating the effect of inoculum presence on long-term storage. Incidence of fruit rot decay and brown rot was assessed on a monthly basis (midDecember, mid-January, mid-February and mid-March). Assessments were based on morphological features of the pathogens. Monilinia fruit rot was specifically evaluated within total fruit decays. Significant differences among treatments were analysed by ANOVA using an LSD t-test at P = 0.05 level. Results and discussion Incidence of fruit decay and brown rot in 2005-2006: In this experiment, the lowest and largest fruit decay occurred under the ULO and traditional storage conditions, respectively, in all assessment dates, justifying statement of Barkai-Golan (1990) (Table 1).

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 801 Irrespective to phytopathological treatments, fruit decay was significantly different for the three storage methods (P = 0.05). Fruit decay was fully suppressed in the ULO store room except in the treatments of injured fruit and injured fruit including one monilinia infected fruit. In the CA store room, average fruit loss was between 20 and 35 % by mid-March. In the CA store room, decay incidence on healty fruit was significantly lower compared with treatments of injured fruit including one monilinia infected fruit, and half of the fruit decays were caused by M. fructigena irrespective to phytopathogenic treatments. In the traditional store room, average fruit loss was between 31 and 52 % after a five-month storage period. Again, decay incidence on healthy fruit was significantly lower compared with treatments of injured fruits. In addition, similarly to CA storage conditions, half of the fruit decay was caused by M. fructigena in all phytopathogenic treatments in the traditional store room. Incidence of fruit decay and brown rot in 2006-2007: In 2006-2007, incidence of fruit decay was generally lower on cv. Idared compared to the 2005-2006 experiments. However, effects of sorage methods and phytopathological treatments were similar in both experiments (Table 2). Table 2.

Again, the lowest fruit decay occurred in the ULO and largest in traditional storage treatments in 2006-2007. Only the injured fruits were infected by fruit decay organisms in the ULO store rooms, indicating a high disease suppressing ability of the ULO storage method (Barkai-Golan, 1990). CA storage conditions were not so effectve in suppressing disease incidences as the ULO storage method but the fruit decay reducing effect was still significantly better than in the traditional store treatment (Sitton and</p><p id="Pg128">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 802 Patterson, 1992; Ahmadi et al., 1999). M. fructigena infection accounted for a large proportion of the total decay (31 and 52 %) in both years indicating that the Monilinia genus plays an important role in the loss of stored apple fruit as this genus has strong relationship with the injury status of fruit (Tian et al., 2001; Holb and Scherm, 2007). Traditional store conditions also had weak ability to reduce postharvest decay of apples in both experiments. Conclusions Our results clearly demonstrated that for a long-term storage, only the ULO store method provided a sufficient option in suppressing fungal fruit decay of apple. Our study was the first to demonstrate that if an injured and infected fruit is present already in the beginning of storage, it greatly reduces the disease suppressing ability of CA store rooms and almost destroys all fruits under traditional store condition Large proportions of M. fructigena infection in the treatments also emphasised the essential importance of fruit injury preventions at harvest and during post-harvest manipulating processes.Acknowledgements The study was supported by the Hungarian Scientific Research Fund (OTKA F043503).

Concerning any phytoremediation technologies, the ecotoxicological and phytotoxicological effects of a polluted material is one of the main point, which should be evaluated in order to get precise basis for choosing the best phytoremediation technology. In this study widely accepted phytotoxicological methods such as seed germination, root growth inhibition were carried out. In many cases the polluted site is not appropriate for revegetation of its own properties because of toxic content of heavy metals, pH, and lack of nutrients. Therefore in this study, the effect of mine tailing was assessed by using composted sewage sludge in different ratios, which can buffer the toxic effects of metals to some extent. Often applied indicator plant species, such as cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. convar. Capitata provar. Alba) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa) were applied to examine the phytotoxicological properties of mine tailing – compost mixtures. Based on the results of growth inhibition and seed germination test 5 V/V% compost is recommended to use for phytoremediation due to its buffering effect. Enhanced ratios of compost caused phytotoxicity possibly due to its relatively high bioavailable Cu, Zn content, therefore it is not recommended. Keywords: heavy metal, seed germination, root growth inhibition, lettuce (Lactuca sativa), cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. convar. Capitata provar. Alba) Introduction In case of soil contamination the natural physical, chemical and biological properties of the soil are changing enormously into a bad condition (Simon, 1998, Várallyay, 2007). The concentration of heavy metals exceeds 4,6 g cm-3, and their atomic numbers exceed 20. (Kerényi, 1997). In mine tailings, heavy metals can be found in insoluble precipitation, adsorbed on the surface of organic or inorganic colloids in an exchangeable or specific form (Filep, 2002; Tamás 1994). Soil acidification, since the adsorption capacity of the metals depends on the pH, may increase the amount of mobilized ions which could cause serious damage in the environment by translocation into the water and food chain (Prokisch, 2006; Győri, 2006) The bioassays of phytotoxicity have received great attention by environmental agencies around the world. Heavy metal phytotoxicity is described as the intoxication of living plants by substances present in the growth medium, whenever these substances are taken up and accumulated in plant tissue (Chang et al., 1992). The seed germination and root elongation technique was used because it is an easy and inexpensive screening test. Suggested plant species are cucumber, lettuce, radish, rice, sorghum, mustard, rape, turnip, cress, red clover and wheat varieties (Organization for the Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), 1984); also oats, corn, cabbage, carrots, soybeans, tomatoes, ryegrass, onions, and beans (United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), 1984; United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), 1996).</p><p id="Pg130">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 804 Materials and methods The examined matrixes are two kinds of mine tailings with heavy metal contents from Szárazvölgyi reservoir near to Gyöngyösoroszi (Hungary). The heavy metal content exceeds the limit value of pollution beyond which measures of environmental protection shall be taken (C3) in the case of Zn, Pb, Ni, As. The metal content was measured by FPXRF NITON XL 700. Two kinds of mine tailings (grey and yellow coloured) have different physical-chemical properties. The grey mine tailing is mainly fine-grained (58,18%) and rough-grained sand (33,19%), the yellow mine tailing is mainly finegrained (28,84%) and rough-grained sand (23,47%) and gravel (21,24%) based on the grain-size distribution according to Atterberg’s system. The buffering matrix is composted sewage sludge. This compost fulfill the requirements of the 36/2006 Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development edict, except for Cu content, which exceeds the utilization limit with 28% which may cause inhibition of seed germination in this concentrate. The bulk density of the compost is ρ=0.63. The chosen test plant for seed germination test and root elongation test is lettuce (Lactuca sativa) – Május királya (King of May) and cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. convar. Capitata provar. alba) “giant of June” which has a seed germination time of 10 days in soils (Greene et al. 1989) with natural illumination. Well germinating lettuce and cabbage seeds were placed into plastic pots, containing 1 dm3 soil and mine tailing mixtures. The mine tailing was sieved (&lt;2 mm). The rate of compost in different mine tailings were 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 75, 100 V/V%. Each treatment was conducted with three replicates. The control was chernozem soil. Irrigation was carried out daily, based on the quantity of evaporation. 20 seeds were germinated in one germination pot in a greenhouse at room temperature (20±0,5oC). Nutrients for plants were provided by the compost material. The lengths of the roots were measured on the 10th days. Within the assessment, the 3 lowest value out of 20 seedlings were not taken into account. The average length of the 17 germs was expressed in the percentage of the controls (table 1.). Table 1.Toxicological qualification of the germs (Németh, 1998) Average root length in the percentage of the control Qualification 0 – 5% 6 – 50% 51 – 90% 91 – 120% &gt;120% extremely poisonous poisonous slightly poisonous non-poisonous stimulating Among root lengths results of each treatment Student’s t-test (p&lt;0.05) were used to assess the significance of differences after proving the normal distribution of the root lengths belonging to one treatment, furthermore statistic indexes (mean, deviation, etc) were applied.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 805 Results and discussion Based on seed germination test 5 V/V% compost content is recommended. In this case the compost could buffer obviously the toxicity of mine tailings, but higher level of compost causes no or inhibition effects probably due to its high organic content which may acts as a complexing, chelating agent and makes heavy metals more bioavailable for cultivated plant species (table 2).

Enhanced ratios of compost caused phytotoxicity possibly due to its relatively high bioavailable Cu, Zn content, therefore it is not recommended. Calculating with deep tillage (40cm) and compost bulk density, it can be recommended to utilize 126 t/ha compost on the mine tailing in Gyöngyösoroszi.

However the utilization of sewage sludge in plant production is limited by the sanitary regulations and the heavy metal content. The directives of the EU determine that the biologically treatable wastes – like the sewage sludge - should be used for biogas production, or composting primarily. During the research we installed four different compost recipes with digested sewage sludge, saw dust, wood chips, straw and grass clipping. The aim of the project was to determine the conditions of composting for agricultural utilization, while decreasing the hazardous effects of sewage sludge and produce a stable, final product, which can be used as a fertilizer. Keywords: heavy metal, composting, digested sewage sludge, organic communal wastes Introduction The developing society is more intensively producing a larger amount of sewage sludge compared to the last 10 years. Sewage sludge can be a useful fertilizer for the agriculture. It is a potential nutrient source, grades up the soil structure and the water and heat management of the soil. (Várallyay, 2001; Lukács et al., 2003). However the utilization of sewage sludge in plant production is limited by the sanitary regulations and the heavy metal content. (Tamás, 1990, Simon et al. 2000, Rékási et al. 2006) The directives of the EU determine that the biologically treatable wastes – like the sewage sludge - should be used for biogas production, or composting primarily. The aim of anaerob sewage sludge stabilization is reducing the amount and volume of the sludge, while transform the organic compounds to stabilized materials and produce biogas. The stabilization reduces the pathogen organisms in the sludge too. Both the raw and digested sewage sludge can be used for composting. During composting too main processes take place: the synthesis and degradation. Using the correct raw materials the optimal conditions of composting can be establishing, like C/N ratio, oxygen-balance, moisture content and temperature. The optimal nutrient content and grain distribution should be ensured during the chose of raw materials to determine the microbiological processes. (Petróczki and Késmárki, 2003) The heavy metal content of the raw materials also should be considered. (Kovács, 2006). Technology and recipe variants should be determined with the utilization of digested sewage sludge and other communal organic wastes (e.g. selectively collected communal wastes, wastes of food industry) to produce a stabilized final product. (Fazekas et al., 2000) The aim of this paper to determine the conditions of digested sewage sludge composting for agricultural utilization (raw material compound, nutrient content, degradation temperature, use of inoculum, microelement content).</p><p id="Pg134">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

The spread material was separated to 4 different parts, and the diagonally opposite parts were removed. The remaining parts were mixed again. The process was repeated until we got 3 kg sample for analyzing. In the laboratory moisture content, bulk density, nutrient content, mezo and micro element content were measured. The prism temperature was measured by stack thermometer three times per day at the site. In the composition the we used the inoculum called COFUNA® which meant 2,5-3% of the volume. Results and discussion Because of the difficulties at the beginning of the degradation the temperature was measured on the first week. The temperature changed differently at different compost recipes during the retention time (Figure 1.).</p><p id="Pg135">VII.

Figure 1., Changes in temperature during the residence time The warm intensity of prism 1 was slower than the intensity of prism 2 and 3. In spite of the slow increase, after the 16th day the temperature reached the optimal level and was the same until the end of the degradation. The temperature of prism 2 increased after the installation and kept this level until the end of the degradation. The temperature of prism 3 warmed fast but after the 26th day decreased. The raw material in the 2nd and the 4th recipe were the same, but we did not use inoculum in prism 4. The warming of prism 2 was slower than prism 4, but it held the temperature on the same level until the end of the degradation. The temperature of prism 4 was warmer in the beginning, but after a while it orientated to the temperature of the environment. The acid pH of the sludge changed to neutral during the degradation, which caused by the puffer-effect of the used raw materials. The volume of the raw materials after the mixing was 150-200 m3 at the end of the residence time the volume decreased to 110-130 m3, which meant a 30-40% loss. The length of the prisms decreased with 8-10 m, the height with 0,2-0,4 m and the width with 0,3-0,5 m. The reason of the volume loss is the degradation processes, the change of moisture content, and the loss from screening. The moisture content of the digested sewage sludge decreased with 20-30% until the end of retention time. The organic content changed to 40-45% from 60-65% during the degradation. The grain size was under 25 mm in 100% of the compost.

Cereal Research Communications 810 The concentration of the heavy metals in the complete compost was less than in the sewage sludge due to the other raw materials. The nickel concentration - comparing to the sewage sludge composition – decreased with 57% in average. There was a large change in the cobalt and arsenic concentration too (-32 and -36% in average). Only the lead concentration increased because the raw materials were from municipal parks that were probably affected by air and soil pollution (Table 2.). The N content of the raw material mixing decreased during the degradation but transformed to compounds that easy to uptake. The micro-organisms need a large amount of potassium and magnesium. The K and Mg content of the compost was lower than the expected values in the Hungarian regulation referring qualified compost. The C/N ratio was optimally determined at the beginning of the degradation. During the process it did not changed. For prism 4 (where we did not use inoculum) a larger C/N ratio was implemented to ensure the conditions for the metabolism of the microorganisms. Conclusions The digested sewage sludge can be used effectively for composting. The heavy metal content can be decreased by an optimal mixture of sludge and other organic communal wastes. The chemical parameters and heavy metal content is very various in the sewage sludge so the properties of the sludge should be considered during the determination of the raw material composition of the compost. For example, if the moisture content of the sewage sludge is large, wood chips and saw dust should be used. The nutrient content of the compost is larger than the expected values, and the heavy metal content is lower than the limit values in the referring Hungarian regulations. Composting is a possible way to decrease the amount and the hazardous factors of sewage sludge, while we get a useful, stable final fertilizer product.

The delineation of the infection makes the plant protection more effective and at the same time lowers the quantity of the harmful and costly pesticides. The paper presents the allocation of the cercospora disease with remote sensing techniques. The examinations of the spatial variability of sugar beet leaf area were performed in the frame of a large scale field pest control experiment in the Tedej model area. The effects of different pest control treatments on leaf area - applied on the model area - were studied by processing DAIS 7915 images. Keywords: sugar beet disease, hyperspectral remote sensing, precision agriculture Introduction On the temperate zone the sugar beet is the most important raw material of the sugar production. Due to changes of the market conditions the importance is not the sugar production but its potential in ethanol industry (Lakner et al., 1993; Gyula et al., 2007) The new devices of the precision agriculture enables using new, environmentally sound methods which allow exact dosage of pesticides to cut down the amount of harmful chemicals getting into the food chain (Tóth et al., 2006). Remote sensing technologies provide an important tool to aid site-specific management of crops. Remote sensing has the potential to provide real-time analysis of the attributes of a growing crop that can assist in making timely management decisions that affect the outcome of the current crop. Laudien et al. (2003) analysed sugar beet disease using hyperspectral remote sensing measurements, separating the health and the disease plants. This paper presents the aims and methods of image analysis of hyperspectral data for evaluating the spatial distribution of sugar beet diseases. Materials and methods The investigated area is situated in the eastern part of the Hungarian Great Plain, next to a small rural town called Hajdúnánás. In the model area selected for Cercospora examination in large parcel scale shroud protection experiments, rhizomania tolerant species (Triplex) were used, with same treatment in each parcel. The examination included the analysis of effects of chemicals’ treatment time, treatment number, and different fungicides. For the determination of the Cercospora leaf spots (Cercospora beticola), bonitation were applied in a way, that vegetation were examined in each parcel 250 by 25m, than an average was calculated. DAIS-7915 hyperspectral image was applied for image analysing (Table 1.) that was used evaluating in other environmental protection aspects (Nagy et al., 2007). Table 1.

In the vegetation analysis</p><p id="Pg139">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 813 the plant-stress analysis method the so called red edge position (REP) and the Chlorophyll Absorptions Integral (CAI) are the most commonly used (Smith et al., 2004). For the determination of the Cercospora infection I this case the REP method (Laudien et al., 2003) was used. The green reflectance maximum of the B4 channel (551 nm) from the first derivative of the hyperspectral image curve, the first peak of the NIR REP value from the 780 nm B17 channel was calculated. After the determination of the REP regression was calculated with the values of the infection (Figure 3.) Figure 3. Cercospora leaf spots map and the investigated parcels The R Square (R2 = 0,663) was higher, than in the case of NDVI, dislocation of the red edge position could be observed towards the lower values with the growth of the infection.

Cercospora leaf spots map and the investigated parcels (n=14).</p><p id="Pg140">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 814 Conclusions The spatial pattern of each treatment was examined by principal component analysis using the values representing the variability of vegetation as the principal component. The results show different inside some of the parcels that support the Cercospora leaf spots map. Based on the regression analysis it could be concluded that each NIR channel is suitable for the estimation of leaf area changes, although MIR and TIR range is less sensible to vegetation changes. In the course of calculations NDVI, REP values were obtained from pre-processing and compared to values of leaf contamination/infestation. The highest regression rates could be estimated from the iteration model (R2 =0,731, p&lt;0,05) calculated from the 1,668 μm range that can be used making a detailed Cercospora leaf spots map.

In the present study the plant-available ammonium-lactate (AL)-soluble phosphorus amounts not removed by the test plants winter wheat (w. wheat) and maize and accumulated in the soil as a long-term effect of 32 years' NPK fertilization were investigated in some selected treatments of the trials. The soil acidity had the highest effect on the phosphorus accumulation at the different experimental sites of the network. In calcareous soils the accumulation was much more considerable than in the strongly acid experimental soils. The weather in Hungary showing an inclination towards drought has an unfavorable influence on the P utilization of plants, therefore a P fertilizer dose as much as 100-120 kg P2O5 ha -1 yr -1 proved to be high in some cases. Keywords: long-term field experiments, soil P content, P accumulation, soil acidity, calcareous soils Introduction The increasing mineral fertilizer use in Hungary beginning in the 60s of the last century multiplied the yields, first of all the yields of grain crops, and yields reached a level outstanding in comparison with the international average as well. However, the signs of the effects indicative of the deterioration of soil conditions could also be recognized besides the yield increasing effect. Several reports strongly point out the harmful environmental impacts of the intensive fertilizer use in the western countries. The global climate change also demands to minimize the environmental damages resulting from agricultural activities. In domestic aspects, Várallyay's (2007) review about the VAHAVA Report on the research into the climatic changes in Hungary gives a useful survey about the agricultural effects and responses. Isermann (1993) attributes significant environmental damages to the increase of C, N S and P concentrations in the soil. In the last few decades the N and P loads of arable lands and pastures increased through the application of animal manures and slurries due to the intensive animal husbandry to such an extent that it already causes a water and soil pollution of intolerable degree, first of all in the Benelux countries. The phosphorus compounds of organic manures are leached from the soil similarly to nitrogen. On the contrary, the P compounds of mineral fertilizers are not mobile in the soil, consequently there is no fear of their loss trough leaching. Water pollution can happen through surface runoff and erosion of the top soil layer of sloping areas. Mineral phosphate compounds of fertilizers are converted in the soil depending on its acidity and Ca carbonate content. In neutral and alkaline soils, the monocalcium phosphate of P fertilizers are converted to dicalcium- and tricalciumphosphate in time. In acid soils iron and aluminium ions, which can be present in the soil solution, precipitate the phosphate ions of fertilizers as insoluble Fe and Al phosphates (Kádár, et al., 1984). The immobilization of fertilizer phosphates depends on the soil bulk density or weight, clay</p><p id="Pg142">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 816 minerals and P concentration of the soil. Kádár et al. (1984) and Füleky (1983) investigated the phosphorus status and Németh (2006) and Izsáki (2007) the movement of fertilizer-N in the home soils thoroughly. Precipitation significantly influences the phosphorus accumulation in the soil, P uptake by the plants, and in consequence yield levels as well. The loads on different soil types due to fertilizer application with increasing NPK doses can exactly be detected only in long-term field experiments. Materials and methods The network of the National Long-term Fertilization Trials in Hungary was established at 26 different sites representing the different agro-ecological regions of the country in 1967. The trials were initiated by an expert committee under the direction of G. Láng. Due to the lack of financial sources, the trials have been continued, however, only at nine sites (Table 1). These small-plot field experiments have a uniform experimental plan with different four-year crop rotations, with four replicates. This paper includes only trial B-17, which was started with crop rotation w. wheat-maize-maize-w. wheat. One unfertilized control and 19 fertilizer treatments were uniformly applied with increasing NPK rates at all sites in every experimental year. In this study we investigated only the effect of no-fertilization (N0P0K0, coded: 000), NPK treatments without and with P fertilization combined with the lowest N and K fertilizer doses, as well as an NPK treatment with the highest N and K doses (Table 2). In the first 20 years, N1 and N4 rates were 50 and 200 kg ha-l, respectively. After the 20th experimental year N doses were changed to N1 = 100 and N4 = 250 kg ha-1, respectively. Phosphorus doses coded 1, 2 and 3 were 50, 100 and 150 kg P2O5 ha -1in the first twenty years and 60, 120 and 180 kg P2O5 ha -1after the 20th year, respectively. For both crops, 100 kg K2O ha -1 was applied (K1 dose) in the first twenty years, while 100 and 200 kg K2O ha -l for wheat and maize, respectively, the 21st year onwards. Potassium dose K2 was 150 and 200 kg K2O ha -1 for wheat and maize, respectively. In the 32nd experimental year, phosphorus accumulation in the soil was studied. Soil samples were taken from the ploughed soil layer (0-20 cm) of each plots. Plant available, AL-extractable P2O5 concentrations (Egner-Rhiem-Domingo, 1960), 0.05 M EDTA+0.1M KCl-soluble Al concentrations by atomic absorption method and pH (KCl) values in the soil were determined.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 817 Results and discussion Three of the experimental sites (NH, IR, MO) have calcareous soil. In these soils a considerable phosphorus accumulation could be detected (Table 2). In the soils of KE, HB and BI a soil acidification of different degree has begun. At one out of these experimental sites, at KE, the P content of the soil also shows a considerable increase. The accumulation in the experimental soils at HB and BI, showing acidification as well, has a much slighter extent. In the strongly acid experimental soils at KA, KO and PU the accumulation is of different degree. Table 2.

The results show that the phosphorus accumulation at the different sites depends on the soil acidity, and the presence of calcium carbonate is determining in this respect. The Al concentration also depends on the soil acidity: A remarkable solubility difference can be detected between the Al content of the calcareous and acid soils. Such a definite relationship can not be detected in case of phosphorus accumulation varying with the fertilizer treatments in the different experimental soils.

Cereal Research Communications 818 Conclusions The 32-year long-term effect of P fertilization with yearly doses of 50(60), 100(120) and 150(180) kg P2O5 ha -1 in combination with N and K treatments in the experimental sites of the Hungarian Long-term Fertilization Trials manifested itself as follows. 1. Even the lowest P dose improved the P supply of all experimental soils, while the original degree of P supply practically showed no changes on the unfertilized control plots at the nine experimental sites of the network. That caused a poorer yield formation depending on the season. 2. Our P accumulation results at NH, IR and MO sites confirmed that calcium phosphate compounds dominate and considerably accumulate on calcareous soils, because of their calcium carbonate content. At the experimental sites with acid soils, the detected P accumulation of lesser extent can be attributed to the formation of insoluble aluminum and iron phosphates from the phosphorus compounds of the P fertilizer, which can cause P deficiency. Phosphorus deficiency can, therefore, be decreased with liming, which increases the pH value of the soil. References Egner, H, - Rhiem, H. - Domingo, W.R.: 1960.

Simona DUŠKOVÁ 1 – Václav HEJNÁK 1 – Jaroslava MARTINKOVÁ 1 – Zdislava ERNESTOVÁ 1 – Jana KRIŽKOVÁ 1 1 Department of Botany and Plant Physiology, Faculty of Agrobiology, Food and Natural Resources, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague, Kamýcká 129, 165 21 Prague 6 - Suchdol, Czech Republic, e-mail: hejnak@af.czu.cz Abstract: On the leaves of two modern varieties (Jersey and Malz) and one old variety (Valtický) of spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), the stress responses caused by soil drought were studied. The plants were cultivated at 70 % θMKK. The stress was brought about by interrupting irrigation at the beginning of shooting (31.DC) and by gradual drying-up of the substrate for a period of 10 days down to 30 % θMKK. At selected ontogenetic stages (13.DC, 15.DC, 21.DC, 31.DC, 33.DC, 39.DC, 51.DC and 61.DC) relative water content (RWC) and the gas exchange parameters (gs, A and E) were measured, and these data were used to calculate the water use efficiency (WUE). It was found out that WUE can be used to evaluate the drought-resistance of varieties of spring barley. Although with respect to RWC &gt; 80 %, only a mild stress occurred, the examined genotypes manifested contrast responses to the decrement of water in the substrate with respect to WUE. It can be said that the Malz variety can manage water well and has low sensitivity; the Valtický variety can manage water relatively well and is moderately sensitive, while the Jersey variety is characterised by inferior water management and increased sensitivity to lack of water. Keywords: spring barley, drought, water stress, stomatal conductivity, photosynthesis rate, transpiration rate Introduction Drought is the most important factor of external environment limiting the production capabilities of spring barley. Lack of water in soil results in disruption of water balance in plants and in discordance between water intake and the need for water during ontogenesis. This induces numerous stress-related physiological responses at various structural levels of a plant. The stress caused by drought in spring barley speeds up the ageing of leaves and reduces the photosynthesis rate (Hejnák and Križková, 2004), significantly limits longitudinal growth, translocation of assimilates into generative organs and the overall production of dry matter (Hejnák, 2003); it reduces and slows down reception and use of soil nitrogen and nitrogen from fertilizers (15N) (Hejnák and Ernestová, 2007); it reduces the quantity of the energy accumulated in plants through photosynthesis, particularly in leaf blades, which significantly limits production performance of the stressed plants in the next stage of ontogenesis when assimilates are translocated and thereby energy is transferred from leaves to generative organs (Križková and Hejnák, 2007); it limits the production of yield elements – the number and weight of cereal grains in spikes (Martinková et al., 2007). The presented publication examines the stress responses to drought at the level of the physiology of the leaves of spring barley, using the gas exchange parameters (stomatal conductivity, photosynthesis rate and transpiration rate) and the water use efficiency (WUE) calculated according to these data. Materials and methods The stress responses caused by soil drought were studied on the leaves of two modern malting varieties (Jersey and Malz) and one old malting variety (Valtický) of spring</p><p id="Pg146">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 820 barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). The experiment was taking place in a greenhouse, with the photoperiod being 16 hours of light / 8 hours of darkness and with the temperature being set at 25 °C during the day and at 18 °C at night. The plants were cultivated as sand cultures, irrigated by Knop’s nutrient solution once every three days and by distilled water on the other days. The containers were arranged according to the Latin square method. The plants were cultivated in two groups – a control group and a stress (experimental) group. The control group: the substrate moisture content was at 70 % of the maximum capillary water capacity (θMKK) throughout the experiment. The stress group: at the beginning of the shooting stage (31.DC), irrigation was interrupted; through gradual drying-up the substrate moisture was reduced from 70 % to 30 % θMKK; after 10 days, the substrate moisture was again increased to 70 % θMKK by resuming the irrigation. At selected ontogenetic stages (13.DC, 15.DC, 21.DC, 31.DC, 33.DC, 39.DC, 51.DC and 61.DC) the following physiological parameters were always measured on the second leaf from the top: relative water content (RWC) was measured gravimetrically, the gas exchange parameters (gs, A and E) were measured by means of an open gasometrical system, using the infrared gas analyzer LCpro+ (ADC Bio Scientific Ltd., Hoddesdon, UK). The measuring process was repeated twice. When the gas exchange parameters were measured, temperature in the assimilation chamber was set at 25 °C, level of irradiance at 850 µmol m-2 s-1, air humidity at 50 % and concentration of CO2 350 µmol mol-1. The parameters identified in the measuring process were used to determine the water use efficiency (WUE) – as the dependence of photosynthesis on stomatal conductivity (A/gs) and as the relation of photosynthesis to transpiration (A/E). Results and discussion The comparison of the RWC levels identified during the experiment in the stress and control groups shows that after interruption of irrigation, moderate decrease occurred in all varieties in comparison with the control group but even so, the RWC level did not drop below 80 %. It is possible to infer from this that the water stress was moderate (more details in Dušková and Hejnák, 2007). 0,00 10,00 20,00 30,00 40,00 50,00 60,00 70,00 80,00 90,00 13.DC 15.DC 21.DC 31.DC 31.DC 33.DC 39.DC 51.DC 61.DC A /g s WUE: A/gs - MALZ control stress 0,00 1,00 2,00 3,00 4,00 5,00 6,00 7,00 8,00 13.DC 15.DC 21.DC 31.DC 31.DC 33.DC 39.DC 51.DC 61.DC A /E WUE: A/E - MALZ stress control Figure 1.

The Jersey variety: Dependence of photosynthesis on stomatal conductivity – WUE = A/gs (left) and the relation of photosynthesis to transpiration – WUE = A/E (right). Figure 1 (the Malz variety) shows considerable increase of water use efficiency (WUE) in the stressed group. This is related to the fact that the photosynthesis rate decreased less and more slowly than the stomatal conductivity (the A/gs ratio) and the transpiration rate (the A/E ratio) in the plants affected by the interrupted irrigation. The closing of stomata and the related decrease of stomatal conductivity in water stress thus influence the transpiration rate more than the photosynthesis rate. It can also be said that simultaneously with the decrease of stomatal conductivity, the transpiration rate decreases at the same pace but the photosynthesis rate decreases more slowly. From the identified WUE levels, only stomatal limitation of photosynthesis can be inferred. The left part of Figure 2 (the Valtický variety) shows first a slight decrease of WUE at the beginning of the effect of water stress on the plants, which indicates a greater decrease of A as compared with gs. However, in a later period, WUE starts to increase slightly and reaches even higher levels than in the control non-stressed plants. On the whole, it can be said that changes in levels of A are in fairly close correlation to the changes of gs levels. The levels stated in the right part of Figure 2 also indicate a shortterm decrease of water use efficiency in the stressed plants. The intake of CO2, or in other words the photosynthesis rate, was limited more than the output of H2O, or in</p><p id="Pg148">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 822 other words the transpiration rate. Even in the Valtický variety, stomatal limitation of the photosynthetic process can be inferred, that is, without the basic photosynthetic structures being affected and disrupted. Figure 3 shows that in the case of the Jersey variety, the decrease of WUE in plants affected by water stress is of more permanent nature. Decrease of levels was identified in examining both the A/gs ratio and the A/E ratio. This means that under the influence of water stress, the photosynthesis rate decreased more than stomatal conductivity and transpiration rate. If the decrease of A is faster and greater than the speed at which stomata are closed and consequently than the decrease of stomatal conductivity, we can deduce that photosynthesis can also be limited otherwise than by stomata. The effect of water stress on the photosynthetic apparatus of plants can be significant. A moderate water stress can limit the regeneration of ribulose 1,5-biphosphate (Escalona et al., 1999). This can be regarded as one of the possible causes of the decrease of the photosynthesis rate and consequently the decrease of WUE in the Jersey variety. Conclusions If water use efficiency (WUE) is used as the criterion of drought-resistance of plants, it can be said that the examined genotypes of spring barley showed a contrast response to moderate water stress caused by soil drought: Malz – increased WUE, only stomatal limitation of photosynthesis; Valtický – only moderately decreased WUE, only stomatal limitation of photosynthesis; Jersey – decreased WUE, stomatal as well as probably non-stomatal limitation of photosynthesis. As concerns examination of the differences among the varieties regarding their sensitivity to water stress, the following can be said for the individual varieties: Malz – good water management, low sensitivity; Valtický – basically good water management, moderately sensitive; Jersey – deteriorated water management, sensitive.

Anjou 245, exposed to gradual drying-up of soil retained a high RWC (84 – 89 %), virtually at the level of non-stressed plants, for 3 through 12 days (3 – 12 d) after interruption of irrigation. However, stomatal limitation of the photosynthesis rate (PN) and transpiration rate (E) occurred in them. Growth regulators applied on the plants stressed by drought at the point of time after 3 days significantly influenced the parameters of the exchange of gases between the maize leaves and the surrounding environment. When 100 M abscisic acid (ABA) was sprayed on a leaf, this resulted, throughout the experiment, by tighter closing of stomata and by lower levels of PN and E in comparison with the stressed plants, not treated by growth regulator. The decrease of the gas exchange parameters was greatest shortly after the application (at the points of time 3.1 and 4 d) when the differences were highly provably in comparison with the untreated plants. When benzylaminopurine (BAP) in the concentration of 1 M was sprayed on the maize plants, this resulted in steady, but statistically improvably higher levels of PN. On the contrary, E was lower than in the stressed plants, not treated by growth regulators, and it was lower to a statistically provable extent during the period of 6 – 12 d. When a stronger concentration of BAP amounting to 10 µM was used, PN increased to a statistically highly provable extent in comparison with the untreated plants but it did not reach the level of PN in the control plants that were irrigated throughout the experiment. The levels of E identified by measuring were hovering around the levels identified in the stressed untreated plants. Keywords: maize, drought, water stress, photosynthesis rate, transpiration rate, abscisic acid, benzylaminopurine Introduction Sustainable development of the cultivation eco-systems for maize is only possible if the stability of the circulation of water, nutrients and energy in the whole system consisting of soil, plant and atmosphere is ensured. In order to monitor and accurately examine these circulations as well as to assess the effect of individual agronomical measures and environmental factors on the photosynthetic productivity of maize plants, long-term field experiments are highly suitable (Dóka and Pepó, 2007; Hoffmann et al., 2007; Nótás et al., 2007; Vad et al., 2007). Much attention is also paid to the effect of growth regulators on the translocation of nutrients (Tůma et al., 2007) and on the regulation of water management of plants (Hnilička et al., 2007). Physiological responses at the level of stomata, which regulate the output of water as well as intake of CO2, are very important to ensure good balance between water intake through roots and water output through leaves. In a number of agricultural crops, including maize, the effect of abscisic acid (ABA) on the closing of stomata and the effect of cytokinins on their opening was proved (Stuchlíková et al., 2007). The purpose of the presented work was to find out how ABA and cytokinin benzylaminopurine (BAP) in C4 maize plants influence the gas exchange parameters if they are applied as late as during a deepening soil drought. Materials and methods Young maize plants (Zea mays L., cv. Anjou 245) were used for the experiment. The experiments were taking place in a physiological greenhouse under controlled</p><p id="Pg150">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 824 conditions: with 14-hour photoperiod (14 hours of light / 10 hours of darkness), at temperature within the range of 20 – 25 °C during the day and 16 – 20 °C at night and with relative air humidity being within the range of 50 – 60 %. In containers filled with soil, 5 plants were cultivated on an area of 0.05 m2. The soil moisture was maintained at the level of 60 – 70 % of the maximum capillary water capacity. Plants 8 weeks old were divided into 5 groups with 4 repetitions: 1. control group – plants irrigated throughout the experiment; 2. plants stressed by drought – complete interruption of irrigation; 3. plants stressed by drought + application of 100 µM ABA 3 days after interruption of irrigation; 4. plants stressed by drought + 3 days after interruption of irrigation, 1 µM BAP was applied; 5. plants stressed by drought + 3 days after interruption of irrigation, 10 µM BAP was applied. The growth regulators (BAP and ABA) were applied by a spray device on the leaves of the plants. The concentration levels BAP 1 M and 10 M and ABA 100 M were used in the application dose, corresponding to 100 cm3 m-2 when converted. The Citovett wetting agent was used. The responses of the plants to changes of the moisture content in soil were identified by measuring the relative water content (RWC) in leaves and the photosynthesis rate (PN) and the transpiration rate (E). PN and E were identified in intact leaves by means of a commercial portable gasometrical infrared analyser LCA-4 (ADC Bio Scientific Ltd., Hoddesdon, UK) with a leaf chamber LC4/PLC4BT-1/E. 3 leaves were measured in each experimental container. PN and E were first established 3 days after interruption of irrigation; then they were measured just before the application of growth regulators (3 d), then 2 hours after application (3.1 d) and then 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 days after interruption of irrigation (4 – 12 d). In the assimilation chamber, the temperature during the measuring process was 25 °C, the level of irradiance was 750 µmol m-2 s-1, air humidity was 50 % and the concentration of CO2 was 350 µmol mol -1. The statistical evaluation was carried out by means of a variance analysis at α = 0.05 in the Statistica computer software, version 6.1 CZ, the ANOVA module. The mean values measured in three series of experiments have been published. Results and discussion The obtained levels of PN and E are shown in Figures 1 and 2 in the form of pie charts. The dark area represents PN and E observed with open stomata in the control group 1. The plants in groups 2 – 5 exposed to gradual drying-up of soil substrate retained RWC &gt; 80 % (84 through 89 %) throughout the experiment, which was not statistically different from the levels observed in the control group. However, in spite of the high RWC, the gas exchange parameters were limited on the drying-up soil. This is a typical symptom of the effect of a moderate water stress. As the light area shows in Figures 1 and 2, we observed a statistically significant decrease of the photosynthesis and transpiration rates in the plants stressed by drought in group 2 in comparison with the non-stressed group. We believe that similarly like in C3 plants, the decrease of PN can be the result of a decrease of the internal pressure of CO2 in the leaves as a consequence of the partial closing of stomata during soil drought. The reduced diffusion of CO2 through cell walls, membranes, cytoplasm and shells of chloroplasts leads to a decrease of the concentration of CO2 in the chloroplasts of mesophyll cells (for example, Flexas et al., 2004).</p><p id="Pg151">VII.

Our experimental results have also proved the effect of an exogenously supplied ABA on the regulation of the exchange of gases between the leaves of maize and the surrounding environment. ABA applied on the leaves of plants (group 3) resulted in greater partial closing of stomata and lower levels of PN and E in comparison with the untreated group 2 throughout the experiment. The plants responded most strongly by decreasing the gas exchange parameters shortly after the application (3.1 and 4 d) when the differences in comparison with group 2 were statistically highly provable. However, the levels observed at later times showed the diminishing of the effect of exogenous ABA and therefore the differences between groups 2 and 3 were on the border of statistical provability. BAP was applied on the plants in two concentrations. The 1 µM concentration of BAP (group 4) was manifested in the maize plants by permanent but statistically improvably higher levels of PN and, conversely, lower level of E in comparison with the untreated group 2. As concerned transpiration, the differences in the period 6 – 12 d were statistically provable. When a stronger 10 µM concentration of BAP was used (group 5), statistically highly provable increase of PN occurred in comparison with group 2; however, the level of the control group 1, which was being irrigated throughout the experiment, was not reached. The observed levels of E were hovering around the levels observed in group 2 not treated by growth regulator. The explanation of the different effects of the two concentrations of BAP can probably be found in their different effect on the natural level of phytohormones in leaves. It is possible that the 1 µM concentration of BAP was too low and that at such a low level its effect on the opening of stomata could not manifest itself in the plants growing in a situation of a deepening</p><p id="Pg152">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 826 deficit of water in soil. However, the tendency to open stomata, which its application brought about, could result in stimulation of increased production of ABA, which caused stronger partial closing of stomata and decrease of transpiration. Conversely, the 10 µM concentration of BAP was probably sufficient to limit the effect of ABA on the closing of stomata in the stressed plants or to partially inhibit the production of ABA prompted by the water stress. The moderate opening of stomata then resulted in increased transport of CO2 to leaves and a higher PN. We can also regard this as a proof that during a moderate water stress, the photosynthesis rate was limited only by stomata. Conclusions The results confirmed that growth regulators supplied to C4 maize plants growing on a drying-up soil during a water stress can effectively influence its photosynthetic performance and water management capability. Reducing the gas exchange parameters by applying ABA can generally improve the ability of plants to survive an unfavourable drought because reduction of the amount of water evaporated through transpiration enables the plant to economise water, to adapt gradually as concerns osmosis and to redistribute water in its organs. Another aspect that apparently also matters are the interactions of exogenously supplied substances and the natural levels of hormones in plants, as shown by the findings obtained after application of BAP. A lower dose ultimately supported the ability of maize plants to economise water and improved water use efficiency (WUE). A higher dose supported improvement of WUE by increasing the photosynthesis rate. Acknowledgements This work has been prepared by help of the research plan MSM 6046070901.

However, stomatal limitation of gas exchanges occurred in them and the photosynthesis rate (PN) and transpiration rate (E) decreased. The abscisic acid (ABA) applied 72 hours after interruption of irrigation improved the plants‘ water management on the drying-up soil – the plants initially responded to a leaf spray with the concentration of 100 M by even more closing their stomata and by decreasing PN and E. This slowed down the progression of water stress in the treated plants and, later on, this resulted in higher levels of PN and E and in their better ratio (PN/E) than in untreated plants. Benzylaminopurine (BAP) applied by spraying in the concentration of 1 M or 10 M resulted in a highly significant increase of PN and E as early as 2 hours after application. The effect remained even after 24 hours and 72 hours. When applied on the stressed plants in combination with growth regulators, BAP was reducing, especially during the initial stages, the effect of ABA on the closing of stomata and the decrease of the parameters PN and E. At other times of the measuring process, this effect was not so distinct. Keywords: sugar beet, drought, water stress, photosynthesis rate, transpiration rate, abscisic acid, benzylaminopurine Introduction One of the main driving forces for motion of water in the system consisting of soil + plant + atmosphere is transpiration. In a drying-up soil, the balance of water in a plant is disrupted – the water output through transpiration is higher than water intake through roots – and the plant starts to manifest the symptoms of a water stress. The primary manifestation is that stomata are closed in order to reduce transpiration and prevent water loss. Nevertheless, this measure also reduces the photosynthesis rate and consequently the productivity of the plants. This is why it is important to get to know the physiological mechanisms, which plants use to regulate the parameters of gas exchange when suffering from a water deficit. The role of abscisic acid (ABA) as the chemical signal indicating drought has been proved in a number of agricultural crops in recent years. Attention is also paid to the role of cytokinins in this process (for example: Pospíšilová and Baťková, 2004; Stuchlíková et al., 2007; Šafránková et al. 2007). The objective of the work was to use ABA and cytokinin BAP to obtain new knowledge about the responses of C3 beet plants to a deepening water deficit in soil, specifically the knowledge of the parameters of gas exchange in leaves. Materials and methods Young sugar beet plants (Beta vulgaris L., ssp. vulgaris var. altissima Döll), the Elán variety, were used for the experiment. The experiments were taking place in a physiological greenhouse under controlled conditions with 14-hours photo-period (14 hours of light / 10 hours of darkness), at a temperature range between 20 and 25 °C during the day / between 16 and 20 °C at night and the relative air humidity was between 50 and 60 %. In the containers filled with soil, 5 plants were cultivated on an</p><p id="Pg154">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 828 area of 0.05 m2. The humidity of the soil was maintained at 60 – 70 % of the maximum capillary water capacity. Plants 8 weeks old (with 5 or 6 leaves) were divided into 6 different groups subjected to the following conditions; all this was repeated 4 times: 1. control group – plants irrigated throughout the experiment; 2. plants stressed by drought – complete termination of irrigation; 3. plants stressed by drought + 3 days after interruption of irrigation, 100 µM of ABA was applied; 4. plants stressed by drought + 3 days after interruption of irrigation, 1 µM of BAP was applied; 5. plants stressed by drought + 3 days after interruption of irrigation, 10 µM of BAP was applied; 6. plants stressed by drought + 3 days after interruption of irrigation, 10 µM of BAP + 100 µM of ABA were applied. Growth regulators (benzylaminopurine and abscisic acid, including their combinations) were applied by a spray device on the leaves of the plants. 1 M and 10 M concentrations of benzylaminopurine (BAP) were used and a 100 M concentration of abscisic acid (ABA) was used in the application dose, corresponding to 100 cm3 m-2. The Citovett wetting agent was used. The responses of the plants to changes of the moisture content in soil were continuously monitored for all different groups at the level of physiology of leaves by gravimetrically identifying the relative water content (RWC) in leaves and by gasometrically measuring the photosynthesis rate (PN) and the transpiration rate (E). PN and E were identified in intact leaves by means of a commercial portable gasometrical infrared analyser LCA-4 (ADC Bio Scientific Ltd., Hoddesdon, UK) with a leaf chamber LC4/PLC4BT-1/E. 3 leaves were measured in each experimental container. PN and E were first established 3 days after interruption of irrigation; then they were measured just before the application of growth regulators, and then 2 hours, 24 hours and 72 hours after the application. In the assimilation chamber, the temperature during the measuring process was 25 °C, the level of irradiance was 750 µmol m-2 s-1, air humidity was 50 % and the concentration of CO2 was 350 µmol mol -1. The statistical evaluation was carried out by means of a variance analysis at α = 0.05 in the Statistica computer software, version 6.1 CZ, the ANOVA module. The mean values measured in three series of experiments have been published. Results and discussion The levels of PN and E obtained in the measuring process are shown in Figures 1 and 2. In the control group 1, the mean values of PN 11.23 ± 0.47 µmol CO2 m -2 s-1 and E 2.11 ± 0.13 mmol H2O m -2 s-1 were identified. The plants in groups 2 – 6, exposed to the gradual drying-up of the soil substrate, retained RWC &gt; 80 % throughout the experiment. Therefore it is possible to speak about a moderate water stress, which is usually manifested by discontinuance of longitudinal growth, increase of the ABA concentration in leaves and in the partial closing of stomata. In our experiments, in the plants stressed by drought, we identified statistically provable decrease of the photosynthesis and transpiration rates in group 2 as compared to the non-stressed controlled group. It is the consequence of the partial closing of stomata during the effect of soil drought, resulting in a decrease of the internal pressure of CO2 in leaves. In group 3, the plants first responded to the supplied ABA in a short period of time after the application (2 hours) by closing more stomata and by a significant decrease of the levels of PN and E as compared with the untreated group 2. However, the partial closing of stomata probably slowed down the progress of water stress in the treated plants.</p><p id="Pg155">VII.

This was why as early as 24 hours later, higher levels of PN as well as higher levels of E were identified than in the plants cultivated during a water stress without any application of growth regulators. Still higher levels were identified 72 hours after the application of ABA. The photosynthesis rate came close to the levels identified in the plants in the control non-stressed group. The transpiration rate was even higher than in the non-stressed control group. BAP applied to plants, to which water supply was interrupted (groups 4 and 5) resulted, over a short period of 72 hours, in a significant increase of PN and E of the leaves of sugar beet. In comparison with the plants untreated by BAP, statistically significantly higher levels of PN and E were identified as early as 2 hours and then 24 hours after its application. The photosynthesis and transpiration levels identified were even higher than in the non-stressed plants in the control group. The only exception was the level of E identified 2 hours after application of 10 µM BAP. The effect of BAP on increase of PN and E persisted even when measuring was carried out 72 hours after the application. Stuchlíková et al. (2007) identified a similar effect of BAP on an increase of PN and E in experiments with maize. However, the loss of water related to the higher transpiration can result in faster deterioration of water stress in plants treated in this way (a fast decrease of RWC) in the further stage of dehydration. Where growth regulators were applied on the stressed plants together (group 6), BAP decreased, especially during the initial stages (up to 24 hours), the effect of ABA on the closing of stomata and on the decrease of parameters PN and E. The identified levels of gas exchange were higher than when ABA alone was applied but these levels were lower than when BAP alone was applied. The highest effect was observed as early as 2 hours after application. At other points of time in the measuring process, this effect was not so apparent and the differences between the different groups, to which growth regulators were applied, were levelling out.

Conclusions Our experimental results also proved the effect of exogenously supplied ABA on the regulation of gas exchange between the beet leaves and the surrounding environment. The tighter closing of stomata caused by the exogenous ABA reduced transpiration and slowed down development of water stress, that is, its effect on the photosynthesis rate of the plants. With this, it improved water management of the plants expressed by the PN/E ratio. The exogenous BAP significantly increased PN and E of the sugar beet leaves. From a long-term point of view, however, there is a risk that higher transpiration could speed up drainage of water and deteriorate the water stress.

A significant prevalence of nitrophilous species at pastures grazed by cows and of species undemanding for nutrients on long-term unmanaged lands. The influence of management on species diversity was not demonstrated. Keywords: mowing, grazing, species diversity, phytoindicators Introduction The formation and development of the grassland ecosystems in forest vegetation zones is conditioned by long-term human farming activities. Anthropogenic effects, such as agriculture and forest clearing triggered the formation of semi-natural grassland vegetation, the existence of which is dependent on these influences, thus without regular management taking place there is a gradual degradation of these communities. Grasslands of mountainous and sub-mountainous areas fill particular non-productive and landscape functions. Therefore they would not be rated among production areas from the point of view of agricultural production, but primarily in terms of natural resources protection and formation. The most frequent method of management on grasslands is mowing and on pastures grazing, during this the elimination of the aboveground biomass takes place. These methods represent a different stress situation for the vegetation; however the grassland communities feature a certain measure of adaptability to this type of stress. This is primarily species diversity, which enables alternative dominance and manifests itself through alternative usage of the production components in the stand. Further possibilities are energy reserves in the underground or basal parts of the plant and their utilisation after mowing to cover the carbohydrate deficit (Novák et al., 2007). Wet and wetland meadows were used for roughage in former times, currently they are unattractive from the economic point of view in comparison with mesophilous fodder meadows. These meadows rapidly degrade in the absence of regular management, several competitive strong species prevail in them and species richness decreases very rapidly. This process proceeds faster in comparison with mesophilous and xerophilous meadows. The principal factors which endanger the existence of permanent grasslands are the following: land set aside, changes in the site conditions (a drop in the water column, eutrophication) and landscape fragmentation (Lindborg and Eriksson, 2004). An absence of regular management strengthens above-ground competition, which as a result leads to high-herbaceous species prevailing (Schwinnig and Weiner, 1998). At unmanaged meadows old vegetation remains, which provides considerably worse conditions for the germination of seeds and the survival of seedlings of a number of species. The nutrient supply from the surrounding agricultural landscape supports an expansion of species from nutrient rich communities (Wahlman and</p><p id="Pg158">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 832 Milberg, 2002). The aim of this study was to evaluate the species composition of permanent grasslands that are mown (mesophilous meadow), grazed (cow grazing, mesophilous meadow) and land set-aside (wetland and xerophilous meadows) expressed by means of the Ellenberg´s indicators and related to the soil conditions as well. Materials and methods In 2005 – 2007 the botanical field research inventoried plant species at five localities in the Protected Landscape Area Sumava (in the neighbourhood of the city Kasperske Hory, Czech Republic). Locality No. 1 represented a regularly (twice a year) mown type of mesophilous grassland, with a predominantly southern exposure (centre Lo. 49°8'19.826"N, 13°32'55.95"E). Locality No. 2 is pasture, ungrazed strips left by the cows are mown; the pasture is additionally sown here and there, southern exposure (49°8'12.447"N, 13°32'45.998"E). Localities No. 3 and No. 4 represent an unmanaged type of grassland, 15 years without any human intervention or grazing (Lo. 3 - 49°8'28.801"N, 13°32'22.912"E, Lo. 4 - 49°8'30.198"N, 13°32'5.397"E). Locality No. 5 is unmanaged wetland meadow (49°8'12.325"N, 13°33'2.092"E). Table 1 presents soil analyses featuring particular localities. For particular species classical floristic inventory methods were used and selected Ellenberg´s indicator values for an approximation of the site characteristics: moisture, reaction (soil pH), nitrogen (in effect a general indicator of soil fertility) (Hill et al., 1999). Statistical data analysis was carried out using the ordination method (correspondence analysis; CA) (Lepš and Šmilauer, 2003). The species nomenclature is in accordance with Kubát et al. (2002).

In the middle part of the diagram a line of species which prefer a wet to waterlogged environment is visible. They are in particular species from the unmanaged locality No. 5 (35 taxa determined in total), where the alliance Calthion and partially Molinion predominated. The species of higher growth growing here (for example Scirpus sylvaticus, Cirsium oleraceum and Filipendula ulmaria) and an absence of management has, among other things, is connected with the highest humus content within the framework of the localities studied. In the left part of the diagram (Fig. 1)</p><p id="Pg159">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 833 there is a closed cluster of species which predominantly occur in periodically waterlogged biotopes and have no large requirements on nutrient supply. These are especially species from locality No. 1 (e.g. Holcus lanatus and Anthoxanthum odoratum) and localities No. 3 and No. 4 (e.g. Briza media, Luzula campestris and Nardus stricta). Regular mowing, medium nutrient supply and a high proportion of humus at locality No. 1 probably closely correlate with the high species diversity (55 taxa in total). Localities No. 3 and No. 4, even though there was a long-term absence of sheep grazing (more than 15 years), showed very high species diversity (52 taxa in total, resp. 84 taxa), it corresponds with the results of Novák et al. (2007) and Antal et al. (2007), which did not show species dependency on management. The low nutrient and humus supply of the soils at localities No. 3 and No. 4 is also related to the species of “low growth” dominance, whose competitiveness is generally small (e.g. Euphrasia rostkoviana, Potentilla erecta and Thymus pulegioides). Species which preferentially occur at sites with higher tropic potential (e.g. Urtica dioica and Rumex obtusifolius) can be found on the right half of Fig. 1. These are species that dominate in pasture (locality No. II), where periodic cow grazing takes place (35 species in total). The nitrogen indicators, which are present here, correspond with the very high nutrient supply at this locality (see Table 1). -0.2 0.8 -0 .6 1 .0 Aeg poda Alop pra Cala epig Cx brizo Cirs oleCrep mol Cx rost Fica ver Fili ulm Gali apa Junc effu Lath pra Lych flo Myosaqua Poa triv Scir syl Cardamar Agrocani Rumeobtu Urti diomoisture reaction (soil pH) nitrogen Anth odo Briz med Cx panic Cx pall Desc ces Fest rubr Holc lan Junc con Luzu cam Nard str Pote ere Ranu acr Rume ace Figure 1.

Conclusions An evaluation of the species composition of the managed and unmanaged permanent grasslands in 2005 - 2007. The influence of grazing on the presence of nitrophilous species in this period was found to be significant, but it does not explain the stand’s low species composition. An absence of management and the prevailing competitive hygrophytes and hydrophytes are related to the low species diversity as well as high proportion of humus. The occurrence of species preferring a low nutrient supply in soils was significant at long-term unmanaged permanent grasslands. The high variability of the species composition at these localities is influenced by the prevalence of less competitive species. It can be assumed that substrate heterogeneity has a considerable effect as do other factors (exposure, moisture, etc.).

The variability of monitored traits between sugar beet and weed beet depending on the soil qualities was not significant. The height of weed beet was significantly lower, in BBCH 11-12 (25 mm ± 9.81), growing from the glomerules affected by the total herbicides, for this variant field germination was also found to be significantly the lowest. 5 weeks after their emergence weed beets started to create stems, which were also probably influenced by favourable temperature conditions. The plant height, leaf length and width for sugar beet were greater in comparison with weed beet, though statistically insignificant. A considerable of weed beet variability in the monitored traits is apparently genetically conditioned. Keywords: Beta vulgaris, BBCH, herbicide Roundup, soil group Introduction Sugar beet is a biennial plant, in the first year the vegetation creates a beetroot and leaf rosette. Generally in the second year the vegetation grows from the core axis of the main stem and from buds in the axil the secondary stems and the generative organs on them. Sugar beet’s leaves usually have strong petioles and a very sinuate lamina, the flower generally is not generated sooner than the second vegetative year. The names “weed beet” are used for the annuals Beta vulgaris L., these are primary or introgressive hybrids between the cultivated beet (Beta vulgaris ssp. vulgaris L.) and the wild sea beet (Beta vulgaris ssp. maritima (L.) THELL.) (Bartsch and Ellstrand, 1999). The presence of weed beet in a field reduces the yield (Ungai and Gyori, 2006; Tóth, 2007) and causes problems during harvesting and sugar extraction (Sester et al., 2006). Weed beet has some distinctive physiological and morphological traits, though they may not be manifested at the same time. Its significant phenotype traits are as follows: one-year life cycle, multigermicity, root branching in older plants and plagiotropic growth, etc. (e.g. Skalický et al., 2007). Inter-row occurrence is common but depends on the agriculture practices during the growing period. The aim of this trial has been to find, if morphological differences between sugar beet and weed beet may be influenced by a site’s soil conditions. Further a comparison of selected morphological traits in early development phases with regard to possibilities for early detection. Materials and methods To achieve the defined aim a pot trial was established. The experimental plants were sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L. ssp. vulgaris), variety Merak (Varianta A) and weed beet,</p><p id="Pg162">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 836 the glomerules of which have been taken in 2005 from plots in various sugar beet areas in the Czech Republic. Variant B was weed beet glomerules in BBCH 65-69, affected by the total herbicide (Roundup Klasik, 480 g l-1 Glyphosate-IPA) and glomerules taken away in the BBCH 89 phase, variant C was weed beet glomerules unaffected by total herbicides and taken away at the same BBCH phase. Variant D was weed beet glomerules taken away in BBCH 75 phase. Each of the variants was cultivated in three repetitions on 4 soils which were taken away from the locations where the weed beet’s glomerules were sampled. For their characteristics see Table 1. Polyethylene buckets with perforated bottoms were used as trial pots which were placed in plates with a foam-rubber circular underlay. 8 000 g of the earth in a fresh condition were weighed out and put into the pots and 10 glomerules uniformly sown depending on the variant. The experiment was established in May 2006 at the experimental site in Prague-Suchdol (272 m above sea-level), plants were grown under standard lighting and temperature conditions, in the course of the trial the soil moisture was kept at 60 – 70 % of the maximum capillary water capacity. According to BBCH scale for sugar beet (Meier et al., 1993) during the beet’s phenological development particular morphological traits were monitored. For each variant the number of plants emerging, total plant height and leaf length and width were monitored. Attention was paid to other traits, such as “bolting”, florescence for weed beet and the effect of particular soils on total growth. The measurements were primarily carried out in two BBCH phases: 11-12 (first pair of leaves unfolded), 14-15 (4 and more leaves unfolded). The BBCH phase 51 (main stem elongation begins) and 60 (first flowers opening) were further monitored for weed beet. A statistical evaluation was carried out by the analysis of variance with α = 0.05 in the software Statistica (8.0), using the ANOVA module. Table 1.

For example the significantly lowest plant height was demonstrated by weed beet in soil I., for which development was probably affected by the total herbicide treatment (var. B). For the soil variants IV., plant heights were the second highest, although the soil characteristics (see Table 1) do not seem so favourable for sugar beet growing (light loamy-sandy soil). In other cases the values were very variable. This also concerned the morphological trait – leaf width. This trait, in the BBCH phase, was very variable for all variants, on every soil. Therefore it can be inferred that this trait is distinctively influenced by plant emergence rate and the quantity of incident solar radiation depending on the number of plants in the pots. Table 3.

Cereal Research Communications 838 The evaluated trait – plant height was also very variable, the same causes as for morphological trait – leaf width, can be deduced. Significantly lower values for the measured morphological traits for weed beet (var. B) are noticeable on all soils in BBCH 14-15 (see Table 3). It confirms the probable strong effect of the total herbicide Roundap on the growth and development of these plants. In contrast sugar beet achieves the highest parameters in all monitored traits on each soil (var. A). Significant differences in the plant height and leaf length were found on the majority of soils for other weed beet variants (var. C and D). Between individual weed beet’s variants (var. B – D) significant differences were found in the development rate. Var. C entered the fastest BBCH 51 (“bolting”) on all soils, and this was 5 weeks after plant emergence, other variants (B and D) did not do so until 8 weeks. A generally high stem generation rate was probably caused by favourable temperatures in the course of the trial. Weed beet plants entered the BBCH 60 within 30 days after starting BBCH 51. Conclusions Sugar beet and weed beet’s morphological variability in early developmental phases was not significantly dependent on soil properties. On all the monitored soils weed beet had better field germination than sugar beet. The exception was weed beet growing from glomerules affected by the total herbicide. The results point to weed beets having marked variability within the monitored traits, which seems to be genetically fixed. Higher plant height, leaf length and width were established for sugar beet plants in comparison with weed beet plants, but they were not significant.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 839 CHEMICAL COMPOSITION AND NUTRITIVE VALUE OF SELECTED GRASSES DURING PRIMARY GROWTH IN 2004 János LAZÁNYI - Károly PETŐ – Géza NAGY Department of Rural Development, Faculty of Agronomy and Rural Development, Debrecen University Abstract: This paper presents the results of the chemical composition and nutritive value of five temperate grasses during primary growth in 2004. Pure stands of established grass species/cultivars were sampled 5 times with 3 replicates. Both species and sampling dates had significant influences on forage quality. More leafy grasses, Hungarian brome grass (HBG), reed canary-grass (RCG) and timothy (TY) had higher crude protein contents than perennial ryegrass (PRG) and tall fescue (TF). As regards net energy contents of forage, a rank of TF, RCG, HBG, PRG and TY, with increasing energy content was found. Later sampling dates tended to have lower quality forage. Practical considerations from the results: the importance of “early bite” in grazing systems, PRG and TY deserve most attention in high quality forage systems. Keywords: chemical composition, nutritive value, temperate grasses, primary growth Introduction Chemical composition and consequently the nutritive value of forage primarily depend on sward composition and stage of growth. This letter is most obvious during primary growth, where phenological stages of grass may differ to great extend with time. A schematic pattern of the changes in the chemical composition of grasses according to stage of maturity (spring development) for primary growth was summarized by Gill et al. (1989) reporting that protein, lipid and minerals are decreasing, while sugars, hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin are increasing with time. All these changes result in decreasing dry matter digestibility during primary growth and this reduces the nutritive value of the forage. All these characteristics have to be considered in the strategic timing of forage harvest during the first cut. In a field experiment, spring phenological development and nutritive value of five temperate grasses were examined. The grasses and cultivars were: perennial ryegrass (PRG) Lolium perenne L. (G 658), tall fescue (TF) Festuca arundinacea Schreb. (Szarvasi 56), Hungarian bromegrass (HBG) Bromus inermis Leyss. (Keszthelyi 51), reed canary-grass (RCG) Phalaroides arundinacea L. (Keszthelyi 52) and timothy (TY) Phleum pratense L. (Szarvasi 60). Perennial ryegrass is considered the premier quality forage grass species worldwide. Tall fescue has high nutritive value, but its quality is only intermediate at first harvest due to advanced maturity. Hungarian brome-grass is of good quality and primarily suited to get good live weight gains of cattle or sheep. Reed canary-grass is of good quality only at an early stage of development, later it declines with increasing cell wall components. Timothy’s quality is comparable to that of the previously described grasses except for PRG. However, its feeding value may be superior to them, cut at the same dates, as it is a late grass, and it is less advanced in maturity or phenology in springtime (Barnes et al., 1995). Materials and methods Grass samples of the five species were taken from pure stands grown in the demonstration garden of Debrecen University, Agricultural Centre.

Grass samples, in 2004, were taken five times with 3 replicates, during primary growth, between late April and mid June, with approximately 2 weeks intervals. Chemical composition and nutritive value of grass samples were determined by ISO compatible Hungarian Standard methods: sample treating – MSZ ISO 6498/1991), water content – MSZ ISO 6496 (1993), nitrogen content (Kjeldahl method) –MSZ 6830-4 (1981), crude ash –MSZ ISO 5984 (1992), sugar – MSZ 6830-26 (1987). The experiment was analysed as a randomised complete block with three replicates with five grass species and five sampling dates. Data of the investigation were statistically analyzed by General Linear Model of the SPSS 13.0 for Windows (2004) software. Result and discussion Grass species, sampling dates and their interaction were found to have significant influences on chemical composition and nutritive value of forage (Table 1). The level of significance was relatively high both for grass species and sampling dates during primary growth. The interaction of grass species and sampling dates had relatively lower level significant influences on forage quality in a few cases (ash content, net energy for growth and N-free extract of forage).

Crude protein (CP) content was relatively low in tall fescue and in perennial ryegrass during primary growth, only 148.0 and 156.4 g kg-1 DM respectively. Hungarian brome grass, reed canary grass and timothy had higher CP contents, 160.0, 163.4 and 161.0 g kg-1 DM, respectively. Differences are much higher than the value of standard error of differences between means. Differences may be due to the different structure of the grasses. These three grasses, having higher CP contents, are known as leafy grasses at any stage of spring phenological development (Nagy, 2007). The rank of grasses regarding crude fibre (CF) content of forage were TY, PRG, RCG, HBG and IF, having 274.3, 287.1, 288.2, 305.4 and 310.0 g kg-1 DM, respectively.

Grasses had ash content between 87.7 and 91.7 g kg-1 DM, except for timothy (85.5 g kg-1 ash in DM). This latter may be attributed to late spring development nature of this grass. In net energy (NE) contents of the investigated grasses, a rank of TF, RCG, HBG, PRG and TY, with increasing energy content, was found. Surprisingly, timothy was able to surpass perennial ryegrass as regards the most important nutritive value parameters of forage quality. This result may obviously be explained by the leafy and late spring development character of TY. Table 2.

Mean CP content was consistently decreasing during primary growth. The high CP content in late April dropped to approximately one thirds of that by mid June, 255.8 g kg-1 DM to 91.0 g kg-1 DM, respectively. Crude fibre contents were increasing till the beginning of June than a slight decease was observed by mid June. CF contents for sampling dates 1-5 were 222.6, 295.5, 308.3, 325.7 than 312.8 g kg-1 DM, respectively. Crude fat contents showed just the opposite trend. It was decreasing until early June, 29.0, 27.4, 24.8 and 14.5 g kg-1 DM for the first 4 sampling dates, respectively, and then increased to 19.2 g kg-1 DM. Crude ash contents were decreasing with time during primary growth. Changes in net energy contents followed the pattern of crude fat. From late April until early June, energy contents were decreasing, and then a slight increase in the energy content of forage was observed. Changes in metabolizable protein (both Nitrogen- and energy dependent ones) followed the pattern of crude protein changes in the forage. This slight increase in crude fat and energy contents, as well as the slight decrease in crude fibre content between early and mid June, may probably be explained by the development of new shoots in the sward. In 2004, from late May/early June, the experimental area got substantial rainfall compared to the last 40 years average (Nagy, 2007). Rainy weather conditions probably increased the rate of new shoots (nutritious</p><p id="Pg168">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 842 young tissue) in the herbage mass. This hypothesis may be confirmed or rejected by the evaluation of research data from 2005 and 2006. Table 3.

The efficiency of grassland management in Hungary can be improved by targeted species and cultivar use as well as by strategic timing of grass harvest in Spring. The results of this research may have practical considerations in two different management aspects. Chemical composition changes with time underline the importance of “early bite” in grazing systems (traditionally grazing starts on 24th of April in Hungary). Differences among species can be utilized in composing seed mixtures for high quality forage. Perennial ryegrass and timothy require special attention in this respect. These species performed very well in two recent experiments (Nagy, 2006) as well, producing high yield potential under very similar ecological conditions.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 843 EFFECT OF A SOIL MICROBE PREPARATION (EM-1) ON THE DAMAGE OF WESTERN CORN ROOTWORM (DIABROTICA VIRGIFERA VIRGIFERA LECONTE) Tamás NÉMETH – Miklós NÁDASY – Zsolt MARCZALI – Ferenc SIMON – Erzsébet Ihárosi NÁDASYNÉ 1 University of Pannonia Georgikon Faculty of Agriculture, Keszthely, Hungary Abstract: Last years the Western Corn Rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, has become one of the most significant pests in Hungary. Since its appearance in 1992 at Belgrad the insect has conquered almost the whole country and nowadays causes economical damage. The main point of sustainable development is the reduction of chemicals use in agriculture, which is possible with EM-1. Keywords: western corn rootworm, soil microbe preparation Introduction Western Corn Rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte) is one of the most harmful pests in Hungary nowadays. It made a name for itself due to its larvae, which can cause severe economic damages in the Hungarian maize fields (Keszthelyi 2006). Some insects (e.g. aphids, thrips) play important role in the epidemiology of plant viruses (Horváth et al. 2006a, b, 2007; Takács et al. 2006a, b). Weed species also cause yield losses in the maize crop (Kazinczi et al. 2006, 2007). Maize growers have to try several well-known protective methods to avoid the financial consequences of these heavy detriments. Above all methods to ease the larval damage is the application of soil disinfectants simultaneously sprayed while sowing and use of pelletized seeds. Unfortunately, neither of them can provide a complete solution for this problem, but both operations attempt to remedy the harm with environment loading materials. Having the important role of useful organisms in straitened ecological circumstances of single-crop systems in sight, we approached the question from another aspect. We tried to find a solution without exterminating the larvae, but with strengthen the maize plants’ regenerative and compensative ability. As an option, we picked a bacterial preparation EM-1 from the Sym-Bio-Tech Ltd. Our aim was to study whether the bacterium culture in the soil will be able to reach an increased yield and root regeneration in a such way, that the plants will be capable of compensating the larval damage and making the maize growing profitable. EM-1 is a bacterium preparation made in Japan, which contains more than 80 microorganism species. Most of the contained cultures are strictly undercover. EM-1 shifts the content of the polydisperse soil matrix towards the nutrient mobilization and better water management owing to its so called biological colloid system therefore it can provide more favourable conditions for plants to develop roots with increased weight and surface. Injecting this preparation into the soil regularly, we can create special circumstances, dominated by fermentative bacteria. Fermentation in contrast with putrescence, goes with appearance of strong acting antioxidants and other life friendly materials (enzymes, vitamins, amino acids, bioactive agents etc.) and not with toxic metabolic products (ammonia, N20, methane etc.). Therethrough, these microorganisms with the help of</p><p id="Pg170">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 844 fermentation can play a positive role in the development of plants and in the improvement of soil fertility. Materials and methods Our studies were carried out on field experiments in 2006 and 2007. In both years we made a comparison between two experimental plots, treated with EM-1 bacterium preparation and Force 1,5 G soil disinfectant. The dimensions of experimental plots were 152 m x 18 m in both localities and years. The two consecutive studies were fulfilled at Fadd in 2006 and at Hetes in 2007 on two single-crop system maize fields. The sowing were performed in an average point of time, at the end of April. The bacterium preparation was sprayed with a fieldland sparger and incorporated instantly before sowing. We used 33 l/ha EM-1 as a dose in both years. Force 1,5 G soil disinfectant was dispersed with seed-drill equipped with micro granule spreading adapters at the time of sowing. As a dose we used the widely spread 15 kg/ha in both years. The treatments were evaluated by two methods and on the basis of the evaluations we were able to make comparisons. Our first task was to study the degree of damaged roots, with the help of the generally accepted IOWA (Hills-Peters) scale on early summer. In all treatments, we randomly selected 10 maize plants to perform the evaluation, so we collected 40 sample plants per plots. Sample plants with a 20 x 20 x 20 cm soil square were picked out with a spade and then transported to a central depot, where the soil was removed vigilantly with water jet, to preserve the original state of the roots. Our second aim was to compare the yields of each experimental plot at the autumnal harvest. The results were confronted with the costs of chemical protection against the WCR. Results and discussion On the basis of results (Table 1.) we did not find any significant difference between EM-1 and Force 1,5 G treated plots in 2006. Thus, EM-1 was able to increase the regeneration of roots and we could not find statistical difference between the degrees of damage. However, in 2007 we can see a significant difference to the advantage of Force 1,5 G. We have to remark that in spite of the drastic soil disinfectant the damage was quite serious. The answer for this strange contradiction is hidden in the weather conditions of the two years (Figure 1.), especially in the distribution of precipitation during the growing-season (Figure 2.). Table 1. Comparison among root damages in 2006 and 2007 IOWA degrees Treatment 2006 2007 EM-1, average 2,55 4,1 Force 1,5 G, average 2,4 3,54</p><p id="Pg171">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 845 Figure 1. Annual distribution of precipitation in 2006 at Szekszárd and in 2007 at Hetes Figure 2. Distribution of precipitation in the growing-seasons of 2006 at Szekszárd and in 2007 at Hetes There is only a small difference between the years considering the whole amount of precipitation, and what is more we measured 30 mm more rain on the experimental plots. However, there was considerable difference among the distribution of precipitation. In 2006 there dropped down a high quantity of rain before sowing, so the soil was humid as required to provide favourable conditions to the sprouting corns. In 2007 unfortunately, there was not any precipitation in April. The bacterium preparation, which can produce 5 thousand million colony-forming units per cm3, was spread under that arid condition. It follows from the foregoing that the loss of germs was considerable and their advantageous effect to the soil colloids and to the plants early development was diminished. Owing to the higher temperature than usual during that period, the eggs of WCR received the effective thermal amount about two weeks earlier. The larvae had to feed on more undeveloped roots and for this reason they caused a serious damage on the roots of young plants. The soil disinfectant was able to take its effect on the target organism long before, so its effectiveness was satisfactory. Afterwards, the precipitation in May of 2007 was quite petty, but in May and June of 2006 dropped down more than 60 mm rain providing necessary water for the explosive growth and regeneration of maize roots. There dropped down more precipitation in 2006 during the maturing of corns, so the yield was better at the end of the growing season (Table 2.).</p><p id="Pg172">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Comparison of yields in 2006 and 2007 Treatment 2006 2007 EM-1 9,9 t/ha 5,4 t/ha Force 1,5 G 8,4 t/ha 4,9 t/ha The yield of the examined years cannot be compared exactly because of the quite different soil and nutrient conditions of the experimental plots. Our results tried to shed light only on the differences among the treatments. Conclusions Our studies show that using of various technologies under different ecological circumstances can bring us the expected results. We can establish that EM-1 is able to compensate the damage of WCR larvae if the habitat is in possession of good water and nutrient management. Moreover, after the first use of EM-1 we do not have to give the whole dose because it can be trisected in consecutive years and so its cost approaches only the third part of Force 1,5 G disinfectants’. All these can provide a cheaper and more environment friendly technology in long run maize growing. It is a solemn question, how the results would have varied if 2007 had not so extreme drought...

These chemicals can also change processes of nutrient transformation, so can indirectly effect on mineral nutrition of plants. The aim of our experiment was to study the effect of different preemergence herbicides on mineral nutrition of two sunflower hybrids in a pot experiment. Experiment was set up in greenhouse. We examined changes of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and calcium content of Itanol and Rigasol PR sunflower hybrids. The applied herbicides were Afalon Dispersion (linuron), Galigan 240 EC (oxyfluorfen), Pledge 50 WP (flumioxazin), Proponit 720 EC (propisochlor) and Stomp 330 (pendimethalin) with the highest field suggested doses. Plants were grown for four weeks. Thereafter fresh- and dry weights, as well as N-, P-, K- and Ca concentration of shoot samples were measured. We established that fertilizers increased biomass and nutrient content of shoots in every treatment. Herbicides decreased fresh- and dry weight of four weeks age sunflower shoots in different extent, moreover influenced mineral nutrition of two hybrids unequally. Keywords: biomass-production, nutrient content, pot experiment, soil herbicides, sunflower Introduction Weed control has a determining role in sunflower growing, because 4-6 weeks old plants are very sensitive to weed competition. Early weed competition may cause 50% yield loss. The weed control can be made by agrotechnical and mechanical methods or by herbicides. The farmers use chemical weed control mainly as presowing and preemergence herbicide treatments (Hunyadi et al. 2000, Benécsné 2002), we have hardly any licensed post-emergence herbicides in sunflower culture. Choosing the herbicide and their dose the characteristics of the soil has to be taken into consideration, mainly humus- and clay content of the soil. Pesticides can appear in soil-plant-food chain (Várallyay 2006). Soil herbicides influence directly the emergence and physiological processes of cultivated plants and weeds. These chemicals effected on micro biotic nutrient transformation in the soil hereby influence the mineral nutrition of cultivated plants (Fischl 1994, Jolánkai et al. 2006, Németh 2006). The effect of herbicides onto the soil processes has been investigated by a number of scientists, and it has been found that the different herbicides hinder or stimulate the different processes of the soil. It has been proved that pendimethalin hinder the first step of the nitrification (Goring – Laskowski 1982). The sunflower is very sensitive to herbicide residues, the testing for this character is especially important. Similar to other cultivated plants, herbicide sensitivity of the various hybrids and varieties strongly differs (Nádasy et al. 2000, Dobozy – Lehoczky 2002, Lehoczky et al. 2002, Nádasy – Germann 2003). The aim of our experiment was to study the effect of different preemergence herbicides on mineral nutrition of two sunflower hybrids in a pot experiment.</p><p id="Pg174">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 848 Materials and methods The pot experiment was set up in greenhouse on May 2004; using 13.6 cm diameter pots filled with 1 kg air dried soil in each pot, in four replications. The experimental soil was clay lassivated brown forest soil from Keszthely. Two early ripening sunflower hybrids has been used: Rigasol PR and Itanol. We grew 6 plants per pot. 100 mg N, 100 mg P and 200 mg K was given in each of the pots in form of ammonium nitrate, superphosphate, and in potassium chloride (40%), except for the absolute controls without fertilizer and herbicide. The effects of five preemergence herbicides on the nutrient content of the plants were studied. They belong to five chemical groups and have different action mechanism (Table 1). They were sprayed onto the soil surface a day prior to sowing, in the highest dose recommended for field application converted to the pot size. The herbicide free control and absolute control pots were not treated. We had 56 pots altogether. Watering were given to meet 60% of water capacity, which is optimal for the sunflower. The plants were allowed to grow for 4 weeks then harvested and measured the fresh- and dry weight of the shoots. The N-content were measured by Kjeldahl method, of the P-content with spectrophotometer and the potassium and calcium content by flamephotometer. The statistical analysis has been made using the SPSS computer program, two-factorial variance analysis.

The fresh weight of plants without fertilizer was the lowest and the herbicide treatments more or less decreased also the fresh weights. The hybrids reacted differently to the herbicide treatments. All herbicides used decreased the fresh weight of Itanol, mostly the photosynthesis-hindering Afalon Dispersion, and least the Pledge 50 WP, followed by Galigan 240 EC and Stomp 330. The fresh weight of Rigasol PR non-significantly increased the Pledge 50 WP and Stomp 330, the lowest fresh weight has been found at the Afalon Dispersion treatment also in case of this hybrid. The tendency of changes in dry weight was the same than that of fresh weights. The Afalon Dispersion treatment considerably decreased also dry weight of the plants.</p><p id="Pg175">VII.

Interesting, that at both hybrid the herbicide Afalon Dispersion caused the highest N-concentration, probably because there was the lowest biomass production. In case of the hybrid Itanol the Stomp 330, while in case of Rigasol PR the Proponit 840 EC decreased mainly the N-content, but its value was statistically not significant. Tab. 2 shows that the hybrid Rigasol PR utilized P better. As an effect, P-concentration of the shoots were statistically increased. It was surprising, that in the herbicide treatments the P-content did not decrease in relation to the NPK controls, moreover in case of Rigasol PR it increased significantly in the treatments with Afalon Dispersion and Galigan 240 EC. The highest P-content has been found using Afalon Dispersion, the lowest at Stomp 330, similar to that of N-concentrations. Table 2.

The K-concentration of the shoots increased 30% in relation to the non-fertilized absolute control plants. The herbicide treatments did not influence significantly the K-content, except for Afalon Dispersion. In our experiment the Ca supply was the same for all pots, still we have found, that the Ca-content of control plants was much lower. It can be explained by the fact, that the increasing NPK nutrient supply inspires the uptake of other nutrients, too, since the plant wants keeping the desirable rate of nutrients in the plant parts. The Caconcentration of the shoots was about the half of that of K. The fertilized Rigasol PR</p><p id="Pg176">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 850 had a higher Ca concentration than of Itanol, and this situation did not change significantly by the herbicide treatment. Conclusions Based on the results we can establish that the fertilizers increased the biomass production and the nutrient uptake of sunflower hybrids in all herbicide treatments. The respond of Rigasol was stronger than that of Itanol. The herbicides influenced mainly the fresh- and dry mass production. All herbicide treatment significantly decreased the fresh weight of Itanol. Both hybrids produced the lowest fresh and dry weight in the Afalon Dispersion treatment. The macronutrient concentration was in a good correlation with the biomass production. The nutrient concentration of the plants with higher dry matter production was lower as a consequence of dilution of the nutrients. With this can be explained that in the Stomp 330 treatment the N-, P-, K-concentration of shoots of more sensitive Itanol decreased, while in case of Afalon Dispersion increased. The Galigan 240 EC, Pledge 50 WP and Proponit 720 EC had a lower influence on the macronutrient content. That means, that the hybrids decreased mainly the biomass production because of the herbicide treatments, and this influenced also the macronutrient concentrations. References Benécsné, B.G. 2002.

The bacteria destroy the host by subduing its immunosystem and it cause host mortality within 36-48 hours. The nematodes feed and reproduce for several generations inside the cadaver. In this study experimental results are reported on Soil Inhabiting Pests and Western Corn Rootworm. Under laboratory conditions the nematodes were effective against the larvae of cockchafer, but the effect of the nematodes was not immediate. Against Western corn rootworm the nematodes was inefficient. Keywords: entomopathogenic nematodes, western corn rootworm, biological control Introduction In these days significance of conventional chemical pest control has gradually decreased in the whole world and controls methods, which observe environmental protection, have come to the fore. Therefore importance of biological control has gradually been increasing, but at the present it happens generally in the green house. By field cultures only a few methods have been used and applying of entomopathogenic nematodes has spread the most in practice. In our Plant Protection Institute entomopathogenic nematodes have been studied for more than 10 years. In this study experimental results are reported on effect of nematodes on Soil Inhabiting Pests and Western Corn Rootworm. Literature review The entomopathogenic nematodes are microscopic, soil-inhabiting animals which live in symbiosis with bacteria. But one part of they life spends inside the body of their host (Poinar, 1979). The nematodes in the soil are called dauer or infective juveniles. These larvae do not feed, having a closed mouth, anus and resistance against environmental effect. Their functions are searching and infection of the host. The infective juvenile nematodes penetrate into the host animal through the natural cavity or cuticle. After entering an insect, infective juveniles release associated mutualistic bacteria, which start to reproduce within the host animal. The bacteria destroy the host by subduing its immunosystem and it cause host mortality within 36-48 hours. The nematodes feed and reproduce for several generations inside the cadaver, and then they abandon the host’s cadaver in search of new hosts. As a result the insects are killed by the bacteria, hence the term entomopathogenicity (Poinar, 1990). Two genera are important in practice from the entomopathogenic nematodes: Steinernema and Heterorhabditi. Steinernema carry bacteria of the genus Xenorhabdus while Heterorhabditis nematodes transmit a species of the genus Photorhabdus. From the genus Steinernema two species occur in Hungary: Steinernema feltiae and S. riobravis (Lucskai et al, 1996). According to our last years experiment the entomopathogenic nematode were effective against larvae of Colorado potato beetle, Cabbage moth and American cockroach. White grubs (the larvae of scarabs) are among the most dangerous pests in our country. They cause serious damage in agriculture and also in forestry by feeding on the roots of</p><p id="Pg178">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 852 the plants. The damage is particularly serious in weedy field (Horváth et al, 2006). The adults of flower chafer live mainly in orchards (e.g. apple) and cause problem by feeding on flowers and fruit. Soil fumigant can be used against larval damage, but these pesticides gradually having been put out of commission, consequently the biological controls have come to the fore. The Western corn rootworm is one of the most significant pests in Hungary. The control against this pest is inevitably but the conventional chemical methods not always successful because of the slow and late larvae hatching (Keszthelyi, 2006). Weed species also cause significant yield loss in the maize crop (Kazinczi et al, 2006). Materials and methods The studies were carried out in the Institute for Plant Protection of the University of Pannonia Georgikon Faculty of Agriculture between 2003 and 2007 in laboratory in greenhouse pot and also in field. 1. Studies with the larvae of cockchafer (Melolontha melolontha) Laboratory experiments: The experiment was carried out with third larval stage from field-collected larvae, with four repeat. The temperature was 22 degree Celsius. 100 gram soil (50 g black soil and 50 g sand) and one grub were put in each pot. The concentrations of the nematode were 100 JJ/ml and 1000 JJ/ml, which were got out with pipette. The experiments were evaluated with white test on the 4th, 7th and 14th day. The used nematode species were the following: Steinernema feltiae, Steinernema glaseri, Steinernema riobravis, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora Hh. Field experiment: The experiment was carried out also with third larval stage from filed-collected larvae, in isolator. 5000 gram mixed soil and five grubs were put in each isolator. The concentrations of the nematode were 1000 JJ/ml and10000 JJ/ml. The experiments were evaluated with white test on the 4th, 7th and 14th day. The used nematode species were the following: Steinernema feltiae, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora Hh 2. Studies with the larvae of rose chafer (Cetonia aurata) The experiment was carried out only in laboratory with third larval stage from filedcollected larvae, with four repeat. The strains NC-Lu, NC-513 KMD-15 of Steinernema glaseri nematode were used. The concentrations of the nematode were 1000 JJ/ml. The methods of experiments and evaluation were the same as the research of the chafer’s grub. 3. 2. Studies with the larvae of Western corn rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera) The trials were under laboratory conditions in Petri dish. The larvae of rootworm derived from own breeding, the entomopathogenic nematodes (Steinernema feltiae and testing strains) were gained from the Újfehértói GySz Pbc. The applied doses were 5000 JJ/ml and10000 JJ/ml. One maize plant and 10 larvae (L2) were put in each wet dish. The nematodes were got out with pipette. The experiments were evaluated with white test in the 24th , 96th hour (on the 1st and 4th day).</p><p id="Pg179">VII.

Cereal Research Communications 854 Conclusions From the data of the 1-4 tables the followings can be determined: 1. Under laboratory conditions the nematodes were effective against the larvae of cockchafer, on the 14th day the mortality was close to 100 percent. The most effective species was the Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, which cause 50 percent mortality already on the 4th day. 2. From the applied doses only the 1000 JJ/ml was efficient, with 100 JJ/ml on the 14th day the mortality was only 32 percent. 3. The effect of the nematodes was not immediate, since the desired mortality was only after the 4th day (80%). 4. Under field conditions the effectiveness of nematodes was moderate, even with high dose (1000 JJ/ml) the mortality was 44 percent. Under field condition also the Heterorhabditis bacteriophora was the most effective species. 5. Entomopathogenic nematodes were also effectual against the larvae of rose chafer (Cetonia aurata) in laboratory, but their effect was less then by cockchafer. On the 14th day the mortality was 70%. Among the strains of the Steinernema glaseri the NC LU was the best (75%), it was concluded, that different strain of the species has diverse effectiveness against insects. 6. Against Western corn rootworm the nematodes was inefficient. The mortality was under 50 % by the species Steinernema feltiae, which was the control, and also by the new strains. 7. Nematodes are effective only by wet conditions, in dry soil the infective juvenile larvae are dying, therefore during the experiment the field was watered constantly. This is the reason why in the USA the golf-courses are watered regularly and the nematodes are used successfully against Japanese beetle (Popillia japonica).

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 855 EFFECT OF SOIL DROUGHT ON THE TRANSLOCATION OF ASSIMILATES FOR SELECTED VARIETIES OF SPRING BARLEY Jaroslava MARTINKOVÁ1 –Simona DUŠKOVÁ1 1 Department of Botany and Plant Physiology, FAFNR, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague, Kamýcká 129, Prague, Czech Republic, martinkova@af.czu.cz Abstract: 2 varieties of spring barley were selected: Valtický as a historical variety and Malz, cultivated from it, as a representative of contemporary varieties. Both varieties were grown in two different groups – a control group and a group stressed by soil drought. In both groups, translocation of assimilates was then monitored by means of the method of combustion calorimetry. The present-day Malz variety is a result of a significant cultivation progress in comparison with the Valtický variety because there is a more economical distribution of assimilates in favour of the commercially important organ of the plant, i.e. spikes. In the Malz variety, the cultivation progress is also apparent in the more efficient utilisation of the mechanisms for adaptation to water stress. Keywords: barley, translocation of assimilates, combustion calorimetry, dry matter, spike, leaf, stem Introduction Assimilates are formed during photosynthesis in chloroplasts, which we consider to be the primary place of their origination. The produced assimilates are then progressively transported from chloroplasts to other parts of the plant’s organism. The result of the transport of assimilates is their distribution in plants (Petr et al., 2002). The translocation of assimilates in a plant between the source and the sink is linked to genes and it is regulated by phytohormones, which have the function of a correlation signal. The energy bound in the plant matter is identified from representative samples. A high energy content indicates a high content of carbon in the organic dry matter, and the carbon content varies according to the type of the organ and the season of the year (Larcher, 1988). We can always identify the level of the inner energy of assimilates created by photosynthesis only in an indirect way because it only manifests itself as an increment of combustion values of the organic substances making up the dry matter of assimilating organs. It follows from the experiments of Hejnák (2003) that the drought resulted in a significant limitation of the growth of the photosynthetic apparatus in barley plants (first yellowing and then withering of the lower leaves) and lengthwise growth of stalks during the period of shooting. Stagnation of the size of the assimilation apparatus even after the end of the drought resulted in a decrease of the production of assimilates necessary for filling the grains in spikes during the period of ripening in the stressed plants as compared with the non-stressed groups. Materials and methods 2 spring varieties of common barley were chosen as experimental plants – the Valtický variety (a historical variety, the initial variety for what is known as “the Diamond Series”) and the Malz variety (the current Czech variety of a type known as “the Diamond Type”). The barley plants were grown as sand cultures in containers with quartz sand in a greenhouse with a partially controlled temperature regimen (25°C during the day and 18°C at night) and light regimen (16 hours of light/8 hours of darkness). Both varieties were grown in two groups – a control group and a group with</p><p id="Pg182">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 856 decreased soil irrigation (15 plants in a container).The amount of irrigation water was identified gravimetrically. During the vegetation period, the plants were irrigated by Knop’s nutrient solution twice a week and with distilled water on the remaining days of the week. During the vegetation period, the plants were twice given a solution with micro-elements according to Benson. As a result of interruption of irrigation at the beginning of the shooting stage, the maximum capillary water capacity was decreased to 30 % in the stressed group. For the control group, the moisture content of the substrate was maintained at 70 % of the maximum capillary water capacity throughout the experiment. Irrigation of the stressed plants was resumed in full (70 % of the maximum capillary water capacity) during the period of full shooting (39.DC). The production and translocation of assimilates were identified according to the identification and monitoring of the changes in the energy content in dry matter (kJ g-1) in the individual organs of a plant during ontogenesis. The energy content was identified by means of the combustion calorimetry method using the IKA C200 calorimeter. Results and discussion In both varieties, the average energy content in the generative organs is identically the highest one in both the control group and the stressed group (Fig. 1, 2). These results confirm the conclusions of Martinková et al. (2005) who identified the highest energy levels in the generative organs of the reseeding forms of wheat. 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 13.DC 15.DC 25.DC 31.DC 39.DC 61.DC 75.DC 91.DC Phases of ontogenese - control E n e rg y k J g -1 leaf culm spike 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 13.DC 15.DC 25.DC 31.DC 39.DC 61.DC 75.DC 91.DC Phases of ontogenese - stress E n e rg y k J g -1 leaf culm spike Figure 1. The translocation of assimilates and the changes of the energy content in the Malz variety in the control and stressed groups. It follows from Fig. 1 that the production of assimilates and their distribution in the individual organs as well as the entire plant is highly steady in the control group of the Malz variety. The leaves in this group produce a steady quantity of assimilates and consequently their energy value is steady throughout the ontogenesis. At the beginning of the vegetation period, the higher content of substances more rich in terms of energy is apparent (12.32 kJ g-1) because the nitrogen metabolism with production of proteins, which have a higher energy content in a unit of dry matter, predominates in the young leaves, and at the same time, the plants still draw on the spare substances in the cereal grain. Energy content starts to decrease on the 75.DC (10.8 kJ g-1) when the bottom</p><p id="Pg183">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 857 leaves of the plants wither and die. The lowest energy content in the leaves is on the 91.DC (9.98 kJ g-1) as a result of discontinuation of photosynthetic processes and consequently discontinuation of the production of their products. Same as with leaves, the energy content of the stalk is steady. Even when the generative organs are formed, there are no significant fluctuations in the translocation of assimilates. The highest net energy content was identified in the Malz variety on the 61.DC in a spike in the control group. Specifically, the energy content was 15.41 kJ g-1. During this period, the spikes are active in terms of photosynthesis and therefore they produce some of the assimilates on their own. Another part of assimilates is transported from leaves. On the 91.DC, the energy content is 13.45 kJ g-1 because the spike consists predominantly of carbohydrates, which have a lower energy content than nitrogenous substances. In the stressed group, the energy content in the leaves increased after reduction of irrigation. The reason was a slight predominance of the production of assimilates over growth and this resulted in accumulation of the energy-high organic compounds and in an increase of the net energy content per unit of dry matter (Hejnák, 2003). At the same time, the transport of assimilates was limited, as it is apparent from the decrease of energy in the stalk (Fig. 1). Immediately after irrigation, the growth was quickly resumed and the assimilates accumulated in the leaves were transported through the stalk into the already developed spikes. Consequently, the energy in the leaves decreased and, on the other hand, the energy content in spikes increased. In the stressed group, the translocation of assimilates from leaves to spikes was taking place until full ripeness (the 91.DC), which is also indicated by the increased energy content in the stalk at that time. Although the energy content per unit of dry matter in a spike is higher on the 91.DC, the total quantity of the accumulated energy in this generative organ is lower by 8.36 % than in the non-stressed plants, which is in accordance with the results of Hnilička et al. (2000) and with the results of Úžika and Žofajová (2006). 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 13.DC 15.DC 25.DC 31.DC 39.DC 61.DC 75.DC 91.DC Phases of ontogenese - control E n e rg y k J g -1 leaf culm spike 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 13.DC 15.DC 25.DC 31.DC 39.DC 61.DC 75.DC 91.DC Phases of ontogense - stress E n e rg y k J g -1 leaf culm spike Figure 2: Translocation of assimilates and changes of the energy content in the Valtický variety in the control group and the stressed group. In the Valtický variety, the content of energy-rich substances first increased from the 13.DC until the 15.DC and then they decreased. On the 31.DC, some of the organic substances are translocated to the newly forming stalk, which, combined with the high</p><p id="Pg184">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 858 metabolic activity, results in a higher energy content in this young organ as compared with leaves. As Hnilička (2004) states, the maximum photosynthesis rate and consequently the maximum production of assimilates occurs during the period of spiring and blooming. The newly produced substances are translocated to stalks and spikes. This resulted in a higher energy content in these organs in the Valtický variety on the 75.DC. The highest energy content in spikes was identified on the 91.DC. It was 13.48 kJ g-1. In the stressed plants, there was a marked decrease of energy content in leaves by 3.29 kJ g-1 after reduction of irrigation. The reason was probably a higher sensitivity to water stress as compared with that of the Malz variety. Not only did the growth stop but photosynthesis and consequently the production of assimilates declined. Regeneration after irrigation was also significantly slower. This also resulted in postponing the stage of the main filling of spikes with assimilates to as late a time as the time between the 75.DC and 91.DC, as indicated by the identified energy content levels shown in Fig. 2. Similarly as Hnilička et al. (2007) did with wheat, we proved differences between varieties of spring barley in their responses to water stress. Conclusions In comparison with the Valtický variety, a significant progress has been accomplished with the present-day Malz variety in achieving a more economical distribution of assimilates in favour of the commercially important organs, i.e. spikes. In the Malz variety, the cultivation progress has also resulted in a more efficient utilisation of the mechanisms for adaptation to water stress.

At present, buckwheat cultivation is experiencing a revival in the Czech republic. Medicinal plants production in large fields brings many problems. In recent years, there has been the tendency to obtain natural raw materials by introducing biotechnologies. This study describes the optimal conditions (nutrient medium, temperature, growth regulators, light) for growth of Fagopyrum esculentum culture in vitro and for flavonoid production. Flavonoid content in intact plant and culture in vitro is also compared. Introduction Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) Moench. is a dicotyledon, the member of the Polygonaceae family (Petr and Hradecká, 1997). A related plant is the Fagopyrum tataricum Gaertner (Janča and Zentrich, 1996). At present, buckwheat farming in our country is going through a revival. Buckwheat is a short season crop that does well on low-fertility or acidic soils, but the soil must be well drained. To much fertilizer, especially nitrogen, will reduce yields. F. esculentum is highly sensitive to drought (Cawoy et al., 2006). Medicinal plants production in large fields brings many problems. There is an increased risk of plants' being attacked by diseases and pests, the available arable land is being reduced in size, the process of cultivation and harvesting of medicinal plants is difficult since it requires a large amount of manual labor, and, last but not least, the local climatic conditions play an important role as well. In recent years, there has been the tendency to obtain natural raw materials by introducing biotechnologies. Main advantages in in vitro cultivation versus cultivating the intact plants are following: 1) explantate cultures can be produced in controlled conditions and in a setting that is independent on climatic or soil conditions, 2) cultivated plant cells are clear of microbes, insects and fertilizers ( Sikyta and Dusek, 2002). Buckwheat contains flavonoids rutin, isoorientin, orientin, vitelin (Bruneton, 1999). Rutin is the most important substance found in the blooming herb and in the seed hull. Buckwheat haulm is administrated to increase blood vessel walls’ strength and elasticity. It is utilized in the treatment of varicose veins, hemorrhoids (Janča and Zentrich, 1996). The goals of the study were to derive Fagopyrum esculentum callus culture, find ideal conditions for the culture’s growth in vitro, and to compare the content of flavonoid in the buckwheat herb with the callus culture. Materials and methods Callus culture was derived from the root of Fagopyrum esculentum young seedlings in the 3rd – 10th passage. Callus from the young seedlings was transferred to paper bridge placed inside a sterile Erlenmayer flask with MS (Murashige Skoog medium) (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) supplemented with 2,4 dichlor-phenoxy-acetic acid (2,4</p><p id="Pg186">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 860 D) as a growth regulator with a 1.0 mg.L-1concentration (Tumova et al., 2007). The cultivation of the culture continued under these conditions until the 3rd passage. Starting with the 3rd passage, the MS culture medium was enriched with the following growth regulators: 6-benzyl aminopurin (BAP) in the concentrations of (0.1, 1 and 10 mg.L-1); -naphthalene acetic acid (-NAA) (0.1, 1 and 10 mg.L-1); 2,4 dichlor-phenoxy-acetic acid (2,4 D) (0.1 and 1 mg.L-1); combination of growth regulators: 2,4 D (0.1 and 6furfurylaminopurin (K) 0.1 mg.L-1); 2,4 D (0.1 and K 1 mg.L-1); 2,4 D (1 and K 0.1 mg.L-1); 2,4 D (1 and K 1 mg.L-1) . The culture was allowed to grow for 5 weeks at 25°C under different light conditions – daily light photoperiod (16 h daylight and 8 h darkness) (Safrankova and Hejnak, 2007), in darkness when the culture was blocked from light during the entire growth period and in light when the culture was continuously exposed to light coming from a 100 W light fixture suspended 1 m over the culture. After 5 weeks of cultivation, the calluses that had developed were weighed and the growth was evaluated - the growth factor R was utilized (Kováč, 1995). The content of flavonoid also was determined spectrophotometrically in accordance with Czech Codex 1997, (Composite author, 1997). The dried calluses were powdered before. Results and discussion In plant cultures in vitro, it is very important to select a suitable culture medium that offers both the optimal combination and concentration of growth regulators. It is also necessary to set the growth conditions (light, temperature, pH) and adhere to aseptic principles during work. The results of the experimental work indicate that the maximum growth of culture was achieved when the light and the regulator 2,4-D (1 mg.L-1) + K (0.1 mg.L-1) (RF 2.109) were used (Fig.1). The maximum production of flavonoids in the culture was achieved during the daily light regime cultivation with 2,4-D (1 mg.L-1) + K (1 mg.L-1) (0.069 %) -Fig. 2. When the BAP growth regulator was used, the highest growth was recorded when the BAP (0.1 mg.L-1) was used under daily light conditions. The growth factor increased in this case approximately 3.5 times. The growth was also significant with BAP (1 mg.L-1) under daily light regime and in darkness ( Fig. 1). When -NAA was used the highest growth was recorded with the use of -NAA (10 mg.L-1) under daily light regime and also under the light lixture; and with the use of -NAA (1 mg.L-1) in darkness. The growth factors under these conditions were approximately twice as high as with -NAA (0.1 mg.L-1) ( Fig. 1). When the 2,4-D growth regulator was used, higher growth was achieved with 2,4-D (1mg.L-1). The highest growth of culture was observed when 2,4-D (1 mg.L-1) + K (0.1 mg.L-1) and 2,4-D (1 mg.L-1) + K (1 mg.L-1) combination was used - Fig. 1. The test results show that the growth regulators selected had a significant impact on the culture’s growth. These results suggest that growth of Fagopyrum callus culture is better achieved under daily light regime with BAP( 0.1, 1 and 10 mg.L-1); α-NAA (0.1 and 10 mg.L-1); 2,4-D (0.1 and 1 mg.L-1) ; 2,4-D (0.1 mg.L-1 + K 1 mg.L-1); 2,4-D (1 mg.L-1 + K 0.1 mg.L-1) and 2,4-D (1 mg.L-1 + K 1 mg.L-1) – Fig. 2.</p><p id="Pg187">VII.

Growth factors of F. esculentum callus culture on MS medium supplemented with various growth regulators and under various light conditions When cultivating in darkness we recorded statistically significant increase in the flavonoid content when BAP (0.1 mg.L-1); α-NAA (1 mg.L-1); 2,4-D (0.1 and 1 mg.L1); 2,4-D (0.1 mg.L-1 + K 1 mg.L-1); 2,4-D (1 mg.L-1 + K 1 mg.L-1) regulators were used. Statistically significant increase in the flavonoid content was observed when the following growth regulators were used: BAP (1 and 10 mg.L-1); α-NAA (0.1, 1 and 10 mg.L-1); 2,4-D (0.1 mg.L-1); 2,4-D (0.1 mg.L-1 + K 0.1 mg.L-1); 2,4-D (0.1 mg.L-1 + K 1 mg.L-1); 2.4-D (1 mg.L-1 + K 0.1 mg.L-1) and 2,4-D (1 mg.L-1 + K 1 mg.L-1) – Fig. 2. The results obtained from the test proved that the growth regulators that had been used had a significant impact on the production of flavonoids in the callus culture. In summary, the flavonoid content was higher when cultivating was done under light conditions. The production increased 3.5 times under daily light regime with 2,4-D ( 1 mg.L-1 + K 1 mg.L-1) and in darkness with 2,4-D (1 mg.L-1). The production of flavonoids increased roughly 2.5 times during the daily light regime with 2,4-D (0.1 mg.L-1 + K 1 mg.L-1) and in light with -NAA (0,1 mg.L-1); and approximately doubled with the use of -NAA (1 mg.L-1) - Fig. 2. This study revealed that the average of flavonoid content in F. esculentum callus culture is 0.023 %. The average rutin content in plants grown under long-day conditions was established at 0.147 mg.G-1 (HPLC analysis), plants grown under short-day conditions contained 0.064 mg.G-1 (Ohsawa and Tsutsumi,1995).

Conclusions It can be concluded that both a good growth of culture and an increased production of flavonoids were achieved when the combinations of the growth regulators 2,4-D (1 mg.L-1 + K 1 mg.L-1) were used under daily light regime.

The trial involved 4N x 4P = 16 x 4K = 64 treatments with 2 replications giving a total of 128 plots. The groundwater depth was 13-15 m and the area was prone to drought. The fertilizers were applied in the form of calcium ammonium nitrate, superphosphate and potassium chloride. In the case of excessive NxP fertilisation the weed cover increased from 5 to 21%, while the soybean cover dropped from 78% to 56%. In this treatment the air-dry weed shoot mass on August 15 th was 4 times that on the control plots, reaching a value of 2.5 t ·ha -1 , chiefly due to the spread of Chenopodium and Amaranthus species. The degree of infection with Macrophonia phaseolina at harvest was 100% on the withered plants growing on unfertilized soil, while this value was below 5% with maximum NxPxK nutrition, where some of the plants were still green. The late ripening induced by overnutrition was responsible for the resistance to Macrophonia, since forced physiological ripening did not occur even in a dry year. Keywords: NxPxK interactions, fertilization, yield, weed occurrence, Macrophonia infection Introduction Interactions make the essence of all phenomena which take place both in living and dead world and so, we can not understand the surroundings without discovering the acting interplays and without revealing the mutual role of different factors. Authors seldom devote much attention to the interplay between nutrients. The widely adopted approach is of varying only one or possibly two nutrients at a time in field experimentation (Németh 2006, Izsáki 2006, 2007, Kovacevic et al. 2006., Bertic et al. 2007). Without factorial designs involving interacting nutrient factors at varying levels, serious study of interactions is not possible. Nutrient interactions studied usually under greenhouse or solution culture conditions are away from field conditions or “real world”, they can not mirror the behaviour of the crop in the field. There is urgent need to adopt the multifactor / multilevel approach in the field by using more complete experimental designs. However this approach sets a definite limit on what is possible in the field, requiring a large number of plots covering considerable areas of land. There is often difficulty in explaining even first-order interactions, particularly when supporting information such as soil and plant analysis are not available. Because of the key role of N and P in metabolic pathways and their historically dominant position in soil fertility research, it is not surprising that recorded interactions between these two elements were mostly published (Sumner and Farina 1986, Adams 1980, Kádár 2006, 2007a,b,c, Balikó and Sárdi 2007). Materials and methods The experimental calcareous chernozem loamy soil had in its ploughed layer 3% humus, around 5% CaCO3 and 20% clay and it was originally found to be poorly supplied with P and Zn, moderately well supplied with N and K.

The fertilizers were applied in the form of calcium ammonium nitrate, superphosphate and potassium chloride. Rates of fertilizers were 0, 100, 200 and 300 kg ha-1 N annually and 0, 1000, 2000, 3000 kg ha-1 P2O5 as well as 0, 2000, 4000 and 6000 kg ha -1 K2O during the 15 years. Experiment was established in autumn 1973. In the 15th year of the trial soybean variety Imola was grown. Sowing date was on 2nd May 1988. The area precipitation was in May 11 mm, in June 70 mm, in July 30 mm, in August 97 mm and September 57 mm in year 1988 (Kádár et al. 2003). Results and discussion The effect of N x P supplies on soybean nodulation, weed infestation, withering and seed yield is presented in table 1. The number of nodules per plant as an average dropped from 3.8 to 2.0 on inoculated soil as a function of NP-oversupply. On uninoculated control soil near the experimental area no nodules were formed on the roots. In the case of excessive NP fertilization the weed cover increased from 5 to 21%, while the soybean cover decreased from 78 to 56%. In this treatment the air-dry weed shoot mass on August 15th was 4 times that of the control plots, reaching a value of 2.5 t ha-1, chiefly due to the spread of Chenopodium and Amaranthus species.

K-fertilization had practically no influence on the yield on this loamy soil, which had 136 mg kg-1 AL-soluble K2O in the upper soil layer. Scoring for withering the soybean-stand showed on September 15th that on control soil with nutrient deficiency plants withered and dried while on the overfertilized plots left green or partly green. The degree of infection with Macrophomina phaseolina at harvest reached 100% on the withered plants growing on unfertilized soil, while this value was below 5% with the maximum NPK nutrition, where some plants were still green. There was positive interaction among the NxPxK supply levels. The N-fertilization alone reduced the infection on 56%, K-fertilization on 10%, P-fertilization separately on 8%, giving a total of 74%, while the infection dropped from 100% to about 5% as a function of N x P x K treatment.

In these circumstances, the late ripening (effect) induced by overnutrition (cause) was responsible for the resistance of soybean to Macrophomina (result), since forced physiological ripening did not occur even in a dry year. Conclusions At the beginning of flowering the soybean root system penetrated to a depth of 65-70 cm. On average, approx. 8% of the roots were found in the rapidly drying 0-5 cm layer, 49% in the 5-15 cm layer and 25% in the 15-25 cm layer, i.e. a total of 80% in the ploughed layer. The maximum root density was 1.13 cm · cm-3 soil, in the 5-10 cm layer, and the minimum 0.01 cm cm-3 soil, in the 60-70 cm layer. On uninoculated control soil no nodules were formed on the roots. The number of nodules per plant dropped from 3.2 to 2.0 on inoculated soils as a function of NxPoversupply. A maximum seed yield of 2 t ha-1 could be achieved with given treatments of 100 kg ha-1 year-1 N and with ammonium lactate (AL)-soluble P2O5 and K2O supply levels of 100-150 mg kg-1. Extreme overfertilisation with N and P led to yield losses of 20-30% in this dry year, when a total of only 265 mm rainfall was recorded during the vegetation period.

A higher total DM yield was obtained under sheep grazing (P&lt;0.05) than under cattle grazing, whereas grazing by cattle resulted in higher values of dead plant material compared to grazing by sheep (P&lt;0.01). Application of 150 kg ha -1 N resulted in 19.2 % higher grassland DM yield in comparison with N0 (P&lt;0.01). Sheep grazing was less detrimental to legumes DM yield than was cattle grazing (P&lt;0.05), whereas omission of N application (N0) resulted in higher legumes DM yield and their contribution to total DM yield compared to N150 (P&lt;0.01). A grazing management x N rate interaction (P&lt;0.05) was recorded for legumes DM yield and their contribution to total DM yield. Application of 150 kg ha -1 N resulted in 29% higher grasses DM yield and 9% in higher grasses contribution to total DM yield in comparison with N0 (P&lt;0.01). As the grass content increased, the contribution of legumes and forbs declined when fertilized with 150 kg ha -1 N. Keywords: botanical composition, nitrogen, sheep grazing, cattle grazing, yield Introduction In intensive grassland management systems, high N application increases forage yield and nutritive value, but the disadvantages of using high level of N fertilizers to the environment become more and more apparent. N fertilization increase yield and quality of different species (Varga et all., 2007, Izsaki, 2007). Rational use of soils and the maintenance of their multifunctionality, “quality”, fertility and agricultural productivity are important elements of sustainable (agricultural) development (Várallyay, 2006). The use of grass/white clover swards in temperate grazing systems is receiving interest, as they afford opportunity to develop grazing systems that require low inputs of mineral N but are still productive in terms of both herbage and animal output and reduce adverse effects on the environment (Yarrow and Penning, 2001). Grass/white clover swards, continuously stocked with sheep, had up to 80% of the lamb liveweight output ha-1 of swards receiving 420 kg of N ha-1 year-1(Orr et al.,1990). As a result of artificial fertilizers, the number of species in the grassland decrease, although the diversity decrease, the feeding value and yield of improved grassland increase (Szeman, 2007). Very little information exists about plant relations in grass-legume swards grazed under controlled rotational management with paddocks, using recovery periods that vary according to plant regrowth vigour, and under high stocking densities in Croatia.</p><p id="Pg194">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 868 The objective of the current field study was to examine the effect of N application (N0; N150) and rotational grazing by cattle and sheep on grassland DM yield and botanical composition. Materials and methods The three-year experiment (2000-2002) was conducted in north-western Croatia, at the Faculty of Agriculture experimental station, on brown acid soil (pH 5.3, 650 m altitude, 1230 mm average annual precipitation, 6.6 °C mean annual temperature). A mixture of 12 kg ha-1 cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata cv. Amba), 6.4 kg ha-1 smooth-stalked meadow grass (Poa pratensis cv. Balin) and 6.4 kg ha-1 white clover (Trifolium repens cv. Rivendel) was sown in August 1998, with a seedbed dressing of 40 kg N, 130 kg P2O5 and 130 kg K2O ha -1. Potash and phosphate dressings were repeated at the same rates in the autumn of 1999, 2000 and 2001. During 1999, the sward was topped regularly to control annual weeds. In 2000, the total experimental area (0.6 ha) was divided into 12 equal paddocks (0.05 ha). The experiment consisted of all combinations of (i) two grazing managements (rotational grazing by cattle and sheep) and (ii) two annual N application rates: 0 kg N ha-1 and 150 kg N ha-1 in six equal applications from spring to autumn. The layout was a randomized-block design with three replications. The grazing regime was imposed when the mean sward height was 17-20 cm for cattle and 13-15 cm for sheep and continued until a post-grazing height of 5 cm was attained. Grazing was applied for a maximum of 24 hours with 10-12 Charolais heifers and 35-40 Charolais ewes plus lambs, depending on the herbage available. Grassland herbage production was measured before each of the grazing cycles (rotations), from April to October, by cutting at random fifteen quadrats (1 x 0.3 m) per paddock to ground level. Cut herbage was weighed and a 200 g subsample was taken and hand separated into legumes (mainly white clover), grass, forbs and dead plant material. Herbage samples were oven-dried at 105 0C for 24 h and dry weights were recorded. There were 5-7 rotations per year, depending on the year and grazing treatment. All data were subjected to the analysis of variance using the GLM procedure of SAS (SAS Institute, 1997). All variables were transformed by square root transformation. Upon the analysis of variance, a multiple comparison test of average values, along with the Bonferroni correction method, was conducted for the significant effects and interactions. Results and discussion The total precipitation during 2000 (995.6 mm) was 19% less than the long-term average (1230.9 mm) and the mean annual temperature (8.4 0C) was 27% higher than average (6.6 0C) and it caused the lowest DM yield in 2000 (9.11 t ha-1) compared to 2001 and 2002 (13.43 and 11.2 t ha-1, respectively) which were more humid (+104.6 and +20 mm, respectively) and warmer than the long-term average. August 2000, with only 0.5 mm precipitation and 2.8 0C higher temperature than average, was especially dry and warm. Averaged over all years, a higher total DM yield was obtained under sheep grazing (P&lt;0.05) than under cattle grazing which is consistent with the results of Murphy et al. (1995), whereas grazing by cattle resulted in higher values of dead plant material compared to grazing by sheep (P&lt;0.01) (Table 1). Application of 150 kg ha-1 N resulted in 19.2 % higher grassland DM yield in comparison with N0 (P&lt;0.01). Szeman (2007) found that fresh and DM grassland herbage yield increased as the nitrogen supply</p><p id="Pg195">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 869 improved and the increase of yield improved the carrying capacity of the grassland. Sheep grazing was less detrimental to legumes DM yield than was cattle grazing (P&lt;0.05), whereas omission of N application (N0) resulted in higher legumes DM yield and their contribution to total DM yield compared to N150 (P&lt;0.01). A grazing management x N rate interaction (P&lt;0.05) was recorded for legumes DM yield and their contribution to total DM yield. The highest legumes content were recorded in SN0 which is contrary to the results of Briseno de la Hoz and Wilman (1981), Evans et al. (1992) and Murphy et al. (1995), who reported that cattle grazing depressed clover content less than sheep grazing in ryegrass/white clover swards. Close sheep grazing favours white clover growth and production by decreasing the shading of growing points by companion grasses. More intensive sheep grazing that was imposed during the present study, compared to cattle grazing, probably created better light conditions in the sward that resulted in better clover growth. Floristic changes due to nutrient additions is thought to be caused by the faster and more intensive growth of some species (usually grasses) compared to other species (mostly dicotyledonous) when well-fertilized (van der Bergh, 1991; Knežević, 2007, Szeman, 2007). This was also confirmed in this research where application of 150 kg ha-1 N resulted in 29% higher grasses DM yield and 9% in higher grasses contribution to total DM yield in comparison with N0 (P&lt;0.01). As the grass content increased, the contribution of legumes and forbs declined when fertilized with 150 kg ha -1 N, which is due to the results of Griffin et al. (2002) and Knežević (2007). Cattle grazing resulted in 40 % higher values of dead plant material compared to sheep grazing (P&lt;0.01). If grasses such as Dactylis glomerata L. and Poa pratensis L. are not grazed during the first one or two spring rotations because of initial repugnance around dung pats, they quickly mature, become increasingly rank and tend not to be grazed at all during the rest of the season (Murphy et al., 1995).

The paper turns a light on the different agronomic effects to grow proper seed. Keywords: winter wheat, seed production Introduction Winter wheat is the most widespread cultivated plant that has been grown for the longest time. Its importance can be found mostly in its ecological adaptibility. The aim of its production in general is to satisfy human nutritional demands. Winter wheat plays an important role in human nutrition in Hungary but beyond that a significant quantity is produced for export. It can be grown in the whole country, it fits the crop system well and the favourable ecological features of the country allow to generate a special quality. The usage of proper seeds yet plays an indispensable role in meeting contiously the high requirements of the market. The found for commodities is guaranteed by the varietytrue, certified seed of good quality which is the result of professional seed production. Hungary has traditionally been a seed producting area in the past and it still is in our present days (winter wheat seeds were grown on 32191.3 ha in the year of 2007). Concerning future perspectives, this tendency is about to stay. An advantage is needed to be taken on the great endowments of the country under the European Union keeping a close eye on meeting consumer expectations (e.g. foodsecurity) and market demands. However in order to sustain our competitiveness, a constant developement is needed concerning particularly the field of agricultural technics and the production of new breeds. The aim of our seed production is to generate seeds of good quality meeting the expectations of the market in an economic way in accordance with the current goals of researches at the same time. One of the most fundamental elements of cropping technologies is the seed which represents a great biological value. Besides the quantity, its quality is just as important. As a result of this the seed production has to be carried out at the highest level that is possible. Because of the changing ecological circumstances and the appearance of countless breeds (and in connection with this the appearance of new genotypes) relying on previous experiences is not sufficient. New researches are needed to be carried out for a useful developement of technologies concerning especially the new, breed-based technologies. To produce seed that meets the general standards of the market, the most optimal circumstances possible are needed to be provided during cultivation time. The quality of seed (and also the cost of production) is defined both by the environmental effects and the agricultural technics. For this reason cropping technologies must comply with the climatic and edafic circumstances and growers must</p><p id="Pg198">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 872 pay a close attention to all those elements of agricultural technologies with which the direct surroundings of the plant can be altered. The emergence of breed properties doesn’t only depend on the genetic base but also on the environmental circumstances which can affect the value of the breed either in positive or in negative ways by hindering or stimulating the emergence of genetic potential. Materials and methods In order to examine the effects of different elements of growing technologies, a series of experiments were set up on small field lots at the experimental area of Institute of Crop Production SZIU on the outskirts of Hatvan-Nagygombos. The certain treatments are characterized by the variation of methods that are used in case of the appearance of critical points in seed production. In small-plot experiments the following breeds used for mass-production were analysed: GK Alföld, Mv Magdaléna, Mv Suba, Mv Csárdás, Mv Toborzó. In the previous year before setting up the experimental plots, watermelon was grown on the land. Sowing was carried out on the12th of October 2006 with a reduced germ number of 4.5 million piece/ha according to the regulations of sowing-seed production. The sown number of germs must be 10% less in case of sowing-seed production than in regular market production. As for the fertilizer used for top dressing, the nutrition supply was carried out on different nutrient levels. The stock of plants on the plots were treated with various levels of nitrogen doses at the occassion of the susequent nutrient delivery of Springtime. There were further changes in the dates and time of dispersal and in the amount and distribution of nutrients as well. The treatments of top dressing fertilization experiments were the following: 0, 40, 80, 120 kg/ha. The basic fertilizer dose was dispersed uniformly based on soil nutrient supply. A solid dose of 300 kg ( 8/21/21 rate) of NPK was applied. Concerning pest control, because of the possible appearance of deteriorative weeds, a close attention must be paid to weed control. The crop diseases, as well as pests can cause serious damages in sowing-seed propagations. To estimate these losses, herbicides, fungicides and insecticides of various active substances were used on each plots. The herbicides used are: Granstar 75 DF (tribenuron metil), Maton 600 (2,4-D- ester), Lontrel 300 (klopiralid), Mustang SE (floraszulam + 2,4-D-ester), Banvel 480 S (dicamba), Starane 250 EC (fluroxipir-1-metilheptil-ester) Fungicides: Folicur 25 WG (tebukonazol), Amistar (azoxistrobin) Insecticides: Sumi-Alfa 5 EC (eszfenvaleratew), Parashoot SC (metilparation) The weight of yield harvested separately by each plot was measured and after the grain appearance examinations of the samples taken, the quality parameters of the seed were defined. Results and discussion The amount of the yield differed according to the doses N fertilizers applied in the form of top dressing. In the case of Mv Magdaléna, the quality of yield has increased together</p><p id="Pg199">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 873 with the increasing fertilizer doses but this growth was only significant at the fourth stage of 120 kg N agent.This same tendency applied for the yield of GK Alföld breed as well. As for the Mv Suba, despite of a constant increase that followed a slow increase in the beginnig, none of the results were significant. The top-dressing fertilizer had the most significant effect on Mv Csárdás: after an initial rise and then a slight dicrease, we got a notably higher amount of yield at the two last level. The Mv Toborzó after starting out with an early dicrease, has showed an even increase in yield volume, however the remarkable difference was also experienced only at the fourth nutrient level. The differing herbicides also had all sorts of effects on the yield, they have improved the number of germs by 1,1-1,5 t/ha. An important deviation from the control samples was only experienced in the case of Mv Suba and Mv Csárdás.On the breed mentioned first, Maton had a positive effect, and on the second breed, Granstar, Maton, Lontrel and Mustang had positive effects. The herbicides had similar effects on the yield of plots. A significant difference was only experienced for MV Csárdás as a result of the usage of Parashoot pesticide. The quality of seed was described by the number of germs per hectare which is calculated as the range of the certain thousand-kernel weights, the crops yield and the percentage of germination.The trend of germ numbers varied according to the different pesticids and showed an intense fluctuation in case of different breeds. A significant difference was experienced with MV Csárdás after using Parashoot, Folicur and SumiAlfa. Thanks to the different top-dressing fertilizers, the germ number per hectar showed a constant increase, to improve them by 10000000-15000000 per hectar. As for Mv Magdaléna, Mv Suba and the Mv-Toborzó, a significant difference was observed on the fourth level (120 kg N-agent). The difference between the results measured was significant on the third and fourth level for Mv Csárdás. For Gk Szeged this difference was observed on the second, third and fourth level (40, 80 and 120 kg N-agent). The effect of herbicides on germ number showed similarly various results but a strong fluctuation was experienced regarind varieties. Only Mv Suba and Mv Csárdás showed a significant difference. On Mv Suba Maton and Lontrel and on Mv Csárdás, Maton, Lontrel, Mustang and Granstar pesticids had an effect.

Results of the seed-experiment, Hatvan-Nagygombos 2007. Conclusions In the experiment elements of certain technologies were studied. On the basis of the results obtained effects of different treatments on seed quantity and quality were determined. Form the results it could be concluded that the various circumstances had effects on different quality parameters depending on the crop year and the variety used. Seed quality and quantitiy values proved to be variety specific. Further examinations are needed to evaluate crop year effects ont he parameters studied. In certain years the effects of various pesticides were only experienced in case of certain, intensive varieties. Herbicides improved the quality and quantity of the yield only in case of Mv Suba and Mv Csárdás. Fungicides and insecticides provided a satisfying result only for Mv Csárdás. These varieties are probably more sensitive for pest control. By continuing the experiments, this hypothesis has to be proven. The diverse doses of fertilizers affected seed quality and quantity in case of all varieties. Significant results were obtained at higher levels of nutrients. Consequently, we can conclude that nutrient supply is a most cardinal issue in seed production. References G. Drezner – K. Dvojkovic – D. Horvat – D. Novoselovic – A. Lalic: 2007.

For the precision and sustainable farming we should know in advance the level of weediness in each year. As the interaction between weed and soil or climate or any other element of its environment and crop year is a usual plant-soil or plant-environment relationship. We studied if we could estimate weediness from simple climatic data on a given experimental field. Keywords: weediness, winter wheat, estimation, crop site Introduction Agricultural production has long been a major enterprise in Hungary because more than 60% of the country’s land is arable. For centuries, winter wheat was the most commonly cultivated crop. Today the quality of Hungarian winter wheat must be assessed in terms of its competitive capability not only for domestic markets, but exportability as well. Aside from good milling and baking quality, the whole process of production should be reviewed to ensure a high quality, healthy end product. Up-to-date quality assurance systems (e.g. HACCP, ISO) have established criteria for many products, including agricultural. These systems strive to minimalize risks during cultivation through transportation to their destination point to handling and storage and ultimately consumption. The most critical technological points in wheat production are agrochemical applications, so that it is essential to reveal and study soundly their impacts (Birkás, 2006). According to the strategy of sustainable agricultural one of the basic principle is to produce safety goods and supply customers with healthy food. Hence we have to deal with chemicals used in the production accentuatedly and track their residues accurately in the yield. Since the change of the Hungarian agriculture the increased weed infection causes great losses in wheat. It is necessary to apply herbicides on the weedy field as harvest approaches to make the harvest easier and avoid losses. Chemicals applied by this method may be present on the surface and inside the plants used for nutrition (Husti, 2006). Each of these chemicals which present in the plant may cause acute or potential danger to the human health. Agriculture can produce large amount of negative externalities include nutrient and pesticides run off, soil erosion, air pollution, loss of biodiversity etc. Many inputs and practices used by conventional farmers are also used in sustainable agriculture. The goal is to develop efficient, biological systems, which do not need high levels of material inputs. Chemical inputs are being by the public to be a primary cause of food contamination and environmental pollution arising from agriculture (Jolánkai et al., 2006). Sustainable approaches are those that are the least toxic and least energy intensive, and yet maintain productivity and profitability (Várallyay 2006). This study focuses on the weed-control, the weediness - in association with the sustainability - in the winter wheat production. If we use less herbicides it might cause less problems. If we should use them we should use adequately.</p><p id="Pg202">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 876 One of the most important elements of the plant protection procedure of winter wheat is the weed control. Herbicides application became the traditional element of the production technology of winter wheat. But according to Nagy (1986) when the good fore crop (maize for silage, oil flax) keep the field free from weeds, there is no need for chemical weed control. Pepo (2005a, 2005b) state that the yields are determined basically by the crop year, and also the appearance of weeds. Weeds are plants competing with wheat for sources in a soil-plant system. As it is harmful for wheat we should control weeds. For the best way of control we should know the connection between weeds and its environment (the soil and climate and so on). In this paper we studied the connection between main wheat weeds and climatic factors under given soil parameters. The main wheat weeds are Apera spica venti, Anthemis spp., Bromus spp., Fallopia convolvulus, Cirsium arvense, Ambrosia artemisiifolia, Alopecurus myosuroides, Galium aparine, Tripleurospermum inodorum, Avena spp., Bifora radians, Convolvulus arvensis, Stellaria media, Veronica spp., Poa trivialis. To make our work more effective we classified these weeds in well known groups based on the type of the form of life. Materials and methods A ten-year small plot experiment was run at Hatvan-Nagygombos to evaluate the weediness in association with the yield of winter wheat and the effects of crop year. The soil type of the experimental field was chernozem with forest residue (Chromic Luvisol). Experiments were conducted in split plot design with four replications each year. Plot size was 10 m² and plots were solved and harvested by plot machines. Weeds were counted always in the same growth stage of winter wheat each year. In the same time, we also collected basic climate data. Every crop year can be characterized by average temperature and precipitation, we collected data on both of them monthly. The 1996, 1997, and 2000 crop year were drier than the average, and the 1998, 1999 crop years were more wet than the average. The 1999 crop year was extremely precipitated. The weediness (db m-2) and the yield were measured always in the same fenologic state. In this point of view we compared data from untreated control with climate parameters. As we have data on climatic factors, like temperature and precipitation we could combine them in any possibility. In this way we made a ‘climatic matrix’ with the free combination of any mean temperatures and precipitations of any month in each year. We indicated the temperature with ‘h’ and the precipitation with ‘cs’ as it could be seen in table 1, and the numbers mean the month for what they referring to. After creating the climatic matrix we calculated the r2 between each value of the matrix and the appropriate value of weediness in each form of life. Results and discussion On figure 1 and 2 we can see that connection between climatic factors and the appearance of each kind of weed could be very close. We collected the closest relations</p><p id="Pg203">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 877 in table 1 for all form of life.

Cereal Research Communications 878 Conclusions With the fitted trend lines we can estimate the weediness from simple climatic data in advance. The weediness (in quantity, measured in our experiments) has close connection with crop year. In our experiment the Alföld 90 winter wheat variety had a good weed oppressive ability. In the sustainable agricultural production there is a possibility to reduce the chemical input - by reducing the weed control – with the suitable variety. In lack of that severe problems may occur. If we estimate the weediness in advance, we can characterize our procedure for these weeds. That means less herbicide but appropriate ones on an appropriate level.

The different fertilizing technologies on the park type of lawn, wich is not or just sometimes irrigated. The aim of the experiment: Work with Gardena lawn mowers on the land and examine what effect has on the grass. The effect of Gardena lawn mowers on the grass. The dissertation presents, the experiment with different types of Scott artificial fertilizers the influence of different cutting hight, and the spread of weeds in the turf. The growing energy and density difference in between the air and not air turf. The dissertation presents the different cutting hight makes different combination of botanical species, it supports by the measured informations. The green color of the turf is depending on the nutrition and the influencing time of Scott fertilizers. The AN lost earlier the effection for the color, but the long lasting fertilizer helps the green color look more aesthetic. Keywords: turf, mower, fertilizer, soil, green yield. Introduction The beautiful green turf determinative element in the garden.(Hessayon.2002). The lawn is need to be fertilized to maintain color, density and vigor. The healthier and more vigorous a lawn is, the better it can withsand stress from heat, drought, traffic and pets. We often try to achieve a dark green lawn, but the darkest green lawn is not always the healthiest lawn. The nitrogen is the most important element what is responsible for green color and the vegetative growth. At each mowing we have to count with 1g/m2 nitrogen agent need,(Gruber, 1964). The most important element of the intensively used sport fields sports grass is the nutrient supply of the soil of the pitch (N:P:K), which greatly adds to the colour, density, homogenity of the grass, as well as to the stress caused by drought and cold. (Németh, 2006); (Németh–Cséplő–Vida–Bedő–Veisz, 2006). Though all tree elements are important in maintaining a healthy turf stand nitrogen will cause for the greatest response. With the help of a computer model, the potential grass yield gets easily calculable depending on the changing climatic factors,(Antal.2007). If it needed to count with it. Materials and methods The experiment placed the botanical garden of Szent István University. On fourteen parcels, seven were cut by rotary mower, seven were cut by push reel mower. Turf was sustained by regular mowing in the rythm of growing grass. The height of turf in case of rotary mower was 50 mm, while in case of reel mower it was 27 mm. Mowing of turf started in the beginning of May. Only 30 % of the vegetation was removed by mowing so at least 2-3 leaves were always left on the blades of grass.</p><p id="Pg206">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 880 Every time in each parcel mowing was performed by a grass collecting mower. Yield was measured in every parcel at times and regularity listed in the table while weight of green mass was indicated in the table and illustrated in the diagram. Fertilization was made in 18th of June. Watering happened occasionaly but not regularly. Weighting of green mass for data collection happend 10 times. Results and discussion Yield of turf mowed by rotary mower On fields treated by rotary mower the amount of yield was defined by nutrient supply. Greatest yield was ensured by Sierrablen fertilizer with 8-9 months release. Yield fluctuations indicate the effects of weather. In its tendency yield starts with a value of 0,98 kg/parcel afterwards it gradually decreases till in August reaches its deepest value at 0,24 kg/parcel, then as a result of autumn weather it starts to increase slightly again and finally ends with a yield of 0,4 kg/parcel. With the application of a 5-6 months release of Sierrablen fertilizer yield was less at the beginning , 2,7 kg/parcel, but its development showed a more balanced decrease and at the end it resulted in a slightly higher value of 0,42 kg/parcel than the one with higher value of release. The wave-trough caused by summer climate could be observed also in this case then it was followed by a yield increase in autumn. After a conventional ammonium-nitrate treatment green mass was about the same as in case of Sb1 treatment which means that it was higher than the first yield of Sb2 treatment but the decrease during vegetation period was strong and after its deepest value in August it didn’t rise for the influence of more preferable autumn weather. In this case the exhausted nutrient level couldn’t ensure a powerful development. Fertilizers with regulated nutrient supply provided better yields which, with its reserves, helped to overcome the droughty summer period. Retarded time of fertilization took a favorable effect on turf in contrast to results of earlier experiments where to the period of August the effect of fertilizers with a regulated nutrient supply also decreased when it was dispersed at the end of April, the beginning of May or even earlier. Conventional fertilization could not keep up with the demands of grass and a better result could only be obtained with repeated fertilization. Development of yield and production of 5 cm high turf was not obstructed in either of the treatments by the effect of the mower. Yield alterations showed similar tendencies but Sierrablen fertilizers were more adapted to physiological developmental peculiarities.</p><p id="Pg207">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 881 Figure1: The effect of green yield in kg/parcel. Mowed with rotational mower. Effect of reel mower on green yield With a reel mower a 27 mm high turf was sustained/ we were able to sustain a 27 mm high turf. Regarding production it was observed that the yields of Sb1 and AN2 treatments were almost the same at measure time of first growth. Values of Sb2 treatment were slightly lower than that of the other two treatments. Later yield decrease showed a more balanced effect because at the end of Sb2 treatment, like in case of rotary mower, it closed with a somewhat higher yield than Sb1. However, in the aggregated yield of a year the later one is better. As a result of ammonium-nitrate treatment the decrease in yield was stronger but this drop of the droughty summer period was then followed by a slight increase in autumn. So physiological effect predominates but plants have neither the needed amount of reserves nor the adequate nutrient level to be able to ensure proper development and maintenance of turf. It is proven by data that turf mowed by a reel mower provides less growth in every treatment so it has an effect on the prevailance of fertilizers. In spite of this turf showed no signes of degradation so this height can also be handled successfully if the adequate level of nutrients for Gramineae/grass could be assured and with a regular mowing turf could be exempted from the stress of random cutting. Yield decrease compared to fields with higher grass at the beginning of nutriment supply derives from the lack of growth per unit of time, which is caused by deep mowing. In the latter period of time grass adapted to the height of cutting and the newly developed sprouts of thickened turf already reached a certain level of production, which was provided by turf cut higher. 0 0,5 1 1,5 2 2,5 3 3,5 4 Sb1 average yield kg/p Sb2 average yield kg/p AN1 average yield kg/p 2006.07.05 2006.07.12 2006.07.27 2006.08.16 2006.08.30 2006.09.06 2006.09.14 2006.09.21 2006.09.28 2006.10.05</p><p id="Pg208">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

More favourable cutting surface of reel mower provides faster recuperation and further development for grass while wounds caused by rotary mower slow down its regrowth.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 883 WATER SUPPLY, YIELD AND QUALITY OF WINTER WHEAT ON CHERNOZEM BROWN FOREST SOIL M. Katalin KASSAI – Ferenc H. NYÁRAI – Szilvia HIDVÉGI Institute of Crop Production, Szent István University, Gödöllő, Hungary Abstract: The Alföld 90 winter wheat variety yield and quality was evaluated during five years regarding to the precipitation (the water supply) and the average temperature of the vegetation periods. The yield and the quality varied greatly by the cropyears. Regarding to the water supply we can state that the convenient distribution of the precipitation is more important than the amount of precipitation. Keywords: Winter wheat, water supply, yield, quality, soil-climatic condition Introduction There are a lot of factors which can influence the yield and the quality of winter wheat. One of them is the water supply, the precipitation during the vegetation period and the water supplies management of soil. The winter wheat has a good ability adaptation to the temperature and the precipitation of the temperate zone (Koltay-Balla, 1975). The amount and the distribution of the precipitation during the vegetation period is the determinant factor of the yield quantity and quality (Antal, 2000). Yield levels of winter wheat are determined mostly by climatic effects of the cropyears, limited primarily by water deficiency (Hoffmann-Burucs, 2005). According to Balogh et al. (2007) the different meteorological affects lead to average yields, but the effects of different varieties appeared in the yield. Drezner et al. (2007) also state, that the genotype determinative in different environments The precipitations just before the harvest damage the quality of the yield (Pepo-Pepo, 1986). Materials and methods A several-years small plot experiment is run at Hatvan-Nagygombos to evaluate the effect of some elements of production technology on the yield and quality of some winter wheat species. In this paper we evaluate the effect of the cropyear on the yield quality and the quantity of the Alföld 90 winter wheat with special regard to the degree of supply of the precipitation in association with soil conditions. The precipitation and the temperature was measured during the vegetation period. The experiment is situated on a chernozem brown forest soil. The yield, the hectolitre weight, the protein content, the wet gluten, the farinographic value and the falling number was measured. The samples of the untreated plots were evaluated. Results and discussion In the 1995-1996 vegetation period there was a temperature little bit higher than the average. This cropyear was drier, than the average. In October there was no precipitation but after that there was a rather equalized precipitation in the winter and the late spring-early summer period. The total precipitation in the vegetation period was 377 mm (Figure 1.).</p><p id="Pg210">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 884 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 X. XI. XII. I. II. III. IV.

In the 1998 crop-year there was a more precipitated autumn and spring period, and the winter also was not dry. In 1999 was the lowest yield, when the winter and the spring were very dry, and at the harvesting period there was a lot precipitation. The yield, the farinographic value and the falling number varied to a high degree according to the crop-year than the protein content, the wet gluten, and the falling number. The protein content, the wet gluten the farinographic value and the falling number in 1996 was the higher when there was no much precipitated vegetation period but the dispersion of the precipitation was satisfied. Conclusions At the evaluated period there was much difference among the cropyears regarding the average temperature and the precipitation. The winter wheat yield and quality varied by the cropyears. The water supply, the quantity of the precipitation greatly determine the yield and the quality of the wheat, but the dispersion more important than the total amount of the precipitation in association with the water management of soil.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 887 THE EFFECT OF WEATHER ON THE HOPS´S PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND TRANSPIRATION RATE Helena HNILIČKOVÁ 1 – František HNILIČKA 1 – Karel KROFTA 2 1 Department of Botany and Plant Physiology, FAFNR, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague, Kamýcka 129, Prague, Czech Republic , e-mail: hniličková@af.czu.cz 2 Hop Research institute, Co., Ltd., Kadaňská 2525, Žatec, Czech Republic, Abstract: On the experimental non-irrigated hop-fields in Stekník, an experiment with the varieties Agnus, Premiant, Sládek, Harmonie and newly cultivated variety 4527 was launched in the years 2005 through 2007. For the monitored set of hop plant varieties, photosynthesis and transpiration rates were measured during the vegetation period. The photosynthesis rate of hop increases from the the stage at which sprouts are tied to wires until the stage of hop cone formation. The decline of photosynthesis rate occurs in the period of technological and biological ripeness of hop cones. The provably lowest transpiration rate is in the period of ripeness of hop cones. Conversely, the highest transpiration rates are reached in the period of blooming. It follows from the physiological measurements that the varieties Sládek and Premiant respond to the effect of year-specific influence less sensitively than the newer varieties Agnus, Harmonie and the newly cultivated variety 4527. Keywords: rate of photosynthesis, rate of transpiration, hop, Humulus lupulus L., weather Introduction Historically, the Czech Republic has been one of the largest producers and exporters of hop in the world. In 2007, hop was grown on an area of 5,389 ha. The most important agricultural region in this respect is the region of Žatec where hop is grown on an area of 4,006 ha. The predominant part of this region is found in the rain shadow of Krušné Mountains and it can be included, according to the work by Dengema et al. (2005), in the 61 % of the Earth’s area, where there is less than 500 mm precipitation. At present, new genotypes are being included in the range of grown varieties and the physiological response of these new genotypes to unevenly distributed precipitation or to possible drought is not fully known. Evaluation of the resistance of cultural crops to drought is a long-term problem (Vegh and Rajkai, 2006; Križková and Hejnák, 2007). According to Hniličková et al. (2007), it is very complicated to study the physiological characteristics of hop and its resistance to stress because hop plants reach a height of up to 8 m. Since there is a lack of more detailed information on the physiology of the grown varieties and clones of hop, our goal was to identify selected physiological characteristics of both the older and newer varieties of hop. Materials and methods Agnus, Premiant, Sládek, Harmonie and a newly cultivated variety 4527 was launched in the years 2005 through 2007. It is apparent from the geological-soil characteristics of this locality that the mother rock is of Permian origin. The predominant kind of soil is sand-clay soil or clay-loam soil. The soil type is brown soil with a humus content of 2.5 – 3.5 %, pH of 6.2 – 7 and volume weight of 1.5 – 1.6 g.m-3. The maximum capillary capacity (% of the volume) is 37-40. Photosynthesis and transpiration rates were measured in the plants on a physiologically mature leaf in the second third of a hop plant. The photosynthesis and transpiration rates were measured in the subsequent stages of development according to BBCH: 23, 33, 55, 68, 73, 82, 89. The physiological characteristics were measured by a portable infra-red</p><p id="Pg214">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 888 analyser LCpro+ (ADC Bio Scientific Ltd.). The temperature of 25°C and the irradiation density of 500 mol.m-2.s-1 were set as the optimal levels. A thermopluviogram was made to compare the temperature and precipitation levels in the individual months of the year concerned. The thermopluviogram is based on the internationally recommended standardized criteria (deviations of temperature from the normal level and the relative expression of precipitation as the percentage of the normal level (Klabzuba et al., 1999)). The data obtained by measuring were statistically processed by StatSoft, Inc. (2001) – STATISTICA Cz [a software system for analysing data], version 7.0. Results and discussion Figure 1 shows a provable influence of the year-specific weather characteristics on the photosynthesis rate. The lowest photosynthesis rate was identified in 2006 (5.05 mol CO2.m -2.s-1). In 2006, May was warm and dry. August was cold and humid. April and June could be put into the category of warm and humid months. July also falls into the category of warm and humid months in spite of that it was a normal month in terms of precipitation but temperature was significantly higher than the many-year normal level. Conversely, the highest average photosynthesis rate was identified by measuring in 2005 (6.88 mol CO2.m -2.s-1). In that year, May, July and August were warm and humid, with August having exceeded the normal level in both temperature and precipitation. As opposed to that, April and June were warm but dry. In 2005, the total precipitation did not compensate for the precipitation deficit in the preceding year. Figure 1. The rate of photosynthesis (mol CO2.m -2 .s -1 ) of hop plants This figure also shows the statistically provable effect of the genotype of the monitored hop varieties on photosynthesis rate. From among the monitored set of varieties, the lowest average photosynthesis rate was identified in the Sládek variety (5.49 mol CO2.m -2.s-1). Conversely, the provably highest photosynthesis rate was identified in the variety 4527 (6.22 mol CO2.m -2.s-1).</p><p id="Pg215">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 889 The results also show that the older hop varieties (Sládek, Premiant) have a lower photosynthesis rate in comparison with the new varieties (Agnus, Harmonie and 4527). For hop plants, inter-varietal differences in photosynthesis rate are mentioned by Hniličková et al. (2007) in their work. For maize, for example, Bodi and Pepo (2007) mention differences of this kind. The photosynthesis rate increases from the phase 23 BBCH (4.17 mol CO2.m -2.s-1) until phase 73 BBCH (6.84 mol CO2.m -2.s-1). A decrease of the photosynthesis rate can be witnessed during the period of 82 BBCH (6.83 mol CO2.m -2.s-1) and 89 BBCH (6.30 mol CO2.m -2.s-1). The photosynthesis rate levels identified in the measuring process are lower than the ones stated for hop by Kenny (2005) and Hniličková et al. (2007) in their works. Figure 2. The rate of transpiration (mmol H2O.m -2 .s -1 ) of hop Another characteristic measured was the immediate transpiration rate. From the results obtained for the years 2005 through 2007, it is apparent that similarly like photosynthesis rate, transpiration rate is also influenced by the weather characteristics of the year concerned. A fairly even transpiration rate was identified in 2007. In that year, the transpiration rate was the lowest one of all the monitored years, specifically 0.21 mmol H2O.m -2.s-1, as shown in figure 2. This was due to warm and dry weather during the vegetation period of hop, combined with unevenly distributed precipitation of various intensity. In spite of that, it can be said that the lowest average transpiration rate over the monitored period was identified in the newly cultivated variety 4527 (0.15 mmol H2O.m -2.s-1), while conversely the highest one was identified in the Agnus variety (0.27 mmol H2O.m -2.s-1). The highest transpiration rate was identified in 2005 when the Agnus variety demonstrated the highest transpiration rate (2.15 mmol H2O.m -2.s-1), while on the other hand, the Premiant variety had the lowest one (1.28 mmol H2O.m -2.s-1). The results obtained are in accordance with the work of Hniličková et al. (2005) who monitored transpiration of hop. The transpiration rate levels obtained by measuring were lower than the ones stated for maize by Czajbok et al. (2007), except for the year</p><p id="Pg216">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 890 2005. As opposed to that, the same author states a higher transpiration rate for amaranth than the one demonstrated by hop plants. Fig. 2 also shows the effect of the genotype of the examined hop varieties because the provably lowest transpiration rate during the monitored years was demonstrated by the Premiant variety (0.38 mmol H2O.m -2.s-1), while conversely the Agnus variety demonstrated the highest transpiration rate (0.53 mmol H2O.m -2.s-1). Conclusions It is apparent from the results obtained that photosynthesis rate increases from the time when the sprouts are tied to wires (4.17 mol CO2.m -2.s-1) until the cone formation period (6.84 mol CO2.m -2.s-1). A decrease of photosynthesis rate occurs during the periods of the technological ripeness (6.83 mol CO2.m -2.s-1) and the biological ripeness of the cones (6.30 mol CO2.m -2.s-1). The said physiological characteristics are provably lower in older varieties when compared with the newer varieties. It follows from physiological measurements that the Sládek variety (year of registration: 1994) and the Premiant variety (1996) respond less sensitively to the year-specific weather effects in comparison with the newer varieties: Agnus (2001), Harmonie (2004) and the newly cultivated variety 4527.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 891 CHANGES IN YIELD AND QUALITY OF HOP DEPENDING ON THE IRRIGATION Petr SVOBODA 1 – Helena HNILIČKOVÁ 2 – František HNILIČKA 2 1 Hop Research institute, Co., Ltd., Kadaňská 2525, Žatec, Czech Republic, e-mail: p.svoboda@telecom.cz 2 Department of Botany and Plant Physiology, FAFNR, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague, Kamýcka 129, Prague, Czech Republic Abstract: On the experimental hop-fields in Stekník, experiments with drop irrigation were launched in the years 2005 through 2007. A virus-free Saaz, Osvald’s clone 72, was chosen as the experimental plant. It is apparent from the results obtained that drop irrigation provably increases the yield of hop cones as compared with non-irrigated plants. There was an average 21 % increase of the yield over the monitored years. The content of alpha bitter acids in the irrigated plants increased by 7 % on the average as compared with the nonirrigated group of plants. Keywords: irrigation, hop plats, Humulus lupulus L., yield of cones,  -bitter acids Introduction Considerable attention is still being paid to studying irrigation of hop in the hopgrowing research and practice because hop is a demanding plant as concerns the precipitation quantity and the correct distribution of precipitation over the vegetation period. In the region situated in the rain shadow of the Krušné Mountains where the annual precipitation total is lower than 500 mm, there are years with a significant precipitation deficit, to which hop responds by a decrease of yield, which results, in turn, in a decrease of the profitability of the hop-growing business. Hop sensitively responds to supplementary irrigation, the application of which increases the yield by 2026 % in comparison with the non-irrigated plants (Slavík, Kopecký, 1997). In addition to that, when irrigation is used, the quality of hop cones is not affected (Slavík, Kopecký, 1994). At present, the economical irrigation systems – drop irrigation and micro-sprinkling – seem to be promising because these systems proved to be suitable to make the hop cone yield steady (Slavík, 2000). Materials and methods On the experimental hop-fields in Stekník, experiments with drop irrigation were launched in the years 2005 through 2007 because the total standard precipitation in this region is between 400 and 450 mm, of which precipitation of between 250 and 300 mm occurs during the period of vegetation. The plan of the experiment involved a nonirrigated control group and an irrigated group (drop irrigation). The time of irrigation and the irrigation dose are stated in Table 1. A virus-free Saaz, Osvald’s clone 72, was chosen as the experimental plant. It is apparent from the geological-soil characteristics of this locality that the mother rock is of Permian origin. The predominant kind of soil is sand-clay soil or clay-loam soil. The soil type is brown soil with a humus content of 2.5 – 3.5 %, pH of 6.2 – 7 and volume weight of 1.5 – 1.6 g.m-3. The maximum capillary capacity (% of the volume) is 37-40. The cone yield and the content of alpha bitter acids were identified in hop plants by means of the high-frequency liquid chromatography method (HPLC). A thermopluviogram was made to compare the temperature and precipitation levels in the individual months of the year concerned. The thermopluviogram is based on the internationally recommended standardized criteria</p><p id="Pg218">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 892 (deviations of temperature from the normal level and relative expression of precipitation as the percentage of the normal level (Klabzuba et al., 1999)). The data obtained by measuring were statistically processed by StatSoft, Inc. (2001) – STATISTICA Cz [a software system for analysing data], version 7.0. Table 1.

In that year, weather was warm and dry during the vegetation period of hop, combined with unevenly distributed precipitation of varying intensity and a total precipitation dose of 125 mm. On the other hand, the highest yield was achieved in 2005 (2.15 t.ha-1). In 2005, May, July and August were warm and humid, while August was above the normal level in terms of both temperature and precipitation. As opposed to that, April and June were warm but dry. The total irrigation water dose was 75 mm. Figure 1 shows a provable effect of the type of experimental group on the yield of cones because a provably lower yield was identified in the non-irrigated group (1.58 t.ha-1) as compared with the group irrigated by means of drop irrigation (1.92 t.ha-1). The difference between the groups amounted to 0.34 t.ha-1 or 21 %. The results obtained are in accordance with the works of, for example, Slavík, Kopecký (1997), Slavík (2000). Increase of yield after application of irrigation was identified for mustard by Fodor (2007), for potatoes by Ábrahám, Sárvári (2006) and for tomatoes by Schober et al. (2007). Irrigation also increases the energy content in hop plants (Hniličková, Novák, 2000). Figure 1 also shows that the lowest yield was provable in the control group of plants in 2007: 1.32 t.ha-1. On the other hand, the highest yield was identified in the group of irrigated plants in 2005: 2.30 t.ha-1. The most significant difference between the yield of</p><p id="Pg219">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 893 irrigated and non-irrigated plants was identified in 2007 when the difference between them was 0.38 t.ha-1. The lowest yield depression between the control group and the irrigated group was in 2006: 0.17 t.ha-1. In that year, May was warm and dry. August was cold and humid. April and June could be put into the category of warm and humid months. July also fell into the category of warm and humid months in spite of that it was a normal month in terms of precipitation but temperature was significantly higher than the many-year normal level. Josipovič et al. (2006) state that the weather conditions are decisive as concerns the effect of irrigation on the yield level. This conclusion was confirmed by our results. 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 2005 2006 2007 year y ie ld o f c o n e s ( t. h a -1 ) Control Irrigation Figure 1.

The presented chart makes it apparent that the content of alpha bitter acids was provably influenced by the version of experiment because the</p><p id="Pg220">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 894 content of alpha bitter acids was provably lower in the non-irrigated group (2.83 % of weight) as compared with the irrigated hop (3.04 % of weight). This difference was 8 %. Slavík and Kopecký (1994) state that irrigation does not have any effect on the quality of cones. However, the results obtained show an increase of the content of alpha bitter acids. The content of alpha bitter acids provably decreased the most in 2005 when the difference between the alternative groups was 0.35 % in favour of the irrigated group (3.93 % of weight). As opposed to that, in 2006, the content of alpha bitter acids was improvably higher in the control group (1.80 % of weight) as compared with the irrigated group (1.73 % of weight). Conclusions The results obtained show that drop irrigation provably increases the yield of hop cones as compared with non-irrigated plants. There was a 21 % increase of yield on the average over the monitored years. The content of alpha bitter acids in the irrigated plants increased by 7 % on the average in comparison with the non-irrigated group. Irrigation is one of the significant intensification factors in the hop growing industry in the conditions prevalent in the Czech Republic.

František HNILIČKA1 – Helena HNILIČKOVÁ 1 – Dana HOLÁ2 – Marie KOČOVÁ2 – Olga ROTHOVÁ2 1 Department of Botany and Plant Physiology, FAFNR, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague, Kamýcka 129, 16521 Prague 6, Czech Republic, e-mail: hnilicka@af.czu.cz 2 Department of Genetics and Microbiology, Fakulty of Science, Charles University in Prague, Albertov 6, 128 43 Prague 2 Abstract: In greenhouse experiments, we have monitored the photosynthesis and transpiration rates in 15 genotypes of maize. Juvenile maize plants were cultivated in two versions of the experiment – a control version and a stressed version. The control plants were irrigated with 70 % of the field water capacity. For the stressed version, irrigation was completely discontinued for fourteen days. The experiment was started when five genuine leaves were grown. The lowest level of photosynthesis rate was in the stressed plants of the genotype 810*13 (4.28 μmol CO2.m -2 .s -1 ) and the highest level of photosynthesis rate was identified in the control group, specifically in the plants 2086 (11.58 μmol CO2.m -2 .s -1 ). The provably lowest transpiration was identified in the genotype 2013: 0.76 mmol H2O.m -2 .s -1 , while the highest transpiration was identified in the genotype 23*704 (1.24 mmol H2O.m -2 .s -1 ). The genotype 810*13 responds sensitively to a drought-induced stress and the genotype CE704 seems to be tolerant to such conditions. Keywords: Zea mays L., maize, drought, genotypes, rate of photosynthesis, rate of transpiration Introduction Maize responds sensitively to the conditions of the external environment, to agrotechnical actions and cultivation. The most frequent factor limiting the growing of crops, including maize, is the uneven distribution of precipitation during their vegetation period and the consequent drought (Solomon and Labuschagne, 2003). Maize is fairly tolerant to water stress in the vegetative phase and it is sensitive in the generative phase. However, resistance to drought is linked to the genetic basis of the grown genotypes because hybrid genotypes of plants often have properties different from their parental lineages. Studying and evaluating the resistance of the genotypes of cultural plants against water deficit is a long-term topical problem (Samarah, 2005; Vegh and Rajkai, 2006). As concerns the cultivation of maize, it is necessary to know the performance and the cross-breeding capability of the parental genotypes (Pepo et al., 2007). This is why the objective of our experiments is to monitor the immediate effect of an irrigation deficit on the exchange of gases in selected genotypes of maize and to select tolerant parental lineages and their descendants according to the obtained data. Materials and methods A broader genotype group of maize (5 in-bred parental lineages – 2013, 2023, 2086, CE704, CE810 – and reciprocal hybrids of the F1 generation), organised as dialell hybridisation, was selected as the experimental material. The juvenile maize plants were grown in containers with homogenised soil, in partly controlled greenhouse environment where the temperature was 25°C during day and 18°C at night and the light regimen was 16 hours of light and 8 hours of darkness. The plan of the containerbased experiment included two versions: a control (irrigated) version and a stressed version. The control plants were irrigated at the level of 70 % of field water capacity. In the stressed group, the plants were not irrigated for a period of fourteen days. The</p><p id="Pg222">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 896 experiment was started when four genuine leaves were formed. The photosynthesis and transpiration rates were measured gasometrically in the plants in two-intervals. The said characteristics were measured by a portable infrared analyser LCpro+ (ADC Bio Scientific Ltd.). The temperature of 25°C and the irradiation density of 650 mol.m-2.s-1 were set as the optimal levels. The photosynthesis and transpiration rates were measured in the control and experimental plants. The readings were statistically processed by StatSoft, Inc. (2001) – STATISTICA Cz [a software system designed to analyse data], version 7.0. Results and discussion It is apparent from the obtained results that the photosynthesis rate is provably lower in the stressed plants (7.47 µmol CO2.m -2.s-1) in comparison with the control plants (9.27 µmol CO2.m -2.s-1). Figure 1. The rate of photosynthesis (µmol CO2.m -2 .s -1 ). Figure 1 shows that the photosynthesis rate was affected not only by the version of the experiment but also by the time of measurement. In the stressed plants, it is possible to see a gradual decrease of photosynthesis rate, depending on the duration of water deficit. The photosynthesis rate was lower than the one, which, for example, Czajbok et al. (2007) state in their work for maize. Decrease of photosynthesis rate in stressed plants was also identified in barley, which is documented in the work of, for example, Šafránková et al. (2007).</p><p id="Pg223">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 897 Figure 1 also shows the effect of the genotype of the maize because photosynthesis rate was the lowest in the stressed plants of the genotype 810*13 (4.28 µmol CO2.m -2.s-1), while conversely the highest photosynthesis rate was identified in the control plants 2086 (11.58 µmol CO2.m -2.s-1). The figure also indicates that the genotype CE704 responds with the lowest sensitivity by reducing photosynthesis rate during drought because the average photosynthesis rate of the stressed plants was 7.02 µmol CO2.m -2.s-1 and that of the control plants was 7.09 µmol CO2.m -2.s-1. On the contrary, the genotype 810*13 reduced the photosynthesis rate in the stressed plants most significantly (4.74 µmol CO2.m -2.s-1) as compared with the control group (9.93 µmol CO2.m -2.s-1). Figure 2. The rate of transpiration (mmol H2O.m -2 .s -1 ) Another measured characteristic was the transpiration rate. Similarly like with photosynthesis, transpiration, too, was provably affected by the version of the experiment where stressed maize plants had a lower transpiration rate (0.89 mmol H2O.m -2.s-1) as compared with the plants in the control group (1.09 mmol H2O.m -2.s-1). It follows from figure 2 that the plants from the control and experimental groups had had the lowest transpiration rate before the start of the experiment, that is, at time 0: 0.55 mmol H2O.m -2.s-1. In the stressed plants, we can see a rapid increase of the transpiration rate on the second day after inducement of stress, when the transpiration rate increased by 0.49 mmol H2O.m -2.s-1. At the end of the monitored period, the transpiration rate was 0.63 mmol H2O.m -2.s-1. In the plants from the control group, the transpiration rate was within the range from 0.55 mmol H2O.m -2.s-1 (time 0) to 1.29 mmol H2O.m -2.s-1 (day 8). Thereafter, a statistically provable decrease of transpiration</p><p id="Pg224">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 898 was recorded; see figure 2. The transpiration rates recorded in the measuring process were lower than the ones stated by Czajbok et al. (2007) in their work for the same. Transpiration rate was the lowest in the stressed plants of the genotype 810*13 (0.55 mmol H2O.m -2.s-1) and the highest average transpiration rate was in the control plants 23*704 (1.28 mmol H2O.m -2.s-1). For example Solomon, Labuschange (2003) speak in their work about differences among varieties of wheat in their responses to drought. Inter-varietal differences for abiotic stressors are mentioned by Batistella et al. (2002) and Bodi and Pepo (2007) in their works on maize and by Huzsvai, Nagy (2005). Conclusions The results show that the photosynthesis rate was the lowest in the stressed plants of the genotype 810*13 (4.28 µmol CO2.m-2.s-1) and was the highest in the plants 2086 from the control group (11.58 µmol CO2.m-2.s-1). The lowest transpiration rate was identified in the genotype 2013: 0.76 mmol H2O.m-2.s-1, while the highest one was identified in the genotype 23*704 (1.24 mmol H2O.m-2.s-1). The results obtained also indicate that the genotype 810*13 responds sensitively to drought and that the genotype CE704 seems to be tolerant. The lineage CE704 also had high GCA levels for some characteristics under stressful conditions. The lineage 2023 as well as the lineage 2013 often showed the presence of an additional maternal effect (it was mostly an effect of a favourable nature).

Their characteristics were revealed by basic statistics, gamma and normal probability distributions and related function analysis. For further plant breeding work, regarding the iron incorporating capacity, the soybean lines #8, #4, and #7 constitute promising genetic background. Keywords: soybean, iron accumulation, distribution, mutation, gamma ray, 60 Co Introduction The appropriate content of Fe in plants is essential both for the health of the plant (Brown and Jones, 1976; Curie and Briat, 2003) and for the nutrient supply to man and animals. Iron deficiency chlorosis (ID) reduces total soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] production by several million metric tonnes each year (Hansen – Schmitt et al., 2003; Dadhich - Somani, 2007; Sabo et al., 2007). Although ID-tolerant soybean varieties are available, variety screening is difficult and does not always provide reproducible results (Naeve and Rehm, 2006). Therefore more robust screening methods are needed. The objectives of our investigations were: (1) To screen our M10 mutant soybean lines selected for high protein or high oil content and favourable agronomic characteristics for their seed-Fe content at one location and during two growing seasons. (2) To identify lines with high seed-Fe-content for further genetic studies. Materials and methods Plant material Five hundred seeds of a Carpathian-Ukrainian local variety (00) were sown in the gamma field of the Department of Genetics and Plant Breeding, Szent István University, Gödöllő, and exposed to chronical gamma rays from a 60Co source at a 100-300 Gy. Pedigree selection was started in the M2 generation for plant height, first pod height, number of pods, 1000-seed weight, yield per plant and lodging, furthermore for oil and protein contents. For analyses of Fe concentrations in the seeds, M10 soybean lines of good agronomic characteristics were used. Determination of element concentration Dried grinded seed samples (0.2 g) were digested in a mixture of 2 ml HNO3 and 2 ml of H2O2 in a teflon bomb (PTEF) for ICP analysis. The digested samples were filled up with deionised water to 10 ml. The Fe element was determined by ICP-OES (Thermo Jarrell Ash Co, ICAP 61).</p><p id="Pg226">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 900 Statistical analysis In order to generally characterize the Fe-contents of the seeds of soybean lines in general, summary statistics, viz., means, medians, confidence intervals, ranges, percentiles, standardized skewness, kurtosis were applied (Mendenhall, 1987; Harshbarger and Reynolds, 1990). To identify the favorable lines regarding the iron accumulation, probability distribution functions were fitted, with Shapiro-Wilk W, log likelihood, Chi-Squared Test, and Kolmogorov-Smirnoff statistics having been applied as goodness of the fit tests. Accordingly the gamma (1) and normal (2) distribution functions (Walpole and Myers, 1989) were found to adequately describe the Fe distributions. To assume the highest possible Fe contents among the lines, the hazard functions (3) of these distributions were made use of. , (1) , (2) (3) where, α, β, µ and σ are shape, scale factors, mean and standard deviation, while f(x) makes up the density function, and S(X) constitutes the survival function, respectively. For the computational work the statistical toolbox of Matlab 6. 5. 0. and Statgraphics Centurion XV programs were employed. Results and discussion Table 1 summarizes the basic statistics of the Fe content in seed. The confidence interval for the difference between the means extended from 2.93 to 14.01. Since the interval does not contain the value 0, there is a statistically significant difference between the means of the two samples at the 95 % confidence level (t = 3.2 P-value &lt; 0.05). These results assume that the variances of the two samples are equal. In this case, that assumption appears to be reasonable based on the results of an F-test (F = 0.79; Pvalue = 0.76). A Mann-Whitney W test was conducted to compare the medians of the two samples. The average rank in 2003 constituted 14.39, while the average rank in 2004 was 7.32. Since the P-value is less than 0.05, there is a statistically significant difference between the medians of Fe contents in the years 2003 and 2004 at the 95 % confidence level (cf. fig. 1 inserted box and whisker plot). A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was run to compare the Fe distributions of the soybean lines in 2003-2004. This test has been performed by computing the maximum distance between the cumulative distributions of the two samples. The maximum distance makes up 0.60, as it is visualized on the constructed quantile plot (Fig. 1). Consistently with the approximate 0.06 P-value for the test, there was a statistically significant difference between the two distributions at the 94 % confidence level.</p><p id="Pg227">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 901 Fig. 1. Quntile plot for the Fe contents of soybean lines as affected by vintage. Inserted in the Box and whisker plot. Although the values of standardized skewness and standardized kurtosis (Table 1), which belong to the range of -2 to +2, may indicate that the Fe contents of the studied soybean lines may come from normal distribution, a more detailed analysis was conducted to reveal a more solidified nature of the distribution. In 2003 the best fitting distribution followed a normal, while in 2004 a gamma distribution. Table 2 displays the critical values for five lower tail areas for the fitted distributions. The value of the fitted gamma distribution below which you would find an area equal to 0.01 is 89.1 for gamma distribution and 88.1 mg kg-1 DW for normal one. Otherwise it means that in 99 % of the soybean lines the Fe values exceeded these critical ones. Also calculated were the Normal Tolerance Limits for Fe. Assuming that Fe comes from a normal distribution, the tolerance limits were between 74.57 and 134.86 mg kg-1 DW.

Cereal Research Communications 902 In order to predict the genetic potential, i. e. the highest possible Fe accumulation of the investigated soybean lines in accumulating Fe in their seeds, the hazard function of the gamma and normal distributions were analyzed. In this presumption the calculated hazards represent the conditional distribution of the Fe content random variable of soybean lines (X), given that is at least X. Hence, the less a hazard value for a given Fe content, the higher the probability that, that Fe content may come from that population. Having performed this sort of analysis for both the gamma and normal distributions, it can be assumed that ~ 155 mg kg-1 DW constitutes the highest threshold for incorporation Fe in the investigated soybean lines’ seeds under the climate conditions of the years of 2003-2004. For further selection work, regarding the iron uptake efficiency, according to the 85 % percentile value of 113.4 mg kg-1 DW, as determined by 95 % two sided confidence interval, the soybean lines #8, #4, and #7 constitute promising genetic background. Conclusions Both the basic statistics and parameterized gamma and normal distributions revealed significant differences in the Fe-contents, with 95 % confidence interval for the mean being between 35.7 ÷ 173.8 mg kg-1 DW. The significant differences were determined not only for the means but also for the medians. The latter had a value of 110.6 and 100.4 mg kg-1 DW in 2003 and 2004, respectively. With making use of function analyses of gamma and normal distributions, i. e. tolerance limits, critical values, quantile plots, hazard functions, the genetic potentials of the M10 lines were assumed. It can be stated at 95 % confidence level that 99.73% of the distribution lies within the tolerance limits of 74.57 and 134.86 mg kg-1 DW, with ~ 155 mg kg-1 DW being the possible highest Fe-content. For further plant breeding work, concerning the iron incorporating capability, the soybean lines #8, #4, and #7 possess valuable genetic background.

The main advantages are: lubrication free operation meaning a method of environment protection, low weight (fuel economy and reduction of soil compression by machines) and wear resistance [1]. Generally some types of polymers are considered to be excellent anti-wear materials, but the detailed wear effects of different soils on polymers are not clarified yet. [2, 3] At our research tests we examined the abrasive wear behaviour of polymer/steel gear pairs contacting seven different soil types. The article gives a brief review about the results and conclusions. Keywords: soil, abrasive wear, polymer and composite machine elements Introduction In the agricultural machinery the wear resistance of machine elements is crucial. In the literature clearly described the theory and process of different wear phenomena mainly focusing on metallic materials. In the field of new structural materials e.g. plastics, composites, ceramics are not known in details. The lack of knowledge can result uncertain operation and unexpected breakdown, shorter lifetime of machine elements. In agricultural machines very frequent failure process the abrasion due to soil, sand and other mineral-based small and very hard particles acting on the working surfaces. According to the definition of abrasion: if the contact interface between two surfaces has interlocking of an inclined or curved contact, ploughing takes place in sliding. As a result of ploughing, a certain volume of surface material is removed and an abrasive groove is formed on the weaker surface (fig.1). This type of wear is called abrasion [4]. Soil as an abrasive media means a large category. From the point of caused wear on working surfaces the physical soil types are essential and have to been clarified [5, 6, 7]. According to the recommendations we have selected seven different physical soil types [8, 9] as abrasive media for further laboratory wear testing. Selection and sampling of soil types The sites for taking soil samples were chosen in view of the basic principles of soil mapping. At each of the chosen sites the soil survey was carried out with the aid of the Pürckhauer auger technique. The Pürckhauer auger is a steel tube, 1 m in length, its diameter varying between 1 and 3 cm, half or a third of the length of which is open, with a solid steel head at one end, with a hole drilled across. The auger is driven into the soil with the aid of a plastic hammer, and after a few rotations it is pulled out of the soil, containing a ‘mini soil profile. The auger is made of a very strong and resilient alloy, and its hardness makes it easy to take samples from very compact or heavy clayey soils or soils containing stone rubble. Another benefit of the technique is that it enables studies of soil type, thickness of layers, colour, physical type, carbonate, pH value and moisture without excessively disturbing soil structures, and it has proven to be suitable for roughly distinguishing and separating soil patches. The description of the auger and</p><p id="Pg230">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 904 the identification of the soil types are based on the work of Stefanovits and Szodfridt. After the profile description, disturbed soil samples were taken from the designated layer.

Wear in loam (A) Conclusions The abrasive role of soil particles can establish a new maintenance strategy due to specific wear-resistance ranking of structural materials in the function of dominant soil types. The local land features can be taken account for material selection during machine repair. At present research the sand (H) and loam (A) caused very high wear values (10 – 12% ) with a certain polymers, but regarding an average behaviour loamy sand (HV) and small pebble sand resulted high wear. Among the polymer wear values extremes (low and high wear loss, 2% and 12%) were found with sand (H) and loam (A). The most even wear was experienced with loamy (AV) media. The magnesium catalytic cast polyamide 6 (PA 6 G-H) as strategic engineering polymer for agricultural machines performed quite well comparing to the composites and PETP versions. The low wear volumes of PA 6 G-H highlights the role of mechanical properties of engineering polymers especially toughness and strain ability of the materials have to be examined in the future.

The hard mineral particles of different soils can cause severe wear and damage in working machine elements. To get to know the wear resistance of structural materials and compare the different soil types from the point of abrasive effects laboratory models were developed on the base of system approach and DIN standard recommendations. Keywords: abrasive, soil, modelling Introduction Machinery components in relative motions suffer surface degradation and failure due to interaction with hard ragged counter surfaces or abrasive particles, typically soil origined in case of agricultural machines [1, 2, 3, 4]. Many studies (Khruschov , Rabinowicz Archard Yamaguchi Ratner) have been made to evaluate the effect of particles and component material properties and their interaction with operational and environmental parameters and time in determining the ultimate wear rate and failure of the components. Abrasive wear phenomenon is a small segment of tribology (science, knowledge and technics of friction, wear and lubrication). The suggested functions and connections are mainly valid for metallic materials. But, to improve the abrasive wear behaviour of a certain tribo system - modifying the system -, there are more keys e.g. replacing the metal surface with a new ceramics, composite or plastic one [5]. Before doing any kind of modification or development in a tribo system, different modelling has to be done to ensure the proper behaviour of sliding surfaces. To follow the reproducibility of the model systems different test categories are suggested by DIN standard (fig.1) Implementation of DIN standard categories for modelling of soil’s abrasive Cat. I.: final, real test of e.g. joints and tires on dusty road, stochastic abrasive effects with real soil particles. The most time consuming and expensive way of testing offering the most reliable results about the interaction of soils and machine elements. Cat. II: real test with directed surroundings, controlled abrasive effects with real soil particles. Cheaper and shorter test than cat. I. Cat. III: Bench testing with selected unit subjected to any kind of friction and wear. Controlled load and wear. In case of abrasive tests real soil or standardized media are often used.

Offer less real results comparing to the first three categories. Cat. V.: Simplified model of abrasive with real soils or standardized abrasive media and simplified machine elements. Cat. VI.

Conclusions The quick test equipments developed in accordance with DIN 50322 recommendations at Institute for Mechanical Engineering Technology, Szent István University make it possible to investigate the abrasive effects of different soils on structural materials of agricultural machines. This point becomes more and more important regarding the increasing demand for better reliability and longer lifetime of land machines. References Barczi A. – Füleky Gy. – Gentischer P. – Néráth M.

We assume that these parameters could be good bioindicators of soil quality and changes in soils. The studied area is located in the North-Eastern part of Hungary, the Nyírség region, mostly covered with acid sandy soil. Five different amounts of bentonite (0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 t ha -1 ) were applied in 2002, while all plots were amended with 250 kg ha -1 livestock manure in 2005. Soil samples were collected from the treated plots to characterize the effect of bentonite on soil-living Collembola, microbe functional groups and some of the enzyme activities in 2006. In case of the fields treated with 10, 15 t ha -1 bentonite we gained the highest number of Collembola (50 % more) in comparison with the 0, 5, 20 t ha -1 bentonite treatment. In the first two years, the greatest microbial count and enzyme activities were also found in the 10, 15 t ha -1 bentonite-treated soils while four years later these parameters were not so sensitive. Keywords: bentonite, Collembola, colony forming unit of soil microbes, soil enzyme activities Introduction There is a long history of improving the fertility of sandy soils in Hungary (Nagy, 2007; Kádár, 2007). Numeruos authors investigated the effects of different treatments. Most experiments focused mainly on the yields. According to the EU Soil Protection Strategy (Directive (COM(2006) 232) the attention of scientists and policy makers have recently shifted to diferrent soil biodiversity studies: understandig degradation processes and finding indicators to monitor these processes. In our research, we investigated the effect of different bentonite treatments on three biological parameters: the abundance of Collembola, soil enzyme activities, and colony forming unit of some soil microbes. The abundance and species composition of Collembola depend on pore space, connectivity of pores, moisture and temperature regimes of soils (Larsen et al., 2004). Sandy soils can be characteized by large pores (Várallyay, 1984). Bentonite is known for improving soil physical and chemical parameters (Szegi et al., 2005). Our objectives were to characterize the effects of different amounts of bentonite applications on soil enzyme activities and soil biota, and the abundance of Collembola as the indicators of soil quality and fertility. Materials and methods Bentonite contains high amount of montmorillonite clay minerals, with high cation exchange and water retention capacity. Clay minerals are also known as soil aggregate forming agents. The following bentonite applications were carried out in the ploughed soil layer: 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 t ha-1. In 2005, all plots were treated with 250 t ha-1 farmyard manure. The test plant was rape (Brassica napus ssp. Oleifera ‘Meteo’) in 2006. Our hypotheses was that bentonite application could improve the physical and</p><p id="Pg238">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 912 chemical properties of light textured sandy soils, and should retain more available water in the growing period, thus enhancing the soil biological activity. The experimental design was a randomized block with four replicats. Soil samples were collected from the upper 0-20 cm soil layer from five sampling points in each plot. Soil physical and chemical paramenters were measured according to the Hungarian lab routines (Buzás et al, 1993). Soil biological samples were analized immediately after sampling or after freezing. The Hungarian Standard was used for the dehydrogenase on the bases of the formazane production in the TTC-amended soil (MSZ-08-1721/3-86). Invertase activity was estimated from the glucose formation (Mikanová et al. 2001). Catalase activity of the H2O2 amended soils was measured by the O2-release (MSZ-081721/4-86). Colony forming units (CFU g-1 dry soil) of the aerob heterotrophs with fast reproduction (r-strategists), aerob oligotrophs (K-strategists), the spore-forming bacteria (l-strategists) were estimated on Martin-agar plates by a modified plate dilution technique (Angerer et al., 1998). Modified Tullgren-type extractor was used to gain Collembola, then counting and identification were carried out by stereo microscope at 400x magnification. Statistical analyses (ANOVA, correlation) were performed by SPSS 15. program. Results and discussion Physical and chemical parameters Four years after the bentonite-amendment, there were not any statistical differences found in soil physical and chemical parameters regarding the different treatments (Table 1.).

There were not any significant effects found in the fourth year. We did not find the colony forming unit of microbial groups in soils as sensitive indicator, based on the four-year investigations. However, the ratio of „r” and „K” strategist microbes seems to be more sensitive indicator, because these data followed the original trend (Table 2.). According to our results, the most favourable conditions were detected in the 10 and 15 t ha-1 bentonite-treated plots concerning the r/K ratio. Among the treatments there were not any significant differences in dehydrogenase (intracellular enzyme) activity during our investigations. Invertase (extracellular enzyme) acted like the dehydrogenase, no tendency could be observed. Only catalase (extracellular enzyme) activity inticated the expected trend.

Conclusions Despite, there were no physical and chemical improvement due to bentonite applications, most of the biological indicators (Collembola, CFU, r/K ratio, catalase</p><p id="Pg240">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 914 enzyme activity) showed increasing tendency in case of 10 and 15 t ha-1 bentonite doses. The abundance of Collembola decreased in case of the 20 t ha-1 bentonite. The 20 t ha-1 bentonite application might have decreased the number of favourable pore size distributions wich are important for soil-living (eu-edaphic) Collembola. Ratio of the r/K-strategists seems to be more sensitive indicator than the others in our study. Some soil enzymes can be adsorbed on the surface of clay minerals and organic matter and can sustain their activites for a long time without any biological control (Anton, 1985). Invertase and catalase are both extracellular enzymes, but they acted differently in our research, since catalase indicated the expected changes, while invertase did not show any differents from the other treatments. Davet (2004) had similar results. Catalase seems to be the most suitable to detect the long-time effect of soil amendments. Four years after the bentonite application, the sensitivity of soil microbes and soil enzyme activities decreased paralell to the elapsed time, despite the abundance of Collembola showed differencies. Further studies are needed to determine the timesequence of the examined biological indicators. References Angerer, I.P., Biró B., Köves-Péchy K., Anton A., Kiss E.: 1998.

There were not considerable differences between measured and predicted soil water content in 2005. Predicted SWC by the 4M model was usually close to the observed data. For SP tillage system in 2004, the model predicted approximately 15% higher SWC than the observed values, whereas the measured values in WP and DT were underestimated by 11-12%. The best fit between simulated and experimental data was observed for WP treatment with an average difference of 3%. Possible reason for poor simulation results could be because the model uses only bulk density, LOL, DUL and drainage coefficient as a tillage specific input parameter and does not consider the seasonal changes in soil macroporosity. Simulated NO3-N contents for all tillage treatments were close to the observed values in the beginning of observed crop seasons but overpredicted for the late part of the vegetation period in 2004 and 2005. The model predictions indicate a need for improvement in the crop growth, nutrient and soil physical components as well as their evaluation for different tillage practices. Keywords: soil water and nitrogen dynamics, crop simulation models Introduction Tillage methods affect soil physical properties and, thus, have a direct influence on the soil water and nitrogen dynamics. Effects of different tillage systems on crop yield have been extensively studied under different conditions of soil and climate. In contrast, there is limited information about its effects on soil physical properties and water and nitrogen storage in the soil (Farkas et al., 2005; Németh, 2006; Gombos, 2007; Birkás et al., 2007). This, together with the increase of process modelling of water and nitrogen dynamics in tillage experiments has imposed a demand of accurate measurements of soil physical properties, crop development and crop yield. Work has been carried out in the last few years to study the soil water and nitrogen regime under different tillage methods in eastern Hungary and their influence on the development of field crops (Huzsvai et al., 2005). Although these experiments show some relationship between soil physical properties and soil water and nitrogen dynamics under traditional and conservation tillage, more detailed studies are needed on these tillage practices. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of different tillage methods, under rainfed conditions in eastern Hungary, on soil water and nitrate-N content and to simulate the dynamics of the soil water and nitrogen regime over the 2003-2006 crop season. Materials and methods Experimental Site, soil characteristics This study was conducted in 2003-2006 at the Látókép Experimental Station of the Centre of Agricultural Sciences and Engineering, Debrecen University located in the</p><p id="Pg242">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 916 north-eastern part of the Great Hungarian Plain (47° 30’ N, 21° 36’ E, 121 m elevation). The investigations were part of a multi-factoral (irrigation, tillage, fertilization, plant density) long-term field experiment. The investigated tillage treatments were winter ploughing (WP) to a depth of 27 cm, spring ploughing (SP) to a depth of 22 cm and disk tillage (DT) to a depth of 12 cm. The soil of the experimental site was a lowland pseudomyceliar chernozem (Mollisol-Calciustoll or Vermustoll, silt loam). 4M v. 4.5 software package was used for modelling cropping systems (Fodor et al., 2002). The 4M crop model is a daily-step, deterministic model that simulates the water and nutrient balance of the soil, the soil-plant interactions and the plant development and growth. Table 1 shows the main characteristics of the soil profile at the experimental site needed for simulation in this study. Table 1.

Changes in the soil water profile during the experimental period were monitored using capacitive method. A batteryoperated capacitive soil moisture sensor (BR-150) was used to determine the volumetric water content. Two open-ended tubes (plastic, 40 mm ) for the capacitive probe were installed in each individual plot of each treatment. Readings were taken to a depth of 200 cm in 10 cm increments. Soil water measurements were made five-six times at variable intervals from the end of July to harvest during the growing season. Soil nitrate measurements were taken to a depth of 1 m in 0.2 m increments. Soil nitrate measurements were made 3-4 times at variable intervals from the end of July to harvest during the growing season. Changes in the soil nitrogen during the experimental period were monitored using photometric determination (Spectroquant Nova 60 A). The total amount of plant available soil N in the profile was calculated from the nitrate-N content (mg kg-1) and the bulk density (g cm-3) of the examined layers. Results and discussion Comparison between predicted and observed seasonal changes of soil water content Changes in the measured and simulated soil water contents (SWC) are shown in Figure 1. The SWC was significantly affected by tillage at all measurement dates except the data measured in 2006. Increasing order of the moisture content of the soil in the upper 100 cm layer was as follows: WP &lt; SP &lt; DT. DT treatment proved to be the most favourable from the aspect of saving SWC. It seems that the water recharge of the</p><p id="Pg243">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 917 profile during the autumn and in winter period was more effective in the DT than in the ploughed treatments. The course of simulation curves also underlines the increasing order of the moisture content described above. Between measured and predicted data of 2005 there were not considerable differences. Fig. 1 shows that predicted SWC by the 4M model was usually close to the observed data. For SP tillage system in 2004, the model predicted approximately 15% higher SWC than the observed values, whereas the measured values in WP and DT were underestimated by 11-12%. The best fit between simulated and experimental data was observed for WP treatment with an average difference of 3%. Since the model tended to over-predict some layers and underestimate other layers, the differences in error tended to cancel out, resulting good predictions of water storage in the upper 1 m profile during the 4 year period of 2003-2006. Comparison between predicted and observed seasonal changes of soil nitrogen In 2004, the NO3-N content of the 0-100 cm soil profile exceeded the values of both WP and DT significantly at all measurement dates in SP treatment. In DT treatment, a significantly lower NO3-N concentration was measured from the last third of the growing season. Tillage methods did not affect the amount of soil NO3-N in 2005 and 2006, except in the vegetative growth period. During this period (May-June), the NO3N content of the soil was consistently higher in SP treatment. Fig. 2 shows that simulation curves also follow the significantly differences in NO3-N content found in early vegetative growth period of all examined years. Simulated NO3N contents for all tillage treatments were close to the observed values in the beginning of observed crop seasons but overpredicted for the late part of the vegetation period in 2004 and 2005. This could be probably due to lower N-uptake calculations by the model. 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 1 9 -S e p -0 3 1 9 -N o v -0 3 1 9 -J a n -0 4 1 9 -M a r0 4 1 9 -M a y -0 4 1 9 -J u l0 4 1 9 -S e p -0 4 1 9 -N o v -0 4 1 9 -J a n -0 5 1 9 -M a r0 5 1 9 -M a y -0 5 1 9 -J u l0 5 1 9 -S e p -0 5 1 9 -N o v -0 5 1 9 -J a n -0 6 1 9 -M a r0 6 1 9 -M a y -0 6 1 9 -J u l0 6 1 9 -S e p -0 6 m m WP simulated WP measured SP simulated SP measured DT simulated DT measured Figure 1.

Simulated and measured nitrate-N content of the upper 100 cm soil profile over the growing seasons of 2003-2006 Conclusions Based on the results of this study, the model’s capability to simulate tillage effects on water and nitrate content in the upper 1 m profile was not satisfactory in some cases. Possible reason for poor simulation results could be because the model uses only bulk density, LOL, DUL and drainage coefficient as a tillage specific input parameter and does not consider the seasonal changes in soil macroporosity. The model generally overpredicted nitrate contents in the soil profile for all tillage treatments at the end of the examined vegetation periods. The model predictions indicate a need for improvement in the crop growth, nutrient and soil physical components as well as their evaluation for different tillage practices.

Better tolerance to low winter temperatures was observed for crimson clover. Higher plants (10 to 31 cm) before winter and in spring (67 to 117 cm) were measured for hairy vetch, while crimson clover had higher yields of fresh biomass (33.7 to 113.1 t ha -1 ). Concentrations of N (1.53 to 3.34%), P2O5 (0.55 to 1.04%) and K2O (2.02 to 5.32%) in plant tissue were higher for hairy vetch. However, due to higher yields of dry matter, crimson clover accumulated more N (105 to 239 kg ha -1 ), P2O5 (28 to 83 kg ha -1 ), and K2O (105 to 440 kg ha -1 ) than hairy vetch. According to our results crimson clover could be recommended as a cover crop in Mediterranean and Continental area of Croatia. Keywords: dry matter, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, Trifolium incarnatum, Vicia villosa Introduction Ecologically acceptable production systems are prerequisite for agricultural sustainability (Birkás et al., 2007; Kis, 2007). They often utilize winter annual legumes as cover crops in crop rotation. Sowing cover crops affects physical, chemical and biological properties of soils (Mikó et al., 2007) and reduces soil erosion (Abdul-Baki, 1997). Legume cover crops fix atmospheric N and contribute toward meeting the N needs of a subsequent crop (Phatak, 1992; Guldan et al., 1996) while produced biomass could increase soil organic matter (Cherr et al., 2006). Cover crops established before winter prevent nutrients leaching during winter months, especially nitrogen (Masiunas, 1998). Vegetative growth of legumes terminates with flowering, usually in May, when sowing and transplanting of the most field crops starts. Developed biomass can be incorporated in soil as a green manure (Miko et al., 2007) or mown down to form mulch (Abdul-Baki, 1997). The choice of plant species for cover crop depends on specific climatic and pedological conditions (Cherr et al., 2006). The species used as a cover crop should be tolerant to low winter temperatures and efficient in biomass production and N fixation (Abdul-Baki, 1997). The aim was to examine the potential of hairy vetch and crimson clover as cover crops in Mediterranean and Continental area of Croatia. Materials and methods Field experiments were carried out at Pula (Mediterranean climate) and Zagreb (Continental climate) during two vegetation seasons. We tested two species the most used as cover crops (Abdul-Baki, 1997). Trials with hairy vetch (cv. Poppelsdorfer,</p><p id="Pg246">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 920 Vicia villosa Roth) and crimson clover (cv. Inkara, Trifolium incarnatum L.) were conducted using random block design with four replications. Experimental unit was 2.6 m x 7 m. Ploughing was always performed in August (25 to 30 cm). Preplant fertilizer (NPK 7-20-30) at 500 kg ha-1 was applied broadcast and incorporated into the soil. Cover crops were sown in September, except in the second season at Pula, where due to heavy autumn rain first sowing was unsuccessful and therefore repeated in the mid of February. Crimson clover was sown at seed rate of 55 kg ha-1 and hairy vetch at 130 kg ha-1. The seed rates were higher than recommended in order to ensure high plant density. Plant height was measured before winter and in full bloom (May) on five randomly chosen spots per plot, while plant density was determined on 1 m2 area. In second vegetation season at Pula first measurement was done after germination (March). Yield of fresh biomass was determined by pulling out and weighing all plants from 1 m2 per plot. Plants were dried at 60 ºC for at least 48 hours and dry matter (DM) was measured. Samples were grinded and total N was determined by Kjeldahl method, while P2O5 and K2O were determined by digestion method with concentrated HNO3. Results and discussion Pre-winter differences in plant density between hairy vetch (208 plant m-2) and crimson clover (123 plant m-2) were found in first season at Pula (Table 1). Lower density of crimson clover observed pre-winter and in full bloom was a consequence of autumn drought and therefore low germination rate (data not shown), confirming results of Allison et al. (1998). Crimson clover tolerated well winter temperatures at Zagreb in first season, while hairy vetch was heavily damaged (308 vs. 48 plant m-2 before and after winter, respectively) probably because it was overdeveloped before winter. In second season, with later sowing date, plants were less developed and therefore overwintering was better (264 vs. 142 plant m-2 before and after winter, respectively). Shennan (1992) suggested that hairy vetch is winter-hardy, which was not confirmed by this study probably due to lower temperatures under our climatic conditions. Table 1.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 921 Higher plants before winter were measured for hairy vetch plants (Table 1), except at Pula in second season because sowing was repeated in February. In full bloom phase, plants of hairy vetch were higher than crimson clover in first season at Pula and second at Zagreb (Table 1). Crop height in full bloom ranged 77 to 117 cm at Zagreb, and 61 to 76 cm at Pula, probably due to a higher spring precipitation at Zagreb. Lower yield of fresh matter was found for hairy vetch compared to crimson clover at Zagreb in both seasons and at Pula in second season (Table 1). Yields of dry matter were different only in second season at Zagreb (Table 1). At Zagreb, yield of fresh matter ranged 82.8 to 113.1 t ha-1 for crimson clover and 17.7 to 49.0 t ha-1 for hairy vetch, while at Pula yield ranged 33.7 to 79.5 t ha-1 for crimson clover and 33.8 to 49.5 t ha-1 for hairy vetch. Yield of cover crops is largely determined by temperature and distribution of precipitation Abdul-Baki (1997). Nutrients released by decomposition of organic residues are determined by produced biomass and nutrient concentration of cover crop (Shennan, 1992). Percentage of N in dry matter ranged 1.18 to 3.34% (Table 2). Higher concentration of N was found for hairy vetch, except in first season at Pula (Table 2). Higher P2O5 concentration in dry matter was also observed for hairy vetch (Table 2). Phosphorus concentration at Pula ranged 0.46 to 0.93%, and at Zagreb 0.75 to 1.04% probably due to a higher soil P2O5 concentration at Zagreb (data not shown). At Pula hairy vetch plants had higher K2O concentration compared to crimson clover, while at Zagreb differences were not noticed (Table 2). Table 2.

Besides the effect of other factors, differences in concentration of nutrients between two tested species were probably affected by genotype as found for spinach varieties (Boskovic-Rakocevic and Pavlovic, 2007). Location, season and yield of dry matter affected the quantity of N, P2O5 and K2O that could have been incorporated in soil by plant residues (Table 2). Only in first season at Pula hairy vetch accumulated more N and P2O5 per ha than crimson clover, probably as a result of good over-wintering (Table 1 and 2). Based on higher achieved dry matter yield, crimson clover accumulated more N, P2O5 and K2O than hairy vetch in first season at Zagreb and in second season at Pula</p><p id="Pg248">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 922 (Table 1 and 2). Accumulated nutrient amounts are similar to data reported in previous reports (Brink et al., 2001; Odhiambo and Bomke, 2001). Conclusions Better tolerance to low winter temperatures and lower plant heights before winter and during spring were found for crimson clover compared to hairy vetch. In general, higher yield of fresh biomass was obtained by crimson clover, whereas there was no difference in yield of dry matter. Higher concentrations of N, P2O5 and K2O in dry matter were determined for hairy vetch, but the accumulation of nutrients was mostly higher for crimson clover. Based on our research crimson clover could be suggested as a cover crop in Mediterranean and Continental area. References Abdul-Baki, A.A. - 1997.

E-mail: mirjana.brmez@pfos.hr Abstract: The cultivation of soil above other advantages has favorable effect in destroying pest shelters and disrupts their life cycles. The aim of this paper is to present the effect of different tillage systems on population of common voles (Microtus arvalis Pallas,1778). The experiment was done through three years in Baranya County in Croatia, on winter wheat in crop rotation after soybean. Eight different tillage systems: Conventional soil tillage by ploughing – CT; Diskharrowing – DH; Chiseling + diskharrowing – CH; Notillage for both crops – NT; Diskharrowing for w. wheat and ploughing for soybean (year before) – CSDW; Ploughing for w. wheat and diskharrowing for soybean (year before) – CWDS; No-tillage for w. wheat and ploughing for soybean (year before) – CsNw; Ploughing for w. wheat and no-tillage for soybean (year before) – CwNs. Results showed statistically significant differences between tillage systems and years. The biggest number of burrows occurred in treatments where soil tillage was omitted in year before and where common voles remained from previous year. Based on all obtained results, it can be concluded that tillage system has great impact on presence of common voles, and continuously deep ploughing decrease their number significantly in comparison to treatments where deep ploughing is omitted, either in current year or year before. Keywords: tillage systems, common voles Introduction Soil tillage, especially reduced tillage has been often object of research (Zugec et al., 1986; Birkas and Gyuricza, 2000; Jug et al., 2006). Impact of soil tillage had effect of nutritional status of plants (Jug et al., 2007a), yields (Jug et al., 2007b), pest and weed occurrence (Tolimir et al., 2006), aeration of the soil, and finally on general profit in agricultural production (Loncaric et al., 2007). The cultivation of soil by using mouldboard plough has advantages in destroying pests and their shelters and disrupts their lifecycles. In agricultural production, at high population density the common voles may become the major agricultural pest (Jobsen, 1998). The aim of this paper is to present the effect of different tillage systems on population of common voles through three years in crop rotation by counting the barrows. Materials and methods The field experiment Field experiment was conducted in Baranya County, Croatia, at experimental field near Knezevo (N: 4582, E: 1864) for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), cultivar Demetra, in crop rotation with soybean (Glycine max L.), cultivar Tisa, during three years (2003, 2004, 2005). The main experimental set-up was a complete randomized block design in five replications, with eight tillage systems. Area of experimental field was divided into</p><p id="Pg250">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 924 basic experimental plots of 900 m2 for each tillage treatment. Burrow made by common voles were counted 2 weeks after sowing in each year of investigation. Soil tillage treatments 1. Conventional soil tillage by ploughing – CT 2. Diskharrowing – DH 3. Chiseling + diskharrowing – CH 4. No-tillage for both crops – NT 5. Diskharrowing for w. wheat and ploughing for soybean (year before) – CSDW 6.

Ploughing for w. wheat and no-tillage for soybean (year before) – CwNs CT) Conventional tillage includes ploughing up to 30 cm depth, followed by diskharrowing, sowing preparation and sowing with no-till driller John Deere 750A; DH) includes diskharrowing and sowing as for CT; CH) includes chiseling on up to 30 cm depth, followed by diskharrowing and sowing as for CT; NT) No-tillage sowing without any primary tillage operation. CSDW and CWDS are combinations of CT and DH, whereas CsNw and CwNs are combinations of CT and NT treatments. Soil characteristics The experimental site soil is classified as a calcareous chernozem on loess substrate. The soil analyses presented very favorable chemical properties (pH in H2O = 8.1, pH in 1M KCl = 7.5; humus = 2.6%, CaCO3 = 2.1%; AL-soluble P2O5 and K2O = 18.7 and 28.4 mg 100g-1, respectively). Weather characteristics Weather characteristics were mainly specific in comparison with long-term means. For example, precipitation in the period April-July were lower for 116%, and mean air temperatures were higher for 2.5oC in 2003 (Table 1).

Tillage system may serve as one of variables to assess the outbreak risk of common voles together with landscape design (Dellatre et al., 1996) and other relevant factors. Conclusions In three years investigation at the area of Baranya County eight different tillage systems were tested to identify the influence of tillage on the number of burrows made by common voles. The conclusion is that the continuously deep ploughing has the most favourable effect at the number of burrows. It is important to stress out that one year of deep ploughing is not enough to destroy the common voles burrows and shelters.

J. Strossmayer in Osijek, Trg Svetog Trojstva 3 HR-31000 Osijek, Croatia, e-mail: ijug@pfos.hr Abstract: The maize hybrids seed from three different FAO groups (FAO 400, FAO 500 and FAO 600) in four fractions (KO, KP, SO and SP) produced in two climatically different years (extremely dry 2000 and extremely wet 2001) had been different in quality and chemical composition. The effects of year, genetic specifity and seed fraction at the kernel mass, chemical composition (starch, proteins, cellulose, oil and moisture content) and seed vigour have been evaluated. The influence of agroecological conditions during two production years have been exposed at seed chemical composition and vigour indicators (cold test – CT and bulk seed electrical conductivity - EC). The genetic specificity and seed fraction had significant influence at all tested indices, with the exception of the influence of the fraction at the starch content. Keywords: maize, kernel mass, chemical composition, vigour Introduction The seed quality is a complex property which is under genetic and physiological influence and depends of agroecological conditions during the seed forming period. During the phases of emergence and early growth, the most important influence have water and temperature and with their optimum all hybrid differences raised from seed genetic potential will be expressed. Beside genetic properties, the biological factor which is moderating crop growth and development is the seed volume fraction, and growth acceleration significantly depends of seed reserves. El Hallof and Sárvári (2007) studied the effects of the fertilization, genetic characteristics and weather conditions during the vegetation period at the seed content of proteins, starch and oil in three different maize hybrids, and the authors concluded that the oil content was under significantly influence of hybrids and weather conditions. Revilla et al., (1999) in their research found that the maize lines with larger seed fractions should be used for hybrid parents in order to achieve larger vigour in early growth. The aim of our research is to investigate the influence of two extremely different crop production years, hybrids and seed fractions at the seed chemical composition and vigour at the maize seed. Materials and methods The each crop production year has its specific influence at the seed quality due to the unique ecological factors, which was the reasoning why the seed from three different FAO groups (OsSK 444, OsSK 552 and OsSK 644) produced in two different years (2000 and 2001) have been used. From the Table 1 is visible great oscillations in temperature and precipitation regime, where the year 2000 was extremely droughty with strong stress even from the moment of seeding and emergence, through the whole vegetation period, and with severe crop yield reduction. At the opposite, the year 2001 had 300 mm precipitation more than the long time period average.</p><p id="Pg254">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 928 Table 1.

The 1000 kernel mass and contents of starch, oil, proteins, cellulose and moisture were analysed, together with laboratory indices of seed vigour (standard germination test (SG), cold test (CT) and bulk seed electrical conductivity test (EC)-according to the methods described by Hampton and TeKrony (1995)). The measured parameters were statistically processed by three- factorial analysis of the variance. Results and discussion The average 1000 kernel mass for both years was 284,6 g and it was under significant influence of fraction and hybrid. Although the seed production year influence was not significant for 1000 kernel mass, the interactions year x hybrid and year x fractions were significant. The highest 1000 kernel mass was recorded for OsSK 444, whereas the lowest one was recorded for OsSK 552. SP and SO fractions had significantly lower 1000 kernel mass in comparison with KO and KP fractions (Table 2). The seed chemical composition (starch, oil, cellulose, proteins and seed moisture) was significantly influenced by production year, hybrid and seed fraction, together with their interactions (Table 2 and 3). The seed from droughty year 2000 had higher oil and cellulose content, whereas the seed from wet year 2001 had higher starch, proteins and seed moisture content. Hegyi et al., (2007) observed also higher starch content at wetter site, but with lower proteins content for the same conditions. The OsSK 552 hybrid had the highest starch and oil contents, whereas OsSK 644 had the lowest values of starch and oil. The cellulose and the seed moisture was the highest at OsSK 444. Regarding seed fractions, the proteins content was the highest in KO and SO, whereas flattened seed fraction had higher oil and cellulose content. The seed production year did not influenced on SG, whereas CT and EC, as a indicators of seed quality in unfourable conditions (during seeding, germination and emergence) were significantly influenced by the seed production year.</p><p id="Pg255">VII.

J. Strossmayer in Osijek, Trg Svetog Trojstva 3 HR-31000 Osijek, Croatia, e-mail: ijug@pfos.hr Abstract: The maize root growth and nutrient uptake can be reduced due to the low temperatures, which can severly limit early growth and development. The aim of this research was to determine how the three maize hybrids (OsSK 444, OsSK 552 and OsSK 644), produced in two years with different weather patterns (2000 and 2001), and grown under different temperatures (10ºC, 15ºC and 20ºC) accumulated the dry matter (DM), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). The experiment has been coducted in the pots within the climate chamber. In the maize three leaves vegetative stage the shoot and root had been collected and analysed for the DM, N, P and K. It was found that the DM and K content were under significant influence of all treatments, whereas the seed production year treatment did not impact N and P in the shoot. The temperature influenced significantly all investigated parameters except the root N content. The genetic specifity had significant impact at all parameters. Keywords: early growth temperature, maize shoot, dry matter, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium Introduction At the nutrient content of the maize the large influence have agroecological conditions and genetic specificity. The temperature and the moisture are ecological factors which are well known of being important moderators of all physiological and biochemical processes, especially nutrients uptake. Also, different temperatures regulates different order of the ions uptake. Tan et al., (2002) concluded that the temperature of 20ºC in the root zone of the lettuce caused higher nitrogen and phosphorus accumulation than lower temperatures. The phosphorus fertilization and temperature affect the root hairs formation, shoot growth and phosphorus content, as shown by Kristoffersen et al., (2005). Uzik et al., (2007) had been investigated the accumulation and dry matter translocation in ten winter wheat cultivars produced from 1921-2003 and also pointed out differences due to the genotype variability. Nagy (2007) in his research of the year and fertilization influence at the maize hybrid yields concluded that the significantly lower yields were not always caused by low precipitation amount, whereas significantly higher yields were always achieved by high precipitation amount. The aim of this research was to establish the impacts of the seed production seasons, early growth temperatures and genetic specificity at the accumulation of the dry matter (DM), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in maize shoot and root Materials and methods The research has been conducted at three maize hybrids from different FAO groups (OsSK 444, OsSK 552 and OsSK 644) produced in years 2000 and 2001, both with specific weather pattern. Year 2000 was extremely dry, with only 163 mm of the precipitation during the maize vegetation period (April through October), which has long term average of 427 mm. The mean air temperature during the vegetation period was 16.9ºC, which is 2.5ºC more than long term average. Year 2001 had higher</p><p id="Pg258">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 932 precipitation (654 mm), combined with the average temperature of 15.9ºC, higher than long term average for 1.5ºC. The plastic pots were filled up with the mixture of the soil and sand and in each pot 30 maize seeds were seeded. The seeded pots were placed into the climate chamber and chosen temperatures of 10, 15 and 20ºC were set up. All treatment combinations were set up in four replications. After reaching the three leaves vegetation stage, maize plants were removed from the climate chamber and plant material, shoot and root separately, had been analysed for the content of dry matter (DM), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). The plant material had been digested by the mixure of the sulphuric and perclorine acids, with the addition of the H2O2. The microkjeldahl method had been used for the N content determination, the P had been determined by the spectrophotometry, and AAS had been used for reading K concentration. The three-factorial ANOVA was conducted for all analysed parameters and F-protected LSD values for means comparisons were calculated. Results and discussion The shoot N content (NS) was under significant influence of the early growth temperature and maize genotype. In the average for both crop production years, the highest N content was in shoots grown at 20ºC, whereas the lowest N content was in shoots grown at 10ºC, which is in accordance with the results presented by Gavito et al., (2001).

At the shoot and root K content (KS and KR, respectively) significant effects were recorded by year, temperature and hybrid (Table 3). In the research conducted by Banaj et al., (2006) authors found that OsSK 552 had higher K content than OsSK 444 for same level of P fertilization, which is in accordance with values of KS for seed produced in 2001, whereas KS in seed of OsSK 444 produced in year 2000 showed higher KS than OsSK 552 for the same year. In this research the highest KS was recorded for year 2000 and early growth temperature of 20ºC, whereas KR was higher for maize grown from seed produced in year 2001 and early growth temperature of 15ºC. The hybrid OsSK 644 had significantly higher KS and lower KR in comparison with OsSK 444 and OsSK 552, which were not different between each other. The accumulation of the shoot and root dry matter was under significant impact of year, temperature and hybrid, which is in accordance with research done by Rácz et al., (2007). Higher DM was recorded in moist year 2001 and it was in average 39.17 mg shoot-1 and 57.49 mg root-1. The early growth temperature of 20ºC iniciated highest mass of shoot and root (44.24 and 57.49 mg, respectively). The highest DM of shoot</p><p id="Pg260">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

J. Strossmayer in Osijek, Trg Sv. Trojstva 3, HR-31000 Osijek, Croatia, e-mail:Vesna.Vukadinovic@pfos.hr Abstract: Raising of orchards and vineyards, as economically very lucrative and interesting plant growths, is even more appealing, through the subsidies given by the government, through the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Croatia. The subsidies are given based on results of pedochemical analyses. These analyses lacking some important information, vital for land suitability, which is not corresponding enough with high investments for raising orchards and vineyards. Proposed land suitability model will identify previously missing critical attributes for land suitability, such as altitude, inclination and exposition and soil nutrients limiting values. So, the base of the land suitability for potential subsidy applicants will be the map of the area with all relevant information needed for educate decision about sustainability of orchard or vineyard establishment. Keywords: land suitability, orchards and vineyards, GIS, digital mapping Introduction The key attribute of the mapping land suitability is the plant and its growth requirements, whereas other indicators must attain the "indicative minimum". The digital topographic maps with information about landscape, soil, erosion risk (Königer et al., 2002), climate, vegetation, infrastructure, hydrology, frequency of diseases and protection can, with the usage of the GIS can present a complete set of information necessary for the proper decisions, especially in the light of the potential global climate changes (Farkas et al., 2005). The main goals of this research, based at the area of the Baranja region on the “Bansko brdo”, were creation of fast and reliable information system based at GIS for determination of agroecological and economic risks during the selection of the area for establishment of orchards and vineyards, and system testing and calibration in real conditions. Materials and methods At pilot-area of Bansko brdo the soil samplings had been done with soil probe at 40 sites according to the previously determined sampling grid, during July and August of 2005. The soil sampling grid dimensions were 1000×2250 m2. The soil samples have been taken by the soil probe up to the 7 m depth. Geographic position of plots and altitude above sea level has been determined by GPS with correction by WAAS (error ≤ 5 m). At each of sampling sites the 25 samples has been collected by hand probe from two depths (0-30 and 30-60 cm). The samples were analyzed on next: organic matter, soil reaction (pH), CaCO3, ammonium-lactate P2O5 and K2O, microelements (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Mo, Ni) and heavy metals (Cd, Hg, As, Co, Pb, Cr), CEC, BS, soil texture and structure, bulk density, hydropedological values (pF 0.33, 2.5, 4.2 and water field capacity). These results were used for fertilization recommendations, where final recommendation took into account profitability, planned and really possible yield, specific requirements of plant species and soil potential fertility. The Department of Agroecology of the Faculty of Agriculture in Osijek, Croatia, also use special calculator</p><p id="Pg262">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 936 (Vukadinovic, 1999) for fertilizers requirement and soil conditioning for numerous agricultural crops and plants (Bertic et al., 2007), including orchards and vineyards (Vukadinovic et al., 2003). For relative land suitability recommendations for orchards and vineyards the following general equation is used: 1001 % min min1 I n II RP n      (RP% = relative suitability in %, I = fertility indicator, I min = fertility indicator in minimum) The standard erosion risk assessment is usually calculated from the RUSLE (Wichmeier and Smith, 1978), but other, less exact equations can be used for potential erosion risk estimation, such as: 1000 ionprecipitatRERslope REP   (REP = Relative Erosion Potential, (t ha year); slope = average land slope; RER = Relative Erosion Rates, (t ha year); precipitation = amount in month with maximum precipitation, (mm)) All collected landscape information, together with soil physico-chemical analyses results and topographic map layer, based on digitalized topographic map of 1:25000 scale and vectorized vertical altitude difference of 10 m, have been entered into "Input relation base", whereas "Output relation base" contained also previously described recommendations for ameliorative fertilization and other soil fertility improving measures. The final product is relative land suitability GIS for orchards and vineyards, implemented through the ArcView v9.03 software package. Results and discussion Regarding plant growth limitations of the landscape, it was possible to determine desired altitude zones on Bansko brdo (Figure 1) by GIS tool (ArcMAP v9.03), and quickly identify frost high risk zones (below 120 m), frost moderate risk zones (121-150 m) and frost low risk zones (above 150 m). Our research of Bansko brdo found more automorphic and hydromorphic soil types and subtypes, determined accordingly to the Croatian Soil Classification (Skoric, 1986). Fertilization recommendations were calculated by AL-calculator (Vukadinovic, 1999), whose main task is to recommend fertilization doses and soil conditioning. Through the automatisation of the entire calculation, the errors and subjectivity were diminished, and by the usage of mathematical score functions the nutrition requirements for a single nutrient were more reliable since the correction has been evaluated through nutrient availability in the soil, interaction with other nutrients and soil chemical and physical properties, instead of limitation through the single nutrient border values. The results of recomandations were rather low for phosphorus and potassium, which was expected, since sampling showed high soil content of both nutrients, especially in rich soils which were determined at Bansko brdo, such as chernosem, eutric cambisol and similar soils. Also, some sampling sites were within already established orchards and vineyards, properly fertilized and conditioned, but some of sites were abandoned from farming, presumably due to the same reasons as found by Szirmai and Czóbel (2006). Nevertheless, the phosphorus requirements were greater than potassium requirements, what is in correlation with higher carbonate content and lower organic</p><p id="Pg263">VII.

Altitude zones of Bansko brdo Graph 1. Distribution of antropogenic attributes for soil suitability determination The AL-calculator is also taking into consideration lower phosphorus availability from fertilizers and calculations are adjusting required amount accordingly. The soil suitability assessment included two segments, antropogenic and non-antropogenic relative soil suitability attributes. Antropogenic soil attributes, soil properties changeable by agricultural measures, and whose distribution is given by Graph 1, were used for assessment of compulsory actions before establishing orchard and vineyard, and additional limited measures during the grove exploitation period, such as raising the soil organic matter content by manure addition. The most variabile attribute was the available phosphorus soil content (CV = 32.3%), which is the consequence of phosphorus fixation, due to the shallow soil profiles and high soil carbonate content of soils developed at loess soil supstrate. The same is also the most limited attribute (average 73.8% of required soil concentrations), since other attributes (humus, pH and available potassium content) recorded values nearly fully recommended contents. The non-antropoghenic attributes, the soil properties which can not be substantially changed by agricultural measures, must be considered as limitation factor and their negligence or average can lead toward high risk of orchard and vineyard production. Their intensity of soil suitability is presented in the Graph 2. Although most of them can not be changed, some of them, such as the slope and soil water retention capacity, can be changed by high investment in landscape correction through the terracing and irrigation, which is inappropriate for given area with abundance of more suitable positions. The finally considered relative land suitability for orchards and vineyards is accordingly calculated somewhat lower than the intensity of the lowest ranged non-antropoghenic attribute (Figure 2).</p><p id="Pg264">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Relative land suitability for orchards and vineyards at Bansko brdo Graph 2. Distribution of non-anthropogenic attributes for soil suitability determination Conclusions Determination of land suitability for plant production, namely orchards and vineyards, is based on determination of geographical conditions interlaced with soil physical and chemical properties, together with relative suitability of each soil for plant production. The "safety zone" for vineyards at Bansko brdo is determinated at 150 m height above sea level, and favorable and unfavorable expositions have been overlayed at geographical map of Bansko brdo, together with other collected soil indices. Based both on terrain and laboratory research it can be concluded that the tested computer model for determination of land suitability for orchards and vineyards is fast and reliable system for land suitability determination, and it can be the base not only for plant production risk assessment, agricultural and technological recommendations, improved land utilization and protection, but also for the future GIS model for improved National register of vineyard and vine producers.

For this reason, land management should involve permanent soil protection from erosion. This requires preparation of maps of soil erosion risk, as the basis for implementing the policies of soil protection steps. This paper presents results of the investigation which comprises the estimation of the water erosion risk on Croatian soils. For assessing a qualitative cartographic method according to the CORINE program was used depending on the maps of potential and actual erosion risk (scale 1:300.000) comprising the total territory in Republic of Croatia. In this reason pedocartographic investigations were applied with the GIS technology assistance. Research results indicate that the largest part of the Republic of Croatia has a low potential risk of soil water erosion, account for 42.3% of the total area of the country. A moderate degree of water erosion occurs on 24.1 % of the total area and high erosion risk can be estimated on 31.8% of the total area. In Croatia, however, a low actual erosion risk was assessed on 53.3% of the studied area, a moderate actual risk occurred on 31.5%, while a high actual risk accounted for 13.4% of the measured area. According to our results, a low erosion risk occurs on 53.6% of the cultivated area, while a moderate degree on 23.1% and a high degree on 23.3%, respectively. The area endangered by moderate and high erosion risk indicates a probable great damage on the cultivated land in Croatia that calls attention to the execution of the risk decreasing steps. Moreover, in agricultural soils characterised by moderate and high erosion risks, further soil degradation forms can also be appeared as the consequences of the crop production technologies. The erosion risk maps of Croatia can be served as the main source of the information required for planning sustainable land use and soil protection both in national and regional relations. Keywords: soil, water, erosion, CORINE program, map, Croatia Introduction It is well known that crop growth and yield will decline if the level of any soil degradation incidence (erosion, compaction etc.) extends above an value which will vary with different soils both in Croatia and in Central European (Birkás 2006; Várallyay 2006). Water erosion as one of the human-induced degradation types is really serious problem in Croatian relation. Moreover, loss of the soil caused by water (or wind) erosion it cannot be replaced by agricultural techniques. Implications of soil erosion are of the utmost importance for the overall economic development, notably for agriculture and forestry. Primary effects involve soil loss, that is, removal of the ploughlayer from arable areas or the surface humus or/and lower horizons from other areas, which leads to reduced soil productivity, lower yields and smaller cropping areas, plant damage, decrease in soil depth, etc. Secondary effects are reflected in an increase of silt particles in canals, rivers, lakes and reservoirs, pollution of surface and ground waters caused by fertilizers and pesticides detached with soil particles (Basic et al. 2002). Damages to vegetation and changes of local climate, with more frequent and longer dry periods, intensify desertification processes. To conserve the existing soil resources and protect them from further damage, as for sustainable water management (Juhász 2007) a program should be designed for soil protection from erosion, as a basis for land management ensuring permanent soil protection from erosion. Aimed at designing such a program, the project «Execution of potential and actual soil erosion risk maps of the</p><p id="Pg266">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 940 Republic of Croatia at a scale of 1:300000» was started in 1997. This paper presents the methodology applied and the research results of the given project as well as the potential uses of the produced maps of soil erosion risk. Materials and methods Maps of potential and actual soil erosion risks for the Republic of Croatia were made using the method CORINE – soil erosion risk and important land resources (CEC 1992) according to the criteria and standards of designing maps at a scale of 1:300.000. This is a qualitative cartographic method that involves designing and overlapping of several layers-thematic maps, as presented in Figure 1. Maps with texture classes, soil depth and stoniness were compiled from the Basic Soil Map of the Republic of Croatia, scale 1:50.000 and the Soil Suitability Map of the Republic of Croatia, scale 1:300.000 (Bogunovic et al. 1997). Maps of precipitation variability and climatic aridity were derived from climatic data for 70 meteorological stations, calculated with Fournier and Bagnouls-Gaussen-indices (Briggs 1998). Map of terrain slope was derived from contour lines with 50 m equidistance. Vegetation cover map was derived from the forest distribution map, scale 1:300.000.

Scheme of the CORINE method All research was done by the method of integrating digital maps using GIS tools of the NT Arc Info program package. Results and discussion Potential soil erosion risk Potential risk of soil erosion by water is defined as the inherent soil susceptibility to erosion by water, not accounting for the vegetation cover or mode of utilization. This risk is thus the worst possible case; namely, assessment of the potential soil erosion risk is based on the assumption that the entire area under study is used as arable land. Major characteristics of a terrain that have dominant influence on the potential soil erosion risk include soil erodibility, precipitation erosivity and terrain slope, for which respective maps were made, and their further integration resulted in the map of potential soil erosion risk. Further elaboration and analysis of the given map revealed low potential risk on 2,397,409.8 ha or 42,3%, moderate potential risk on 1,366,411.3 ha or 24,1%, and high potential risk on 1,800,264.9 ha or 31,8% (Figure 2).</p><p id="Pg267">VII.

Degrees with potential soil erosion risks 53,3 31,5 13,4 Low risk Moderate risk High risk Water area Settlements Figure 3. Degrees with actual soil erosion risks Actual soil erosion risk Actual risk of soil erosion by water is the risk of erosion, regarding to the current soil cover and the actual land use. In the regions with the type of vegetation cover representing arable areas, i.e., all areas that are not under forests or permanent grasslands, for this reason the potential risk, at the same time, corresponds to the actual risk of soil water erosion. In the regions with the vegetation cover type representing areas under forests or permanent grasslands, the extent of the risk of soil erosion by water is really lower compared to the extent of potential risk owing to the protective role of this vegetation cover (CEC 1992, Pottyondy et al. 2007). Thus, map of the actual soil erosion risk was derived by integrating the map of the potential erosion risk with the vegetation cover map. Inventory of areas under particular degrees showed that the most wide-spread class is the one indicating low actual risk of soil erosion by water, which accounts for 3,020,690.3 ha or 53.3% of the Croatian territory. The degree of moderate actual soil erosion risk covers 1,796,921.0 ha or 31.5%, while the degree of high actual erosion risk occurs on 746,474.8 ha or 13.4% (Figure 3). Actual soil erosion risk on agriculture land In Table 1. results of the actual risk of soil erosion on cultivated agricultural land in Croatia is summarised. Table 1.

Erosion is usually manifested as the sheet erosion, however, rill and gully erosion forms can also be found in any micro-</p><p id="Pg268">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 942 regions. In order to protect the soils with moderate and high erosion risk from further degradation, they should be, above all, carefully managed and then adequately protected from erosion within regular agricultural production. As we suggested, modifications of the soil tillage methods and crop production technologies, have been shown to offer opportunities to reduce greatly incidence of water erosion problems (mainly at actual moderate and low risk). Conclusions Soil erosion risk in the territory of the Republic of Croatia was assessed using the CORINE method, a qualitative cartographic method, and involved production of maps of potential and actual soil erosion risks at a scale of 1:300.000. These maps served for determination of discrete degrees of potential and actual risks, as well as of their distribution. Besides, the Geographic Information System of soil erosion in Croatia was established, which enables users to retrieve all the required information, from data about the main input parameters to final results of erosion risk assessment, in a relatively simple and fast way. Research results and the possibility of their cartographic presentation provide a complete picture of soil production capacities in Croatia, and may serve to plan agricultural land use and protection in agriculture, water management, forestry and environmental protection, all in compliance with sustainable development at both national and regional levels. The soils with moderate and high risk (46,4% of total agriculture land) of soil erosion, should be carefully managed and adequately protected within regular agricultural production.

Sándor ZSARNÓCZAI Institute of Regional Economics and Rural Development, Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences, Szent István University, 2103 Gödöllő, Páter Károly u. 1, Hungary, e-mail: szeles.ivett@gtk.szie.hu, zsarnoczai@yahoo.co.uk Abstract: In Hungary irrigation is indispensable in modern agricultural production because of Hungary’s continental climate and the uneven and few amount of rainwater. The water channelled to the fields in time and to the right place can increase the quality as well as the quantity of agricultural products. As a result of interrogation also we can observe favourable changes in the structure of the soil. One of the basic aims of irrigation is to improve the food supply of the ever increasing population. In Hungary the size of the territory authorized for irrigation is about 200 thousand hectare, about 5% of the cultivated area, but the watered area in reality is about half of that, depending on year it happens. 80% of the irrigated areas can be found in HajdúBihar, Jász-Nagykun-Szolnok, Békés, Csongrád and Bács-Kiskun counties. About two-thirds of irrigation water is provided by water works such as ones in Tiszalök, Kisköre, the barrage in Békésszentandrás and their sub-canals such as ones called Eastern-, Western-, and Nagykunsági main canal. The importance of irrigation leads to use of the existing capacity much more but agricultural producers can not improve irrigation system, because the agricultural production do not provide enough income for them. Mainly crops, seed-corn, fruit and vegetables, both of international and home markets as well as foodprocessing industry demand continuous and good quality of yields which can be proved by the irrigation. Keywords: Irrigated areas, history of irrigation, water management, ways of irrigation Introduction It is a topical question because people living in the region between the Danube and the Tisza have been directly experiencing the natural and environmental impact of their place of living for ages. At the beginning of the 1990s, when there were a lot of changes, a very heterogenic structure could form /50% of the cultivated lands belonging to farms, which consisted less than 10 hectares, moreover the 80% of the owners had a territory of less than 1 hectare/. The disintegration of lands – especially in the territories of the former agricultural plants – led to negative effects. The irrigation system of the big agricultural plants cannot be employed in the case of small or medium size farm production. Because of negligence and lack of maintenance, the water processing ability of the canals has decreased by 80-90%. The canals and pumps state owned need serious reconstruction. If improvement is not implemented in water management, the region will really be disadvantageous also in consequence of global warming / György Várallyay, 2007, 201. p. /. Materials and methods This case focuses on the importance of irrigation system in Hungary and improvement in the examined area in different periods. Analyse about the negative and positive effects of irrigation from the viewpoint of the soil and plants. In history of the interrogation there were some important periods. In the first period /1935-1948/ they built the Barrage at Tiszalök and the Eastern Canal and continued the arrangement work at the Körös river. Some years later new opportunities were in flood safety. Also water arrangement and irrigation were discovered as the consequence of building reservoirs at the hills. In the second period /1945-1958/ in 1945 agricultural land reform played an</p><p id="Pg270">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 944 important role as the majority of the new landowners tried to make use of the land – especially in the low quality but irrigated lands over the Tisza river. In this period irrigation worked in seamed canals. The third period was from 1958 to 1970. Both in case of vegetable producing and plough land products rainfall-like irrigation became decisive. The switch over to rainfall-like irrigation lasted till the end of the 1960s, and the territory of the irrigated land reached 70-75% of the all area. In the four period /1970-1980/ there were tendencies for introducing new technologies, such as reel box and linear irrigation systems. The old irrigation devices became out-of-date and depreciated, so the territory of irrigated lands decreased by the beginning of the 1980s. The sixth period extended from the change of regime to the present day. In 1990s water consumption was low. The usage of the resources was 10-15% nationwide. In the Danube-Tisza valley region – depending on the hydrological circumstances and the use of irrigational water – it was more unfavourable. In smaller water collecting areas the extremities and the uneven division of over-surface water was much stronger, and the capacity utilization could be about 100% /Cselőtei 2005, 39. p. and also see Stekauerová Vlasta - Nagy Viliam: 2007, 1098. p. /. Results and discussion Extend of irrigation shows very big differences in different regions and different counties of Hungary. The reason of that is basically the difference in the plants /type and territory/ and the difference in the amount of rainfall and its disperse. 80% of the irrigated and irrigateable territories can be found in Hajdú-Bihar, Jász-NagykunSzolnok, Békés and Csongrád counties /Helyes 2005/. For the last few years the territory of the legally irrigateable lands has extremely decreased, by 100 hectares between 1997-2004 /Figure 1/. By 2004 the irrigated landsize has decreased by 68%, compare to one of 1997. The size fluctuation of the effectively irrigated areas was considerable different between the biggest and the smallest one, which was 98%. Between 1997-2004 the effectively irrigated lands were 40-50% of the whole irrigated area. The reasons of the decrease in irrigation between the Danube and Tisza rivers can be summed up in the following: - changes in the ownership of lands; - disintegration of lands formerly belonging to big agricultural plants; - irrigation techniques which are only partly adjustable to the size of lands, and are partly soon out-of-date; - the increase of energy resource prices, more than average; - losing the former markets; - economic problems coming from partly liquidation. It is typical for the Danube-Tisza valley that evapo-transpiration in summer is bigger than the amount of rainfall. Additional to drought also temporal drainage can cause water shortage, in dry periods the territories covered with inland water can become very droughty and they can show the biggest water shortage during the mating season. As the puddles disappear, and water goes under the land surface, the extent of vaporizing decreases when there is heavy rainfall shortage as a consequence of which the moisture in the atmosphere decreases and the plants are hit by weathering drought. The biggest contradiction of water management in the Tisza valley, as well as around the river</p><p id="Pg271">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 945 valleys is that it is relatively short. In periods of 10-12 years there are droughty and water-plenty periods /Alföldi 2000/. In dry periods there is need for irrigation in the valley of the Danube and Tisza rivers, which is more or less solved by water cutting from the Tisza River. Nowadays the size of legally authorized possibly irrigated territory is about 200 hectare which is less than the 5% of the whole cultivated land. In the past one and a half decades the size of irrigated territory has differed from 80 to 130 hectares depending on the weather conditions. This means 2-2,5% of the territory of plough land and horticulture, while it means 15-20% of its productivity. In Hungary they additionally use 0,5 km3 for water supply and irrigation of the plant /Cselőtei 2005/. 302,4 81,8 264,3 93,4 237,7 33,8 235,5 125,3 231,2 105,3 210,5 128,4 219,9 134,7 205,7 102,9 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 th o u s a n d h e c ta re 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 years Variations in domestic irrigated areas between 1997 and 2004 Area of the territory authorized for irrigation Watered area in reality of this Figure 1. Source: Journal of Farming, 2005. (Helyes, L.); Agricultural Economics Research Institute From the size of the territory and the 0,5 km3 used water, some years ago they drew the conclusion that irrigation in Hungary is not important.. Although – when vegetable was taken forcing into consideration – the size of irrigated land is at least 20% of the whole plant production. We have not spoken yet about the domestic, fenced and other gardens which are statistically incalculable but have an outstanding importance from environmental, social, health and consumption aspects as well as the viewpoint of export. Irrigation can be decisive in some sectors and has strong influence on the results of the not-irrigated products such as through seed-corn production. Between the Danube and Tisza rivers the amount of irrigation water by hectare is important on the private farms. In the region they irrigate maize, sunflowers, beet and potatoes. First the increase of watered land is really important in horticulture. In case of vegetable, herb, fruit and ornamental plant production they can realize a fairly big profit compared to the territory they use so the lack of irrigation can mean a big risk for producers. While planning and constructing irrigation it should be taken into consideration the chemical characteristics of water and its effects on the soil and plants. The favourable</p><p id="Pg272">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 946 characteristics of irrigation effect are the water management of the soil, which also appears in the plants. Such positive effects are the renewal of water supply, the improvement of nutriment management, the correction of soil structure. The unfavourable effects of irrigation can be important and their size can sometimes be bigger than those of favourable ones, so the soil productivity can fall. The negative characteristics can influence plant production during many years or stop it for good. This kind of negative effect is salinization, leaching of nutriment, condensation of the soil, the callus and erosion of the surface. Conclusions To improve the unfavourable water regime situation, this can be summarised: - the maximal utilization of so called dry production /production of droughtbearing species and spreading of moisture retaining agrotechnical methods/; - detention of local water supply and its storage in inland canals with barrages and reservoirs; - effective water renewal from the Danube or the Tisza by using water processing systems with water canals, decent increasing pumps and delivery pipes. As a hydrological consequence of the changes in climate, in the short run in some 20-30 years there should be a connection between the valleys of the Danube and the Tisza. The aim of this canal is to provide water in the Tisza valley and in the Danube-Tisza region, as well as to fine down the water in the soil, as we can compensate the droughty period of the recent years by irrigation which can get an ever increasing role especially in horticulture and vegetable production. Between the Danube and the Tisza irrigation should not be an occasionally applied technology, especially not in horticulture. Balanced irrigation is the basis of quality horticulture. The maximal agro-ecopotential use of the given territory cannot happen without irrigation.

Hungary e-mail: jprokisch@agr.unideb.hu 2 Department of Solid State Physics, University of Debrecen, Hungary 3 Department of Dairy Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Kafr El-Sheikh University, Egypt Abstract: The bioconversion of the inorganic Se(IV) to elemental selenium form by yoghurt culture was investigated. The whey-yeast extract media were mixed with 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 ppm of Se(IV) and incubated with yoghurt culture at 40 o C for 24 h. Up to 5 ppm of Se, the bacterial growth rate closely resembled that of the control. However, cells grown in the presence of 10 and 20 ppm of Se(IV) showed longer lag phase and low growth rates compared to the other treatments. Red color of the elemental Se was accumulated in the bacterial cell cultivated with more than 5 ppm of Se after 24 h of incubation. A dose independent bioconversion rate of selenium to organic and elemental form was observed in the media supernatant. The inorganic Se was completely bioconverted in the cultured media at the level of 1 ppm after 4 h of incubation. But in higher concentration elemental selenium nanospeheres were formed inside the bacteria as the result of detoxification mechanism. According to the electronmicroscopy pictures, the size of spheres is in the 100500 nm range and controlled by the species of bacteria. Applying only one species of bacteria a very homogenous particle size distribution of the produced elemental selenium can be achieved. Keywords: selenium, nanospheres, bacteria, speciation Introduction Selenium is an essential micronutrient for animals and humans, but in higher dose it can be toxic. In humans, selenium is a trace element which functions as cofactor for reduction of antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidases and certain forms of thioredoxin reductase found in animals and some plants. Bioavailabilty and toxicity strongly related to the chemical form of selenium (Hartikainen, 2005). Inorganic selenium(IV) is less toxic, than selenium(VI) in the soil plant system as it was described by Kádár (2002), Várallyai (2007 a,b) and Széles (2007). Organic selenium forms are less toxic but highly bioavailable forms, therefore they have significant importance in the functional foods, food and feed supplements. Some plant, like cabbage and onion can convert the inorganic selenium to organic, but others can not (Alltech 2004). Yeast is applied for the industrial production of selenium-methionine from inorganic selenium, but we have limited information about the conversion of inorganic selenium by bacteria (Rayman, 2004). Certain anaerobic bacteria respire toxic selenium oxyanions and in doing so produce extracellular accumulations of elemental selenium [Se(0)] (Oremland, 2003). In this study we examined some yougurt making species for the occurrence of this phenomenon. Materials and methods Pure yoghurt cultures were obtained from the National Collection of Agricultural and Industrial Microorganisms, Budapest, Hungary: Bifidobacterium bifidum NCAIM B 02021, Lactobacillus acidophilus NCAIM B 02085, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp.</p><p id="Pg274">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

The media were amended with 0, 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 mg.dm-3 of filter sterilized (Sartorius AG, Germany) selenium Se(IV) (sodium selenite, Na2SeO3. 5H2O, Sigma-Aldrich, Switzerland) and incubated at 40 oC up to 24 h. The effect of Se on bacterial growth was monitored at 2 h intervals by determination of the media absorbance at 650 nm and acidity development by measuring the pH value. Ten ml aliquots of media were removed after 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h of incubation. The media were centrifuged at 4500 g for 20 min at 10 oC to spin down the bacterial cells. The supernatant was carefully collected and kept under freezing until analysis. The cell pellets were washed 2 times in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5) and finally with ultra pure water. To the cell pellet 1 ml Tris-HCl buffer (10 mM, pH 8.0) then 100 µl of 10% lysozyme solution was added (Sigma-Aldrich, 100.000 U/ mg) and cells were incubated overnight at room temperature. The hydrolyzed cell pellet was centrifuged at 5000g for 20 min and the supernatant was collected for analysis (cell fraction). Media supernatant and the cell fractions were analyzed for selenium species by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) (X series, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) coupled to HPLC (Merk-Hitachi L06200A, Germany) equipped with an anion exchange chromatography column (Polyspher, IC-ANI, Merck, Germany) as previously described by Zommara et al. (2007). Selenium standards namely; selenoL-methionine (seMet, Fluka Chemie, Switzerland), and Se(IV) (Na2SeO3. 5H2O, SigmaAldrich, Switzerland) were prepared in Milli-Q water. The centrifuged, separated and washed residues were studied by a scanning electron microscope (AMRAY-1830I) with EDX (EDAX) for the identification of elements in the particles. Results and discussion The effect of Se(IV) concentration on growth of yoghurt culture was estimated by measuring the acidity development and absorbance in the cultured media during 24 h of incubation. Development of acidity in the media showed approximately similar pattern for the control (Se-free media) and the media supplemented with 1, 2 and 5 ppm of Se(IV). However, increasing Se concentration to 10 and 20 ppm in the media significantly retarded the acidity development. In contrast, increasing the Se(IV) in the cultured media to 5 ppm slightly suppressed the bacterial growth after 4 h of incubation. However, the bacterial cells grown in the existence of 10 and 20 ppm of Se(IV) showed longer lag period followed by marked decline in growth rate than the other treatments. A part of the increased absorbance in the media supplemented with Se(IV) might be attributed to the elemental selenium granules produced during the reduction of Se(IV) by the bacterial cells. The cultured media resulted in red color of the reduced Se element at Se(IV) level of 10 and 20 ppm after 24 h of incubation. Diowksza et al., (1999) also observed red color in L. plantarum, L. brevis, L. sanfrancisco biomass grown in MRS medium amended with Se(IV) exceeding 10 ppm. Selenium speciation data for the supernatant of whey media supplemented with different concentrations of Se(IV) and incubated with yoghurt culture show low organic selenium content in the control media supernatant. Supplementation of media with</p><p id="Pg275">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 949 Se(IV) markedly increased the organic form of selenium in the supernatant. At 1 ppm concentration the yoghurt culture completely consumed the inorganic Se and converted it to an organic form in the cultured media. The biotransformation rate of Se was almost constant and independent on the level of Se in the cultured media. For example, increasing the Se(IV) content in the media from 1 ppm to 2 ppm (100%) increased its organic Se by only 20% (from 509 ppb to 600 ppb) at the end of incubation period. When the selenite concentration was higher, than 5 ppm, selenium nanospheres were formed in the bacteria as it presented on the Fig.1. A B C D Figure 1. Bacteria culture (A), partialy digested bacteria (B) and purified selenium nanospheres (C,D) The formed nanospheres have unique similarity, their size is controlled by the type of bacteria. The smallest nanospheres were produced by the Streptococcus thermophilus (100 nm), while the largest were produced by the Bifidobacterium bifidum (500 nm). Supprisingly, the allotropic form of selenium was not the same for each bacteria. Most of them are produced the red form, but the Bifidobacterium bifidum produced the gray hexagonal form of selenium as it was proven by X-ray diffraction method. The formed nanospheres are pure selenium as it was proven by the X-ray fluorescent measurement of EDAX as it is presented on the Fig.2.</p><p id="Pg276">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

This is a mechanism of detoxification resulting in selenium nanospheres of 100-500 nm. Every bacteria species produce different size of spheres. The lactobacillus species could be applied for the industrial production of selenium nanospheres easily. The observed phenomena would have importance in the detoxification of selenium(IV) in soil and environmental samples as well. Acknowledgements This work was supported by Bolyai János Scholarship.

ISOLATION OF SOIL AND AIR-BORNE, FUNGICIDE-RESISTANT AND DEGRADING MICROORGANISMS FROM THE HEAD SURFACE OF WINTER WHEAT CULTIVARS Judit KRISCH 1 – Tímea EIFERT – Zsolt BÓNA – Csaba VÁGVÖLGYI 2 – Lajos TANÁCS 3 1 Institute of Food Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Szeged, H-6725 Szeged, Mars tér 7. e-mail: krisch@mk.u-szeged.hu 2 Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Science and Informatics, University of Szeged 3 Faculty of Agriculture, University of Szeged, Hódmezővásárhely Abstract: Thirty-four isolates taken from the head surface of winter wheat varieties were investigated for azoxystrobin and propiconazole plus cyproconazole resistance and degradation ability. The 22 isolated bacteria were able to grow in the presence of both fungicides, but their degradation ability could not be verified. The 3 Aspergillus isolates were resistant to both fungicides, and grew on minimal medium with the azole fungicide as carbon source. From the 4 resistant Fusarium strains, 3 were resistant to azoxystrobin and the azole fungicides, and one, only to the former. Degradation, but also other mechanisms, may have been involved in the development of resistance. Keywords: fungicide, resistance, degradation, microorganisms Introduction Fungicides are used to protect healthy plants from phytopathogenic and mycotoxinproducing fungi. The fate of a fungicide in the environment is influenced by many factors: climate, rainfall, agricultural practices and microorganisms. New type fungicides have site-specific reactions, and are not persistent in the environment thanks to photo-, chemical and microbial degradation. Non-target microorganisms, such as bacteria, can degrade and use fungicides as carbon and energy source or can metabolize them in the presence of alternative substrates (co-metabolism). Enzymes involved in this process are constitutive or inductive (Hill and Wright, 1978). Target fungi can develop resistance - a stable, genetic adjustment that results in reduced sensitivity - against site-specific fungicides. Resistance may occur as a simple or multiple gene mutation. Repeated application of the same or chemically similar fungicide results in a selection pressure and the resistant fungi become the dominant group in the population (Ma and Michailides, 2004). Resistance can develop by: 1/ alteration of the target site of fungicide binding; 2/ synthesis of alternative enzymes for the substitution of target enzymes; 3/ overproduction of the target enzyme; 4/ reduced fungicide uptake or active efflux; and 5/ degradation of the fungicide. Sometimes resistance is accompanied by enhanced mycotoxin production (D’Mello et al., 1998; Simpson et al., 2001). It is well known that soil microorganisms are able to degrade pesticides, but there is only little information about microorganisms living on plant surfaces. Dissipation of fungicides from the plant surface can occur by absorption and degradation (Sigler et al., 2002). Jolánkai et al. (2006) demonstrated that, two weeks after application, more than 50% of the used fungicide disappeared. Fungicide degrading non-target microorganisms can help target fungi to avoid the lethal effect.</p><p id="Pg278">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 952 Our aim was to isolate microorganisms from the head surface of winter wheat and investigate their degrading ability on the fungicides Amistar (azoxystrobin) and Artea (propiconazole + cyproconazole). Materials and methods In the phenophase of grain filling, ears of the winter wheat varieties Békés, Kalász and Petur were collected in an aseptic way on the experimental field of the Cereal Research Non-Profit Company in Szeged/Öthalom. Of each variety, samples were collected from fungicide-free and fungicide-pretreated plants. The heads were placed on sterile culture medium (glucose, 10 g; peptone, 5 g; yeast extract, 2.5 g; agar-agar, 30 g in 1000 ml DW) in Petri dishes, and the appearing colonies of bacteria and moulds were isolated. Colony morphology, Gram staining and microscopic observations were taken for each isolate. To test the degradation ability of the isolated bacteria, suspension was made of each bacterium, mixed with conidia of Fusarium culmorum, and inoculated onto fungicide (5.28 mg l-1 propiconazole and cyproconazole; 0.25 mg l-1 azoxystrobin) containing medium. Degradation was indicated by the simultaneous bacterial and fungal growth. Fungi able to grow on fungicide containing medium were considered resistant. Degrading ability of the resistant fungi was tested on minimal medium (ammoniumsulfate, 5 g; potassium-dihydrogen phosphate, 1 g; magnesium-sulfate, 0.5 g; agar-agar, 15 g in 1000 ml DW) containing only 0.1% glucose and the fungicide as carbon source. Degradation was indicated by the growth of the fungus with a colony diameter ≥ 1 cm and conidia formation after 14 days incubation. The used fungicides were Artea: 80 g l-1 cyproconazole + 250 g l-1 propiconazole; Amistar: azoxystrobin 250 mg l-1. Artea inhibits ergosterol synthesis of the fungi while Amistar inhibits electron transport in the mitochondria (Ocskó et al., 2002). Results and discussion Thirty-four microorganisms were isolated from the head surfaces of winter wheat varieties. Most of the 22 bacteria were spore-forming Gram-positive rods, possibly members of the Bacillus genus. Some Gram-negative rods and Gram-positive cocci were also found. All of them were able to grow in the presence of both fungicides. However, we observed no mycelium growth when mixed bacterium – Fusarium culmorum conidia were inoculated on fungicide containing medium. The major part of the isolated fungi belonged to the Fusarium genus. Three isolates were identified as aspergilli: A. flavus, A. fumigatus, A. niger, and two as Erysiphae graminis. All aspergilli were resistant to both fungicides. From the resistant Fusarium strains, 3 showed resistance against Amistar and Artea, while one isolate had only resistance to Amistar (see Table 1). It seems that all Aspergillus strains were able to grow on a minimal medium with the azole fungicide as carbon source. Mycelial growth and conidia formation on azoxystrobin containing medium was observed only by A. niger, A. fumigatus and Fusarium sp. 2 (see Table 2).</p><p id="Pg279">VII.

This can mean that no degradation took place, or the degradation was masked by an antifungal compound produced by the bacterium. Bacillus subtilis is known to produce such antifungal peptides (Zuber et al., 1993; Chitarra et al., 2003), and most of our isolates were members of the genus Bacillus. All aspergilli showed resistance to both of the fungicides. The resistance of the majority of Fusarium species to azoxystrobin was strong, but was somewhat weaker to the azole fungicides. It is possible that fungi able to grow on minimal medium containing a fungicide as carbon source are able to degrade the active ingredients, but other mechanisms such as mutation and overexpression of the target gene (Ma and Michialides, 2005; Ma et al., 2003), and the presence of an ATP binding multi drug resistance pump (Zwiers et al., 2002) can also play a role in the development of resistance (Szarka et al., 2006). In a previous experiment we investigated the soil microorganisms from the same test field, and found mainly bacteria from the Bacillus genus and moulds from the Fusarium genus (Krisch et al., 2007). Head surface microorganisms isolated in this experiment</p><p id="Pg280">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 954 showed a very similar distribution. This leads to the consequence that a part of the plant surface microorganisms was probably soil-borne.

Abstract: The examination of silica microremains of plants species may lead us to form a better understanding of recent land use history of soils. Phytoliths – anorganic products of plant species – are taxa specific, therefore diagnostic of distinct anthropogenic impacts, such as cultivation of non-indigenous plants. Present study demonstrates that phytolith analysis is a suitable tool to detect various human impacts in recent times as well and not only in a palaeoecological context. A case study of a well-developed Luvisol from the Bakony Mountains provided good opportunity to understand how complex the ‘life of a soil’ may be, and how all important information is archived within one profile in the form of microscopic, silica-built particles. Keywords: biomorph analysis, phytolith, land use, soil history Introduction The function of the uppermost Earth cover – defined as soil – is multifarious (Várallyay 2007). Besides being the most important medium for crop cultivation (Gyuricza 2007) and buffer of contaminations, it shelters the ’memories’ of human history in the form of many different phenomena (Konkolyné 2002). Not only macrofossils or archaeological findings transmit information on how people managed their environment, but microscopic remains formed in and by living organisms are equipped with notable information package, too. The morphogenetic division of soil published by Golyeva (2001a) mentions organic and mineral (siliceous) particles under the same terminology: biomorphs. By translating the meaning of these microremains, conditions of soil formation and landscape development can be achieved (Alexandrovskiy 2000). Among biomorphs, phytoliths bear with the highest significance, as they are formed of anorganic, hydrated silicon dioxide, therefore resist to weathering agents, processes and remain intact for a long period of time. Phytoliths, also known as plant opals, are microscopic particles (5-100 μm) formed in plants by the excretion of silica in the inter- and intracellulars (Piperno 1988). By deepening our knowledge in terms of how biomorphs/phytoliths redistribute according to present anthropogenic impacts (e.g. grazing, ploughing, crop cultivation, etc.), we can more and more understand historical events. In general, these observations – both quantitative and qualitative – can help other disciplines focusing on interactions between human and its environment to answers questions and solve theoretical problems that could not be answered and solved by using other scientific tools. The aim of the present study is to give an insight to the ongoing researches in this field, and to present results of biomorphic analysis of a Luvisol from a territory with highly complex and therefore unique land use past. The so called ‘wooded pastures’ situated in small basins of lower mountain ridges are humaninduced, though high value natural heritages of the Carpathian Basin (Centeri et al.</p><p id="Pg282">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 956 2007). Recently, studies have revealed many aspects of the botanical characteristics, historical land use conditions and environmental management relations of the pasture in the Bakony Mountains near the settlement of Pénzesgyőr (Szabó et al. 2007; Kenéz et al. 2007). Investigations pointed out that – though use of the territory has changed in each historical epoch since humans inhabited the mountaneous area – grazing was the dominant land use type for a long time, and probably has to be the most suitable. Forms and spatial distribution of land use on the target area has been analysed in precise details using areal photographs of the past (1951–1998) (Saláta et al. 2007). Materials and methods The wooded pasture of Pénzesgyőr is located in the centre part of Bakony Mountains above 400 m and is surrounded by lower mountain peaks and steep creek valleys. Climate of the microregion is moderately warm, moderately humid with an annual average precipitation exceeding 750-800 mm and 8,5 °C annual mean temperature. Present potential associations of the area are Querco-petrae-Carpinetum, Alnetum glutino-incanae, Fago-Ornetum and Phyllitidi-Aceretum. The dominant soil type is Luvisol (Marosi and Somogyi 1990). Not only its hidrology, but its geomorphology and soil cover is also determined by the nummulite-rich parent material, the Szőc Limestone Formation that – due to inconsiderate land use – forms rocky outcrops on the pasture. Soil cover of the wooded pasture was pre-surveyed with Pürckhauer soil sampler (Finnern 1994) in order to designate the locations for sampling. The target profile for the biomorphic analysis has been opened and sampled according to Hungarian standards (Buzás 1988). On-site macromorphological description was performed along with field tests of basic soil characteristics. Sampling for the phytolith analyses was carried in a vertical section (Pearsall 2000). Plant opals were extracted by the common separation method (Piperno 1988) and restored in glycerin. Identification and countings of plant opal particles were carried out at a magnification of 400-1000x by using light microscopy. Morphotypes were indentified in accordance with the recommendations of the International Code for Phytolith Nomenclature (ICPN) Working Group (Madella et al. 2005). Each identificated particle was grouped under the habitat-based classification system developed earlier by Golyeva (2001b) in order to be able to interpret results. Results and discussion According to the on-site description the examined profile can be classified as a Luvisol affected by lessivage and clay migration. A well-defined A0, E, EB, B and D genetical horizon was detectable. The profile has developed on the slightly weathered, nummulite-rich Szőc Limestone Formation. In accordance with its geographical position leaching processes have eliminated the carbonate content. Traces of reductive conditions, such as iron flecks occured in the B horizon. Samples for biomorph analysis have been taken from the upper 40 cm (including A0, E, EB horizons). Qualitative distribution – accumulation zone and downward migration phenomena – of biomorph particles is typical for forest soils (Table 1.). Phytolith content reaches its highest level in sample PA01-3, 4-7 cm beyond the surface. The most notable and most informative is the disappearance of forest indicators (a./2.; a./7.; c./10.) at a depth of 15-20 cm-s (PA01-05) and the accumulation of indicators of meadow-type habitats (a./3.; a./6.) above this level. These trends are underlined by the change in the amount of arboreal</p><p id="Pg283">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 957 (c./10.) and grass detritus (c./11.) units as well. Indicator forms of cereal phytoliths – evidences of crop cultivation – occur at first at the depth of 15-20 cm-s (PA01-05) and cummulate between 2-7 cm-s. Diatom shells (Bacillariophyaceae) and spicules of sponge species (Porifera) in the lower section of the profile refer to water-effect during evolution of this Luvisol. Table 1.

From the lower part of the 40 cm deep layer the existence of a former closed forest vegetation cover can be easily imagined. This is supported by the relative dominance of indicators of forest vegetation – arboreal detritus, trichoms of grasses of forest habitats and coniferous phytoliths – in samples PA01-7 and PA01-6 . The high amount of sponge spicule refers to soil forming aspects of the territory and suggests the altering geographical position of the sampling area in the geological past. The occurence of meadow-type habitats in sample PA01-6 may already be interpreted as ’forerunners’ of a meadow-type grove vegetation cover, which may refer to the establishment of the wooded pasture. The most ’interesting story of the profile’ – vegetation and land use change – is told by sample taken from the depth of 15-20 cm-s. The first appearance of cereal phytoliths along the profile, and a remarkable change between forest and meadow inidicators are detectable. The disappearance of forest inidicators and the concentration of meadow-type habitats supports the fact of crop cultivation and elimination of closed forest vegetation. The cumulation of cereal phytoliths occur between 2 and 15 cm-s. The complex, thus mixed phytolith types in these samples are the results of the turbulent effects caused by ploughing, which is supported by the pure, highly corroded condition of forest trichoms. Another observation, the dissappearance of arboreal detritus from sample PA01-5 and the rise of grass detritus is also a special and relevant phenomena of formerly ploughed soil</p><p id="Pg284">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Conclusions It has been shown that anthropogenic impacts on territories characterised by complex land use history are detectable by utilising phytolith analysis. For this aim the special function of soils, namely that they bear the signs of landscape development has been utilized. We can contribute to the better understanding of human-induced and influenced paleosols and cultural layers by analyzing how biomorph and especially phytolith profiles change and how these particles are being redistributed due to anthropogenic effects int he present and recent past. Amongst these impacts, ploughing and crop cultivation are probably the most remarkable pressures, which are – in opposite – easy to detect. Acknowledgements Authors are thankful to Alexandra A.

ON STORED WHEAT Vlatka ROZMAN 1 – Zlatko KORUNIC 2 – Irma KALINOVIC1 – Anita LISKA1 – Darka HAMEL3 1 Faculty of Agriculture, University of J.J. Strossmayer in Osijek, Trg Sv. Trojstva 3, HR-31000 Osijek, CROATIA, e-mail: vrozman@pfos.hr 2 Diatom Research and Consulting Inc., 14 Greenwich Dr., Guelph ON CANADA N1H 8B8 3 Institute for Plant Protection in Agriculture and Forestry of Republic Croatia, Svetosimunska 25, 10 040 Zagreb, CROATIA Abstract: These investigations aimed to determine bioactivity of cineole essential oil against rice weevil (Sitophilus oryzae L.) on stored wheat. Therefore, three different experiments with cineole were carried out: first, to test efficacy of cineole against different developmental stages of rice weevil in wheat grain; second, to test effective concentration of cineole against rice weevil in space 50% filled up with wheat applying cineole in the concentration range of 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 g m -3 ; and third, to test effective concentration of cineole in spaces differently filled up with wheat (empty space, 50% and 95% filled up). Though cineole exhibited certain fumigant characteristics it would be needed to apply high concentrations (doses) relative to phosphine or methyl bromide to gain satisfactory results. If the problem of cost-effective commercial production can be solved, cineole could find a place in IPM strategies, especially where the emphasis is on environmental and food safety and on replacing the more dangerous and toxic fumigants and insecticides. Keywords: essential oils, cineole, fumigation, Sitophilus oryzae, cost-effectiveness Introduction Many conventional pesticides can adversely affect the environment; requirements for safer means of pest management have become crucial. Chemical inputs are seen to be a primary cause of food contamination and environmental pollution arising from agriculture (Jolánkai et al., 2006). Thus, the application of synthetic fumigants in storage facilities to control stored pests has been a standard practice during the past few decades. Their non-selective and uncritical application brings up some serious issues, such as toxic effects to the wheat that is used in diet for people and livestock (Fishwick, 1988), and contamination of the environment (WMO, 1995). During storage, the primary goal is to preserve quality of wheat and to prevent qualitative and quantitative loss (Győrine Mile and Gyori, 2006). Therefore, the use of safe, low toxicity botanical pesticides is now emerging as one of the prime means to protect crops like wheat, their products and the environment from pesticide pollution, as a global problem (Prakash and Rao, 1997). Generally, botanicals should cause less damage to human and environmental health than conventionals. So, the focus over the last few years has been investigations of essential oils bioactivity in order to find out the most fumigant active chemical components (Singh and Upadhyay, 1993; Lee et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2001; Park et al., 2003; Rozman et al., 2006; 2007; 2007a). This paper describes laboratory research on cineole essential oil as fumigant against rice weevil to find out whether essential oils can act as potential source of new fumigants, as well as whether they can be produced and used in fumigation in economically justified manner.</p><p id="Pg286">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 960 Materials and methods Investigations were carried out in the laboratory of Diatom Research and Consulting Inc. in Canada. 99% cineole essential oil (produced by „Sigma“, Germany) was applied under controlled laboratory conditions: temperature 30±1oC, 70±5% r. h. in darkness. Culture of rice weevil – Sitophilus oryzae L. were reared in the Diatom Research in same conditions. All experiments were of Canadian Western Hard red wheat, with 14% m.c. Three laboratory experiments with 56 samples were set up: 1. experiment –test of fumigant efficacy of cineole against different developmental stages (eggs, larvae, pupae and adults) of rice weevil. By sieving infested wheat all developmental stages of the pest outside the grain were removed. Infested wheat was divided in 200 g samples placed into glass jars of 450 ml capacity (50% filled up). Infested wheat samples of 200g in 450 ml-1 volume glass jars were treated with cineole by dribbling onto filter paper (50 g m-3) that was placed on the surface of the grain. The jars were then tightly sealed. Equal number of samples was set up as non-treated control. After 7 days the samples were opened for aeration and assessment of the results. The experiment was set up in 4 repetitions, and results of alive developed adults were measured two times after the following 13 and 21 days. 2. experiment –test of effective concentration of cineole against rice weevil adults. Each sample contained 200g of wheat placed in glass jars of 450 ml-1 volume with 100 adults 2-4 weeks old. 5 concentrations of cineole (50, 100, 150, 200, 250 g m-3) that was dribbled onto filter paper, and non-treated control were tested. The experiment was set up in 4 repetitions, and number of dead adults was measured after 48 hours. 3. experiment - test of efficacy of cineole (50 g m-3) in empty space, in space 50%, and 95% filled up with wheat against rice weevil adults 2-4 weeks old. Test samples for fumigation of empty space were 450 ml volume glass jars containing 0,5g flour, 10 wheat grains, and 100 adults. Test samples for fumigation of space 50% filled up contained 200 g wheat in 450 ml-1 volume glass jars with 100 adults, while test samples for fumigation of space 95% filled up contained 360 g wheat in 450 ml-1 volume glass jars, and 100 adults. Filter paper that was dribbled with cineole (50 g m-3) was placed at the bottom of the each sample (empty space) and on the surface of the wheat (space 50% and 95% filled up). Non-treated control was set up in the same manner. The experiment was set up in 4 repetitions, and the number of dead adults was measured after 48 hours. Statistical analysis - data were subjected to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) according to the GLM (general linear model) and LSD test entered in the table. Data processing was conducted by the SAS System for Windows 98. The figures that represent mean values were made by Microsoft Excel 2003. Results and discussion The results of efficacy of cineole against different developmental stages (Table 1) showed that number of rice weevil emerged adults being fumigated with 50 g m-3 with exposure of 48 hours was slightly lower than their number in the control, apparently, applied dose was not sufficient for effective control of younger developmental stages of S. oryzae. By testing 5 concentrations of cineole (50, 100, 150, 200, 250 g m-3) during 48 hours in space 50% filled up with wheat, 100% mortality of rice weevil was obtained</p><p id="Pg287">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 961 with highest concentration of 250 g m-3 (Figure 1). Concentration of 50 g m-3 cineole in empty space induced nearly 100% mortality. However, fumigation in space 50% filled up with wheat showed only 50% to 60% efficacy against rice weevil. In space 95% filled up with wheat mortality was 34% (Figure 2). Table 1.

Fumigation of empty space showed favourable results, while fumigation of space filled up with wheat (50% and 95%) proved to be ineffective and unacceptable. The cause could be high sorption of cineole in wheat grains, poor permeability of cineole vapour into seed interspace and into grains, which considerably reduced fumigation effect. In other words, to gain as</p><p id="Pg288">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 962 similar results as obtained with phosphine and methyl-bromide cineole concentrations should range from 200-250 g m-3. According to Champ and Dyte (1976), phosphine dose of 0.03 g m-3 and methyl-bromide dose of 1 g m-3, if applied in airtight space, were found to be enough to gain LD50 test insects, while Lee et al. (2004) reported required cineole dose of 42 g m-3 to gain LD50 for S. oryzae, roughly equal to our doses. Moreover, one (1) kg of phosphine pellets costs about 28.4 EUR, whilst 1 kg of cineole in packages of 100g reaches 162 EUR. Conclusions Though cineole exhibited certain fumigant characteristics against S. oryzae, it would be needed to apply high concentrations (doses) relative to phosphine or methyl bromide to gain satisfactory results. We find such a high price for cineole, and for other essential oils, considering the remaining characteristics (scent, sorption, aeration etc.), as serious limiting factor for application of natural essential oils in practice.

Keywords: fumigation, cineole, Tribolium castaneumn, Sitophilus oryzae, Rhyzopertha dominica, Chryptolestes ferrugineus Introduction The primary cause of food contamination and environmental pollution arising from agriculture are chemical pesticides (Jolánkai et al., 2006). Also, the pesticide residues in grain arising from postharvest treatments (Fishwick, 1988) come from their nonselective and uncritical application causing the toxic effects in the food and contamination of the environment (WMO, 1995). Therefore, the use of botanical pesticides is one of the solutions to protect crops, their products and the environment from pesticide pollution (Prakash and Rao, 1997). Many of them degrade rapidly and do not accumulate in the body and environment; while some are very pest specific and do little or no damage to other organisms. One of them is cineole, the active component of many essential oils such as eucalyptus. It is a cyclic ether with empirical formula C10H18O and systematic name 1,3,3-trimethyl-2-oxabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Sometimes is traded commercially as "eucalyptol". It is readily biodegradable, unreactive and relatively non-toxic (Haley, 1982). Cineole has been investigated as a fumigant against stored-product insects (Shaaya et al., 1991; Singh and Upadhyay, 1993; Lee et al., 2003; Rozman et al., 2006; 2007; 2007a). Also, it inhibits the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (Ryan, 1988), it interferes with sonic communication and mating in leafhoppers (Saxena and Kumar, 1984), and it is a mosquito feeding and ovipositional repellent (Klocke et al., 1987). Cineole, therefore, has a future as an industrial and commercial solvent as well as the potential to control insects in an environmentally acceptable manner, in addition to its existing use in pharmaceuticals. All these observations suggest that cineole has a potentially large-scale use as a benign agricultural bioagent. For this reason, our investigation describes the effect of cineole fumigation in spaces differently occupied with wheat (empty space, 50% and 95% occupied) against three stored pests.</p><p id="Pg290">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 964 Materials and methods Experiment was carried out in the laboratory of Diatom Research and Consulting Inc. in Canada with objective to determine the effect of cineole fumigation of space differently occupied with wheat grain. The used method was a modified procedure described by Lee et al., 2004. Chemical: 99% cineole (C10H18O) was purchased from “Sigma-Aldrich” (Export Division Grünwalder Weg 30 D-82041 Deisenhofen, Germany, EC No: 207-431-5).

Fumigation in space 50% occupied with grain was absolutely effective against C. ferrugineus, with obtained mortality for R. dominica of 89.50%, and T. castaneum, of only 11%. C. ferrugineus had very good response to cineole fumigation in 95% occupied space (88% mortality), R. dominica showed mortality of 64%, whilst application to T. castaneum proved to be ineffective (4.5%). Similar results were described by Lee et al. (2004) with the cineole dose of 42 g m-3 for LD50 for S. oryzae, R. dominica and T. castaneum species. Table 1.

Very good results were gained in fumigation of empty space, while results of fumigation of space occupied with wheat (50% and 95%) did not prove to be successful and acceptable. Probable cause could be found in considerable sorption of cineole in wheat grains and poor permeability of cineole vapours into seed interspace and into grains, which largely lessen fumigation effect.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 967 WATER CONSUMPTION AND MACRONUTRIENTS LEACHING IN TOMATO SUBSTRATE GROWING Gabrijel ONDRASEK - Davor ROMIC - Josip BOROSIC - Mirjana HERAK-CUSTIC - Marija ROMIC Faculty of Agriculture University of Zagreb, Svetosimunska 25, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia, e-mail: gondrasek@agr.hr Abstract: A greenhouse study was carried out to determine N, P, K, Ca and Mg leaching as well as water uptake in tomato growing on three different substrates. The assumption that various physicochemical properties of growing media can affect plant water uptake and nutrients absorption was confirmed. The same fertigation management significantly affected amounts of drained nutrients (327-373 g m -2 ) and plant water uptake (866-911 L m -2 ) between tested substrates. Keywords: fertigation, water uptake, tomato, peat Introduction Soil degradation processes such as salinization, erosion and pollution, represent dominant environmental factor which affecting crop production and require sustainable agricultural management and practices (Szabolcs, 1989; Varallyay, 2007). Substrate growing (Sg) is applicable to degraded areas and as one of the most sophisticated and intensive plant production allows the achievement of high yields without jeopardizing quality product (Savvas, 2002). However, compared to conventional field production, Sg requires huge amounts of nutrients and water (Le Bot et al., 2001). Water and nutrient consumption in Sg can be divided into (i) physiological, that plants take up and utilizes for organic matter production, and (ii) technological, leached (drained) and absorbed nutrients/water quantity. Previous investigations (Schwarz et al., 1996) have confirmed that leached quantities of particular macronutrients may amount to 40-50% of the overall nutrient input, and may induce negative ecologically-economic implications unless reused (Van Os, 1999). Whereas the substrates have various physicochemical characteristics (Leamire et al., 1990, Sahin et al., 2002), it is assumed that these properties could affect water and nutrients balance. Thus, the aim of present study was to determine water consumption and macronutrients leaching in tomato growing on different substrates under uniform fertigation management. Materials and methods The study was carried out from April to November 2002 in a greenhouse at the experimental station of the Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zagreb, Croatia. Three tomato seedlings (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill., cv. Belle) were transplanted into plastic bag containing 11.3 L of growing substrates at a plant density of 3.1 plants m-2. The experimental design was a randomized complete-block, replicated 3 times with 3 treatments: peat, rockwool and perlite. The experimental plot comprised of 3 bags, totally 27 plants per treatment. Uniform fertigation management (rate, frequency and chemical composition) was applied to all treatments, using the nutrient solution of following macronutrients composition (mM): NO3 - 12; H2PO4 - 1.2; K+ 7.6; Ca2+ 3.7; Mg2+ 2.8. Irrigation rate and frequency were adjusted to target EC value of root zone (3 dS m-1), and was controlled daily with a portable electric conductivity meter. Plant water uptake on tested substrates was determined by the water balance method, basis on</p><p id="Pg294">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 968 the difference between total water (supply) input (I) and drainage (D) (Romero-Aranda et al., 2001). To detect total I, a flow-meter was installed at main pipeline inlet, while a plastic collector was set up at each experimental plot to measure total D. According to difference of macroelement’s concentration in supply (IS) and drainage (CD), plant nutrient uptake UX (x=N, P, K, Ca, Mg in kg ha -1) has been estimated by following equation (Schwarz et al., 1996): UX=IS x I - CD x D. Volumetric measurements and sampling of D were performed once a week, while nutrient concentrations were determined using standard procedures (APHA, 1992). Depending on ripening, tomato fruits were harvested 1-2 times weekly, and only marketable yield was analyzed. Statistical data analysis was performed using the SAS software package (SAS Institute, 2001). The data for each measured and analytically detected parameter were subjected to analysis of variance using a GLM proc., and to comparison of means using Tukey's test at p≤0.05. Results and discussion Total I during the trial was amounted 1.197 L m-2 (386 L plant-1). Analysis of plant water uptake and D confirms the significance of differences between the substrates (Table 1). Tomato plants grown on rockwool took up the largest amount of water (76% of I), and obtained the lowest D among analysed substrates, only 24% of I (286 L m-2). Significantly the lowest water uptake achieved tomato grown on perlite (866 L m-2) whereas on peat tomato water uptake reached 74% of I (887 L m-2). Differences in water consumption between treatments can be explained by physical properties of substrates, namely pore size distribution. All substrates are exceptionally porous (&gt;80% vol.) what directly affects the water/air distribution (Milks et al., 1989). Two essential fractions of the pore size distribution are macropores, responsible for the aeration and drainage of substrates, and micropores responsible for water retention (Hillel, 1980). Perlite is known as a very porous and aerated substrate and this property is due to his relatively high proportion of macropores, ca 44% vol. (Sahin et al., 2002). In contrast to perlite, peat substrate has a higher proportion of micropores (ca 12% vol.), the most important for retaining of readily available water. Rockwool, with the highest porosity and water capacity, ensures the best water availability to plants (77.8%), followed by peat (27-42%), and then perlite with only 12% (Leamire et al., 1990). Total amount of N applied during the trial was 206 g m-2 (Table 1). The significantly highest amount of leached N was determined on perlite (42%) and the lowest on rockwool (39%), statistically negligible compared to peat (40%). Phosphorus content in I (5%) and D (3%) was the lowest among studied nutrients. The highest amount of P was leached from perlite (28%) while the difference in P leaching from rockwool (23%) and peat (25%) was not statistically significant. Potassium participated with 41% in the overall tomato nutrition (357 g m-2) whereas the most K was leached from perlite (36%). Tomato plants grown on rockwool and peat released the same amount of K (32%) in drainage (Table 1). Besides N and K, Ca concentration was also high in I (178 g m-2) as well as in D (86-98 g m-2). Total amount of Ca leached and taken up by tomato during the growing period did not differ significantly between peat and perlite. However, tomato plants grown on rockwool contained the lowest amount of Ca in D (86 g m-2), 48% of total Ca input. Total amount of Mg added via nutrient solution amounted 83 g m-2 and more then half was leached from tomato grown on perlite (49 g m-2) whereas</p><p id="Pg295">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 969 leached amount of Mg from peat (40 g m-2) and rockwool (38 g m-2) were not significant (p&lt;0.05). Table 1.

Plant nutrient uptake is closely correlated with yield (Schwarz et al., 1996). When N uptake is correlated with the marketable yield of tomato, it ranged from 3.1 g kg-1 produce-1 (on perlite) to 3.3 g kg-1 produce-1 (on peat; Table 1). According to Krug (1986), tomato yield of 1 kg requires about 2.8 g N, and similar results were reported by Sonneveld and Voogt (1981). Considering that in our study only marketable tomato yield was analyzed, and assuming that a part of UN was probably absorbed in substrates, accumulated N uptake are within acceptable range. Namely, according to De Rijck and Schrevens (1998) and Le Bot et al. (2001), around 120 kg N ha-1 can be absorbed in rockwool slabs. Phosphorus consumption in our study ranged from 0.8-0.85 g kg-1 produce-1, which is by ca 50% higher compared to some previous findings. For instance, Krug (1986) reported that around 0.35 g P has to be provided for 1 kg tomato. Analogously, Sonneveld and Voogt (1981) recorded very similar consumption (0.4 g P kg-1) for greenhouse-grown cucumbers. Higher P consumption in this study was probably influenced by the substrate absorption (Kadar, 2007) and accompanied by immobilization due to precipitation. Namely, soluble forms of Ca+2 and Mg+2 in the presence of phosphorous anions (H2PO4 -) create a new precipitated compounds (Bohn et al., 1985). Correlation of UCa with tomato yield shows that the consumption ranged from 2.1-2.3 g Ca kg-1 produce (Table 1). However, the effect of substrate absorption should not be neglected in Ca balance. These values are likely to be considerably lower, since it was found that, e.g., 1 kg of cucumbers takes out ca 1.72 g Ca (Sonneveld and Voogt, 1981). If Mg consumption is correlated with achieved tomato yield, it ranged from 0.6-1.1 g Mg kg-1 produce. Substrate absorption certainly contributed such high Mg consumption, which according to similar investigations amounts to 0.2-0.6 g Mg kg1 for tomato (Sonneveld and Voogt, 1981). Tomato requirements for K are the highest among the studied macroelements (Lesic et al., 2002), especially during fructification stage, when higher concentrations of K (Ca) are required for their fruits accumulation</p><p id="Pg296">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 970 (Sonneveld and Voogt, 1981). Consumption of most investigated macronutrient was the highest on rockwool. An exception is K, whose consumption was the highest on peat (6.4 g K kg-1 produce-1), and the lowest on perlite (5.8 g K kg-1 produce-1). It can be explained by the fact that peat is not an inert substrate like perlite and rockwool, then additionally physicochemically (ad)absorbs cations in its volume and acts as a buffer (Lemaire, 1995). Possible K absorption by substrates in this study confirming the results of Sonneveld and Voogt (1981). They found that tomato takes up 3.1-5.8 g K per 1 kg of fruits, which is in agreement with the results of Krug (1986), who stated that ca 3.3 g K should be provided for 1 kg tomato. Conclusions The trial revealed that the same fertigation management resulted in different macronutrients and water consumption, as well as in marketable tomato yield between tested substrates. The best water management, accompanied with the lowest nutrients leaching and the highest yield were achieved on rockwool, while the drainage quantity and losses of nutrients were the highest on perlite. As total amount of leached nutrients ranged from 3270 kg ha-1 (38% of input) on rockwool, to 3730 kg ha-1 (43% of input) on perlite, great attention should be committed to recycling of drainage to avoid potential harmful environmental consequences.

Regarding environmental and economical aspects, soil condition improvement and soil protection are needed. For the improvement of the soil’s physical and biological condition in addition to favourable tillage methods catch crop can be inserted in the crop rotation. These catch crops, which are less known in Hungary, are supposed to increase the effectiveness of crop rotation and facilitate the workability of the soil and in some cases loosen the soil. In this research work, different production purposes of catch crops are evaluated considering their implementation possibilities. Keywords: catch crop, soil condition, penetration resistance, biomass production Introduction The catch crop production is a special method of double cropping when following the harvest of the cash crop; next crop is sown to maintain favourable soil condition (Surányi 1952). This research work explores the possibilities of catch crop production in different tillage methods in order to examine their soil degradation-, unfavourable soil compaction- or dust forming- prevention in the long run. According to these research aims, the effect of different tillage methods on cash crops and catch crops was evaluated. Catch crops were qualified as they provide soil covering during non-cropped period, enrich the soil with organic matter, and improve soil aggregation and physical properties of the soil. The goals of catch crop production are very specific and wide; this research work reveals the little-known production aims of catch crops with their production risk in national circumstances. The other research aim is to call attention to the melioration of the Hungarian soils’ condition, with a special regard to the EU- and the national environmental regulation. The importance of the coherence between production method and the harmony of environmental protection is underlined. Materials and methods The experiment was set up in Józsefmajor, not far from Hatvan (Hungary), at the experimental site of Szent Istvan University. This area is one of the most erosiondamaged lands in Hungary, along the edge of the Southern Alföld alluvial fun and Cserhátalja. The experimental site is south-east rising ground with 100 m above sea level. The relief conditions are various compared to the small size of the experimental field. That is why the phenomena of erosion and sedimentation are presented to a different extent. The climate is strongly influenced by the hilly character of the area. The area presents a mean annual temperature of 9,5-10 oC, (16,3-16,8 oC in the vegetation period) and an annual average precipitation of 580 mm (323 mm during vegetation period). The mean values of precipitation in Józsefmajor are lower than the Hungarian annual average. The experimental site is silty soil, with the type of Calcic Chernozem. The soil has good water and nutrient supply. The organic matter content at 0-40 cm depth is 2,83%.</p><p id="Pg298">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 972 The experiment was set up by the Soil Management Department of Szent Istvan University in 2001. During two consecutive years, winter wheat was produced on the plots of the experimental site before the treatment setting up. As with the continuous wheat production the soil water retention was not accomplished, the first crop of our experiment was white mustard in order to meliorate the soil structure. After this soil conditioner plant, the research work started to focus on catch crop production. The size of the experimental site is 312 x 150 m= 4, 68 ha, with four replications in split-plot design. The size of a plot is 13 x 75 m= 975 m2. Each block consists of vertical strips of an “A” factor. These are the methods of the primary tillage, which are the followings: a1: ploughing ( 26-30 cm); a2: direct drilling; a3: shallow cultivation (12-16 cm); a4: cultivation (16-20 cm); a5: disking (16-20 cm); a6: loosening (40-45 cm) + disking (1620 cm) The different tillage methods were chosen based on their beneficial, neutral or disadvantageous impact on soil condition. The horizontal strips of the “Cover or no cover” refer to the “B” factor of the trial: +: with catch crop -: without catch crop. The crop sequence is as follows: 2002: white mustard (Sinapis alba L.) (soil conditioner); 2002/03: winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (main crop); 2003/04: rye (Secale cereale L.) (catch crop+ forage); 2004: pea (Pisum sativum L.) (mulch); 2004/05: winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (main crop) Based on the research aims, we have formulated two examination groups (examination of catch crops; examination of different soil tillage methods), which are as follows: 1. Examination of catch crop effects on soil and succeeding crop regarding different tillage methods by: measurement of soil penetration resistance; measurement of soil moisture in catch crop covered and non-covered plots; evaluation of catch crop as precrop by measurement of succeeding crop yield. 2. Phenological measurement of catch crop with a special regard to the different tillage methods by: measurement of catch crop green mass; measurement of catch crop root mass; evaluation of catch crop plant growth. For the examination of the soil condition, the penetration resistance of the soil was checked (depth: 0-50 cm) by Daróczi- Lelkes type electronic instrument. Soil was sampled for the laboratory moisture measurement. Later on the data of the soil moisture and the soil temperature were registered by fixed probes to the depth of 80 cm by 3T System. The total amount of nitrogen was determined by Kjeldahl analysis. The harvest was achieved by plots in order to make comparison between treatments (determination of yield). Samples were taken in four replications for the biomass measurement via using a randomly located 0.25 square meter quadrat, to the roots’ depth. The green mass and root mass were measured right after removing soil from the samples. The measurement was repeated following a drying process completed in a drying cabinet. After shooting, the number of plant and the plant height were determined; the mulch of the precrop was estimated by a randomly located 0.25 square meter quadrat.</p><p id="Pg299">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 973 Analysis of variance was conducted on soil penetration resistance, number of plant, plant height and yield with the program of MINITAB and EXCEL. Results and discussion Results of the soil penetration resistance measurement It can be stated that different tillage methods have significant effect on soil penetration resistance at different soil depth (Szőllösi et al. 2001; Birkás et al. 2006). Catch crops have significant effect on soil penetration resistance as well, but the stage of plant growth must be taken into consideration. Keeping the adequate sowing and determination time - which are stressed at the literature review as well- are indispensable part of catch crop production. This production factor is also supported by our research results. Being aware of the Hungarian precipitation circumstances, it must be added that soil moisture taken by catch crops for their initial growth is given back in drier period as catch crops provide soil cover thus reduce and minimize soil moisture loss by evaporation. The initial soil compaction decreases by the use of suitable catch crop species thus soil condition will be more favourable under catch crop compared to non-covered plots. Results of the phenological measurement As a result of the phenological measurement, it can be concluded that there is no significant interaction between number of plant, plant height and tillage methods. Due to different tillage methods there were differences in plant development, but before the harvest these differences were balanced, none of the tillage methods was considered to be unfavorable (Figure 1.)

Cereal Research Communications 974 Results of the yield and biomass measurement It can be concluded that the production aim determines the tillage method. Direct drilling is considered to be favourable for catch crop production but not adequate for cash crop production. (The yield of winter wheat cash crop was less in direct drilling treatment). According to our results of yield and biomass measurement, it can be concluded that the applied soil tillage is determined by the production aim. Being aware of the production aim, certain crop species are recommended for catch crop production, while certain tillage methods for cash crop production. Being adapted to the Hungarian climatic condition, successful cash and catch crop production can be achieved (Gyuricza C. et al. 2006). Conclusions The production purpose of catch crop determines the production technology of catch crop too. (Appropriate soil tillage, sowing date, destruction date, etc.) If catch crop is sown for soil conservation purpose, early sowing time is necessary in order to get the longest possible covering period. It is advisable to observe the changes in soil humidity content in order to avoid water shortage during growing of subsequent crop caused by the soil moisture uptake of catch crop or obstructing germination of subsequent crop. If soil conservation is ensured not only by the presence of living catch crop, but also by leaving plant residues on soil surface, destruction date should be chosen carefully so that high amount of mulch mass should not obstruct contacting seed of subsequent crop with the soil. The production of catch crop both for soil-conservation and forage purposes can be coordinated. In our experiment the high amount of green mass was proved to be excellent forage on one hand, but on the other hand negative impact of late harvest was observed during growing of subsequent crop. In that case, when catch crop is grown in order to avoid and reduce nitrate leaching, right selection of species grown and tillage method are important factors. The loosening of deeper layers facilitates more intensive nutrient uptake and reduces the risk of leaching. If loosening is not applied prior to sowing of catch crop, growing of deeply rooted catch crops can be necessary. In this way the nutrient uptake from deeper layers and avoiding harmful soil compaction, as well as biological loosening can be ensured. We stated that in the beginning higher soil resistance and lower soil moisture values were recorded in catch crop-covered plots. We have to distinct tillage methods, as almost in all cases lower soil resistance values were observed under ploughing, but under direct drilling with catch crop, the soil became more loosened. It can be concluded, that the soil loosening effect of catch crop was most effective, when no drastic soil disturbing method has been applied. References C. Gyuricza – P. Mikó – P. Földesi – A.

As the mentioned pasture is a nature conservation area, the usage of artificial fertilizers or other classic grassland management methods in its handling are prohibited. Therefore grazing is an important tool for the management of this area, however the not suitably regulated grazing order and the poorly calculated carrying capacity cause serious problems at some parts of the pasture. The prediction of the grass yield is essential to avoid both over- and both under-grazing and for determining the optimal number of the grazing animal stock and the grazing method, thus the most suitable management strategy. The potential grass yield is easily calculable with a computer model that will be established as a basis for determining the grass production. For the sake of creating the above-mentioned model it is necessary to get an accurate view of the plant associations of the pasture, thus we created examination quadrates and determined all plant species found in the quadrates. After plant determination, we compiled a coenological table in which we marked among other important data the TWR, so the thermoclimate, water and soil reaction values of the plant species and the nature conservation value categories of the plants. We deal especially with soil reaction indicators in our present work because soil quality determines grass yield thus it is necessary to build this indicator into the model calculating the grass production, while the nature conservation values provide further important data to the development of the management suggestion of the protected pasture. By examining these values to different parts of the area, we could get an exact view on the measure of the degradation effects. This promotes the determination of grazing methods and the forming of the boundaries of certain pasture sections, to avoid those harmful anthropogenic effects that seriously endanger this extensive sandy pasture. . Keywords: grasslands, grass production, nature conservation management, soil reaction values Introduction Protected grasslands sustain diverse plant and animal associations, thus their nature conservation significance is unquestionable. The facade of majority of these areas were formed by agricultural utilization, grazing animal husbandry for centuries, therefore the conservation of these pastures is inconceivable without grazing livestock. The Hungarian nature conservation professionals also become aware of the grazing animals in the management of protected grasslands, so by now the rate of those protected grasslands where grazing is applied as a management tool is considerable. However, it is also a fact that in case of these areas, nature conservation activity is of high-priority, while production is negligible. This is the reason why institutional nature conservation cannot be economically profitable, though nature conservation and agriculture are mutually related to each other. Based on this recognition, the overall aim of our examinations is to develop a grass production model, by which from the estimated grass production the animal carrying capacity of the certain pasture could be calculated, what could promote the cooperation of nature conservation and agriculture.</p><p id="Pg302">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 976 To determine the grass production of a protected pasture we need to examine the changing climatic factors. Nagy (2006) agrees that taking the changing climate elements, namely the amount of the precipitation of the summer period into consideration is essential, as it has a determinative role in forming the grass production. Besides climatic factors we need to be conscious of the botanical structure of the pasture, the physiological characteristics of the grass component plant species, the portion of the different grass components to create the computer model. Without these data, it is impossible to calculate the potential grass yield, mainly at those areas where the effects of environmental factors could not be corrected or at least with only a few classical grass management methods. Our data of botanical examinations could serve as a basis for the grazing system and the appropriate grazing method as well, as by the determined TWR values and nature conservation value categories we could judge the environmental state of the whole pasture or of parts of it. The opinion of Centeri et al. (2007) support this statement, according to which, the data on the soil of a habitat is a good indicator of the status of the area. Birkás et al. (2006) agrees that soil quality influence the plant production in the long terms, however land use factors affect soil quality also. Therefore gathering data on the soil quality among others, helps us to determine an appropriate management suggestion for protected pastures, which could support an effective agricultural activity, while it promotes the conservation of the certain area as well. To carry out our research we collected data from a certain protected pasture, namely from the great pasture of Hajdúbagos, that can be found in the Eastern part of HajdúBihar County, Southeast from Debrecen, North from Hajdúbagos. We chose this grassland as with its some 265 ha latitude, by its diverse relief with its multifarious plant associations and with its protected status is appropriate for our examinations. Materials and methods We carried out the botanical survey according to the quadrate method of Balázs (1949), according to which the 1, 4, 9 or 16 m2 sized quadrates are also appropriate for this sampling method, however by taking the characteristics of the pasture in consideration we chose the 1x1 metre size. To adjust to the overall research objectives we developed all together 34 examination quadrates with uniquely 1 m2 area. We located the quadrates by GPS for the sake of reproducing (Antal and Huzsvai, 2007). The development of the examination quadrates happened in March 2006, in two cycles. The method of development was the so-called guided random method, as – according to the diverse relief of the pasture – the four main altitudinal levels gave the estimated place of the quadrates but within these territories, the correct place of each quadrate was the result of random choice. We carried out our botanical surveys twice so far. The first coenological survey was accomplished in 2006 that reflects the late summer – early autumn aspect, while the second one reflects the late spring – early summer aspect, and it was completed in 2007. We applied the handbook for plant determination of Simon (2000).</p><p id="Pg303">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 977 Results and discussion During our botanical examinations at the great pasture of Hajdúbagos, we found all together 104 plant species from which we were not able to determine properly the species of the Juncus genus. Besides this Juncus species, we were not able to determine the nature conservation value category of a natural hybrid species of the Hieracium genus. Without these two species, the biggest proportion of the determined species at the great pasture of Hajdúbagos are the accompanying species (34 species, 33.33 %), however the number of species referring to natural conditions (47, 46.07 %) is still less than the number of species referring to degradation (55, 53.92 %) (Table 1.).

According to Simon (2000) there are six different soil reaction values, which are the following: 1 = acidic4 = slightly calcareous 2 = slightly acidic5 = calcareous, basic 3 = near neutral0 = not characteristic. From the 104 plant species that we determined at the examined pasture, we were able to define the soil reaction values of 101 species. From the six degrees we found only five at the examination site, slightly acidic; slightly calcareous; calcareous, basic and not characteristic values. The slightly calcareous and the not characteristic value category are the two major ones, while the slightly acidic and calcareous, basic categories are not significant. The distribution of the different soil reaction values according to the plant species found at the examined pasture is indicated on Figure 1. Figure 1.

Cereal Research Communications 978 Conclusions The conservation of the Hungarian protected pastures is a big challenge of nowadays. For the sake of conservation, grazing is a very important management tool, mainly because other classic grass management methods cannot be applied at these nature conservation sites. Although grazing is important, it could be effective in a nature conservation and simultaneously economic point of view only, if it is well organized and follows strict guidelines. The overall aim of our research is to create these grazing guidelines for protected pastures. In our present work we introduce our examinations for a certain pasture, namely for the great pasture of Hajdúbagos. Our preparing computer based grass model requires data of the plant association of the pasture and of the factors affecting the grass production also. Therefore, besides our botanical survey, we consider the ecological indicator values very important that characterize the different plant species by their general reactions to environmental factors. The soil quality effect the grass production seriously, thus we examined the soil reaction indicators of the plant species determined at the examined area. According to these indicator values, we could conclude that calcareous soil types represent the best the great pasture of Hajdúbagos, while typically acidic soils cannot be found there. To consider this result during the development of the management suggestions for the handling of this protected pasture is not negligible, as in case of protected grasslands there are no possibility for chemical conditioning of the soil, thus the effects of chemical reaction of the soil on the grass yield should maximally be taken into consideration. The nature conservation value categories show that the area preserves its semi-natural state, but quite strong degradation effect has an influence on it. To examine the nature conservation status of parts of the pasture could lead us to determine the appropriate grazing system at the certain protected pasture. We hope that our method could be applied later to other protected grasslands as well.

It has been, however, indicated that a higher yield can also be achieved by improving nutrient supply in fertilisers. Several plots have been created on sandy soil with humus around Kecskemét with soil well supplied with phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium and microelements. These plots differed only in their nitrogen supply. Our results has shown how much corn ear, grain and grain-dry matter were produced in case of sweet corn with different nitrogen supply. Keywords: nutrient requirement, fertilizer requirement, nitrogen supply Introduction Based on Sarkadi (1975) we differentiate between nutrient and fertilizer requirements. Nutrient requirement was defined as the nutrient amount that the plant must absorb in order to produce crop in a quality appropriate for the cultivation target and in the amount planned. The fertilizer requirement is usually lower: it is the amount of nutrient to be spread in form of fertilizer needed by the plant in order to fulfil its nutrient requirement. If the nutrient requirement can be satisfied by the nutrient supply of the soil even without fertilization, the fertilizer requirement equals zero. If a certain soil type easily absorbs one of the nutrients, or the objective is to fill up the soil, the fertilizer requirement exceeds the nutrient requirement for that nutrient element. The fertilizer requirement can be “negative” sometimes, when the soil provides so much from a certain nutrient element, that it prevents the production of a yield of appropriate quality. In this case, the soil must be deprived of this nutrient element (e.g. in vegetable production if the nitrate content of the soil is too high, the nitrogen requirement is negative). In contrast to fertilizer requirement, plants always have nutrient requirement, since no yield is produced if there is no nutrient absorption. The best way to identify the nutrient requirement of a plant is to look at its nutrient absorption curve. In the course of the growth and development of a plant the concentration of nutrient elements becomes lower. At the same time, the amount of nutrient elements absorbed grows constantly with its maximum corresponding to the nutrient requirement. However, the plant intends to absorb this amount of nutrient at different speeds during its different development phases (Fig. 1.). The nutrient requirement is proportional to the area below the speed curve (Buzás, I. 1987).</p><p id="Pg306">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 980 Figure 1. Changes of the speed of nutrient absorption, the amount and concentration of the nutrient absorbed by the plant during growth It is more complicated to determine fertilizer requirement. If a soil with poor nutrient supply is spread with an increasing amount of fertilizer, it results in a higher yield. If the nutrient supply is already good the yield cannot be increased by raising the amount of fertilizer. If soils with excess nutrient supply are fertilized, the yield decreases depending on the size of fertilizer portions. Theoretically, these curves that show the effect of fertilization can be perceived as the increasing, horizontal and toxic sections of the curve representing the relation between nutrient supply and yield (Buzás, I. 1987). This may lead to the conclusion that the maximum amount of yield that can be produced on a given soil is the amount of yield that can be reached by increasing the size of fertilizer portions on a poorly supplied soil (Buzás, I. 1987). It has been known for a long time, that on soils with better characteristics (such as soils with better water management or more favourable morphology attributes, etc.) a higher yield can be achieved by fertilizing, than on soils with poorer characteristics (Pepó, P 2006; Németh, T. 2006; Izsáki, Z. 2007). It has been, however, indicated, that a higher yield can be achieved by fertilisation also in cases, when the soils differ only by being better supplied with nutrients spread in the form of a fertilizer (Kulcsár, L. 1998.; Buzás, I. et al. 2006). It implies that we cannot produce a yield by fertilizing a soil of poor nitrogen supply as high as without fertilization on a soil of rich nitrogen supply. Materials and methods On sandy soil with humus around Kecskemét several plots have been created with soil well supplied with phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium and microelements. These plots differed only in their nitrogen supply. The nitrogen supply of the plots has been characterized by the nitrate content of the upper 1 meter deep soil layer measured before sowing. On the plots sweet corn has been grown by spreading 0, 50 and 100 kg of N ha-1 ammonium nitrate artificial fertilizer, and the non-husked corn ear, grain and grain-dry matter produce achieved by fertilization has been measured.</p><p id="Pg307">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 981 Results and discussion During the preparation of the experiment we wanted to establish plots with poor, good and excessive nitrogen supply. Previously (Buzás, I. et al. 2006), it was reported that on soils with higher initial nitrogen supply a larger amount of yield could be produced by fertilizing with nitrogen. Unfortunately, not even the nitrogen supply of the plot with the highest nitrate content was great enough for the yield to stop increasing or decrease as a result of fertilizing with nitrogen.

Cereal Research Communications 982 maximum yield produced with fertilizing at 8,8 mg kg-1 NO3-N content. This has been justified by the fact that the grain-dry matter production at 48,3 mg kg-1 NO3-N initial nitrogen supply always stayed under the values measured at 8,8 mg kg-1 NO3-N content. Therefore, the yield increase shown in Figure 2 at zero artificial fertilizer related to 8,8 mg kg-1 NO3-N initial nitrogen supply is not a real increase as when growing sweet corn the highest grain-dry matter produce per hectare should be aimed at. In fact, canneries pay for the yield on the basis of the grain-dry matter quantity. Based on the results of two years of experiments in the next stage of our research we are going to set up the initial nitrogen supplies at 5 and 50 mg kg-1 NO3-N content. It is expected that we will receive the most illustrative fertilizing effect curves at these values. Conclusions It is known, that on soils of better characteristics a higher yield can be produced than on poorer soils. It has been, however, indicated that a higher yield can also be achieved by improving nutrient supply in fertilisers. Several plots have been created on sandy soil with humus around Kecskemét with soil well supplied with phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium and microelements. These plots differed only in their nitrogen supply. In this research the initial nitrogen supplies we have set up proved to be too high compared to previous years. As a result, the grain-dry matter production has been lower even at 48,3 mg kg-1 NO3-N initial nitrogen supply than at 8,8 mg kg -1 NO3-N content. References Buzás, I.: 1987.

These connections can be proofed in the easiest way in forests in more complex topography (Szendreiné et al., 2001), but they exist at other agricultural productions under more frequently changing conditions. One of the main influencing climate factors is the precipitation and evapotranspiration. The difference of them is often used parameter of climatological water availability or climatological water deficit. These factors are very important, because of their role in the surface water balance, determination of soil moisture content. From the other side, their future tendencies are described with a large uncertainty in the climate change projections. Therefore, detailed investigations of their role in the hydrological cycle and past tendencies are requested. Keywords: precipitation, evapotranspiration, trends, climate change Introduction Climate plays a critical role in the development of biosphere and soil-plant processes. As a special regional feature, the basic limiting factor of the agricultural production is the plant water supply in Hungary. According to the expected warming tendency, temperature stress could be another climatological limit, but it still does not happen (Szalai et al., 2004). Basic adaptation measure to the water scarcity is the irrigation. More than 80 % of global agricultural land is rain-fed, but the irrigated area produces about half of the world total grain supply, because irrigated crops yield is about 3-4 times more than the rain-fed one (Hunyady, 2007). From hydrological point of view, water managers work with changing demands for water resources. Additionally, it is usually assumed, that the natural resources are stationary, therefore, the past practice and experience provides a good basis to future conditions. This situation has been changed, and according to our knowledge, it will change further (Ligetvári, 2000). Szendreiné et al (2001) demonstrated, that clay content of soil could be an indicator of atmosphere-soil-plant interaction depending on different topographical exposure in forests. The soil content influences the soil water capacity and as a consequence, the drought tolerance of plants. Detection of such a connections is difficult, because forestry and even more agriculture are effected by non-climate factors, especially the management practices. Therefore, the adapting capacity of agriculture is high (IPCC, 2007). Materials and methods Generally, it is assumed, that warming is connected to the changes in the hydrological cycle. Several processes change: precipitation patterns and intensity, soil moisture, runoff, types of precipitation. Measurements of the Hungarian Meteorological Service</p><p id="Pg310">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 984 were used for the calculations. The meteorological stations situate usually in a more open place, therefore, sometime they cannot provide data for special microclimatic purposes. For example, it is assumed, that afforestation may increase humidity, lower temperature and increase precipitation, deforestation leads to decreased local precipitation and increased temperature. The sensitivity to climate change has a well-defined north-south gradient in Europe. Although Hungary lies in Central-Europe, and therefore, the annual precipitation amount should increase rather than decrease, but a slow drying process is observed making the climate change tendencies rather similar to the South-European ones. Precipitation is characterized by large year-to-year variability, and this variability is still more important than the decreasing trend of annual precipitation. Despite of reducing of annual precipitation sum, the less precipitation falls more intensively, e.g. the general theory about the intensification of precipitation (Farkas, 2005). All these facts show, that the surface balance situation worsens. Less and more intense precipitation reduces the infiltration and increases the runoff. Jacob (2007) reviewed the expected runoff changes in Europe. The runoff of Danube will be reduced by about 15 % for the period 2071 to 2100 compared to 1961 to 1990. Results and discussion The results of climatological observations partly support the global data in Hungary. Precipitation is decreasing in each season except summer (Fig 1.). The summer precipitation has no significant trend. The growing drought frequency can be the consequence of growing temperature and precipitation intensity.

Cereal Research Communications 986 Conclusions One of the largest, still not investigated problem of possible climate change is the changes of interactions among the different geospheres, the atmo-, hydro-, pedo- and biosphere. Still, we assume, that these connections are unchangeable, and change means only the quantitative changes. Some signs show, that crossing still unknown threshold values will change even the qualitative features of the interactions among the geospheres, which can change basically the further development of the complex system of climate (Ligetvári et al, 2006). It is sure, that water will play a fast growing role in our region, therefore not only environmental and economical decisions have to be made, but even political on international level. The another big problem of the climate change is the uncertainty of prediction: ‘Adaptation to projected climate changes, however, requires tools and mechanisms, many of which are still to be developed, to meet engineering standards with respect to the accuracy and quality of projections. Uncertainties are still large, meaning that water managers have to include this element in their decision making process’ (Jarraud, 2007).Acknowledgements The preparation of this paper was supported by the project GVOP-3.1.1-2004-05-0190 with the title: ‘Development of forest management methods for mitigation of harmful effects of climate change and using its benefits’.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 987 EFFECT OF SOIL AND LOCATION ON FIELD PERFORMANCE OF MAIZE HYBRIDS WITH DOUBLED HAPLOID PEDIGREE Tamás SPITKÓ – László SÁGI – János PINTÉR – L. Csaba MARTON – Beáta BARNABÁS Agricultural Research Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, HUNGARY H-2462 Martonvásár, Brunszvik u. 2. e-mail:spitkot@mail.mgki.hu Abstract: The response of maize hybrids of doubled haploid (DH) origin to different locations and soils was examined over two years. The performance of twenty-two hybrid combinations was compared to that of two standard hybrids with commercial value in order to investigate how hybrids of DH origin responded to changes in various environmental factors (soil status, water and rainfall supplies, heat stress). The results indicated that the individual genotypes exhibited diverse responses in different years and at different locations. In general, the majority of hybrids performed below the level of the standard mean, though it was possible to find a DH line that resulted in a hybrid capable of producing yields equivalent to that of the standards. The significance of these results is that the DH lines were developed via an in vitro plant regeneration system and were tested in multilocation performance trials after long years of selection. Up till now only DH lines developed in vivo have been introduced into cultivation. Keywords: soil, field performance, doubled haploid maize Introduction Factors exerting the most decisive effect on maize yield are soil–plant interaction, quantity and distribution of annual rainfall and temperature during the critical late June– early July period. In years with favourable water supply, maize hybrids have a yield of 8–10 t ha–1, while in dry ones it amounts to only 3–4 t ha–1 (Nagy, 2006). The yield fluctuation can be reduced by ensuring adequate tillage as well as water and nutrient supplies (Nagy, 2007). The main task, from a breeding point of view, is the development of genotypes with better adaptability to environmental conditions and soil properties. Irrespective of whether the hybrids are developed via conventional or biotechnological means, it is these traits that determine whether the new genotype will prove satisfactory in commercial cultivation. This is also true of maize hybrids involving DH parental components, whether they were developed by in vitro tissue culture or in vivo methods. The latter is widely used for the development of inbred lines, while field application of in vitro systems need to be tested on a wider genetic basis (Spitkó et al., 2007). DH lines produced by laboratory methods are utilised for favourable morphological and agronomical traits during several years of per se selection (Barnabás et al., 2005). A number of lines selected in this way were tested for their field performance in the present experiments. Materials and methods Maize hybrids were tested at three locations (Martonvásár, Szarvas, Mezőkövesd) in two years (2006, wet; 2007, dry) in a randomised performance trial (with three replications) on different soil types with varying rainfall supply. The soil types were as follows: loamy chernozem with lime deposits and good water supplies (Martonvásár), clay-loam chernozem (Szarvas) and clay-loam meadow soil subject to rapid drying</p><p id="Pg314">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 988 (Mezőkövesd). Ten DH lines were developed via in vitro plant regeneration from microspores (Spitkó et al., 2006). At their origin lies an exotic Chinese line with good DH induction ability and Iodent-type Martonvásár inbred lines with commercial value. The DH lines were developed in such a way that the commercial lines were present in various ratios (F1 and BC1 combinations). The testers were Martonvásár sister line crosses (SLC) of Iodent (IODSLC), Lancaster (LSLC) and Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic (ISSSLC) origin, together with a fourth SLC tester not related to any of the above (NRSLC). FAO 390 and FAO 450 standards were included in the experiment. The traits evaluated included grain yield (t ha-1), grain moisture at harvest (%) and hectolitre mass (kg hl-1), a trait with increasing importance. Yield data were converted to 15% grain moisture content and subjected to three-way (genotype, year and location) analysis of variance (Sváb, 1981). Results and discussion Three-locational data collected over two years were compared to the standard yields (Table 1). The grand mean of yield (8.46 t ha-1) was significantly lower than the standard mean (9.75 t ha-1), but one combination (DH56×NRSLC: 9.45 t ha-1) was found which did not differ significantly from the mean of the commercial hybrids. The yield of this genotype was comparable to the standard mean in both years at all locations (2006: 11.13 t ha—1 vs. standard mean: 11.46 t ha—1; 2007: 7.77 t ha—1 vs. standard mean: 7.98 t ha—1) However, this yield was coupled with a mean grain moisture content at harvest of 19.7%, which was significantly higher than the standard mean (Table 1). In general, hybrids with DH parental components were more similar to the FAO 450 standard, having a longer vegetation period and higher grain moisture content at harvest, but in most cases grain yield did not come up to expectations. With respect to hectolitre mass, the standard mean and the grand mean did not differ significantly, indicating that most of the combinations satisfied the 71 kg hl-1 requirement. However, hectolitre mass is a relative index, which does not reflect the real value of a hybrid combination. Almost two-thirds of the genotypes tested had values higher than the limit, whereas one of the standards did not satisfy this criterion in either year (FAO 450: 69.48 kg hl-1), confirming that hybrids giving outstanding general performance in previous years may also have low hectolitre masses. The differences in yield and grain moisture at harvest over years and locations are presented in Table 2. The considerable differences in mean summer temperature and rainfall in the two years (data not shown) resulted in substantial yield variations. The yield in 2006, which was favourable for maize production, was more than half more than that achieved in 2007. The rapid drying down of the plants and the rainfall deficiency in 2007 led to faster withering, so the grain moisture at harvest was lower in the second year.</p><p id="Pg315">VII.

Cereal Research Communications 990 genotype and year (Rácz et al., 2006). This suggests that yield losses in 2007 were due not only to the drying out of the soil, but to an even greater extent by the atmospheric drought at flowering. The effect of the location (soil) on the yield is demonstrated in the last three lines of Table 2. The better seed setting and higher yield averages achieved on the moderately heavy chernozem soils at the excellent maize-growing locations in Martonvásár and Szarvas could be attributed in part to their good water management. The rapid drying out of the otherwise high-quality meadow alluvial soil in Mezőkövesd resulted in yield losses of 25-30% for the given hybrids. Conclusions The differing water retention traits of loam and clay soils are of particular importance when weather conditions are unfavourable for maize production. From the point of view of breeding, combinations found in performance trials at multiple locations to have excellent yield stability can be recommended for general cultivation. The interactions between these two factors, together with the joint resultant of the year will determine the actual maize yield average that can be achieved in a given year. For the majority of the maize hybrids examined in the present multilocation trials, all of which had DH parental components, the yields achieved did not satisfy breeding criteria. Nevertheless, it proved possible to identify one hybrid combination whose performance was on par with that of commercial hybrids, despite the limited number of initial materials, which represented a genetically narrow spectrum. This result is significant not because the given combination outyielded the standard (from this point of view none of the hybrids would be granted registration), but because of the origin of the lines. The DH lines used in the combinations not only had satisfactory combining ability, but also retained the haploid induction ability of the Chinese partner suggesting that they could be used for the development of in vitro DH lines with real commercial value. The DH hybrid combinations tested in the present work were at most equal, but not exceeding the standard mean, but if the studies are extended to include a wider range of genetic sources, the in vitro DH technique could be utilised for the purposes of hybrid development.

Five infiltration measurement were made in each of three treatments. The results showes that the forest soil has the highest steady infiltration rate. The infiltration rate for the forest was about 2.5 times higher compared with the meadow and about 6 times higher compared with the cultivated soil. The soil water content for a selected pressure was the highest in the forest soil in the 0–15 cm depth compared with the meadow and cultivated soils. The meadow and cultivated soils did not show any significant (P &lt;0.05) difference in soil water content at the 0.0, –33 and –1500 kPa pressure. Results show that the forest soil can accept and store more available water than meadow and cultivated soils in the 0–30 cm depth. Keywords: forest, meadow, tillage, fluvisol, infiltration, soil water retention, bulk density. Introduction Deforestation affected the hydrologic balance, creating unregulated stream flows and increasing the risk of sol erosion, floods and droughts. The major reasons for these problems are increased run-off due to low infiltration rates and a decrease in soil water retention. Knowledge of soil water dynamics is important for a landscape sustainable development guarantee (Laczová and Štekauerová, 2007). Changes of physical and hydrophysical characteristics of the soil surface layer or of the root zone depend on vegetation type (Štekauerová et al., 2006). Retention has a significant influence on water regime of soil (Gomboš, 2007). Many studies have reported the changes in soilwater retention and physical properties of soils after forest clearing for agricultural purposes (Blanco-Canqui et al., 2004; Seobi et al., 2005; Yangbing et al., 2006). The objective of this study was to measure and compare the rates of infiltration and soil water retention for forest, meadow and crop treatments of a gleyic fluvisol in adjacent fields with the same site conditions. In addition, soil bulk density were evaluated. Materials and methods The study site was located in the Kolubara river valley, western part of Serbia (20o13'N, 44o28'E). The soils of the area are formed mainly in poorly carbonated alluvial deposit (the first dry terrace of the Kolubara river). They are classified as non-carbonated siltyclayey semigley, according to local soil classification system (Gajić et al., 2006), or gleyic fluvisol according to IUSS Working Group WRB (FAO, 2006). Soil samples from arable field profiles were collected in summer 2000, immediately after wheat harvest. At the same time, close to the cultivated soil sampling sites (at the distance of about 150 m), profiles were opened under native forest vegetation, comprised of the community of common oak and common ash (As. Querceto-raxinetum</p><p id="Pg318">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 992 serbicum, Rud.) and under meadow vegetation, with abundant participation of black medick (Medicago lupulina) and sweet peas (Lathyrus sp.). Infiltration rates were measured by using a double-ring infiltrometer (Bouwere, 1986). A constant head of water 3 cm deep was maintained in both the 30 cm diameter inner ring and the 60 cm diameter buffer (outer) ring. Five replicates were carried out at randomly selected locations within each plot. Steady state infiltration rates are reported. Undisturbed soil cores, 5.0 cm in diameter and 5.1 cm in height, were taken to determine soil water retention (SWR) at matric potentials of 0.0 and –33 kPa, and bulk density (b). Cores were taken from three depths: 0–15, 15–30 and 30–45 cm. Five core samples were removed from the middle of each depth from all three treatments. Sieved (&lt;2 mm) soil samples were used to measure SWR at –1500 kPa pressure retention. SWR was determined in five replications for each sample in 5 and 15 bar pressure plate extractors (Soil Moisture Equipment Corp., Santa Barbara, CA). Volumetric values for the SWE were calculated from the gravimetric measures using b. The water retention relationship was used to obtain the soil water parameters at field capacity, permanent wilting point and plant available water capacity (AWC). Plant AWC was calculated from difference in soil moisture content at field capacity (–33 kPa) and wilting point (–1500 kPa). Gravimrtric soil water content and b were determined by oven drying (105oC). Standard laboratory methods were followed (van Reeuwijk, 1995). Statistical analysis were performed using SPSS 9.0.1 software (SPSS Inc., 1999, Chicago, IL). Results and discussion Steady infiltration rate The mean steady infiltration rates and the least significant differences (LSD) for the forest, meadow and cultivated soils are shown in Table 1. Results obtained from this study are consistent with previous studies that show the influence of vegetation and management systems on infiltration. As shown from these results, the soil under forest cover showed a significantly (P &lt;0.05) higher steady state infiltration rate than agriculture uses. Infiltration rate was greater in the meadow than the crop field. Gray (1973) observed three to six times greater infiltration under forest cover compared with row crop management. He attributed these differences to increased porosity. Small infiltration in the cultivated soils could be a result of the break-up of soil structure by cultivation and compaction from farm implements (Bharati et al., 2002). Table 1.

LDS, least significant difference. Soil water retention as a function of soil water pressure was significantly greater in forest soil than for meadow or cultivated soils at 0.0 and –33 kPa pressures in the 0–15 and 15–30 cm depth. Saturated water content of the forest soil at all depths were significantly different from those of the cultivated and meadow soils. Seobi et al. (2005) reported that cultivated soil had lower water content than the grass buffer and agroforestry at 0.0 and –0.4 kPa soil water pressure. According to Gyuricza et al. (2007) changes in the total porosity occurred due to the changes in the macroporosity since the meso- and the microporosity were not affected by soil management. At –33 kPa retention of water in the upper 0–15 cm was about 5% lower in meadow and cultivated soils than in forest. Water content at –33 kPa pressure was greater for the forest and cultivated soils compared with the meadow in the 15–30 and 30–45 cm depth. The forest had significantly lower water content from –1500 kPa compared with the meadow and cultivated soils in the 0–15 depth. This was probably because continuous cultivation increases fine pores, lowers organic matter content and destroys macropores (Hussain et al., 1998). In the 15–30 and 30–45 cm depth forest show almost the same water content as the meadow and cultivated soils at –1500 kPa pressure. Messing et al. (1997) found no differences in soil water retention between grass pasture and trees for a high clay content soil. These findings support our observations in the current study. The forest</p><p id="Pg320">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 994 had significantly greater available water capacity compared with the meadow and cultivated soils in the 0–30 cm depth. The bulk density was significantly smaller for forest compared with the meadow and cultivated soils. Bharati et al., (2002) and Seobi et al. (2005) made similar observations. Conclusions Results showed that soil infiltration rates are significantly smaller under the cultivated soil (4.26 cm h–1) and meadow (10.17 cm h–) than under forest (25.23 cm h–1). The cultivated and meadow soils had smaller water content than the forest at 0.0 kPa soil water pressure. The forest had significantly greater water content than the meadow and cultivated soils at –33 and –1500 kPa for the first (0–15 cm) sampling depth. Available water capacity data from this study show that forest can store more water in the upper 45 cm of soil compared with the meadow and cultivated soil. The bulk densities of the cultivated soil and the meadow were significantly larger than that of the forest. References Bharati, L., Lee, K. H., Isenhart, T. M., Schultz, R. C. 2002.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 995 INFLUENCE OF LIMING ON YIELD AND CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF ALFALFA ON AN ACID SOIL Goran DUGALIĆ1 – Boško GAJIĆ2 – Slobodan KATIĆ3 – Vladeta STEVOVIĆ1 1 Faculty of Agronomy, Cara Dušana 34, 32000 Čačak, Serbia, e-mail: dugalic@tron-inter.net 2 Institute of Soil and Melioration, Faculty of Agriculture, Belgrade University, Nemanjina 6, 11080 Belgrade, Serbia, e-mail: bonna@agrifaculty.bg.ac.yu 3 Institute of Field and Vegetable Crops, 21000 Novi Sad Abstract: An on-farm field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of lime application on chemical composition, leaf to stem ratio, stem height and herbage yield in dryland alfalfa during a three-year period. The soil of the experiment site was silty-loam, pseudogley (Stagnosols). The experiment was conducted in a randomized complete block design with three rates of ground limestone (0, 3 and 6 t ha –1 ). Lime application has a significant beneficial impact on herbage yield, crude protein content, stem height and leaf to stem ratio of alfalfa. Increasing amounts of lime had a significant effect on the concentration of nutrient elements in dried herbage of alfalfa. Lime applications significantly increased soil pH and improved the bioavailability of P, K, Ca and Mg in the treated soil. Liming significantly reduced the Fe, Al, Mn, Zn and Cu contents in the soil. Keywords: acid soil, liming, chemical properties, pH, pseudogley, alfalfa, yield, elemental composition. Introduction Soil acidity is one of the limiting factors affecting the production and sustainability of pastures and crops in many parts of the word. Approximately 30% of the world’s arable soils are acidic. These soils are characterized as containing excess Al3+ and Mn2+ as well as deficiencies of calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), phosphorus (P) and some trace elements (Dall’s et al., 1996). Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) is one of the crops most susceptible to soil acidity. The most suitable soils for alfalfa growing are considered to be those of neutral to weakly alkaline reaction, with pH ranging from 6.6–7.5 (Lanyon and Griffith, 1988). Rational use of soils and the maintenance of their multifunctionality is key issue in sustainable systems (Kanižai et al., 2007). The present investigation was conducted to compare the effects of different lime rates on some chemical soil properties, herbage yield, stem height, leaf to stem ratio, crude protein content and elemental composition of alfalfa grown in acid, pseudogley, soil. Materials and methods Site and soil description The 3 year (2004–2006 growing seasons) field experiment was conducted at the Experimental Farm of Agricultural secondary school in Kraljevo, located in the northwestern part of Serbia (43o36'N, 20o49'E, altitude 206 m a.s.l). The soil of the experiment site was deep, silty-loam, very strongly acid, pseudogley, according to the Serbian soil classification system, or Stagnosols in the FAO classification system (FAO, 2006). The soil had 65% silt and 23% clay. The bulk density was 1.48–1.49 g cm–3. In the top 30cm organic C was about 1.3%. The detailed presentation of physical and chemical characteristics of these soils is given previously (Dugalić, 1997). The site has a moderately continental climate, caracterized by cold winters and hot and very dry summers, with mean minimum and maximum temperatures of 1.2 and 20.3oC, respectively. The average rainfall is 749 mm per year, falling mostly in spring and</p><p id="Pg322">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 996 summer. In all 3 yr of the study the growing seasons were characterized by rather favorable conditions with warm temperatures and regular rainfall during the summer. Experimental design and treatments The field experiment was designed as a randomized complete block with three replicates. The size of a basic plot was 10.0 m2 (5 m x 2 m). The main treatment was liming with three levels: no lime added (control), 3 Mg ha–1 lime and 6 Mg ha–1 lime. Alfalfa (cultivar “NS Mediana ZMS V”) seed was inoculated with Rhizobium meliloti just before sowing. Seed was broadcasted in rows at 1–2 cm depth, with a space of 0.12 m between rows. Seeding rate was 18 kg ha–1. Date sowing was 6 April 2004. Ground limestone (a calcite, comprising 98.5% CaCO3 and 1% MgCO3) with a neutralising value of 90% was broadcasted and mixed in the top 0.25 m layer by roto-tilling three weeks before alfalfa sowing. Plant harvest and analysis The alfalfa was harvested to a 50 mm stubble height when the plants in the control treatment reached I/10th bloom. There were three harvests in 2004 (07 July, 11 August and 22 October) and four harvests in 2005 (19 May, 28 July, 03 August and 27 September) and 2006 (17 May, 22 June, 24 July and 04 September). Subsamples were collected from the yield sample, weighed, and dried for 24 h at 65oC to determine dry mater yield and nutrient content. Crude protein was determined by the method of Isaac and Johnson (1976). Concentration of K in the digest was measured by flame photometry (Anon, 1977). The measure Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe, Zn, Cu, B, subsamples of ground, dried herbage were digested in nitric and perchloric acids (AOAC, 1975). The concentration of all the elements in the digest was measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Ten plants in each plot were randomly selected to determine the height plants and leaf to stem ratio. Soil analysis Soil samples were collected from the pots just befor sowing (06 April 2004) and after the last harvest (04 September 2006). Each time, five random soil cores (0–0.30 m depth) were collected from all plots and then bulked to create one sample per plot. Soil pH was determined in 1:2.5 soil/water suspension (Rowell, 1997), P and K by extractions with Al-slution (Egner et al., 1960). Extractable Ca, Mg, Al, Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy, and B was analyzed colorimetrically by azomethine-H color development at 420 nm. Results and discussion pH and selected characteristics of the pseudogley Chemical properties of the pseudogley soil, prior to liming and after the final harvest of alfalfa in 2006 season are listed in Table 1. The low (3 t ha–1) and high (6 t ha–1) lime treatments significantly increased soil water pH by 1.07 and 1.67 units, respectively. In this study, lime applications significantly increased the extractable P, K, Ca and Mg in the soil. In contrast, liming significantly reduced the level of extractable Al in the tested soil. These results concur with conclusion made by Rosellini et al., 2003; Bowszys et al. (2005) and Lončarić et al. (2007). Concentrations of plant essential trace elements: Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu in pseudogley soil significantly decreased with increasing lime addition. Bowszys et al. (2005) and Karalić et al. (2007) reported similar findings. Concentrations</p><p id="Pg323">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 997 in the soil of B significantly increased when soil was treated with lime compared to the control. Table 1.

Dry matter herbage yield, stem height, leaf to stem ratio and crude protein content Applications of lime significantly increased total dried herbage yields (Table 2). The total yields listed in Table 2. were obtained by adding the yields of all harvests 2004– 2006. Herbage yield of alfalfa in all the cuttings increased significantly with lime application (data not shown). Other studies also have demonstrated that liming can significantly increase dry matter herbage yield of alfalfa (Chen et al., 2001; Popović et al., 2007). In this study, lime application significantly increased leaf to stem ratio and crude protein content of alfalfa (Table 2). Table 2.

Concentration of nutrient elements in dried shoots In this study, application of the higher level of lime appeared to have the best effect on P, K, Ca and Mg accumulation in alfalfa tissues (Table 2). The concentration of Al, Mn, Fe and Zn in dried herbage significantly decreased with increasing lime addition. Similar results are reported by Chen et al. (2001); Grewal and Williams (2003); Karalić</p><p id="Pg324">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 998 et al. (2007). Popović et al. (2007) reported that status of P, K, Mg and Cu in alfalfa hay was not changed by application of higher rates of lime. Chemical analysis of the dried herbage from alfalfa showed that the amount of lime applied had no effect on the concentration of Cu and B (data not shown). Conclusions Results of this study suggest that liming on acid pseudogley soil, with 3 and 6 t ha–1 of ground limestone, not only increases dried herbage yield, but also improves leaf to stem ratio, crude protein content, stem height, and Ca, Mg, P and K content in alfalfa. The present study clearly indicated that applications of lime, particulary for heavy aplication ground limestone (6 t ha–1), significantly increased the pH value and markedly minimizes the potentially toxic effects of Al, Mn, Fe and Zn by reducing their concentration in alfalfa shoots.

According to the data referring to the EU-25 states, energy production will be lower by 6% in 2030 than it was in 2007. This will result in the increase of the EU’s energy dependence, therefore the increase of the proportion of renewable energy resources is a strategic interest for all Member States of the EU. Among renewable energy resources, Hungary has its big opportunities in the energetic utilization of biomass that is mainly of agricultural origin. The aim of this study is to give answer to the land utilization question basically determining the success of biomass utilization of energetic purposes concerning Hajdú-Bihar county and its neighboring Bihor county in Romania. Keywords: land use, bioenergetic aspects, biofuel production –plant–soil interrelation Introduction The protection of our wider and closer environment and therefore the improvement of the quality of our life is an attractive aim. Everyone would like to live in a calm and pleasant environment. It is a declared effort of every society to provide a suitably healthful environment. Nevertheless, the question is where, when, to what extent and within what conditions it can be realized, how the tasks can be clearly formulated by means of attractive and realistic concepts and programmes, to what extent it can motivate the society to realize them (Várallyay, 2006). The utilization of biomass with energetic purposes and the increase of the proportion of primary energy resources arising from it can greatly enhance life quality. There was a tendency of decline in the primary energy production of Hungary during the past years (630 petajoule in 1990, 424,9 petajoule in 2004), nevertheless, the proportion of natural gas has significantly increased (45%) among the available energy resources, that can increases our energy dependence (Lukács, 2007). This dependence can be partially eased by the ”green” energies. The proportion of energy that can be gained from renewable energy sources is very low in our country, it hardly reaches 4%. By utilizing biomass of agricultural origins for energetic purposes, this ratio can be significantly increased even in the long run. The size of the energy sources that can be gained this way is basically determined by the amount of biomass potentially available in the vicinity of the plants, the infrastructure of the region and the demand for alternative energy resources on the market in the future. Nevertheless, it is important to consider that there can be serious disorders in the raw material supply of biodiesel and bioethanol production plants. For today, both domestic and international professional societies are anxious about the production of biofuels (Scharlemann- Laurance, 2008). Among these points we could emphasize the environmental load generated by raw material production, the air and sound pollution caused by the transport of raw materials and final products, or the food market disorder arising owing to the supplementary demand. Besides it also has to be noted that the regenerative ability of fertile soil is</p><p id="Pg326">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1000 limited (Várallyay, 2007). This is why it is so important to lay huge emphasis on the mapping of available and possible factors (environmental resources, acceptability by the society, infrastructure, etc.), even from a cross-border aspects, thinking in a unique European space. Material and methods The already functioning and planned biofual production plants of Hajdú-Bihar county significantly exceeds the potential raw material supply of the region. Therefore, the aim of the study is to assess the production sites available in Bihor county that could be utilized economically by the plants working in Hajdú-Bihar county. Considering that shouldn't be occur any irreversible change in the soil - plant relationship system during the bioenergetic utilization of crop land. Apart from this, we also wanted to examine the extent to which our neighboring county could be our competitor in the utilization of biomass and the production of biofuels. We used the database of the Central Statistical Office (CSO) and the Institutul National De Statistica (INSSE) to carry out this examination. Results and discussion As the natural endowments also show, the economy of Bihor county can be classified as industrial-agricultural. Based on the agricultural performance of the county, it is the fourth one among the Romanian counties’ rank, primarily owing to its significant maize production and the animal husbandry sector, as this county has the second biggest pig population and the fifth biggest cattle population. The proportion of agricultural areas can be considered bigger mainly along the border. Hajdú-Bihar county (area: 6211 km2), that lays in the Hungarian-Romanian cross-border region and Bihor county (area: 7544 km2) are mainly under agricultural cultivation (Table 1).

Similarly to Hajdú-Bihar county, plough-land is the dominating land use form. Agricultural land use is dominant on both sides of the border. In a wider sense, the role of the region has been being in connection with historical division of work and the</p><p id="Pg327">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1001 traditional landscape use developed during the centuries and agriculture. The proportion of cereals (maize, wheat) and oil crops (rape, sunflower) – the crops that can be considered for biofuel production – is high. (Table 2).

Obvious that Hajdú-Bihar county has better givens. So the soil - plant system is more balanced.In the future this crop cultures are expected to grow due to the appearance of the suplementary demand. Nevertheless, the number of agricultural ventures also dealing with the selling of produced goods is very low (0,4-12%) on the other side fo the border, compared to Hajdú-Bihar county (mainly 40-100%). The estate structure and the agrotechnical level are also much higher in Hajdú-Bihar county than on the other side of the border. This can be a potenial advantage for the plants working on the Hungarian side, as they can organize raw material supply and fulfill their logistic duties easier. Public road and railway approachability of Bihor county is a basic aspect for balanced and continuous cooperation. The determinant structural line of the county is the international main road E60 that cuts through the county in a West-East direction at a length of 81 km, and which can be considered as the continuation of the Püspökladány-Berettyóújfalu-Ártánd line coming from Hajdú-Bihar county. The traffic network leaves much to be desired in Bihor county. The quality of the road network that has a length more than 2500 km is satisfactory at only some parts, but the railway network is also neglected and needs reconstruction. Currently there is no motorway in the county, but according to the plans, the Northern Transylvanian motorway will reach the Hungarian border in Bihor. Currently there are three public road border crossing points along the common sections of Hajdú-Bihar and Bihor counties between Nyírábrány and Érmihályfalva, Létavértes and Székelyhíd, and between Ártánd and Bors (Bihor county has another border crossing point at Nagyszalonta in the direction of Békés county). As a result of historical precedence, the number of railway crossing points is two altogether: there are international railway border crossing points between Biharkeresztes and Bors, and between Nyírábrány and Érmihályfalva.</p><p id="Pg328">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1002 As regards biofuel production, Hungary owns some advantage compared to the Romanian party concerning bioethanol production. As for biodiesel production, the Romanian party has outrun the quantities produced by Hungary. According to the estimations, Romania will be one of the ten biggest biodiesel producing countries of the world from 2008. Instead of the current 4,5 million tons, Hungary is going to produce an annual 11 million tons from 2010, according to the plans. Romania has an agricultural area of 3,4 million hectares that can be used for raw material production (rape, sunflower). Maize and wheat have the biggest perspective in Hungary among the feedstocks of bioethanol production (Nagy, 2007). The biggest bioethanol plant in Hajdú-Bihar county will be operating in Kaba. According to the plans, the bioethanol palnt will start to work in Spring, 2008 and will produce 300 litres of bioethanol per day that needs 909 tons of maize per day. This means a maize consumption of 300 thousand tons of maize per year. Next to the bioethanol plant there will also be a powerplant with a planned daily capacity of 12 MegaWatts of electricity and 16 MegaWatts of heat energy (Table 2) Besides domestic markets, the maize needs of the plant can also be satisfied by Bihor county, that has similar production site and climatic endowments. The quantity of the maize to be imported will also be affected by the needs of the bioethanol production plants to be built with Hungarian equity investment in Nagykároly and Nagyszalona, Romania. Conclusions The biggest difficulty concerning alternative energy resources, especially biodiesel and bioethanol is that on the output they have to continuously produce a quantity and quality that satisfies the market needs. In order to be able to function like this, a constant quantity of agricultural feedstock has to be provided on the input side at a constant quality. Considering the impacts of production site, climate and crop year, there will also be a need to include feedstock resources from outside the county. The geographically favourable location of Bihor county and the relative under-utilization of agricultural resources makes it a potential good feedstock base for the plants working in Hajdú-Bihar county. According to the tendencies expected, the minimizing of the separative character of the borders will result in the development of trade and technology relationships even in the field of biomass utilization of energetic purposes.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1003 PHYSICO-MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF WINTER WHEAT Balázs Péter SZABÓ - Antal VÉHA University of Szeged, Faculty of Engineering, 6725 Szeged, Moszkvai krt. 5-7., e-mail: szpb@mk.uszeged.hu Abstract: Wheat kernel texture differentiates cultivars of hard and soft wheat classes. The kernel hardness is a genetic factor (control by friabilin protein). The friabilin presents in high concentration in soft grain varieties and low concentration in hard grain varieties (Békési, 2001). Wheat kernel hardness determines quality, flour yield, flour particle-size, water absorption and other quality characteristics of cereals. The aim of our research was to determine the kernel hardness with static methods. To the static methods we used the Lloyd 1000 R Testing Machines and the Instron 5581. We determined the kernel hardness with the well-known and recognized method also. It was the Perten Single Kernel Characterization System (SKCS) 4100 device. Registered and widely used Hungarian wheat varieties were applied in the study. It was 23 different winter wheat varieties (13 of HRWW and 10 of SRWW). We examined these 23 different samples with the SKCS 4100 also. The samples were labelled with code number. As a result, the Lloyd 1000 R machine and the Instron 5581 can sort the winter wheat in two groups (soft, hard), especially the breaking force, the Young’s modulus and the break work. Keywords: wheat, kernel hardness, Young’s modulus Introduction The kernel hardness has great effect on the baking properties of the resulting flour. Flour, which is made from hard wheat generally have a medium to high protein content and stronger gluten than flour, which is made from soft wheat. The friabilin protein complex determines the kernel hardness. Generally, when the amount of the friabilin is high, the kernel hardness is soft and when the amount of the friabilin is low the kernel hardness is hard. Hardness in wheat is largely controlled by genetic factors but it can be affected by the environment (Gyimes, 2004). The transgenic expression of wild type Pina sequence in the Pina null genotype gave soft grain with the characteristics of soft wheat including increased starch bound friabilin. Hardness is suggested to influence the adhesion forces between starch granules and protein matrix whereas vitreousness would rather be related to the endosperm microstructure (Greffeuille, et. al., 2006). Materials and methods 23 samples (registered wheat varieties) of bread with diverse technological qualities were used in this study. The samples produced in the year of 2005 and 2004 in Szeged, Hungary and were evaluated for various quality characteristics. Grain samples of the entries were taken during harvest (July) and were evaluated after a 3-4 month storage period. LLOYD 1000 R Material Testing Machines (Figure 1.) and Instron 5581 (Figure 2.) machines press the kernel and represent the compressive force and displacement connection. From this graph we read the breaking force, the incline, the break work and the Young’s modulus. The grain was examined in standing position.</p><p id="Pg330">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

The field trial is designed in random block in 4 replications. Among other things we examined winter hardiness, lodging resistance, plant height of varieties. We measured amount of grain yield, thousand-seed weight, weight of one hectolitre. In this work I presented the results of medium varieties in 2003-2005 years. I found significant variance between results of the experimental years and varieties owing to the different amount and distribution of precipitation mainly. I arranged the studied varieties into four groups on basis of their adaptability to climatic and soil conditions of the area. I can recommend those varieties to grow at Mátra Region, which can give the best results in favourable and unfavourable conditions too. Based on my experiences theese varieties are: Buzogány, Róna, MF Kazal, GK Petur). Keywords: precipitation, average yield, brown forest soil, comparative field experiment. Introduction Winter wheat is the most important food crop of the world, and it has determinative part in Hungarian crop production (Balogh et al., 2007), the sowing area is between 1-1,2 million ha in Hungary nowadays (Pepó, 2007). The yield of arable crops, and also yield of winter wheat is influenced by many factors, such as water, temperature and soil (Bertic et al., 2007; Szabó – Pepó, 2007; Tanács, 2007). According to Pepó (2007) the roles of agroecological factors in intensive wheat crop model can be 25%, but he stresses the importance of variety and fertilization too. Varieties acclimatize to climatic and soil conditions in different way, in compliance wiht it, varieties can produce very different yield in individual environs of Hungary (Szabó et al., 2007; Fodor et al., 2006). In the last twenty years the number of varieties on the Hungarian national list was multiplied (Pepó, 2007), so farmers has to choose the best variety from this large assortment, comparative experiments run at touched region can help farmers. I wanted to know how to acclimatize the state qualified winter wheat varieties to climatic and soil conditions of Mátra Region. Materials and methods Field trials were conducted at Károly Róbert College, Tass-puszta Modell Farm. The experiment was set up in small-plots (12,88 m2) in 4 replications with random block arrangement. In my study I have processed the results of 2003-2005 experimental years. I studied medium varieties in unfavourable, droughty and favourable years for wheat. The soil type of the experiment is brown forest soil, representative of Mátra Region, which is not the most suitable for wheat production (Ángyán – Menyhért, 1997). Thickness of humus layer is 0,6-0,7 m, KA: 43, physical soil type is loamy, pHKCl: 6,2 (weakly acid) with medium humus content (2,3%), AL-soluble P2O5 99 mg kg -1, ALsoluble K2O 249 mg kg -1, it has not lime in the cultivated layer.

In 2005 following varieties had the highest yield: Buzogány, Mv Magvas, Róna, GK Rába, Hunor, MF Kazal, GK Cipó, GK Petur, differences of their average yield was not significant. Mv Süveges, GK Cipó, Mv Suba proved to be highly sensitive to different climatic conditions in this experiment. Conclusions Varieties are able to give very good yield at Mátra Region in case of suitable quantity and distribution of precipitation, considering the circumstances, that 50-60 % of yield is given in small-plot comparative experiment is realized at large-scale growing (Sváb, 1964). Varieties can be arranged into four groups. 1. they can give good yield reliably at favourable and unfavourable conditions too (Buzogány, Róna, MF Kazal, GK Petur), theese varieties able for growing at Mátra Region. 2. they give very good yield on rainy conditions, but lack of precipitation resulted in a poor grain yield (Mv Magvas, GK</p><p id="Pg336">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1010 Rába, Hunor). 3. Under unfavourable conditions they can yield better, but in favourable conditions they can not produce economic extra yield (GK Hattyú, Mv Ködmön, Atrium, Mv Csárdás). 4. Their yield is backward in rainy and droughty weather too (GK Miska, GK Marcal, Mv Verbunkos). I can recommend to grow at Mátra Region varieties from first group and I can abstain from growing of varieties at 4. group.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1011 THE EXAMINATION OF THE MOBILITY OF SOME MICROELEMENTS ON BROWN FOREST SOIL László SZEGEDI Károly Róbert College, H-3200 Gyöngyös, Mátrai str. 36., Hungary, lszegedi@karolyrobert.hu Abstract: The alterations and movements of toxic elements (Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, Zn) into the deeper soil layers were followed by means of soil examinations during the long term heavy metal load experiments initiated in the autumn of 1994 at Károly Róbert College, Gyöngyös. The above mentioned toxic elements were released into the ploughed upper stratum. In May 1995 and July 2002 the upper 0-25 cm layer of the soil was sampled. Having examined the total element content we found that in the eighth year of the experiment the metallic contamination was demonstrable with the exception of mercury. The contamination decreased to a different extent in the case of each element. The greatest decrease was found in the case of cadmium (92%), followed by chromium (77%), arsenic (75%), lead (60%), copper (53%), and zinc (6%). In the case of the absorbable element content the greates decrease was observable in the case of cadmium and arsenic – 91-92%. The other elements showed the following order: chromium (80%), lead (76%), copper (72%) and finally zinc (42%). The examination of the connection between the total and the absorbable element content proved that the total metallic contamination determines the soluble metallic content of the soil to a continually decreaseing extent. During the years the total element content went through a qualitative change as a result of which its solubility significantly dereased. The examination of the regression coefficients resulted in the fact that in 2002 the solubility of the treatment elements decreased by 5% in the case of cadmium, by 41% in the case of arsenic, by 52% in the case of copper and zinc, by 59% in the case of lead, and by 77% in the case of chromium compared to the 1995 values. Keywords: heavy metal, toxic element, total element content, absorbable element content. Introduction Soils can accumulate heavy metals for years without their acute toxicity being felt. Above a certain saturation level their filtering capacity wears away, they become permeable, and they themselves act as sources of contamination (Várallyay, 2007). The toxic metals find their way into waters and become absorbable for plants; once they get into the food chain they may cause long term damage (Fodor, 2002; Szabó, 1996). In order to become familiar with the turnover of micro elements it is inevitable to examine the changes of mineral elements in soils, plants, air, and waters separately and in detail (Kádár, 2007). As a result, the examination of potentially toxic elements (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Hg, Ni, Se, Ag, Sn, Zn) came into prominence in different fields of science. It has also become obvious that they represent serious environmental hazards because of their complex interactions in the biogeochemical circulation, and those elements that are non-essential for living organisms can be toxic even in a small concentration (Birkás et al., 2006). On behalf of the Ministry of Environment and Rural Development the “Examination of the Heavy Metal Content of our Environment” research programme was launched in 1991 in the Research Institute for Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (RISSAC). The objective of the programme was to examine the behaviour of heavy metals and other potentially toxic elements in the soil-plant systems and in the food chain and it was carried out in the main soil types in Hungary in open-air small-plot experiments. In 1994 Károly Róbert College joined to the programme providing a venue at the Tass Puszta Educational Farm following the guiding principles and methodology prepared by the Research Institute for Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.</p><p id="Pg338">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1012 Materials and methods Experiments were carried out in the Educational Farm on sour, firm brown forest soil involving 8 elements (Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, Zn), at 3 load levels (0/30, 90 and 270 kg element/ha), in 3 repetitions on 35 m2 (3,5 m x 10 m) plots. In the split-plot experiment the 8 examined elements represent the main plots while the 3 load level represent the sub-plots. The large dose loads symbolize the soil contamination levels. Treatments were implemented by using the water soluble salts of the elements only once at the beginning of the experiment. After spreading the salts were worked into the soil at the depth of 8-10 cm-s. In May 1995 and in July 2002 we sampled the upper layer of the soil at the depth of 0-25 cm. The sampling of the soil was completed with a manual drill by net plots (leaving off 50 cm-s from the edge) and 20-20 sample points represented an average sample. We determined the total and the absorbable element content. We determined the absorbable element content by dissolving NH4-acetate + EDTA (Lakanen-Erviö, 1971), while the total element content was determined by cc. HNO3 + cc. H2O2 exploration (Várallyay et al., 1995). The element composition of the extracts was accomplished by the ICP laboratory of MTA TAKI using an ICP-AES plasma emission spectrophotometer. During the analysis of the results of the soil examinations we observed the development of the total and absorbable element content of the soil, as well as the connections between the total and absorbable element content. The mathematical and statistical assessment of the data was completed with the variant analysis of the two-factor, split-plot arranged experiments (Sváb, 1981). Results and discussion The results of the soil examinations that were sampled from the 0-25 cm stratum of the soil concerning total element and absorbable element content at three treatment levels are shown in table 1 and 2. The examination of the connection between the total and the absorbable element content proved that the total metallic contamination determines the soluble metallic content of the soil to a decreaseing extent.

The examination of the regression coefficients resulted in the fact that in 2002 the solubility of the treatment elements decreased by 5% in the case of cadmium, by 41% in the case of arsenic, by 52% in the case of copper and zinc, by 59% in the case of lead, and by 77% in the case of chromium compared to the 1995 values. On the basis of the results we can state that, considering the total element content in relation to the examined elements, in the eighth year of the experiment the metallic contamination was still demonstrable with the exception of mercury. The contamination decreased to a different extent in the case of each element. The greatest decrease was found in the case of cadmium (92%), followed by chromium (77%), arsenic (75%), lead (60%), copper (53%), and zinc (6%). In parallel with the total element content the absorbable element content also showed a decreasing tendency. The greates decrease was observable in the case of cadmium and arsenic – 91-92%. The other elements showed the following order: chromium (80%), lead (76%), copper (72%) and finally zinc (42%). In 2002 mercury was not analytically traceable in the examined area. We could not rely on the effects of aluminium treatment either in the case of total or absorbale element content since the aluminium-silicates, as the main soil constitutives, can be found in brown forest soils irrespective of the treatments. We also examined by each element how and to what extent the total element content determined the absorbable element content. Table 3 contains the results of the statistical examinations. The values of the determining coefficients concerning 1995 show close connections between the total and absorbable element content with the exception of aluminium. In 2002 the value of the determining coefficients significantly declined with the exception of aluminium and cadmium: this value declined by 75% in the case of chromium, by 53% in the case of lead, by 52% in the case of zinc, by 50% in the case of copper and by 11% in the case of arsenic. The decline indicates that the total metallic contamination determines the soluble metallic content of the soil to a continually decreaseing extent.</p><p id="Pg340">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

On the basis of the results it can be stated that the vast majority of the total metallic content was present in the soil in an easily soluble (absorbable) form in 1995. During the years the total element content went through a qualitative change as a result of which its solubility significantly dereased. The examination of the regression coefficients resulted in the fact that in 2002 the solubility of the treatment elements decreased by 5% in the case of cadmium, by 41% in the case of arsenic, by 52% in the case of copper and zinc, by 59% in the case of lead, and by 77% in the case of chromium compared to the 1995 values.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1015 SOIL AND GENOTYPE INFLUENCES ON YIELD AND NUTRITIONAL STATUS OF MAIZE HYBRID PARENTS Antun JAMBROVIĆ 1 - Luka ANDRIĆ 1 – Tatjana LEDENČAN 1 - Zvonimir ZDUNIĆ 1 1 Agricultural Institute, Juzno predgradje 17, HR-31000 Osijek, Croatia; e-mail: antun.jambrovic@poljinos.hr Abstract: Eastern Croatia is important area for maize seed production where parental components of singlecross maize hybrids are more susceptible to environmental stress compared with their hybrid progeny. Aim of this study was to determine yield response of nine commercial female parents of maize hybrids in seed production to two different soil types (loess and eutric cambisol) in two years. Average seed yield of nine maize inbred lines was significantly highest on loess soil in 2006. In 2007 though, due to extreme drought and heat, yield on this location was reduced on more than a half of previous year. On contrast, there was no significant difference between years for yield on eutric cambisol. Preliminary results for mineral status of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in ear-leaf and seed showed that there was no variation among inbred lines for these traits within and among location(s) in 2006 indicating that soil type did not affect concentrations of P and K in plants. Extreme dry and hot weather during summer of 2007 had notably less effect on seed yield on eutric cambisol than on loess soil. It suggests that eutric cambisol appears to be more appropriate soil type for seed production of maize due to more stable seed yields. Keywords: maize,inbred lines, soil type, nutritional status, yield Introduction Maize (Zea mays L.) is the most widespread crop on arable lands in Croatia occupying about 0.4 million hectares. Eastern Croatia (about 20% of the country territory) is main maize growing area of the country, but high yield fluctuations have been found depending on soil and weather conditions (Josipovic et al., 2005; Kovacevic et al., 2007). The same is true for the whole Pannonian region (Spitko et al., 2006; Izsaki, 2007; Jovanovic et al., 2007; Nagy, 2007). This region is also important area for maize seed production where parental components of single-cross maize hybrids are more susceptible to environmental stress in comparison with their hybrid progeny (Orr et al., 1997). Consequently, yield fluctuations of seed-maize parents among growing seasons and among different soil types are considerably higher. Aim of this study was to determine yield response of nine commercial female parents of maize hybrids in seed production to two different soil types (loess and eutric cambisol) in two years. Material and methods Nine inbred lines (female parents of commercial hybrids were grown under field conditions on two locations in 2006 and 2007. Majority of genotypes belongs to well known germplasm used in Eastern Central Europe (Hadi, 2006): Two locations are situated in Osijek-Baranya County (the eastern Croatia region) where loess soil was in Podgorac and eutric cambisol in Osijek (FAO, 1998).. Air distance between the two locations is 40 km indicating similar weather conditions. Both soils are good supplied with plant available phosphorus and potassium (Table 1). The experiment was conducted in four replicates in two-row plots pf 14.0 m2. Maize was palnted at the beginning of May by planter (two seeds per hill). At early growth stage, plant density was reduced (one plant per hill with theoretical plant density of 57143 plants ha-1). Maize was harvested by hand and grain (seed) yield was calculated on 14% grain moisture basis.</p><p id="Pg342">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1016 Table 1.

ICP analysis was conducted in the laboratory of the Research Institute for Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry (RISSAC) Budapest, Hungary. Initially, data from each environment (combination year-location) was statistically analyzed separately. Entry means and error mean squares were used for further combined analyses of variance (Cochran and Cox, 1957) using a three-factor model that included soil type, year and genotype as main factors. Genotype was considered fixed effect in all analyses, while soil type and year as fixed effects. The PLABSTAT program package (Utz, 1995) was used for all statistical procedures in the study. Results and discussion There were notable differences in precipitation and air temperatures between the two growing seasons (Table 2). During the 2007 growing season, lower precipitation and much higher temperatures were recorded than during the 2006 growing season. In April 2007, it was extremely dry, while in June and July it was very dry and dry, respectively, with extremely warm mean air temperatures. Table 2.

Sándor ZSARNÓCZAI Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences, Szent István University, 2103 Gödöllő, Páter Károly u.1, Hungary, e-mail: zsarnoczai@yahoo.co.uk Abstract: In 1993, the cultivable land was estimated at 5,94 million ha, or 32 % of the total area of the country. The cultivated land was estimated at 4,94 million ha, which is 83% of the cultivable area. Of this area, 4,27 million ha consisted of annual crops and 0,67 million ha consisted of permanent crops. In 1993, agriculture employed around 22,5% of the total labour force, accounted for nearly 28% of GDP and 60% of non-oil exports. The interior region plays considerable role for agricultural production. Surface irrigation is reported to be practiced on 981.273 ha. The predominant system of surface irrigation practiced is basin irrigation. Traditionally, irrigation in Syria has relied on flooding for cereals, furrow irrigation for vegetables and basin irrigation for fruit trees. In Syria the sustainable agriculture means to remain highly developed agricultural production level to supply foods for increasing population of the country with less negative influences on the natural environment. Keywords: Irrigation, agricultural production, water resources, interior region Introduction In 1993, the cultivable land was estimated at 5,94 million ha, or 32 % of the total area of the country. The cultivated land was estimated at 4,94 million ha, which is 83% of the cultivable area. Of this area, 4,27 million ha consisted of annual crops and 0,67 million ha consisted of permanent crops. About 62 % of the cultivated area is located in the three northern governorates Aleppo, Al-Reqqa and Al-Hassakeh, representing only 33% of the total area of the country. The developing food production and agricultural production technology including developing irrigation system are needed to provide enough supplied food for sharply increasing population of the country. The total population was 14,6 million in 1995, of which 48% is rural. Based on the actual population growth, which was 3,3% the number of inhabitants increased to almost 20 million people by the end of 2006. In 1993, agriculture employed around 22,5% of the total labour force, accounted for nearly 28% of GDP and 60% of non-oil exports (Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform. Damascus, Syria, 2005). It means that the country is very depends on the agricultural sector and its output volume, which is the last one depending on the natural or geographical background. Naturally the global warming influences also concern Syria. In this case it is the most important, how the water resources are changing in the country. Materials and methods There are 141 dams in Syria with a total storage capacity of 15,8 km³. The largest dam is located at Al-Tabka on the Euphrates. It forms the Al-Assad lake with a storage capacity of 11,2 km³. The majority of these dams are located near Homs and Hama. Concerning the irrigation and drainage development, estimates on irrigation potential, based solely on soil resources, were about 5,9 million ha, which is roughly equal to the cultivable area. Considering the water resources available at present, irrigation potential</p><p id="Pg346">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1020 is estimated at 1.250.000 ha. Syria depends on international agreements with neighbouring countries on the sharing of river waters in the future. In 1993, the total area with irrigation equipment was estimated at 1.013.273 ha, which was 81% of the above irrigation potential. Irrigation was mainly developed in the northeastern part of the country. More than one-third of the irrigated areas were located in the Al-Hassakeh governorate. Also the total area of the Syrian Arab Republic was 18,5 million hectares, one third of which was arable land or forest and the remaining part was desert and rocky areas non adequate for agricultural production. Topographically, Syria can be divided into some main regions: 1/ The coastal region, which extends from the North to the south along the Mediterranean coast, between the mountains and the sea. 2/ The mountainous region, which includes the mountains and hills that run from the north to the south along the Mediterranean Sea. 3/ The interior region, including the plains of Damascus, Horns, Aleppo, AI Hassakeh, and Daraa, which is located to the east of the mountainous region. 4/ The Badia, that is the desert plains located in the south-eastern part of the country along the Jordanian and the Iraqi borders. Results and discussion The interior region plays considerable role for agricultural production. Surface irrigation is reported to be practiced on 981.273 ha. The predominant system of surface irrigation practiced is basin irrigation. Traditionally, irrigation in Syria has relied on flooding for cereals, furrow irrigation for vegetables and basin irrigation for fruit trees. Sprinkler irrigation is practiced on 30.000 ha, mostly in the Homs, Aleppo and AlHassakeh governorates. It has been developing on a wider scale recently, mainly because of groundwater scarcity, which has encouraged farmers to develop watersaving techniques, and because of equipment becoming available on the local market. Micro-irrigation is practiced on 2.000 ha. In 1993 it was estimated that 60,2% of the area was irrigated from groundwater and 39,8 % from surface water (gravity-fed or pumped from the rivers and lakes). The use of groundwater for irrigation has been expanding rapidly in the last five years because irrigation from groundwater is cheaper than irrigation by gravity. Since pumped water is free, the only investment expense required is the well and a suitable pump. Farmers obtain credit at preferential rates of interest to purchase fuel and imported pumps at subsidized prices. A second factor explaining the increase in irrigation from groundwater is the large number of farmers with small farm holdings. The latest available data estimate that over 75% of the farmers have holdings of less than 10 ha. On average, it is estimated that a household has 3,5 ha of irrigated land. Since most private farmers want secure and independent access to a supply of water, they often dig their own wells. In 1994, the total number of wells in the country was estimated at 122.276 of which 53.453 were not licensed. Of the total area of 1.013.273 ha equipped for irrigation, 349.820 ha are involved in government irrigation projects and 78% of this land is also equipped for drainage. It is estimated that 105.000 ha of these government irrigated areas need rehabilitation.</p><p id="Pg347">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1021 According to trends in water resources management the agriculture sector is a major source of income, foreign exchange and labour in Syria. The irrigated area produces over 50% of the total agricultural production on about 18,6% of the cultivated land. A large part of the wheat production, as well as all major industrial crops including cotton, tobacco and sugar beet were produced on irrigated farms. The development and utilization of water so far has been carried out on an ad hoc basis, mainly responding to various demands (UNDP/FAO. 2005.). Increasing food production has resulted in the construction of dams for irrigating lands under their command; and attractive prices for food crops, particularly for wheat recently, have resulted in a rapid increase in wells and the over exploitation of groundwater. In addition, increasing population and the proliferation of industries in major cities have contributed to further exploitation of the limited water resources. Under the latest development plans, between 60 and 70% of public investment in agriculture was allocated to irrigation development, in particular for the construction of the Taqba dam and the establishment of the Assad reservoir (Soumi, George. 1993.). Irrigated agriculture in the Damascus basin has to compete for both land and water with the residential and industrial expansion of the city. Irrigated agricultural areas have already been seriously reduced in the Damascus basin in recent decades. But the development of irrigation system is needed because of increasing the extent of dessert areas on the world –wide side as well (Ligetvári F. - Várallyay Gy. - Schweitzer, F.: 2006, 496. p.). Irrigation development mainly depends on how Syria reaches agreements with neighbouring countries on the sharing of river waters (Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq). Syria improves water use efficiency and to better control surface water and groundwater exploitation are important challenges facing Syrian policy-makers. Future projects have been planned by the government for the development of major schemes: 91.000 ha in the Euphrates basin, 150.000 ha in the Khabour (tributary of the Euphrates) basin with the construction of a reservoir north of Al-Hassakeh, 150.000 ha in the Tigris basin by pumping from the Tigris river and 72.000 ha in the Orontes basin (AlGhab).</p><p id="Pg348">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1022 Conclusions The aim is at promoting and strengthening technical cooperation networks between farmers, local authorities and different organizations to develop irrigation system in Syria and main agricultural areas. Preparing inventories of technologies, knowledge, know-how and practices, also traditional and modern technologies should be used for implementing modernization for irrigation system. Strengthening training, research and development are to set up systems for human resource development in field of agricultural production. Also strengthen to supply funds through public and private investment concerning the irrigation systems to decrease desertification and effects of drought. Promote national and multinational cooperation to realize main aims against effects of drought (Stekauerová Vlasta - Nagy Viliam: 2006, 289. p.). In Syria the sustainable agriculture means to remain highly developed agricultural production level to supply foods for increasing population of the country with less negative influences on the natural environment. Also some experts decided that “Keeping partly the function of food production, agriculture may play a significant role in energy production or industrial raw material production. For this, a good example can be the utilization of biological materials (biomass) for heating. They can also be used for making fuels, as well as vegetable oils can be used in plastic industry, or medicine and different chemicals may also be made from them.” (Fogarassy, C., Káposzta, J., Nagy, H. 2007, p. 1.)

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1023 A GEOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF SOIL WATER CONTENT AT THE FIELD SCALE: THE INFLUENCE OF SOIL TEXTURE AND TILLAGE Tomas ORFANUS– Viliam NAGY – Vlasta STEKAUEROVA - Lubomir LICHNER Department of Soil Hydrology, Institute of Hydrology, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Racianska 75, 831 02 Bratislava, e-mail: orfanus@uh.savba.sk Abstract: Improved understanding of the variability of soil water content (SWC) is demanded for agricultural management. The soil water distribution at a field scale as influenced by the textural heterogeneity and tillage was studied on a 4.5 ha field near Moravský Svätý Ján village in southwest Slovakia. The variation of SWC followed the textural variations within the scope of the research field. On the loamy sand soil, there was found no influence of tillage on spatial correlation of SWC data there. However, in clay loam the marked spatial anisotropy due to direction of agricultural traffic was detected. We have assumed that tillage has disturbed the spatial structure of SWC in northern direction in case of the clay loam soil. Keywords: soil water content, spatial variability, soil texture, tillage Introduction Water deficiency during plant ontogenesis can have harmful effect on plant condition. From this point of view cultural phytocoenoses belong to the most sensitive ones (WMO, 2001; Fülöp et al., 2007). Water availability for plants becomes a serious problem even in central Europe (IPCC, 2001; Várallyay, 2005; Hnilička et al., 2007). Soils tend to develop in response to state factors and exhibit different forms and levels of organisation (Rajkai, Rydén, 1992; Blöschl, 1996). Consequently, the soil water content is also highly variable in space (Blöschl, 1996; Farkas et al., 2007). Improved understanding of this variability would be very useful for many aspects of human life. When soil water regime is evaluated with respect to the agricultural management, the heterogeneity of the soil cover at the scale of single field has to be considered. In plain areas with negligible elevation drop the lateral flow is not significant. The soil water distribution at a field scale is controlled by the variability of soil hydrophysical properties. Substantial part of this variability originates in textural heterogeneity (Pachepsky et al., 2004) and tillage (Gyuricza et al., 2007; Bencsik et al., 2007). This paper deals with spatial organisation of the SWC at a field scale as jointly influenced by the textural heterogeneity and tillage. Materials and methods The research was realized on a 4.5 ha (150 x 300 m) plot situated near the Moravský Svätý Ján village on Záhorská Lowland in southwest Slovakia. The area belongs to alluvium of the river Moravia. The plot has uniform tillage, but marked differences in soil. The investigated field was ploughed for decades until 2001 after which the minimum tillage has been applied. The minimum tillage in 2001 consisted of wheat (Triticum aestivum) seeding in autumn and then leaving the soil without ploughing until spring when the disking was applied before soya (Glycine max) seeding. Local soils are Arenic Regosol covering undivided 60% of the plot area and Eutric Fluvisol extending on almost 40% of the plot area (ISSS-ISRIC-FAO, 1998). These soil taxons are divided by sharp and easily identifiable borderline. The Arenic Regosol has a loamy-sand</p><p id="Pg350">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1024 texture and Eutric Fluvisol consists of clay loam. The thin area around the borderline is texturally variable and creates some transition zone. The soil was sampled on 10 April 2002, in a regular 20 x 20 m square grid. Soil samples were taken from the horizon 0.10–0.15 m into stainless cylinders of 100-cm3 volume and 5 cm height. The soil water content (by weight and by volume) of each sample was determined by gravimetric method. The descriptive statistics of soil water content (by weight) was calculated for the complete data set containing 128 samples and then for two data subsets, sorted out according to soil texture, containing 66 and 45 samples, respectively. 17 samples, which belonged to a textural transition, were omitted from the statistical analysis. The normality of the original and sorted SWC data were analysed by using the KolmogorovSmirnov goodness of fit test. The continuity and anisotropy of the soil water content variability were investigated by analysing the omnidirectional and directional variograms. Those who want a more rigorous review of geostatistical methods are directed elsewhere (e.g. Isaaks, Srivastava, 1989). Results and discussion The descriptive statistics and the results of Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test of original (complete) and sorted SWC data sets are shown in Table 1. The values of SWC for particular textural class distinctly differ in mean values as well as in their standard deviations. The complete (original) data set has strongly asymmetric and bimodal distribution (Fig. 1a). A geostatistical analysis has no strict requirement for data to be normal (Van Meirvenne, 1991). However, the results might be less precise for asymmetric distributions. After we had selected the SWC data according to textural class, they could be satisfactorily approximated by normal distribution (Table 1, Fig. 1b-c) despite the fact that loamy sand SWC data are better approximated by lognormal distribution. The omnidirectional variograms showed clear spatial structure for both, the loamy sand and clay loam SWC data. The range of spatial dependence was about 100 metres for loamy sand and about 90 meters for clay loam SWC data. The directional variograms were calculated with respect to traction machines driving direction by vernal disking, which was clearly visible on the soil surface at the time of SWC measurements.

Cereal Research Communications 1026 So, there is an anisotropy in SWC spatial autocorrelation in the clay loam part of the field caused by the tillage (Fig. 2-right). Conclusions The SWC varies extremely due to changes in soil texture even in the scope of 4.5 ha field. The difference between maximum and minimum SWC was 50% (weight). The spatial connectivity of SWC values is related with identified textural classes. The SWC data sorted out according to soil types can be approximated by normal distribution. The SWC behaved as spatially dependent variable with range of spatial dependence equal to about 100m. However, the joint influence of textural heterogeneity and soil tillage has manifested itself in the loss of spatial structure in the traction machines driving direction in clay loam part of the research field.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1027 THE EFFECT OF REDUCED SOIL NITROGEN ON THE PLANT COMPOSITION OF ABANDONED AGRICULTURAL FIELDS Rebeka SZABÓ 1 – Balázs FEHÉR 1 – Katalin SZITÁR 1 – Melinda HALASSY 1 – Katalin TÖRÖK1 1 Institute of Ecology and Botany, 2163 Vácrátót, Alkotmány str. 2-4., rebeka@botanika.hu Abstract: Carbon source treatment was applied on three sites differing in elevation, soil moisture and productivity in order to lower soil nitrogen availability and facilitate the natural regeneration process on an exarable field. The treatment significantly decreased the available nitrogen content of the soil on all sites. The plant composition according to the N demand of species was significantly influenced by the abiotic differences of the three sites. The vegetation’s response to the treatment could only be detected on the most productive site, where the change in the soil caused by the carbon treatment was the most pronounced. Thus our results showed that the initial soil characteristics had a great influence on vegetation composition change and the effect of the carbon treatment. Keywords: restoration, old field, available nitrogen, open sandy grassland, secondary succession Introduction After an intensive agricultural production period in Central Europe in the second half of the 20th century, more and more agricultural fields have recently been abandoned due to socio-economic changes (Szirmai and Czóbel 2006; Prach et al. 2007). Large areas of weedy abandoned fields can be found especially in the arid Kiskunság region in Hungary on sandy soils (Csecserits et al. 2007). Restoration measures can be applied to eliminate the limits of natural regeneration and shift succession towards the native grassland vegetation (Hernandez-Fernandez et al. 2007). Changes in soil nutrient status, especially in nitrogen content, have an important role in determining plant community composition and successional dynamics (McLendon and Redente 1992; Tilman 1986; Nagy 2006). Controlling nitrogen availability by increasing the microbial activity through carbon source addition to the soil can be an effective method to provide competitive advantage for slow-growing grassland species in degraded areas (Paschke et al. 2000; Bleier and Jackson 2007). The effect of the restoration treatment on the soil microbial N immobilization and the developing vegetation may also depend on the soil characteristics, like moisture status and soil available nitrogen pool (Török et al. 2000; Németh 2006; Szili-Kovács et al. 2007). In the present paper we analyse the results of a 6-year long carbon amendment experiment based on the data of the last year of the treatment (2003). We hypothesized that the treatment would have different effects on the soil N availability and vegetation composition depending on the initial soil characteristics. Materials and methods The study site is located in the inland sand dune area of the Kiskunság National Park in Hungary. Due to the wind-formed sand dunes, this landscape has great habitat diversity and mosaic vegetation, mostly determined by soil moisture availability (Körmöczi 1991; Várallyay 2006). Our study area is on calcareous sandy soil, and the native</p><p id="Pg354">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1028 vegetation is the endemic open sand grassland (Festucetum vaginatae), which is adapted to low moisture and nutrient conditions. Three sites were selected along an elevation, moisture and productivity gradient within an abandoned farm: the driest Hummock (H), the intermediate Depression (D) and the least dry and most productive Meadow (M). Cultivation ceased in 1991 at the M site and in 1995 at the D and H sites (Török et al. 2000). 6 treatment and 6 control plots (10 m x 10 m each) were placed randomly in a 30 m x 40 m grid at each site. Sucrose and hardwood sawdust were applied as carbon sources to control the nitrogen dynamics of the soil in the treated plots (Szili-Kovács et al. 2000). Sawdust was spread two times and sucrose in every three weeks during the vegetation seasons from 1998 to 2003. The amount spread at each treatment varied based on the abiotic background of the three sites: 300, 450 and 600 kg ha-1 on H, D and M, respectively. Soil nitrogen (N) availability (nitrate- and ammonium-N) was determined using ionexchange resin (IER) bags, replaced every 6 weeks during the growing season (SziliKovács et al. 2007). The percentage cover of each vascular plant species was estimated in 3 permanent quadrats of 2m x 2m in each plot. Vegetation data was analyzed according to the nitrogen requirements of vascular species (NB, Borhidi 1995) and habitat preference (that means here the specialist and disturbance tolerant species characteristic to the open sandy grasslands). Only data from the final year of the experiment (2003) was analyzed, with factorial and one – way ANOVA at p&lt;0.05. Results and discussion The available N content of the soil had been significantly decreased by the carbon treatment in 2003. The differences in the cumulative N values of the three sites reflected the initial productivity gradient: the Meadow site had the highest amount of available N, the Depression had an intermediate level, while the soil of the Hummock had the lowest N availability. The treatment was successful in all sites (Table 1.) and eliminated the differences in the nitrogen levels among the treated plots (Kádár 2007). The decrease caused by the treatment was the most pronounced on the M site, probably due to the higher level of carbon source.

The treatments did not significantly influence the cover of plant species with different N requirements, however, important differences were detected among the sites (Figure 1). The vegetation of site H with low productive soil was dominated by species with very low N requirement (1-2), and species with medium N needs (5-6) were also abundant. The intermediate D site had the highest amount of species of low-medium N needs (3-</p><p id="Pg355">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1029 4). The most productive M site had remarkably high cover of species with very low N requirement (1-2). Thus variation of vegetation composition reflected well on the abiotic differences among the sites. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 1-2 3-4 5-6 7-8-9 NB categories % s h a re o f to ta l c o v e r H D M a b b a b c a b b a b b Figure 1.

Conclusions Our results supported our hypothesis that the initial soil characteristics (correlating with elevation) influence vegetation composition change and the effect of the carbon treatment. As the success of restoration treatment depends on the soil conditions (among others), restoration methods can be transferred to different sites only after previous investigations and adaptation to the local conditions.</p><p id="Pg356">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1031 EVALUATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF CROATIAN WINTER WHEAT GENOTYPES (T. AESTIVUM L.) FOR DROUGHT TOLERANCE Marijana BARIC1 – Snjezana KERESA1 – Ivanka HABUS JERCIC1 – Stjepan HAVARDA1 – Drazen GELENCIR1 1 Department of Plant Breeding, Genetic and Biometrics, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zagreb, Svetosimunska 25, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia, e-mail: mbaric@agr.hr Abstract: Yield stability under water stress condition is a desirable trait for wheat producers and breeders. Data for yield and other agronomic traits were collected from field trials comprising 40 bread winter wheat genotypes (T. aestivum L.) grown in water non-limiting condition and under water deficit during the grainfilling period typical for Mediterranean region. Genotypes responded differently to water deficit showing decrease of yield from 14-50% compared to water non-limiting condition. For the genotypes with high mean productivity (&gt; 7 t ha -1 ) losses in stress condition ranged from 1.3-3.0 t ha -1 . Decrease of yield due to water stress was 29, 37, and 46% for early-, mid-, and late-maturing group of genotypes, respectively. The most sensitive yield components for all three groups of genotypes were yield spike -1 and 1000 grain weight (TGW), and spike m -2 only for late- and mid-maturing group. A significant positive correlation was observed between yield and other agronomic traits: yield spike -1 , spike m -2 , TGW, test weight, and harvest index (HI) in both environments. Stable genotypes that retain high yield under water deficit compared to water non-limiting condition will be recommended for safe production as well as for breeding programs. Keywords: wheat, drought stress, yield, yield components Introduction Soil water deficit is an important environmental factor limiting the productivity of wheat. Water deficit during the grain filling period typical for Mediterranean region can reduce grain yield more than 50% (Rajaram et al. 1996; Van Ginkel et al. 1998), specially at drought sensitive genotypes (Hoffmann and Burucs 2005). The identification of genotypes with high yield potential in water stress condition is important for stable production in dry areas and growing seasons where only drought tolerant genotypes can realise the highest yield (Balla et al. 2006). Evaluation of wheat cultivars for high and stable yield in water non-limiting and water deficit environments could be done using parameters like mean productivity (MP) and tolerance to water stress (TWS) (Rosielle and Hamblin 1981). Some genotypes can combine genetic systems for high yield performance and tolerance to water deficit. These two genetic systems are apparently not always incompatible (Ceccarelli 1989), even high yielding genotypes usually have higher losses due to drought compared to low yielding genotypes. The objective of this study was (i) to identify genotypes tolerant to water deficit, (ii) to determine the influence of water stress on agronomic traits for three (early-, mid-, and late-maturing) group of genotypes, and (iii) to find out correlation between yield and other agronomic traits. Materials and methods Experimental material was comprised of 40 winter wheat genotypes grown in the field in water non-limiting conditions (total precipitation during the growing period was 530 mm) and under water deficit (precipitation reduced for 108 mm during the grain-filling period). Yield and other agronomic traits were determined at maturity. Mean</p><p id="Pg358">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1032 productivity (MP) was calculated as the average while tolerance to water stress (TWS) as the difference in yield between stress and water non-limiting conditions (Rosielle and Hamblin 1981). Genotypes were assigned to one of the three maturing groups based on heading date (early-12, mid-16 and late-12 genotypes). Early-maturing group headed approximately 5 days earlier then mid- and 10 days earlier then late- maturing group. Phenotypic correlations between agronomic traits and yield were calculated for each moisture condition (water non-limiting, water deficit) separately, across all 40 genotypes in the experiment. Results and discussion For genotypes ZgM2, ZgM4, Bc13 and Lucija with high MP (&gt; 7 t ha-1) and very good TWS (Table 1) it is expected to provide stable production in many areas and growing seasons. These genotypes, apparently, possess the combination of genetic systems for high yield performance and tolerance to water deficit as Ceccarelli (1989) claimed that is possible.

(1996) who found a negative correlation between yield and yield spike-1 in late drought condition.

Conclusions Genotypes that showed high MP (&gt;7 t ha-1) and good TWS, like ZgM2, ZgM4, Bc13 and Lucija, could be identified as those that could give stable production in water nonlimiting and water deficit condition as well. Decrease of yield due to water deficit was the highest for late-maturing group and the lowest for early-maturing group of genotypes. The most sensitive yield components for all three groups of genotypes were yield spike-1 and TGW; and spike m-2 only for late- and mid-maturing group. A significant positive correlation was observed between yield and other agronomic traits: yield spike-1, spike m-2, TGW, test weight, and HI in both environments.

Strossmayer, Trg Sv. Trojstva 3, 31 000 Osijek, Croatia Abstract: The seed vigour of four Croatian soybean cultivars was tested using standard germination tests (GR and SG), cold test (CT) and seed conductivity (EC). Vigour parameters were correlated to lipid peroxidation (TBARS) and proline content (PRO) in hypocotyls and cotyledons developed in SG and CT germination condition. Based on the significant correlations among the tested parameters, in the stressful conditions of CT, proline accumulation in cotyledons was less promoted in lower vigour seeds having low CT and high EC values. TBARS and PRO were higher in cotyledons in both tests and negatively correlated. Keywords: cold stress, germination, lipid peroxidation, proline, seed conductivity, seed vigour, soybean Introduction The possible unfavorable soil and climate conditions at planting implicate the necessity of the seed vigour evaluation. Molnár and Sárvári (2006) recommended for maize, that it is very important to choose hybrids with a good cold-test value and good moisture loss dynamics, as these traits play a fundamental role in the efficiency of production. Seed with better performance in laboratory vigour tests, such as cold stress test (CT) and electrical conductivity (EC), usually show higher emergence rate in unfavourable field conditions as reported for soybean (Andric et al. 2007). One of the major contributors to seed deterioration is lipid peroxidation. However, high vigour seed and strong seedlings have an effective defence mechanisms against oxidative stress, whereas the protective role of proline is not evaluated enough in that early developmental stage. The aim of this work was to determine free proline content and lipid peroxidation level in soybean seedlings, in different conditions at germination stage (cold test vs. standard germination test), as well as possible connections of these metabolic parameters with soybean seed vigour. Materials and methods The soybean seed of four cultivars, originating from the Agricultural Institute Osijek in Croatia were used in this research. Germinability of the soybean seed was evaluated by standard germination test (SG) conducted on moistened filter paper at 25oC for eight days with light periods at daytime. The germination rate (GR) was evaluated on the fourth day. Seed vigour tests (cold test - CT and bulk seed electrical conductivity test - EC) were performed according to the methods described by Hampton and TeKrony (1995). Soil used for CT was from the same experimental field where tested soybean seed was produced. All determinations were made in four replicates. Adequately developed seedlings were collected from all replicates in SG and CT, respectively, for the analyses of lipid peroxidation and proline content. Hypocotyls and cotyledons are grinded separately in liquid nitrogen. Lipid peroxidation level (TBARS) was determined after Heath and Packer (1968). Free proline content in soybean seedlings was analyzed as described by Bates et al. (1973). Results from laboratory seed vigour testing, lipid</p><p id="Pg362">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1036 peroxidation and proline content were analyzed statistically by the regular procedures and tests (ANOVA, correlation, F-test, LSD, t-test). Results and discussion The GR and SG of all tested soybean cultivars was high implying good seed quality of tested soybean cultivars (Table 1). However, significant differences in CT and EC indicate their variability in vigour considering possible unfavourable environmental conditions at germination stage. Cultivars Kruna and Vita had higher CT than cultivars Una and Anica, indicating their higher tolerance to low temperature and soilborne pathogen attack during germination. In general, higher EC is considered as a parameter of impaired membrane structure in seed, what could be related to lipid peroxidation process imposed by environmental stress at seed ripening stage and storage, mechanical and imbibitional damage or natural seed ageing.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1037 in CT should promote oxidative stress and subsequent lipid peroxidation in germinating seed. Considering that seedlings developed in dark conditions of CT were etiolated, it may be assumed that photosynthesis in seedlings from SG contributed to reactive oxygen intermediates production, what requires more detailed investigations. It also remains unclear why TBARS level was much higher in cotyledons and does eventually storage lipids in soybean cotyledons are affected with peroxidation process. However, cultivars Kruna and Vita showed much lower TBARS levels in both seedling parts in CT, and lower EC as well. Table 3.

Cereal Research Communications 1038 pretreatment on soybean seedling vigour in cold stress test was observed in the research of Vinković et al. (2007). Sánchez-Urdaneta et al. (2005) evaluated proline content and root growth of maize seedlings under drought stress. Here, similar to lipid peroxidation level, free proline content was much higher in seedlings developed in SG as compared to CT (Table 3). Furthermore, proline accumulated more intensively in cotyledons than in hypocotyls. Considering only CT data, cultivars Kruna and Vita had higher proline accumulation as compared to Una and Anica. Hence, cultivar Vita showed the lowest proline content in the seedlings from SG test. Based on the significant correlations among the tested parameters, it seems that in the stressful conditions of CT, proline accumulation in cotyledons is less promoted in seeds having low CT and high EC values, that means seeds with lower vigour (Figure 1). Lipid peroxidation in cotyledons from CT was significantly and positively related to EC (Figure 2 y1, r = 0.815**). Considering optimal conditions of SG test, TBARS level in cotyledons was higher in seeds with less intensive proline accumulation (Figure 2, y2, r = 0.709**). Conclusions Significant differences in CT and EC indicate variability in seed vigour of tested soybean cultivars. Seeds with low CT and high EC showed lower proline accumulation in cotyledons in the stressful conditions of CT. In the applied tests (both SG and CT), proline and TBARS were higher in cotyledons. As they were higher in an optimal conditions of SG, their background and role in seed metabolism at germination stage needs further evaluation.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1039 TOLERANCE TO DROUGHT STRESS OF CROATIAN WINTER WHEAT GENOTYPES AT SEEDLING STAGE Snjezana KERESA 1- Marijana BARIC1- Hrvoje SARCEVIC1-Ivanka HABUS JERCIC1- Vedran VUJIC1 1 Department of Plant Breeding, Genetics and Biometrics, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zagreb, Svetosimunska 25, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia, e-mail: skeresa@agr.hr Abstract: Drought stress is one of the most important environmental stresses affecting agricultural productivity and may result in considerable yield reduction. Tolerance to drought stress at seedling stage was examined for 26 winter wheat genotypes (T. aestivum L.). Drought stress at –0.5 and –1.0 MPa of water potential was simulated with polyethylene glycol 8000. According to root fresh weight (RFW), shoot fresh weight (SFW) and ratio RFW : SFW, all expressed as percentage of control average, and shoot dry weight (SDW) of nine days old seedlings, genotypes that tolerate drought stress at seedling stage were identified. Tolerance at seedling stage showed significant correlation with tolerance to drought stress at heading and grain filling period. Drought tolerance at seedling stage determined by mentioned particular traits could, therefore, be indicator of drought tolerance at heading and grain filling period. Keywords: drought stress, wheat, seedling, polyethylene glycol Introduction Soil water deficit in autumn at winter wheat seedling stage may occur in some parts of Croatia. Selection of genotypes that tolerate drought stress at this stage is, therefore, important, specially if tolerance at seedling stage is correlated with drought tolerance at heading and grain filling period. Drought leads to the drop in the rate of photosynthesis, reduction of biomass and yield (Balla et al. 2006; Hnilička at al. 2007). Drought tolerance is a complex multigenic trait with multigenic components and, root growth under stress, high root to shoot ratio and better dry matter accumulation (Baalabaki et al. 1999) are only some among traits usually reported to confer drought tolerance. The aim of this study was (i) to identify winter wheat genotypes that tolerate drought stress at seedling stage; and (ii) to compare drought tolerance of examined genotypes at seedling stage with tolerance at heading and grain filling period. Materials and methods Winter wheat genotypes (T. aestivum L.), all together 26 cultivars or breeding lines from three different Croatian breeding programs were included in this experiment. Two days after being sterilised and plated in distilled water in Petri dishes, 25 uniformly germinated seeds were transferred in each of three Petri dish (per genotype and treatment) in Hoagland solutions having water potentials close to 0 (control), -0.5 and –1.0 MPa. Water potential of –0.5 MPa or lower were obtained by adding PEG 8000 (polyethylene glycol) to the solution according to formula of Michel and Kaufmann (1973) . Seedlings were incubated seven days at 20C, after which fresh and dry weight was recorded separately for shoots and roots. Root fresh weight (RFW), shoot fresh weight (SFW) and ratio RFW : SFW were all expressed as percentage of control average for each trait and water potential. Analysis of variance and Duncan's multiple range test were conducted for each treatment (water potential) separately.</p><p id="Pg366">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1040 Results and discussion Although RFW generally decreased at water potential of –0.5 and to much higher extent at –1.0 MPa, it increased for genotypes Bc4 and ZgM1 at –0.5 MPa (Table 1.).

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1041 Higher above-ground biomass (SFW) in the field prevents to some extent evaporation from soil and could have positive effect on yield (Loss and Siddique 1994). On the contrary, high root to shoot ratio at seedling stage, as found for Osk2, Bc1, ZgM7, ZgM1 and Bc7 at –0.5 MPa, showed to be good indicator for wheat drought tolerance, although not as the only parameter (Baalabaki et al. 1999). Results on yield of here investigated 26 genotypes under control and water deficit condition have been known from previously conducted field experiments (Baric et al. 2005; Novoselovic et al. 2007) and were not shown here. However, positive, significant correlation was found between RFW, SFW and RFW : SFW, all expressed as percentage of control average, and yield (t ha-2) (Figure 1a,b and 2a). Response of genotypes to shoot dry weight (SDW) accumulation was different and the highest for ZgM4, Osk10, Osk7 and Bc2 at –0.5 MPa (Table 1). Same genotypes retained high SDW accumulation at –1.0 MPa but some others showed similar. Figure 1.

Tolerance to water stress (TOL) was defined as difference in yield between stress and yield in water nonlimiting condition. High SDW accumulation of mentioned genotypes means that despite drought stress they kept their stomata opened and continued to photosynthesise (Hoffmann and Burucs 2005). This is enabled by good osmotic adjustment of particular genotypes.

SDW at –0.5 MPa in our experiment showed significant correlation with genotype tolerance to water stress (Figure 2b), indicating that yield loss in drought stressed condition will be lower as the SDW at seedling stage is higher. Conclusion Genotypes that had high SDW along with RFW or RFW : SFW regardless at which water potential (-0.5 or –1.0 MPa), like Bc1, Bc5, Bc7, Osk1, Osk10, ZgM1 and ZgM4 could be identified as drought tolerant at seedling stage. Significant correlation was found between RFW, SFW and RFW : SFW, all expressed as percentage of control average and yield (t ha-1) and SDW and TOL. This indicates that traits at seedling stage could be used as indicators of wheat drought tolerance at heading and grain-filling period.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1043 CLIMATIC DETERMINATION OF LONG-TERM YIELD VARIABILITY OF MAJOR CROPS IN HUNGARY Csaba HAUSNER 1 – Ferenc MÁTÉ 1 – András MAKÓ 1 –István SISÁK 1 1 Department os Plant Production and Soil Science, Georgikon Faculty, University of Pannonia, talajtan@georgikon.hu Abstract: GIS anlysis of the CORINE land cover database, the AGROTOPO soil database, the digital climate map of Hungary and the long-term county based time series of wheat and maize yields were performed in this study. Nearly 10,000 random points were inserted into the arable land layer of the CORINE database and all data from the analysed layers were joined to the points. Average yield data of wheat and maize between 1960 and 2005 were analysed from this database with soil types and climate types as independent variables. Average yields were calculated for each year and for both crops and the averages were ranked. Ranks were statistically evaluated across years for each soil and climate types by calculating average rank, lower and upper quartiles and ranges between the quartiles. A tentative climate sensitivity index were calculated to delineate soils and regions within Hungary which show large responses in the yield of the two major crops to the yearly changes of the weather conditions. Presumably, these soils will be more sensitive to the long-term climatic changes, too. Keywords: GIS, wheat and maize yield statistics, climate sensitivity of soils Introduction The processes and consequences of the climate change and the alternatives of the responses have been investigated in Hungary for a long time (Láng et al. 1983, Láng 2004). There are several publications about the general agricultural effects (Anda 2004, Varga-Haszonits 2003, Harnos 2005) and the specific effect on the crop production (Szőllősi et al. 2004, Jolánkai et al. 2003). Some authors refer to the soils as to the transmitter of the climate changes on the crop production (Kertész 2001) but systematic research on the linkage between climate change and soil processes are still missing. The average temperature increased in Hungary by 1 oC-al and average annual precipitation decreased by 83 mm in the last one and half centaury and the majority of changes happened in the last few decades (Jolánkai et al. 2004, Várallyay 2006). The changes largely involve more frequent climate extremes (Bartholy and Pongrácz 2007) and this tendency seems to continue. The soil properties and their combinations show large spatial variability and the climate sensitivity of soils should follow this pattern (Várallyay 2006). The climate sensitivity must be interlinked with the water regime of the soils Farkas et al. 2005. A comprehensive classification of the water regimes of Hungarian soils were elaborated by Várallyay et al. (1980). This system was improved, partly replaced by later developments in which the authors designed a matrix with ten soil properties and ten levels of the properties (Várallyay 1982.). Available water in soils basically determines yield, thus yield must be a good indicator of climate sensitivity (Farkas et al. 2005). Our study aims at combining GIS and traditional statistics in a new way and uses well established and tested data sources (yield, maps) to delineate areas and soil types which are especially sensitive to climate effects. Materials and methods The CORINE landcover digital database (EEA 2005), the AGROTOPO soil database of Hungary (Várallyay 2005), the climate map of Hungary (The National Atlas of Hungary</p><p id="Pg370">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1044 1989) and the long-term county based time series of wheat and maize yields (KSH 1960-2005) were processed and analysed with the ArcView program (ESRI 2003). The climate map and the statistical data were digitized for the purpose of this study and the digital versions of the CORINE and AGROTOPO databases were used. The not irrigated arable land layer of the CORINE database was extracted for the analysis because the yield statistics of wheat and maize refer to the arable land and the AGROTOPO database was derived from surveys mainly from the arable land therefor it can be best used for that area. Wheat and maize are the major arable crops in Hungary. Eeach of them occupies 15-30% of the arable land thus, approximately half of the arable land are represented by the two crops. 9782 random points were placed within the polygons of the arable land layer and all data from the soil, climate and yield maps were spatially joined to the points. The data table of the resulting file was analysed with SPSS statistical program package (SPSS 2004). Annual average yield data of wheat and maize between 1960 and 2005 were calculated for each soil and climatic region and the average yields were ranked. Ranks were averaged across years for each soil and climate type and lower and upper quartiles and ranges between the quartiles were calculated. Large distances between quartiles indicate large between years variabilities mainly due to the variable weather conditions. Ranking can eliminate the long-term trends of inreasing yields between 1960 and 1990, the decreasing trends due to the economic and political turbulencies in the 1990`s and the recent trend of improvement. These are not climatic but technological (feritlization, pesticide use, machinery improvement) and management effects and they must be disclosed from the analysis of the climate effects. The calculated ranges between the quartiles were assined again to the 9782 map points according to the climatic region and soil type they belong to. A tentative climate sensitivity index (CSI) was calculated for each point as follows: CSIsoil_i/climate_i = QRwheat/soil_i + QRmaize/soil_i – QRwheat/climate_i – QRmaize/climate_i where QR is the range of quartiles for wheat and maize yields calculated for each soil type and climatic region. The rationale behind this rough calculation is that climatic regions alone are responsible for a certain amount of yield variability simply because of the different amount of rainfall and heat. If this variability is subtracted, the remaining variability is mainly due to the two-way interaction effect between climate and soil and this is a measure for the climate sensitivity of soils. Results and discussion Each of the 31 categories in the AGROTOPO map was represented in the 9782 „sampling points”. However the number of points for the soil types varied between 2 and 1062. Soils with less than 50 points (7 soil types) were excluded from the more detailed comparisions and soils with 50-100 points were excluded from the final</p><p id="Pg371">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1045 evaluation of the climate sensitivity index. However, each point was considered for the map representation. Each of the 18 categories in the climatic map was represented in the 9782 „sampling points”. However the number of points for the climatic regions varied between 2 and 1609. Climates with less than 50 points (6 regions) were excluded from the more detailed comparisions but each point was considered for the map representation. Comparision of soils with average ranks for wheat and maize has shown that ranks are rather similar for both crops. However, few soil types can be selected which are more suitable for maize (Haplic Luvisol, Stagnic Luvisol) or for wheat (sandy Haplic Phaeozem). By analysing ranges of quartiles, soils were selected which are slightly, medium or strongly responsive to year-to-year variability. Slightly and medium responsive soils have shown wide range of fertlity (average yield rank) and the few strongly responsive soils also had a considerable range of rank values. Year-to-year variabilities of rank ranges for the climatic regions were smaller than for soil types. Figure 1.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1047 EFFECT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON SOIL EROSION FROM A SMALL CATCHMENT István SISÁK 1 – Ferenc MÁTÉ 1 – Péter SZŰCS 2 1 Department os Plant Production and Soil Science, Georgikon Faculty, University of Pannonia, talajtan@georgikon.hu 2 Agricultural Authority of Vas County, Directorate for Pland and Soil Protection Abstract: A small catchment at Tagyon in the watershed of Lake Balaton has been monitored for suspended sediment (SS) and total phosphorus (TP) runoff between 2003 and 2006. Annual sediment exports varied between 1.27 and 4.90 t ha -1 and TP exports between 1.25 and 2.23 kg ha -1 . 7-20 % of SS load and 11-23 % of TP load from the catchment were trapped in the approach channel of the Chipoletti weir. There is a linear relationship between runoff volume and SS and TP loads on a double logarithmic scale. Two orders of magnitude change in the runoff volume involves three orders of manitude change in the phosphorus load and four orders of magnitude change in the sediment load. Diffuse phosphorus load and eutrophication of Lake Balaton may be accelerated even if point source loads will be further reduced and average annual precipitation decrease due to excessive events forcasted for the climate change in the Carpathian Basin. Keywords: erosion monitoring, small catchemnt, total phosphorus, diffuse load, climate change Introduction Enhanced eutrophication of surface waters is a world-wide phenomenon and the water quality of Lake Balaton, the largest shallow lake in Europe had rapidly deteriorated since the early 1970s (Somlyódy, 1983), too. The primary biomass production of the lake has been regulated by available phosphorus (P) in the water (Oláh et al., 1973). Light and nitrogen may be growth limiting factors in some circumstances in summer, but the key water quality regulator remains phosphorus (Somlyódy, 1983; Heródek et al., 1988). Both total P and Chl-a content in Lake Balaton decreased significantly in the last decade due to the reduced external loads from app. 300 t-P yr-1 to 145 t-P yr-1 (Somlyódy et al., 2003). In spite of the achievements in reduction of P loads, large parts of the water body are still eutrophic in the most sensitive tourist season (KVVM, 2007). Further reduction of P load must be pursued by decreasing diffuse (partly agricultural) P load (Somlyódy et al., 2003). These continuing efforts and the regulatory actions should be based on measurements of agricultural P runoff from small catchments and on systematic monitoring of the water quality on the watershed. However, climate change effect may reduce the effect of measures for reducing erosion and phosphorus load. Materials and methods Studies on small, rural catchments (Rekolainen et al., 1997; Poviliatis, 2004; Sarpley et al., 2001) are the usual approaches in estimating agricultural contribution to total P load. We have adopted in this approach. A small catchment monitoring station was set up at Tagyon in 2003. The station was equipped with automatic ISCO 6712 sampler, ultrasonic stage recorder and meteorological extensions (rainfall, temperature and relative humidity measurements). The station is built with Cipoletti weir and eroded sediment accumulates in the basin and in the approach channel behind the weir. The catchment is located in the northern sub-watershed of Lake Balaton with steep slopes, forest is in the upper segment and vineyards in the lower segment of the catchment. Basic data of the catchment and soil tests are the following: area: 0.61 km2, average</p><p id="Pg374">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1048 slope: 12.8 %, average humus content of soil: 2.82 %. soil texture class: clay loam (stony), ammonium-lactate soluble P2O5: 681 mg kg -1. The sampling starts when water level exceeded the level of the weir crests. Equal time interval sampling was chosen with time steps of 10-20 minutes. Suspended sediment (SS) content of the samples was determined by filtering. Molybdenum–reactive P (MRP) of the samples was determined on filtered samples and total P (TP) content was determined on unfiltered samples following digestion with a semi micro Kjeldahl procedure (Bremner and Mulvaney, 1982) by the colorimetric method of Murphy and Riley (1962). Sediment samples were taken from the approach channels and TP measurement was performed. Soils of the watersheds have been monitored, as well. 95 point samples were taken from the plough layer of the cultivated area in the catchments and common soil tests were performed. The KA value of soils was measured (Várallyay, 1993). This soil physical test is used in Hungary to characterize soil consistency and its value is close to the liquid limit described by Sowers (1965). The available P content of the soil was measured according to Egner et al. (1960). Humus content of the samples was measured according to Hargitai (1988) with the potassium-dichromate method. Data generated between October 2003 and December 2006 are presented here. Results and discussion Measured annual total runoffs from the catchment in the observed period varied between 2.5 and 8.5 mm. Annual sediment exports varied between 1.27 and 4.90 t ha-1 and TP exports between 1.25 and 2.23 kg ha-1. These numbers include loads both with runoff and as trapped material in the approach channel of the weir. Runoff rates are not high probably due to the stoniness of soils that supports infiltration and water conductivity of the soils. 7-20 % of SS load and 11-23 % of TP load from the catchment were trapped in the settled sediment of the approach channel. There was an excessive event at 11th July 2005. The peak runoff in this event exceeded 700 m3 h-1 that is more then double of the second largest value. The approach channel and the basin of the monitoring station were largely filled up with sediment during the rising phase of the runoff and the declining phase and later runoffs (among them also a very large event) carried almost all the suspended and rolling material through the weir without significant deposition. Total rainfall amount was far less at 11th of July than 17th of August 2005 but measured SS and TP exports showed opposite ratios in the two largest events. This is due to the strongly contrasting within storm pattern of the rainfall intensities. Higher initial intensity in the smaller rainfall event produced larger erosion. This result supports the findings of Torri et al. (1999) who recognised the strong within storm variability of the erosion processes. Herodek et al. (1995) has already poined out the importance of heavy summer rainstorms in the sediment and phosphorus loads from the watershed of Lake Balaton. Our result also have shown that large runoff events produces much more sediment and phosphorus than small ones. There is a linear relationship between runoff volume and loads in a double logarithmic diagram (Figure 1). Two orders of magnitude change in the runoff volume involves three orders of manitude change in the phosphorus load and four orders of magnitude change in the sediment load. In spite of the excessively high</p><p id="Pg375">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1049 plant-available phosphorus content in the topsoil the phosphorus is strongly „diluted” with the soil material of the deeper layers with low soil test P thus, TP load does not lineraly increase with the SS load. Even small runoff events do not produce high MRP loads due to the adsorption of P on the particles originated from the cley loam soil which has abundant active surface for adsorption. y = 1.9865x - 4.3689 R 2 = 0.8212 y = 1.5343x - 3.1974 R2 = 0.8168 -2 -1.5 -1 -0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 log(Runoff) m3 log(SSload) t log(TPload) kg Lineáris (log(SSload) t) Lineáris (log(TPload) kg) Figure 1. Dependence of the suspended sediment and total phosphorus loads from the runoff (double logarithmic layout) Tagyon 2003-2006 There is a clear evidence that extrem rainfalls have become more frequent in the Carpathian Basin (Bartholy and Pongrácz, 2007) especially in the WesternTransdanubia where Lake Balaton is located. Frequency of daily rainfalls higher than 20 mm increased more than 20 percent in the last two decades and the growth rate was higher in the last decade. Almost exclusively, these rainfall events have produced the runoffs measured at Tagyon. Monitoring the erosion effect of these events is crucial part of the second tier assesment (Tóth et. al 2006) of soil degradation processes in Hungary where erosion is the most common soil degradation process (Várallyay 2006). Conclusions Heavy summer rainstorms may increase SS and TP loads from the watershed of Lake Balaton at a much higher proportion than the increase of runoff. The derived relationship for the small catchment of Tagyon is suitable to give SS and TP loads for</p><p id="Pg376">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Diffuse phosphorus load and eutrophication of Lake Balaton may be accelerated due to excessive events even if point source loads will be further reduced and average annual precipitation decrease.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1051 SIMULATION OF THE IMPACT OF FERTILIZER DOZES ON NITRATE CONCENTRATIONS IN THE STREAM Pavla PEKAROVA1 – Michal SEBIN1 – Jan PEKAR2 – Milan ONDERKA1 – Pavol MIKLANEK1 1 Institute of Hydrology, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Racianska 75, 831 02 Bratislava, Slovakia, e-mail: pekarova@uh.savba.sk 2 Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Informatics, Comenius University Bratislava, Slovakia Abstract: One of the requirements imposed by the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC is to analyze and predict long-term evolution of surface water quality parameters. During a 20-year period (1987–2006), concentrations of nutrients were studied in three model microbasins of the experimental Mostenik basin (Institute of Hydrology) in Central Slovakia: 1. Rybarik (agricultural), 2. Lesny (forested, hornbeam), and 3. Cingelova (forested, spruce). This study deals with a suitable stochastic Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models that were used to simulate monthly nitrate concentrations in the Rybarik stream. Two regressors (fertilizer dozes and discharge) were added into the models to simulate the impact of fertilizers on nitrate content in the stream water. Keywords: fertilizers, experimental basin, SARIMA models, nitrate simulation Introduction Nitrate loading from an agricultural basin is generally strongly related to the amount of fertilizers applied; however, seasonality of hydrological conditions in the basin may play a significant role also. Occurrence of nitrate in water is studied rather extensively due to its impact on public health (Lenhart et al. 2003; Holko et al. 2006, Nemeth, 2006; Dolezal et al. 2007; Bensa et al. 2007; Huitu et al. 2007). The aim of this study is: 1. to analyze nitrate concentrations observed in the Rybarik stream during the 20–year period 1987–2006; 2. to simulate the impact of dozes of fertilizers on nitrate concentration in the stream using Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models. Materials and methods A statistical analysis was performed on a data set covering fifty years of experimental observations in the Mostenik basin (area – 17.2 km2) near Povazska Bystrica, Slovakia. In 1986, water quality monitoring was initiated in three sub-basins with different land use within the Mostenik basin. Most of the Rybarik agricultural microbasin (area – 0.119 km2, elevations 369–434 m above sea level) is cultivated by state-owned enterprises (70%), while private farmers possess the rest of the area. The geological conditions in the Rybarik basin are characterized by flysch substrates. First hydro-meteorological observations in the Rybarik microbasin were made in 1962. Discharge, precipitation and temperature were recorded continuously up until 2006 (Fig. 1). Since 1986, sampling of the stream water, drainage, precipitation, and snow was conducted every 1–7 days, depending on hydrological conditions in the basin (Baca, 2006). Approximately 100 samples per year were taken from the Rybarik stream (Fig. 1). Simultaneously, amount of nitrogen fertilizers and vegetation cover were recorded.</p><p id="Pg378">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Daily discharge Q, nitrate concentrations in the Rybarik stream NO3 , fertilizer dozes F, daily air temperature T, and daily precipitation P, Rybarik microbasin, November 1986–October 1991. For the long-term prediction and simulation of fertilizer dozes impact on nitrate concentration in the stream, different stochastic autoregressive integrated moving average models (Burt and Worrall, 2007; Worrall and Burt, 2007) were tested. In general, the SARIMA(p,d,q) x(P,D,Q)12 model takes the form:  (B)  (B12)d  D12 Yt = (B)(B 12)Et, (1) where: Et - random variable with zero mean =0 and variance E 2;  - the regular MA operator of order q;  - the regular AR operator of order p;  - the regular SAR operator of order P;  - the regular SMA operator of order Q; d - the backwards difference operator; D12 - the seasonal backwards difference operator; B - the reversion shift operator defined as BYt = Yt-1. Results and discussion In general, the highest rates of fertilizers applied in Slovakia (around 90 kg of nitrogen per 1 ha of agricultural land) were between 1970 and 1990. A rapid decrease (up to 27 kg of nitrogen per 1 ha) in the use of nitrogen fertilizers took place after 1989, which was a consequence of economic changes in the country. Crops that were grown in the agricultural Rybarik microbasin during the studied years are listed in Table 1, as well as the amounts of nitrogen fertilizers applied. In 2005 and 2006, no nitrogen fertilizers were applied in the Rybarik microbasin. The highest average monthly value of NO3 - in Rybarik stream was found on April 1988 - 77.9 mg.l-1 (Fig. 2a). After 1990, gradual improvement of the water quality was observed. This improvement most likely resulted from the recession in the application of agricultural fertilizers. The analysis of seasonality showed that maximum nitrate concentrations in surface runoff are in the spring season, when there is no vegetation cover in the basin. The discharge rapidly increases and nitrates are washed out from the upper layer of the soil profile (Fig. 2b). Dependence of average annual nitrate concentrations Cv (weighted against discharge) on annual fertilizer dozes F is depicted in Fig. 2c.</p><p id="Pg379">VII.

Conclusions Twenty years water quality observations in the Rybarik experimental agricultural microbasin allowed us to analyze the variability and complexity of nitrate content in the stream water. Results of the field measurements conducted in 2005 and 2006 at the outlet point of the agricultural basin suggest that concentrations of nitrates did not decrease considerably after the application of fertilizers had been interrupted. On the basis of the model efficiency, two models (model with constant mean, and SAR model, both with 2 regressors – fertilizer doses F and monthly discharge Q) were chosen to simulate the impact of fertilizers on nitrate content in the surface water (Fig. 3).

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1055 INVESTIGATIONS OF SOIL TILLAGE TECHNOLOGIES IN SUGAR BEET PRODUCTION László BOTTLIK1 – Attila STINGLI1 – Tibor KALMÁR1 – Attila PERCZE1 – Tamás TAKÁCS 1 Dep. of Soil Management, Inst. of Crop Production, Szent István University, Páter K. 1., Gödöllő, Hungary. Bottlik.Laszlo@mkk.szie.hu Abstract: Nowadays both climate extremes and economic difficulties call attention to use sugar beet tillage systems that may establish production more successfully. The importance of mulch leaving tillage rises up by emphasizing soil moisture-, organic matter-, and soil surface protection. The damages caused by tillage can be eliminated using ploughless or improved ploughing systems. Furthermore, water-, air-, nutrient-, and heat management of soil are improved. We found, that soil aggregation increases and microbial activity is promoted in soils under mulch leaving tillage systems. In this way better growing conditions can be established, and simultaneously climate damages might be mitigated. Keywords: climate extremes, risk, soil condition, improved ploughing, adoption, mulch Introduction Sugar beet is one of the plants, which requires the highest amount of investment and technological discipline, therefore the establishment of production is a key-factor (Bottlik, 2007). Minimizing hazards during growing season is the basis of efficient sugar beet production. In addition, the strict conditions of sugar market require keeping strict quotas from growers. The main risk factors of sugar beet production are the plant homogenity, plant protection, nutrient- and water-supply, preceding crops, and soil condition (Ungai and Győri, 2006). All growing factors are affected by soil conditions (Birkás et al., 2006). Additionally, soil is the only factor that can moderate climate extremes without irrigation, but on the contrary, can enhance these effects, either (Várallyay, 2006, Tóth et al., 2006). There is only one profitable way to reduce climate damages: producers have to improve or maintain soil condition, so the risk connected with climate extremes can be mitigated (Birkás et al., 2006, 2007; Dolezal et al., 2007; Stekauerová and Nagy, 2007; Vágó et al., 2006). In order to establish sugar and root yield stability, a rational, environment-capable soil tillage system should be applied in the future. Materials and methods Recently, we have made field investigations in different micro-regions to determine the hazard factors of conventional tillage system based on ploughing and to evaluate the real advantages of mulch tillage in sugar beet production. The trials were carried out at Multiton L.P. (North-East Hungary) and at a former state farm in Cegléd (Central Hungary) and at Agricultural Ltd. in Szerencs (Northern Hungary) on clay loam and loam soils. Three methods were used to evaluate soil state factors (a) analysing of soil state to a depth of 30 cm by spade probe, (b) measuring soil penetration resistance for each 50 mm layer with penetrometer, (c) examination of soil agronomical structure (fractions: clod&gt;10 mm, aggregate=10-2.5 mm, small aggregate=2.5-0.25 mm, dust&lt;0.25 mm). Methods of measurements and evaluations corresponded to ISO standards. This research is in connection with the mulch technology program focusing on sugar beet production stability.</p><p id="Pg382">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1056 Results and discussion 1. Conventional tillage based on ploughing (without autumnal surface preparation) In both years, plough-pan compactions were observed at a depth of 25-30 cm. This layer had a penetration resistance of 3.75 MPa or higher. 40 mm thick pan layer has been found by spade probe below the ploughed layer. Inadequately loosened soil state in the season has limited the rooting depth and root formation during sugar beet growth. Figure 1. Agronomical structure under conventional ploughing system (without autumnal surface preparation) of sugar beet in 2006 Figure 1 and 2 show the further risks of inverting tillage. Percentage of aggregate (37 and 31) fractions was low, however small aggregate (35 and 27) and dust fractions (17 and 35) were too high in 2006. The stability of soil structure had rapidly been deteriorated during vegetation period limiting the adequate aeration of soil. Figure 2. Agronomical structure under improved ploughing system (with surface preparation) of sugar beet 2. Improved ploughing tillage (with autumnal surface preparation) We found that tillage systems for sugar beet can be rationalized by changing ploughing practice (Table 1), which are preparing ploughed surface in the same pass and minimizing the number of spring passes. This technique may conserve not only the aggregates and the loosened layer but the water content of soil, as well (Várallyay, 2006). As we found, the duration of looseness has remained during the season and ratio of the aggregates increased up to 70-75 % or higher. Data of the field monitoring confirmed that in the growing season both the depth of loosened layer and the surface state are the most important factors in the formation and mass of sugar beet roots. 3. Evaluation of mulch tillage and investigation of the adaptability in Hungary</p><p id="Pg383">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1057 We found that the mulch-cultivator or soil ripper for primary tillage (Table 1) may conserve the mulch adequately and as a consequence, the depth and duration of the soil looseness have met the demands of sugar beet. The agronomical structure – as the ratio of clod, aggregate and dust – showed more favorable rate in soils, which have been disturbed moderately with heavy-duty cultivator (ratio of 12:75:13 in Cegléd and of 9:86:5 in Szerencs relation – Figure 3). In the trials five factors had beneficial impacts on the aggregation: soil structure conservation tillage, surface mulching (after harvest and after planting), moderated surface drying, preceding crop rooting, and earthworm activity. After stubble stripping about 25-35 % of the mulch cover was sufficient in structure– and water conservation. We stated that 12-15 % of mulch cover has sufficiently decreased the aggregate deterioration from seeding to final phase of bowering of beet leaves. Table 1.

Fertilizing, planting Precision seeder with fertilizer In one pass We stated that sugar beet does not require soil inverting but it demands a loosened state of the root zone, aggregation maintenance (ratio of 75-85%), and a favourable water transport which can be fulfilled by mulch tillage with less soil structure deterioration. Figure 3. Agronomical structure under mulch tillage system of sugar beet We have stated the main causes of the changes in tillage practice of sugar beet growing in the first decade of the 2000s. These are as follows: 1) increase of fuel and agricultural material costs; 2) number of hazards (soil condition defects) connected with</p><p id="Pg384">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1058 conventional beet technology – in spite of increasing expenditures; 3) higher sensitivity of sugar beet to climate extremes on account of soil state defects. We found that total cost of mulch tillage – from stubble to planting – is 35-45% less compared to conventional till. Therefore new and conventional technologies must be investigated under present sugar industry situation (e.g. closing down factories). A challenge for the future is that mulch tillage system can also be adopted under wide-row crops (maize, sunflower, soybean). Hereby, stubble residues may reach a greater appreciation than it has gained at any time. Conclusions Our results stated that the conventional ploughing system has a number of critical risk factors, such as plough-pan compaction during primary tillage, decline of loosened soil state before planting, structure deterioration before and after planting and sometimes, higher water loss than expected. To stabilize the beet production regarding climate extremes and the production costs two improving steps can be done. In one hand a rationalised ploughing system can be used and in the other hand a mulch-leaving primary tillage can be applied. The adaptability of mulch tillage on different soils requires precise investigations. The mulch technology of sugar beet growing has not been adopted generally under national circumstances. However this system can also be adopted under other wide-row crops as well.

Keywords: grazing, mowing, soil parameters Introduction Soil–plant relationships were analysed on pastures of the Tapolcai and Káli Basins grazed by cattle, sheep and goat. Aims of agricultural use and nature conservation have to be harmonized on these areas according to EU expectations (Várallyay 2006, Birkás et al. 2006). Land use has to be managed by considering the agroecological potential of agriculture (Várallyay 2007). Wetlands are especially important from a nature conservation point of view (Boecker et al. 2006, Tasi 2007). Several authors deal with relationships between soil parameters and vegetation in differenet habitats (Lacová et al. 2006, Ľubomír – Hallett et al. 2007, Barczi et al. 2006, Csontos and Tamás 2006, Halbritter et al. 2003). Grass species and medicinal herbs in the vegetation of pastures were observed with a high interest as their changes have got a high importance, especially in cases if mainly these species ensure the most valuable forage for grazing animals (Vinczeffy 1998, Szemán 1994/95, 2003, 2007, Tasi 2002, 2003). Materials and methods Data collected near Badacsonytördemic (pasture grazed by grey cattle) and Kővágóörs (pasture grazed by sheep) villages situated in the Tapolcai and the Káli Basins are evaluated in the current paper. Five quadrates of 2×2 m were observed in every sample area during July 2007, giving species coverage in percentage. During data process, measured actual total coverage was counted into 100% relative coverage. Soil profiles were examined in the field to give a description of pedological background of the examined areas. The upper 0-20 cm layer is the most important under grasslands, because this where the plants are taking up most of the nutrients from. Laboratory experiments were done for the following parameters: texture, pH(H2O) and pH(KCl), CaCO3 (%), soil organic matter, AL-P2O5 (mg kg -1), AL-K2O (mg kg -1). A data matrix containing 45 relevés and 101 species was used for multivariate data analyses from which two dendrograms were calculated by the SYN-TAX 2000 computer package (Podani 2001). The first dendrogram was based on binary data, whereas the second one was based on cover values of the species (using a base 2 logarithmic transformation of the raw data). In both cases Euclidean-distance was used</p><p id="Pg386">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1060 to calculate the comparative matrix and the UPGMA method was applied to build up trees. Results and discussion The sample area near Kővágóörs is characterised by sandstone near the surface. Texture of the erubase (Leptosol) soil was sandy loam. Thickness of the soil varies highly. Deepness of the soil profile excavated by authors was 55 cm and deepness of the humus layer was 23 cm. The A-horizon was slightly compacted as a result of grazing and this intensifyed towards the parent material. The pH of the soil was neutral, towards alkaline. Organic material content of the soil is decreasing as going further from the stable and a similar tendency is showed by phosphorous and potassium content as well, except for wet areas lying deeply, where the amount of grass yield is enough even in dryer periods (Table 1). Therefore, grazing animals stay more in these areas. Compacted soil near the surface was not found in the sample area near Badacsonytördemic. Texture of Histic Vertisol and Fluvisol is sandy loam, with mull generating at 37-50cm deepness. Thickness of the soil was deep. Deepness of the soil profile was 150 cm, with a 150 cm thick humus layer.

Based on this, these areas are outstandingly suitable for grassland amangement and grazing. Due to animal manure, phosphorous and potassium content is much (3.5-4.8 times) higher near (0-50m from) the stable than as moving farther from it in the sample area near Kővágóörs. In case of the Badacsonytördemic area, distribution of observed phosphorous and potassium content data is much more moderate. This is probably caused by the fact that this area is often covered by water, thus, suffusions wash away differences in nutrient content and pH. Differences in nutrient content are caused by mull and turf in the deeper areas. According to the analysis made with binary data, grazed 1-5 and mowed 6-10 relevés near Badacsonytördemic mix, that is grazing and mowing indicates about the same level of disturbance. However, this 10 quadrates as a great common group differentiate from all the other cases.</p><p id="Pg387">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1061 Those quadrates (11-15) whithout mowing near Badacsonytördemic is a not thoroughly unified group. Its diversification may be caused by spontaneous changes in the vegetation driven by lack of management. The control relevés (21-25) near Badacsonytördemic is a well converging robust group, that is these quadrates are very similar from a floristical point of view. Steps of the sequence of moving further from the stable near Kővágóörs are relatively well manifested, although, these are the samples onto which quantitative data give an even better result. Quadrates 26-30 can be found as relatively analogous, though, it is a bit disturbing that two of the quadrates farthest from the stable (42, 44) are close to them. 31-35 and 36-40 are two perfect groups. Finally, 41-45, as mentioned above, has broken up. Figure 1. Binary analysis of coenological data gained near Badacsonytördemic and Kővágóőrs Conclusions The most important result originating from the binary assessment is that grazed 1-5 and mowed 6-10 quadrates near Badacsonytördemic form a robust group together, that is the two types of effects (grazing and mowing) seem to be rather similar considering species stock of the vegetation. Control relevés differentiate well. All of the 5-5 quadrates of the zones moving farther from the stables stay in absolutely coherent groups. This definitely verifies the fact that the vegetation indicates the intensity of management (disturbance) very well. Considering soil parameters, different management types showed great differences. Changes in soil parameters can be detected well in parallel with botanical data, depending on the intensity of animal presence. References Barczi - T. M. Tóth - A. Csanádi - P. Sümegi – I.

Group in Theoretical Biology and Ecology, Pázmány P. s. 1/c, Budapest, H-1117, Hungary Abstract: Soil and vegetation are good indicators of environmental changes. The examined area is semi-arid, extreme dry where open grassland is the typical vegetation. Soils are dry and sandy with vegetation types showing xerotherm characteristics and dominated by endemic species. Urbanization caused growth of nitrate content in the degraded, shallow, sandy soils, while the physiognomy of the vegetation remained the same with some changes in the species composition: the amount of weeds and species resistant to disturbance has increased and the Cynodon dactylon has become dominant on grasslands. Among values measured in the upper soil, humus and lime content are higher in quadrates dominated by Festuca pseudovaginata and, on the contrary, K2O, P2O5 and total-N show higher values on the area of Festuca vaginata. A new species, Festuca pseudovaginata has appeared in an environment influenced by humans at a higher extent. Keywords: Festuca vaginata, Festuca pseudovaginata, grasslands, human disturbance, soil chemistry Introduction While observing the flora it is important to study the bedrock and the soil types as well. The nutrient poor sandy soils in the extremely dry semi-arid areas of the Carpathian Basin are characterised by open, native vegetation consisting of xerophytes. A native species of the open grasslands is Festuca vaginata. The survey was carried out on areas grazed by sheep and on undisturbed grasslands. Based on EU standards, aims of agricultural use and nature conservation have to be harmonised on these areas as well (Várallyay 2006, Birkás et al. 2006, Tasi 2007, Szemán 2007). Besides that, land use has to be managed considering the agroecological potential of Hungarian agriculture (Várallyay 2007), especially on those areas where water supply is a determinative factor (Lacová et al. 2006, Ľubomír–Hallett et al. 2007, Ligetvári et al. 2006). Materials and methods Coenological surveys were carried out in May 2006, employing the Braun-Blanquet (1951) method in quadrates of 2x2 m. Nomenclature of species follow Simon (2000), the naming of associations are based on the system of Borhidi (2003). The occurrence of the species in Hungary is uncertain, a taxon blooming in early spring, Festuca pseudovaginata can be found instead, which was described as a new species (Penksza 2003). Taking soil samples, authors considered the botanical point of view. Altogether 40 spot were examined. Samples were taken from two soil horizons (0-15 and 15-30 cm. Soil parameters that might be connected to vegetation were examined. Laboratory measurements were made on: pH (H2O, KCl); CaCO3; AL- P2O5; Al- K2O; humus (Turin method). Nitrogen availability, nitrogen forms (KCl replaceable ammoniumnitrogen and nitrate) and total nitrogen content. Multivariative analyses of the 20 sites were based on the following data: 1) covering rates of 80 vascular plant species and that of the cryptogam crust; 2) values of 9 soil properties (pH[KCl], pH[H2O], humus,</p><p id="Pg390">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1064 ammonium, nitrate, total-N, Ca%, P2O5 and K2O) as measured in the 0-15 cm soil layer; 3) values of the same soil properties as measured in both soil layers (0-15 and 15-30 cm) soil layers. The three data types were subjected to the same cluster analysis technique: fusion algorithm was a combinatorial method (minimizing increase of variance) and the correlation was used as comparative function (Podani 2001). Results and discussion The pH of the examined topsoil was usually around 8, CaCO3 content between 3-5% that refers to weak lime content. The humus content was very low in every case (&lt;0.5%). The area has got a very low nutrient content; the overall average N content was 300 mg/kg, P2O5 content 25 mg/kg, K2O content 35 mg/kg. Based on the soil laboratory and field data, soils can be classified as regosoils (Table 1). In the Hungarian Classification System they belong to moving sand and featureless sandy soil type, calcareous subtype and low humus version (Stefanovits 1992). Table 1.

It may also be mentioned that similarity within the Fv group is stronger than in the Fp group, which is indicated by the fusion levels that are at dissimilarities of 0.12 and 0.24 for the Fv- and Fp-group, respectively. In the dendrogram based on the topsoil chemical properties both Fp and Fv groups can be recognized well, although, their distinction is not perfect (Fig. 2). This refers to the fact that there is strict connection between topsoil and vegetation. However, vegetation data may differ from what we see according to data of the topsoil, because other types of effects (independent from soil properties) also affect the vegetation (e.g. grazing, trampling and disturbance). If we use also data measured in the lower and the upper soil layers to count the dendrogram, then we surprisingly face the fact that Fp and Fv samples thoroughly mixed (Fig. 3). This may refer to the fact that soil data measured at 15-30 cm deepness</p><p id="Pg391">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1065 practically do not have any effect on Festuca grasslands. That is, 15-30 cm below certain quadrates of Fp and Fv may be patches with very similar soil chemistry, and this is true vice versa, that is 15-30 cm below two quadrates of Fp even very different patches (considering soil chemistry) may lie.

Conclusions Authors found reason for the distribution and existence of species based on the soil examinations. The Festuca vaginata population was found on soils with higher nitrogen</p><p id="Pg392">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1066 and phosphorous content, while Festuca pseudovaginata was widespread on soils with lower nutrients. The association with Festuca vaginata was widespread on nutrient richer soils while the association with Festuca pseudovaginata is living on soils with extremely poor nutrient content. The average of the two upper layers proves the association with Festuca vaginata to live on nutrient rich soils. Higher nutrient content can be explained by lower anthropogenic effects. The examined field was much smoother, nutrient distribution was more equal and nutrient content was higher. There was no mixture of the soil layers. This poor environment with Festuca pseudovaginata could only allow the formation of an open grassland; there are no weeds, either. The disturbance, mixing of the soil layers can be seen from the coenological descriptions. It is a very colourful place with a lot of species. During our examination, which was extended onto disturbed sandy areas as well, we took special interest in the intervegetational relations and the distribution of two Festuca species, the Festuca vaginata and the F. pseudovaginata. The recently discovered F. pseudovaginata is adapting much better to the environment developed during human activity than other members of the genus, thus, on the disturbed (grazing, military areas etc.) areas the dominance of the F. pseudovaginata, and on the less disturbed, mainly just mowed parts the dominance of the F. vaginata can be observed. Based on soil scientific examinations it can be stated that in soil samples from under the stands of the F. vaginata the amount of phosphorous and nitrogen was higher than in the case of the F. pseudovaginata. This poorer environment of F. pseudovaginata only allowed the forming of open grasslands, weed species did not appear in significant numbers either. Based on our survey series, coenological point of view the vegetation differs under conditions influenced by disturbance, we found also in each habitat a divergent species composition.

Group in Theoretical Biology and Ecology, Pázmány P. s. 1/c, Budapest, H-1117, Hungary Abstract: The formerly widespread wetland habitats and floodplain forests are in danger today, as the number of such places has been sharply decreased in the river Danube due to the lowering of the groundwater level caused by the river regulation works. The statistical multivariate data analysis of the coenological surveys that were carried out in floodplain forests – being developed on floodplain soils – in two distant parts of the Hungarian Danube section revealed that the recorded quadrates of the two islands mainly differ from each other in species composition and the ratio of their most characteristic species. According to the nature conservation assessment of the forests, the most natural plant associations of the islands are the willow gallery forests (Leucojo aestivum-Salicetum albae). This result is also supported by the degradation values. It could be also connected to the fact that willow gallery forests are situated in the lowest parts of the floodplains that are the most flooded places, therefore only a few alien species can appear as competitors due to the extremely high soil moisture values and the long lasting water coverage. Keywords: floodplain forests, floodplain soils, Danube islands, statistical multivariate data analysis Introduction Hungary is rich in surface-waters due to the abundant water supply of the rivers originating from the mountains that surround the Carpathian basin (Centeri et al. 2007). A couple of centuries ago – previous to the great river regulation works – floodplain plant associations covered more than twenty times as big territory as they do today. The number of the formerly common wetland habitats and floodplain forests has extremely decreased even in around the river Danube. Groundwater level lowered especially in the floodplains of the main stream of the river Danube, thus causing the most significant changes in the floodplain forests there (Kevey 2004). According to the predictions the resources will not be increasing – in all probability will be decreasing – in the following years (Nagy et al. 2007). Wetland habitats are of high priority in nature conservation (Tasi 2007, Boecker et al. 2006, Várallyay 2006, 2007, Kiss et al. 2006. Loksa et al. 2007), and they are extremely endangered because of water supply uncertainties (Herczeg et al. 2006, Vona et al. 2006, Štekauerova et al. 2003). The productivity also depends on the moisture and physical properties of the soil (Gombos 2007). Therefore experimental researches are very important (Lacová and Štekauerova 2007, Ľubomír – Hallett et al. 2007). In our essay we compared the vegetation types of two Danube islands that are determined by the water supply and the soil characteristics. Materials and methods The Island of Koppánymonostor is one of the biggest islands from those ones that can be found in the river Danube near Komárom. The island is 3.5 km long, its average width is 150–350 m, and its total area is about 87 hectares. The Szúnyog Island is situated in the southernmost part of the Hungarian Danube section close to Kölked with almost the same parameters. The coenological surveys were carried out during summer and autumn 2007, by following the nomenclature of Simon (2000), and by using the</p><p id="Pg394">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1068 Braun-Blanquet (1964) method with different quadrate sizes in the different plant associations. A data matrix was used for multivariate data analyses from which two dendrograms were calculated by the SYN-TAX 2000 computer package (Podani 2001). Euclidean-distance was used to calculate the comparative matrix, and the UPGMA method was applied to build up trees. Results and discussion Figure 1. and figure 2. show the results of the classification analyses derived from the summary chart of the coenological surveys that were carried out in the Island of Koppánymonostor – covered by gravelly and silty floodplain soil – and in the Szúnyog Island. Figure 1. shows the dendrogram that was calculated from the binary data of the coenological surveys recorded in the poplar woods of the two islands. The quadrates 1– 12 were recorded in the white poplar (Populus alba) and black poplar (Populus nigra) woods of the Island of Koppánymonostor, while the quadrates 13–17 represent the white poplar woods of the Szúnyog Island. The forests of the two islands can be clearly separated from each other due to the different dissimilarity values, but the white poplar and black poplar woods of the Island of Koppánymonostor can not be distinguished so sharply. Figure 1. The comparative binary statistical analysis of the poplar woods of Koppánymonostor and Szúnyog islands The quadrates 1–3 show very similar black poplar woods (the similarity between quadrates 2–3 is especially conspicuous). Quadrate 4 and quadrate 5 were also recorded in black poplar woods with dissimilarity values between 0.3–0.4 (just like in the case of Populus s tands D is s im il a ri ty 0,75 0,7 0,65 0,6 0,55 0,5 0,45 0,4 0,35 0,3 0,25 0,2 0,15 0,1 0,05 1 2 3 4 11 10 9 12 5 7 6 8 13 14 16 15 17</p><p id="Pg395">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1069 quadrates 1–3), but according to the binary analyses they were put into the white poplar group because of their species composition. During the binary analyses it was found two-two striking similarities in the white poplar and the black poplar woods of the northern Danube section in the case of quadrates 4 and 11 together with the quadrates 5 and 7. The quadrates 13–17 that were recorded in the white poplar woods of the Szúnyog Island totally differed from the others, and even their dissimilarity values (0.35–0.4) are different from the values of the quadrates recorded in the white poplar woods of the Island of Koppánymonostor, which have dissimilarity values as high as 0.5. Figure 2. shows the dendrogram that includes the coverage values of the species of the coenological surveys as well. Three clearly distinguishable groups can bee seen on the dendrogram. The first group represents the black poplar woods of the Island of Koppánymonostor (quadrates 1–5), which differ much among themselves, except for quadrates 1–2. Although the other two groups are connected by their main plant association forming species, the white poplar (Populus alba), their recorded quadrates significantly differ from one another. The white poplar quadrates of the Szúnyog Island (13–15) have smaller dissimilarity values than the white poplar quadrates of the Island of Koppánymonostor (6–12), consequently the quadrates from the Szúnyog Island are more similar among themselves. Figure 2. The quantitative statistical analysis of the poplar woods of Koppánymonostor and Szúnyog islands Conclusions According to the multivariate data analysis, the quadrates of the two islands mainly differ in their species composition. The binary analyses clearly revealed that the composition of the white poplar and black poplar woods in the Island of Koppánymonostor resemble each other much more than the white poplar woods of the two islands far in the different sections of the river Danube. The white poplar and black Populus stands D is si m il a ri ty 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 9 7 10 11 12 8 13 17 14 16 15</p><p id="Pg396">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1070 poplar woods differ only in the coverage ratio of their characteristic species. To the contrary, whereas the coverage ratio of the identical species is higher in the quadrates of the white poplar woods of the two islands than in the case of the black poplar quadrates, the species composition of the white poplar woods is fairly different, except for the plant association forming species. According to the nature conservation assessment of the forests, the most natural plant associations of the islands are the willow forests (Leucojo aestivum-Salicetum albae). This result is also supported by the degradation values. It could be also connected to the fact that willow forests are situated in the lowest parts of the floodplains that are the most flooded places, therefore only a few alien species can appear as competitors due to the extremely high soil moisture values and the long lasting water coverage.

The gas emission containing nitrogen could be minimised by manure. Both the applications of mineral nitrogen fertiliser and plant residue increased gaseous nitrogen losses of denitrification origin. Keywords: organic and inorganic fertilisation, microbial activity, denitrification, greenhouse gas emission Introduction The interactions of soil-plant systems are determined by the physical and chemical factors of environment, the microbiological properties of rhizosphere and the genetic characteristics of plants. Soil microbial life influences the nutrient supplying capacity of soil, the nutrient uptake of plants and their stress resistence (Vivas et al., 2003). Plants also have special effects on microbial activity. Root exudates and root litter may intensify microbial life and the whole system might affect the global environment producing and emitting e. g. greenhouse gases to the atmosphere (Mengel and Kirkby, 1982). Since microbial transformations of soil are so essential, it is very important to study these processes even in simple model experiments so that optimal plant nutrition strategies with minimal environmental risk can be formed. In the present paper a microcosm experiment set is reported, in which nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission of denitrification origin mostly and the microbial activity of soil samples treated with different additives were investigated. Bacterial counts were performed to test the ratio of nitrification and denitrification in the gas emitting processes. The total microbial activity was also observed comparing the results of a gas chromatographic measurement and a biodegradation test method. Materials and methods Microcosm experiment: The microcosm experiment was conducted in glass vessels covered gas tightly. 200 g homogenised (&lt;2 mm) slightly alkaline solonchak arable land soil samples of low humus content (Table 1.) were placed into glass vessels of 1200 cm3. The soil samples were treated by different additives (Table 2.) at 90 % of water holding capacity. Three replications per treatment were incubated at 37 C temperature during 70 days in 2007. The N2O and CO2 concentrations of gas samples taken from the headspace of each vessel were determined by a HP 5890 gas chromatograph (GC) applying a packed column, electron capture and thermal conductivity detectors. The NO-content was measured by means of chemiluminescent detection in an ANTEK 7050</p><p id="Pg398">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1072 NO-Analyser. The gas samples were analysed three times per day whenever measurements were carried out using external standards and one point linear calibration. Table 1.

The triplicate MPN solutions were incubated at 28 oC for 10 days. Respiratory activity measurement: For the measurement of the biological activity of the soil samples an OxiTop soil respirometry system was used. The OxiTop system consists of a glass bottle with a pressure sensor in the cap. 200 g soil samples of 90 % moisture content were placed into each bottles and sodium hydroxide adsorbent to the gas phase. The bottles were incubated at 20o C for 30 days. The oxygen consuming and carbon dioxide emitting activity of soil microbial life and the adsorption of CO2 changed the pressure inside the closed bottles which was measured and registered by a detector. Results and discussion The changes of the concentrations of the different gases plotted against time can be seen in Figure 1.A), B), C) and 2. The horizontal axes represent the time of incubation and the vertical axes denote gas concentrations. Figure 3. shows changes of the number of denitrifiers during the 5 weeks long incubation. The temporal changes of NO and N2O concentrations characterised the activity of denitrifiers, since no nitrifying bacteria were detected by MPN-measurements. (Results of nitrifier-measurements are not reported.) The high moisture content of the samples also justifies the prevailing role of denitrification in the production of the above gases. The relatively high temperature favoured the microbial process resulting in higher gas concentrations than could be observed in field experiments (Cannavo et al., 2004).</p><p id="Pg399">VII.

Treatments are C, M, CN and MN. During denitrification sub processes NO was produced faster and spent shorter time in the atmosphere of the microcosms due to its shorter lifetime than N2O did. Its short life might explain the detected significant fluctuations in its concentration. The effect of the different treatments was similar in the case of both gases. As the nitrogen and organic material content of the treated soil samples was increased, higher gas concentrations could be measured in the order of treatments C, CN, M and MN. The undisturbed control soils produced fast maximums, but the decomposition of organic matter needed more time in M-MN and R-RN order. In treatment R, the highest N2O concentrations could be detected due to the relatively high nitrate (NO3 –) (Table 2.) and organic material content of this soil, in agreement with other results (Paavolainen and Smolander, 1998). However, the decomposition of the maize straw of high C/N ratio required quite a long time, therefore the maximal values could be measured only</p><p id="Pg400">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1074 after the third week. If the soil samples were amended with further amount of nitrogen fertiliser (RN), higher gas emission could not be observed, as it was experienced in other experiments (Hoffmann et al., 2006), as well. Similarly to yield depression occurring in the case of plants, the lack of sufficient amount of readily decomposable organic matter which would have been required by the higher NO3 – level, no further improvement of microbial activity and resulted gas emission could be detected. If an optimal rate of nitrogen fertilisation can be stated for plant production (150 kg ha–1 year–1; Németh, 2006), higher doses also applied in present experiment (500 kg ha–1) may be unbeneficial to soil micro-organisms, as well. Although the MPN results justified the activity of denitrifiers (Figure 3.), the uncertainities of the method (Cannavo et al., 2004) requires further experiments so that the experienced periodicity can be explained and the appearance of toxic metabolites can be justified. The apparent contradiction between the high bacterium number and the low gas emission in treatment C on the 2nd week might be explained by a more enhanced assimilatory than dissimilatory NO3 – reduction and thus an improved immobilisation instead of gas emission (Paavolainen and Smolander, 1998). The increasing nitrite concentration can be toxic to several soil biological processes, as it can be seen from the shapes of the CO2 curves representing the total microbial activity (Figure 1.C.) After the maximums detected in the second week, the downward tendencies might also be assigned to the decreasing amount of decomposable organic matter. The higher C/N ratio characterised the treated soil samples, the more intensive total microbial activity and CO2 production could be detected in the maximums. The results of the OxiTop (Figure 2.) and GC measurements of the same order of magnitude showed different trends. The lower temperature in the former case might have caused lower mineralisation lasting longer resulting in no decreasing tendencies during the respiratory measurements. Conclusions Based on the results of the reported model experiments it can be stated that depending on the features of the soil, the optimal soil C/N ratio with relatively low denitrification losses could be achieved by the application of manure.

Abstract: In our experiment we have examined the production of baby beetroot under different growing method from the traditional one, with shorter maturity period and with different genotypes on alluvial meadow soil. In this growing phase tender leaves can be consumed so examining the mineral element content of lamina and petiole was considered important. On the whole, it can be concluded that the suitability for growing of the examined 6 varieties for baby beetroot was proved in the case of variety Rubin because both in terms of the usable ratio of beetroot bodies and inside qualities it was considered the best of all. With its fine leafage and intensive body strengthening, this variety seemed most suitable for this growing purpose. The examintions of mineral element content have verified the value of leaves of this plant type that is the nutriophysiological advantages of its consuming. Keywords: table beet, baby beetroot production, pigment content and composition, varieties, minereal element content in leaf Introduction The nutrio-physiological effect of beetroot is very important. Its active materials examined in experiments so far and their role in medical cures have supported its more prestigious position in the row of order of our vegetables. Most of its physiologically favourable effects are due to its colour content (Takács Hajos et al., 2004). Many researcher proved the influence effect of varieties ont he quality parameters (PepóGyőri, 2007; Hegyi et al, 2007). Besides, in different phases of development the concentration of the colour content of the plant varies. In national circumstances, beetroot has been used as processed food industrial product so far – such as in form of pickles and basic material of juices. Whereas, in other countries it is used as baby beetroot, in form of pectin rich squash fermented with lactic acid, as well as for replacing artificial food colours with, and its leaves are used as basic ingredients for sauces and soups. The leaf of beetroot is richer than the root in mineral element content, so it roil in the food chain may play an important roil (Husti, 2006). The nature of growing baby beetroot includes the fact that its maturity period is 60 days so only the varieties thickening intensively are to be used, the beetroot bodies should be of 3-5 cm of diameter. Choosing the right varieties is of primary importance, as well as choosing the right period for harvesting, that is having beetroot bodies smaller than 5 cm of diameter because bigger sized ones can be sold only at a cheaper price. The aim of the experiment included examining how the beetroot varieties suit the aims of growing baby beetroot as a function of bioactive materials and economic value measures in the given growing circumstances. Materials and methods The experiments were conducted on the Horticultural Experimental Farm of Tessedik Sámuel College, Faculty of Agriculture Water and Environmental Management, on</p><p id="Pg402">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1076 alluvial meadow soil. 6 beetroot varieties (Beta vulgaris L. ssp. esculenta var. rubra) were examined. They included 5 Dutch varieties (Taunus, Boro F1, Pablo F1, Bikores, Little Ball) and 1 Hungarian one (Rubin). The sowing was done on 26 April, 2006 where the distance between the rows was 15cms and the size of the plot was 2 ms x 0,3 m. Harvesting was conducted on 6 June, 2006 and after it the following measurements were taken: the varieties were sorted by their sizes, such as beetroot bodies smaller than 3 cm, the ones between 3 and 5 cm and the ones bigger than 5 cm. Also, we measured, crop quantity (kg). During the laboratory measurements we have measured the colour content (mg/100g) with spectrophoto-meter in the Chemistry and Soil Laboratory of the Faculty. As for the color content measurement it was made at wave lengths of λ=535 nm; λ =476 nm and λ=600 nm. Mineral element values were determined by an atom absorption method using ICP OES IRIS Thermo Jarrel ASH device. It was conducted in Institute of Field and Vegetable Crops, Novi Sad. The soil data of our experiment field are included in Table 1. Table 1 Soil determination values pH and EC values include distilled water extract in 1:2 ratio. Results and discussion The critical phase of the growing process is determining the right period of harvesting so the beetroot bodies should be harvested in the phase when the ratio of fractions of 3-5 cm pieces is the biggest. With respect to Rubin varieties this value reached 50% of the total number of pieces, whereas regarding other varieties this value varied at 40%. (Figure 1). The quality of beetroot is primarily determined by the colour material content and inner colour intensity of the bodies. It can be concluded that the smaller bodies are richer regardig both their red (betacianin – BC) and yellow (betaxantin – BX) colour material content than the ones bigger than 5cm.

The nutrio-physically important ion ratio – (Ca2++Na+)/(Mg2++K2+), whose optimal value in the human organism involves ~1.0 – showed better that is lower values in the petiole in case of all varieties. So, it is worth consuming not only the lamina of beetroot leaves but also their petiole because its mineral element content and composition are very favourable.</p><p id="Pg404">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

From the varieties, Rubin, Pablo F1 and Taunus showed the best betacianin (91,3 - 97,41 mg/100g) values. The leaf of the beetroot is rich in mineral elements, its ion ratio is favourable. So, as for the beetroot it is advised to consume the body as well as the leaves of the plant in this tender phase. On the whole it can be concluded that the suitability of growing baby beetroot with respect to the examined 6 varieties was verified only in the case of variety Rubin. This variety had the best ratio of utilizable beetroot bodies and its inner content qualities were favourable, too. References Hegyi Z. - Pók I. – Szőke C. – Pintér J.: 2007.

In the long-term experiment was studied the effect of major production factors (fertilization, irrigation, cultivation, sowing time, pea varieties) on the yield of pea and their relationship with quality of soil. Keywords: leguminose, pea, water, nutrient, cultivation, soil Introduction Pea have the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, with the help of the rhizobium bacterium. Pea crops need nitrogen between 30 % to 80 % through biological fixation (Nádasy and Nádasy 2006, Singh and Wright 2006). Pea improves attributes of soil (water management, humus content, soil condition) increases nutrient content (Birkás et al. 2006). It is the best forecrop of wheat. Negative effects of global changing of clime is also possible with adapting pea in crop rotation (Várallyai et al. 2007). Nitrogen fertilization increases yield in most cases more than any other nutrient fertilization (Pulung 1994). The interaction between agricultural factors are studied by Győri (1981), Szirmai and Czóbel (2006), Kádár (2007). Materials and methods The effect of fertilization, irrigation, soil cultivation on the yield of pea (Pisum sativum L.) in 1991-2007. and pea types in 2006-2007. was studied in a long-term experiment set up by Ruzsányi at the Látókép experimental field of Debrecen University, Centre of Agricultural Sciences and Engineering, Institute of Crop Science, Hungary. Corn was the forecrop in the long-term experiment, pea type Forman, strength density: 1,1 million hectare-1, in chernozem soil (silt + clay content: 50 %; organic matter: 2,5 – 3,0 (organic carbon 1,5 %); pH in KCl: 5,5 – 6,5; Whole nitrogen: 0,12 – 0,18 %; Ammonium lactate extracted Phosphorous in P2O5: 138 mg kg -1; Ammonium lactete extracted Potassium in K2O: 270 mg kg -1). The replication number was four, the experimental parcels were 46 m2. Results and discussion Pea has been grown on 20-25 thousand ha in the past few years in Hungary. 22 – 28% content of protein gives its importance. Pea needs 380 – 420 mm water in growing season. Water needs are not ensured in the most of the years in Hungary. If fall is too high, pea produces too much green mass with low growth. In growing season of pea fall has exceeded 200mm in 6 years, and has not reached 200 mm in 8 years causing lack of water, reducing the accessible yield, in the analysed 14 years as it can be seen in the first figure.</p><p id="Pg406">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

In variants with ZnSO4 nutrition an increase of Zn content was found in comparison with the variants where Zn(NO3)2 nutrition had been applied. It was particularly significantly manifested in the stems at the higher as well as at the lower nutrition level and in the upper green leaves as well as the lower yellow leaves of the oat at the higher nutrition level. The five times higher Zn nutrition intensity was significantly manifested in higher Zn content in all monitored parts of the oat plant. A significantly higher content of zinc was found in the lower yellow leaves in comparison with the upper green leaves. The highest content was recorded in roots. Introduction Zinc is an important essential element for plants. An excess of zinc in the soil, or high doses, leads to signs of toxicity. Plants mainly take it up as the divalent cation Zn2+, at higher pH probably as the hydrated monovalent cation ZnOH+, another possibility of zinc uptake is fixed in chelates (Marschner, 1997). Fe2+ and Mn2+ affect zinc uptake competitively and other divalent cations - Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+ depressively. Higher pH values and phosphorus fertilisation reduce zinc uptake (Zhu et al., 2001). Nitrogen, in comparison with other nutrients, is absorbed to the largest extent and can significantly influence uptake and content as well, mainly that of cations in plants (Nemeth, 2006; Hejnak et Ernestova, 2007; Tuma et al., 2007). Examples of other anions’ influence (e.g. Cl-, SO4 2-) are not published so often. The mobility of zinc in the plant is average, the values move between K+ and Ca2+. Zinc at a higher content in the nutrient medium accumulates primarily in the root tissues. Zn2+ is transported through the xylem fixed to anions of organic acids (probably such as a citrate or malate complex). High concentrations of zinc were found in the phloem. It is assumed that zinc is able to form native chelates. It has been demonstrated that it can react with lowmolecular organic substances, possibly forming Zn-phytates (Grusak et al. 1999). The mobility of zinc is thus dependent on the capacity of these substances to form mobile or insoluble complexes with zinc. In old leaves zinc is immobile, this is explained by its reaction with phosphorus during which the Zn3(PO4)2.4H2O precipitate is formed. The aim of our study has been to establish how zinc fertilisation with accompanying mobile anions in the fertiliser influences its translocation and the content of zinc in the dry matter of the oat’s (Avena sativa L.) panicles, stems, upper green leaves, lower yellowing leaves and roots.</p><p id="Pg410">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1084 Materials and methods The research was implemented in the form of a pot trial. The experimental plant was the oat (Avena sativa L.), variety Atego. Polyethylene buckets with perforated bottoms were used as trial pots which were placed in plates with a foam-rubber circular underlay. 7 kg of dry earth were weighed out and put into the pots along with a fertiliser dose. The agro-chemical characteristics of the soil used were the following: pH/CaCl2 – 6.8; content of available P 82, K 243, Mg 116, all in mg kg-1 in extract according to Mehlich III, content of As – 12.8; Cd – 0.63; Cr – 44.7; Cu – 9.60; Hg – 0.067; Mn – 500; Ni – 14.1; Pb – 29; Zn – 61.8; all in mg kg-1 in extract of aqua regia, CEC 118 mmol kg-1. In the experiment 7 fertiliser variants were set up with three repetitions. The experimental scheme and doses of chemicals per pot are given in Table 1. The experiment took place in standard lighting conditions and with the optimum water regime. The harvest took place in the milk ripeness phase. 8 plants were harvested from each experimental pot and these were separated into panicles, stems, upper green leaves and lower yellowing leaves. The individual parts were independently analysed for their Zn content. The mineralization was used by the dry method – a charge of 0.5 - 5g dry matter. The zinc content in the mineralisate was determined using atomic adsorption. The results were statistically treated using analysis of variance in the Statistica program, Wilkson’s Test at the 0.95 significance level. Table 1.

The lowest Zn content was determined in the panicles, then stems and green leaves. A significantly higher content was observed in the lower yellowing leaves and the significantly highest content was found in the roots. Vragolovic et al. (2007) also describes the difficulty of transporting Zn into the generative organs of the maize. Cui et Wang (2005) states that the Zn supply in wheat was shown particularly in Zn accumulation in root tissues. The significantly higher Zn content in yellow leaves in comparison with the green ones indicates its accumulation in ageing plant tissues and more difficult zinc reutilisation. The five times higher Zn dose, applied to variants III, V and VII, manifested itself significantly in its higher content in all parts of the oat plant, the most distinct in stems and roots. Margues et al. (2007) also describes the more marked effect of Zn fertilisation in comparison with leaves of Phragmites australis.</p><p id="Pg411">VII.

When evaluating the influence of the accompanying mobile anions (NO3 -, Cl-, SO4 2-) on zinc content an increase in its content was found in those variants with ZnSO4 nutrition in comparison with the other variants where Zn(NO3)2 nutrition was applied. This effect was shown to be significant particularly in the stems at the higher as well as the lower nutrition level and in green as well as yellow leaves at the higher nutrition level. This trend was also observed in the roots but due to the higher variance of values it was statistically insignificant. The opposite trend was only found in the panicles, where insignificantly lower values were measured in variants with the ZnSO4 nutrition. Zinc content values in variants with the ZnCl2 nutrition were determined in all parts of the oat plant to be between the values from plants with Zn(NO3)2 and ZnSO4 nutrition. A similar trend is also shown by the results of Sirguey et al. (2006), when in high N doses a decrease in Zn and Cd concentrations was found in the biomass and Cui et Wang (2005) recorded significant increases in the Zn content in roots as well as shoots after the S supply. Marschner (1997) presents synergic uptake between cations and anions of the same valence, whereas for ions of unequal valence this relation was not shown. The whole process is evidently related to the pH regulation and compensation of electrical charges.

A five times higher intensity of Zn nutrition significantly manifested itself in a higher Zn content in all monitored parts of the oat plant. In the lower yellow leaves a significantly higher Zn content was established in comparison with the upper green leaves. The highest content was found in the roots.

Anthropogenic effects may change the condition of top soil. In our experiments we have examined how the total and endurable element content and humus stability coefficient (Q index) changed in 2005 in the experiment started in autumn,1994 with 8 elements (Cu, Zn, As, Hg, Al, Cr, Cd, Pb) at 3 loaded levels (0/30, 90 and 270 kg/element/ha) conducted in 3 repetitions. The samples are taken from plots charged with elements of 270 kg/ha. The soil of the experiment is chernozem forest brown soil, with slightly acid chemical reaction in the ploughed layers, with no lime content. It can be concluded that the heavy metal contamination from 12 years earlier had a traced effect in the humus quality of the tested soil. After the big dose (270kg/ha) Cd, Cr, Zn, Hg, Pb, Cu, As heavy metal soil contemination the humus quality tested with Hargitai Method has changed. The instabil, immature humus fraction has increased in a great propotion and expanded compared to the stabil fraction. The greater the metal contamination in soil is the more the humus stability coefficient is reduced. Keywords: long term experiment, heavy metal, humus stability Introduction The anthropogenic effects may change the condition of the soil (Várallyay, 2006, 2007). It is not only the incorrect agrotechnics but also the harmful outer effects (e.g. metal toxicity) that affect the productivity of the soil (Probisch et al. 2007). In the soil a strong humus formation generally appears when the intensive reproduction of microbes is not only stopped by some cause (e.g. salt accumulation , O2 supply stopped in a short time, metal toxication etc.) but also it results in their mass destruction (Szabó 1986, Filep 1988). Humification and mineralization are two contradictory processes regarding the dead organic materials of the soil. Under the most favorable conditions there is a balanced situation when a sufficient quantity of supply elements with mineral bond is connected back on the producent level and at the same time as much organic remnants are humificated as much is able to at least regenerate the constant humus lost of the soil (Szabó 1986, Stefanovits 1992). On the basis of a great number of tests Hargitai (1967) put the soils of Hungary in order. He concluded that regarding our national soils boggy meadow soils and meadow moors involve the highest humus content but they include the lowest humus stability coefficient which shows the unfavorable quality and presence of accumulated raw organic material. Materials and methods The aim of our experiment was to conclude that in the soil of the experiment conducted in Autumn, 1994 how the total and endurable element content and humus stability coefficient (Q index). The place of the plough field small plot experiment was the A-14 plot of Experimental Study Field of Károly Róbert College. Its soil is chernozem forest</p><p id="Pg414">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1088 brown soil, its chemical reaction in the ploughed layers is slightly acidic (pH (H2O)=6.4, pH (KCl)=5.4), hydrolity acidity (y1) index 9.5, with no lime content. The organic material content of the is 3%, Arany’s bond number is (KA) 45,0. As for the physical soil types it is clay adobe (Fodor, 2002). In the Autumn of 1994 the experiment was started with 8 elements (Cu, Zn, As, Hg, Al, Cr, Cd, Pb) at 3 loaded levels (0/30, 90 and 270 kg/element/ha) conducted in 3 repetitions on a plot of 35m2 territory. The soil sample was taken from the layer 0-30cms with hand drill. The samples originate from plots loaded with 270 kg/ha element. After drying, grinding and homogenization we determined the NH4-acetate + EDTA soluble fraction (Lakanen – Erviö 1971) as well as all the element reserve to be estimated by ccHNO3+ccH2O2 opening. Humus detection was carried out by Hargitai’s (1968) Method. Stabil humus was dissolved by NaF whereas instabil humus was dissolved by NaOH. Humus detection data were valued by one component random experiment’s variance analysis (Sváb 1981). Results and discussion The basic results of soil samples taken in October 2005 regarding total and endurable element content are included in Table 1.

Regarding Hg contamination the pollution is yet almost 50 times, wereas as for Cd it is 19 times above the „B” limit. If we want to know from all the supply how big is the fraction that can directly get into the food chain and can accumulate there, then the endurable element supply must be studied (Table 1). The endurable element content overpasses „B” limit in the case of Cd 16 times, regarding all the other elements the detected indices are under „B” limit. It is important to note Hg. All the Hg supply of the soil samples are 50 times above „B” limit, whereas in respect to the endurable Hg the supply does not reach detectable level. This proves the fact that H gin some form is fixed in the soil which under present circumstances is not available for microbial biomass and/or phytomass. The change in the humus stability index (Q) under different metal contaminations is to be shown in Table 2.</p><p id="Pg415">VII.

As the stability index is the quotient of the extinctions of NaF and NaOH soluble fractions, this way its decrease is to be attributed to either the decrease of NaF soluble humus fraction or the increase of NaOH soluble fraction. If the NaF soluble fraction decreases, then we can deduce that stabil humus is destabilized as a result of metal contamination. If the ratio of NaOH soluble fraction increases, beside the disorder in humification, we can think of the accumulation of organic material as a result of metal contamination. The change of extinction values of NaF soluble humus fraction under metal contamination is shown in Table 3.

It suggests that the ratio of instabil humus fraction has increased in the soil of the metal contaminated plots.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1091 BAYESIAN INFERENCE IN THE PHYLOGENETICS OF PHOMA TAXONS László IRINYI – Erzsébet SÁNDOR Department of Plant Protection, Faculty of Agricultural Sciences, University of Debrecen, Böszörményi út 138. Debrecen, 4032, irinyil@yahoo.fr Abstract: In phylogenetics, there are several ways to infer phylogenetic relationships. Bayesian inference for estimating phylogenetic trees has been proposed as one of the most suitable character-based methods. It is based on the notion of posterior probabilities: probabilities that are estimated after learning something from the data. In this study we have firstly tried to study phylogenetic relationships by Bayesian methods in the Phoma genus. Twenty-seven isolates of ten different Phoma species were firstly characterised morphologically, and then their tef1 sequences were sequenced and analysed by Bayesian methods carried out by MrBayes program. According to phylogenetic tree inferred by Bayesian analysis, the different Phoma taxons are well separated proving that Bayesian inference is well suited for phylogenetic studies among Phoma species. However, the phylogenetic tree does not support the traditional Phoma sections based on morphological characterization. The Bayesian analyses of the tef1 sequences confirmed that the Phyllosticta sojicola species is clustered with the Phoma exigua var. exigua group and the Phoma sojicola is grouped with Phoma pinodella group. The experienced molecular evidences initiate the demand of reclassification of formerly mentioned soybean pathogens. Keywords:, Phoma, translation elongation factor, phylogenetics, bayesian analysis Introduction Phoma is a cosmopolitan genus of coelomycetous fungi. Many species have been reported from a wide range of hosts and substrates, particularly as pathogens from plants, as well as soil-borne but predominantly saprophytic and opportunistic species have also been isolated. Almost 2000 Phoma species have been reported throughout the world until now (Boerema et al., 2004). Up to now the characterization of Phoma species has been mostly applied on the basis of morphology, phenotype and physiology. Recently, Boerema et al. (2004) published a Phoma Identification Manual, based on morphological studies which contain 223 cultural descriptions of specific and intraspecific taxa of Phoma Sacc. However molecular identification methods are useful tools for a confirmative or distinctive complement in the taxonomy of fungi. One of the most commonly used molecular techniques for assessing phylogenetic relationships is to evaluate the sequences of certain fungal DNA regions (phylogenetic markers). In this study we have found suitable molecular marker which can be used as phylogenetic marker in the molecular based classification in the Phoma genus. The translation elongation factor coding gene (tef1) is a highly conserved gene and it has been suggested to have desirable properties for phylogenetic inference (Roger et al., 1999). It is well suited for determining phylogenetic relationships, due to its universal occurrence and presence typically as a single-copy within the genome (Baldauf and Doolittle, 1997). Tef1 has been proven to be a useful gene to resolve phylogenetic relationships at species level as well as in deeper divergences where amino acid substitutions provide phylogenetic resolution (Roger et al., 1999; Druzhinina and Kubicek, 2005). In molecular phylogenetics, there are two fundamental ways of processing the data: as distances or as discrete characters. Character-based methods, including Parsmony,</p><p id="Pg418">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1092 Maximum Likelihood (ML), and Bayesian methods, all use the multiple alignments directly by comparing characters within each column (each site) in the alignment. Bayesian inference is based on the notion of posterior probabilities: probabilities that are estimated, based on some model (prior expectations), after learning something about the data. Bayesian analysis of phylogenies (Rannala and Yang, 1996; Mau and Newton, 1997, Mau et al., 1999) is similar to Maximum Likelihood in that the user postulates a model of evolution and the program searches for the best trees that are consistent with both the model and with the alignment. It differs somewhat form ML in that while ML seeks the tree that maximizes the probability of observing the data given that tree, Bayesian analysis seeks the tree that maximizes the probability of the tree given that data and the model for evolution. Materials and methods Twenty-seven isolates of ten different Phoma species (Phoma pinodella, Phoma sojicola, Phoma exigua var. exigua, Phoma exigua var. linicola, Phoma plurivora, Phoma glomerata, Phoma eupyrena, Phoma destructiva, Phoma foveata, Phoma multirostrata) from diverse hosts were firstly characterised by morphologically according to Boerema et al. (2004), and then their tef1 sequences were sequenced and analysed by Bayesian method carried out by MrBayes (Huelsenbeck, 2000). Total genomic DNA was extracted from freeze-dried mycelium and isolated using the E.Z.N.A.® TM Fungal DNA Isolation Kit (Omega Bio-tek, Inc., USA) according to the protocol (as following the manufacture instructions). DNA concentration was estimated by comparison with known standard in agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. The large intron of the tef1 gene was amplified by the EF1-728F and EF1-986R primer pair (Druzhinina and Kubicek, 2005). The obtained DNA sequences were aligned first with ClustalX (Thompson et al., 1997) and a manual check-up for ambiguities was carried out, with the necessary adjustments using Genedoc (Nicholas et al., 1997). Single gaps were treated either as missing data or as the fifth base and multistate characters were treated as uncertain. Models of sequence evolution were evaluated for each dataset and model parameter estimates obtained with Modeltest v.3.7 (Posada and Grandall, 1998) using Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Phylogenetic analyses by Bayasian method were performed in MrBayes (Huelsenbeck, 2000). For phylogenetic analyses of tef1 fragments we involved other Phoma and Ascochyta species, all were downloaded from GenBank maintained by the NCBI. Results and discussion The morphological identification of the isolates was done following the descriptions of Boerama et al. (2004). The obtained results indicated that the microscopical and cultural characteristics of the concerned Phoma isolates fit to the identity of Phoma species given in. According to phylogenetic tree (Fig.1) inferred by Bayesian analysis of tef1 sequences, the different Phoma taxons are well separated proving that Bayesian inference is well suited for phylogenetic studies among Phoma species. Phoma species represented by more than one isolates constitute clades which are well separated from each other like Phoma pinodella and Phome exigua var. exigua group,</p><p id="Pg419">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1093 which prove that the tef1 sequences are well suited for delineating phylogenetic relationships within the Phoma genus. All Phoma species form a well distinguishable group from the Ascochyta species, which proves the monophyletic origin of Phoma genus. However, the phylogenetic tree does not support the traditional Phoma sections based on morphological characterization. Figure 1. Phylogenetic relationships of Phoma strains inferred by the Bayesian analysis of tef1 sequences. Numbers indicate Bayesian posterior probability values. The columns on the right side represent the Phoma section based on morphological characterization. Conclusions Here we have used tef1 gene to resolve phylogenetic relationships within Phoma genus at higher taxonomic levels. The present study has proved the tef1 region to be phylogenetically useful tool for defining Phoma species.</p><p id="Pg420">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1094 Phoma species are well separated from their closely related Ascochyta taxa. As the identification of Phoma and Ascochyta genus based on morphological characteristics is often problematic, this new phylogenetic marker can be a useful tool for mycologists identifying an unknown species. The Bayesian analyses of tef1 sequences confirmed that the Phyllosticta sojicola species is clustered with the Phoma exigua var. exigua group as Kövics et al. (1999) claimed and the Phoma sojicola is grouped with Phoma pinodella group. The experienced molecular evidence clearly entails the demand of reclassification of formerly mentioned soybean pathogens.

The most important of these is CO2, which has risen from a constant 280 ppm to 380 ppm since the start of the industrial revolution. Even the most optimistic predictions foresee a further increase to 550 ppm by 2100. The climate changes caused by greenhouse gases have a major impact on the success of crop production. Various aspects of this problem, namely the atmospheric CO2 level and the soil water supplies, were investigated in cereals grown under controlled conditions in the phytotron. An increase in the atmospheric CO2 level was found to mitigate or eliminate the negative effects of drought on biomass and grain yield. Variety traits were found to be more important for yield quality than the environmental factors tested, suggesting that adaptability could be improved by breeding. Doubling the atmospheric CO2 concentration led to a deterioration in yield quality, but the extent of the decline was dependent on the genotype. The differences recorded between the genotypes will make it possible to use conventional and molecular breeding methods to develop gene combinations conferring better adaptability to environmental changes, for use in breeding new, more adaptable varieties. Keywords: cereals, increased atmospheric CO2 concentration, water deficiency, adaptability Introduction The climatic extremes that most frequently influence the ecosystems in the Carpathian Basin are low or high temperature and a deficiency or excess of rainfall (Várallyay 2006, 2007a, Mikulec and Stehlová 2006). Many climatic changes make their effect felt in agriculture. Higher mean temperatures accelerate plant development, resulting in shorter vegetation periods and yield losses. Although a rise in the atmospheric CO2 concentration can be expected to have an indirect negative effect due to the greenhouse effect, it also stimulates biomass accumulation, thus increasing grain yield. A greater number of very hot days during the ripening period will not only lead to substantial yield losses, but will also impair the quality. Like high temperature, rainfall deficiency has a negative effect on both yield quantity and quality, while excessive rainfall leads to delayed ripening and a high yield of poorer quality grain. Plant responses to climatic changes are fundamentally influenced by adaptability and abiotic stress tolerance (Balla et al. 2006, Czövek et al. 2006). Rainfall is one of the most important crop production factors. Depending on the soil texture, a large proportion of the rainfall quantity may not be accessible to the crop, leading to disturbances in plant water supplies (Várallyay 2007b). The water requirement of cultivated wheat varieties during the vegetation period is around 350–410 mm, but this is rarely met by natural rainfall. The phytotron established in the Agricultural Research Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences provides ideal conditions for modelling the effect of ecological factors. The present research aimed to determine the effects, interactions and correlations of the climatic changes predicted for the region, such as higher atmospheric CO2 concentration, a rise in mean temperatures and in the number of very hot days and a decline in rainfall quantities, on the biomass production and grain yield of cereals by applying these factors both separately and in combination.</p><p id="Pg422">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1096 Materials and methods The following genotypes, with diverse genetic backgrounds and origin, were examined in the experiments: winter barley (Petra), winter wheat (Libellula, Mv Regiment, Mv Mambó), winter durum wheat (Mv Makaróni), spring wheat (Lona), spring oats (Mv Pehely). The plants were grown under controlled conditions in two PGV-36 chambers in the phytotron of the Agricultural Research Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, at atmospheric CO2 levels of 380 ppm (normal) and 750 ppm (double). Water was withheld for seven days from the 10th day after heading, during which time the volumetric water content (VWC%) dropped from an average of 25% to around 6%. The water supplies in the control ranged from 22.4–30.2%. The soil moisture content was recorded using an Em50 data collector and EC-5 sensors of the ECH2O type (Decagon Devices, USA). Phenological parameters (plant height, tiller number, spike number, ratio of productive tillers, biomass production) and agronomic traits (harvest index, grain yield, thousandkernel mass, grain protein content) were recorded for each species and variety. The data were evaluated using two-factor analysis of variance. Results and discussion Plants grown at doubled CO2 level produced more organic matter, being taller, with more spikes and a higher grain number per plant than those grown at the present CO2 level (Table 1). Thanks to the more intensive incorporation of carbohydrate there was an increase in the mean grain mass and in the grain yield per plant, while the harvest index did not differ significantly from the control, indicating that a proportionate amount of the additional CO2 fixed by the plant was incorporated into the grains. The protein content of the grains was lowest in this treatment, due to the greater incorporation of starch (Fig. 1). Drought stress applied in the early stages of ripening inhibited biomass accumulation and caused forced ripening, with an increase in the number of sterile grains (p=10%) and a decrease in the final grain mass. This resulted in an average 40% decrease in the grain mass per plant and lower values of harvest index. These smaller grains had a relatively higher protein content at the expense of the starch fraction (Fig. 1). Due to the favourable effect of higher atmospheric CO2 concentration there was generally an improvement in drought stress tolerance; the biomass and grain number in drought-stressed cereals grown at the doubled CO2 concentration were on a par with the control values (normal CO2 level and water supplies). High CO2 concentration was also able to moderate the negative effects of drought stress on quantitative yield parameters. Although the yield did not reach the control level (normal water supplies), it was higher than that of drought-stressed plants grown at normal CO2 concentration, and there was also an increase in the thousand-kernel mass and harvest index. The grain protein content rose moderately in response to the opposing effects of high CO2 concentration and drought stress. Although the positive effect of doubled atmospheric CO2 concentration was not significant for all the varieties due to the high standard deviation values, the general tendency was clear (Fig. 2). Differences could be observed between the genotypes, however. Drought stress caused above-average yield losses in Lona, while in Petra and</p><p id="Pg423">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1097 Mv Pehely the yield reduction was more moderate. High CO2 level, however, induced greater increases in biomass and grain yield in Petra and in the wheat varieties, while its effect was negligible in Mv Pehely. Table 1.

Box 19, H-2462, benczesz@mail.mgki.hu 2 Cereal Breeding Department, Agricultural Research Institute of the HAS, Martonvásár, P.O. Box 19, H2462 Abstract: The effect of climatic factors on a wide range of winter and spring cereals was studied in 2005/2006 and 2006/2007 as the beginning of a long-term experiment. Meteorological data were collected and foliar diseases were monitored during the growing periods. The productivity of cereals was compared as influenced by various abiotic and biotic environmental factors. It was found that the extreme weather of the vegetation period 2006/2007 affected cereals in a complex way. Low water supplies from autumn till spring contributed to the weakening of plant defences against viruses and powdery mildew in certain varieties, while warmer temperatures during winter accelerated phenological development of plants and enabled pathogens to appear early, so that the period of infection was prolonged. The diseases, however, also interacted with each other. The unfavourable meteorological conditions and the pathogen attacks resulted in dramatic yield losses. Keywords: drought, virus, powdery mildew, leaf rust, disease resistance, cereals Introduction The most severe problem resulting from the global climate change that affects the living organisms on Earth, including human beings, is the rapid increase in the frequency of climate anomalies. One of the most important effects is a decrease in the annual cereal grain yield production and in the security of the food supply. Extreme hydrological conditions affect the soil and are a serious problem in the Carpathian Basin (Hoffmann and Burucs 2005, Várallyay 2006, 2007). The effects of climate change on a wide range of cereals are being tested under Hungarian conditions in a long-term experiment in the Agricultural Research Institute in Martonvásár. Results on the grain yield and resistance of varieties to foliar diseases are presented here from the first two years. Materials and methods The following species and varieties were sown after pea precrop at optimal sowing dates in the growing periods of 2005/2006 and 2006/2007 in Martonvásár in 2×4 replications of 6 m2 plots: Winter barley: Petra (A), winter wheat: Bezostaja 1 (RUS), Ukrainka (UA), Cubus (D), Apache (F), Libellula (I), Mv Regiment (H), Mv Mambó (H), Mv Béres (H), Mv Emma (H), winter durum wheat: Mv Makaróni (H), winter triticale: Presto (PL), Kitaro (PL), spring wheat: Lona (CH), spring barley: Jubilant (SK), Prudentia (USA), spring oat: Mv Pehely (H), Kwant (PL). Four replications were protected with the fungicide ‘Artea’ in early and late spring (protected, P), while four were exposed to natural infection (nonprotected, NP). The fungicide treatment was very effective in controlling powdery mildew, leaf rust and leaf spot diseases. Foliar diseases were monitored during the whole vegetation period using a 0-9 scale (Stubbs et al. 1986). After harvest the grain yield of each plot was determined. Comparisons between years and treatments were made using two-way ANOVA for each variety.</p><p id="Pg426">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1100 Results and discussion According to the meteorological data collected during both vegetation periods (from October till July) the second year of the experiment was outstandingly dry and warm (precipitation: 179 mm, daily mean temperature: 11.4oC, compared to 378 mm and 8.5oC in the previous year). This resulted in the heading and maturation of cereals being 7-10 days earlier in 2007 than in 2006. Because of the very mild winter, virus vectors (aphids, leafhoppers) survived very well, causing a virus epidemic (BYDV, WDV), the effect of which was not easy to separate from the direct impact of climatic factors, though the visible symptoms suggested it had less importance in the winter genotypes. Besides water stress, spring varieties, however, were visibly heavily affected by virus infection in spring, resulting in dwarf growth, severe mortality of oats and a yield loss of 50-100 % (Table 1). In these genotypes the impact of pathogen fungi was insignificant, because of the very harsh effect of the dry spring period and the heavy virus attack. Table 1.

Only one variety, Petra, proved to be insensitive to fungal diseases in 2007, responding significantly only to climatic variables, while fungal pathogens had a statistically insignificant negative impact on two other varieties (Libellula and Presto). The remaining genotypes produced a dramatically decreased yield due to both biotic and abiotic factors.

The very long dry period lasting until early May 2007 caused a substantial drop in the soil water content resulting in a retarded plant growth. The same severity level of powdery mildew (PM) infection was reached one month earlier than in 2006. Even resistant varieties became slightly more infected by PM than expected (Fig. 1). From 4th May (start of the wet period) the plants suddenly started to grow rapidly, while lower leaves infected by PM withered, especially in varieties with good or moderate resistance (up to 3-4 on the 0-9 scale). A probable change was detected in the race composition of PM between the years, as Mv Regiment and Mv Makaróni, which were totally resistant in the first year, became very susceptible in 2007, while Presto changed to resistant from highly susceptible. Mv Béres and Ukrainka, however, were resistant in both years. From the end of May leaf rust (LR) infection, which appeared three weeks earlier than in 2006, have evolved into a very serious epidemic (Fig. 1). As a result of LR infection some genotypes (e.g. Mv Mambó and Presto) became more susceptible to PM, while in other varieties, leaves with PM lesions withered and leaf rust started to sporulate from the upper leaves (e.g. Mv Emma). Unlike the situation in 2006, where only two varieties were slightly infected with LR and one moderately, only two genotypes remained resistant in 2007, Mv Béres and Petra. Spring varieties were not affected by LR either, but as indicated above, virus infection and water shortage during early growth caused a high level of mortality and dramatic yield losses. Our results suggest that there are</p><p id="Pg428">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1102 interactions between various stress factors. A similar situation was found in wheat seedlings in a combined stress treatment with water stress and Drechslera tritici-repentis (DTR, Németh et al. 2006). Mild osmotic stress retarded the development of fungal infection in the susceptible genotypes, while strong water stress made resistant varieties more susceptible to DTR. A joint effect was also found for abiotic stress factors in wheat; plants were less tolerant to high temperature under low water supplies (Balla et al. 2006). These findings indicate that severe stress conditions weaken the ability of plants to fight other stressors, probably due to the depletion of resources. Conclusions The data suggest that the extreme climatic conditions in 2007, especially the water shortage, contributed to a great extent to the poor biotic resistance of the varieties. Drought in spring weakened plant defences in certain varieties against fungal and viral stressors, while warmer temperatures accelerated phenological development of plants and allowed pathogens to appear early so that the period of infection was prolonged. The diseases, however, also interacted with each other. More investigations will be done on this subject in the following years.

These extreme conditions had a substantial influence on physiological processes and could thus exert a negative effect on plant productivity. The plants responded to reduced water supplies by stomatal closure, resulting in a considerable decline in transpiration and photosynthetic activity. By contrast, heat stress stimulated transpiration, as the stomata were more widely open than in the control plants on the second day of treatment. By the 8 th day, however, these processes again exhibited a decrease. In addition, thanks to the reduced grain filling and unfavourable changes in the carbohydrate metabolism during ripening, the stress factors led to a drastic reduction in yield parameters. Key words: low water supplies, heat stress, photosynthetic activity Introduction One of the most important factors in crop production is water, the lack of which may severely limit the survival, growth and productivity of the plants (Németh et al., 2006). Water deficiency has a complex effect on the physiological processes and adaptability of the plants, which may also be influenced by other factors such as variable light intensity (Csajbók et al., 2007) or extreme temperatures (Balla et al., 2006). Unlike heat stress, drought stress is not immediately perceptible, but develops gradually, depending in part on the presence of other stress factors. The first indication of drought stress is the inhibition of photosynthesis due to a decline in the CO2 concentration of the intercellular spaces as a result of stomatal closure (Chaves et al., 2002; Balogh et al., 2007). High temperature causes disturbances in membrane status, in the conformation of protein components and in photosynthetic processes (Szigeti, 1998). With a rise in the number of very hot days there is a drop in the rate of CO2 assimilation per unit leaf area, which can be attributed to the reduced stomatal conductance and the decreased CO2 diffusion in the intercellular spaces (Wollenweber et al.). Due to the physiological changes induced by heat and drought stress, the relative water content and chlorophyll content of the leaves exhibit a rapid decline, and the plants turn yellow and become ripe for harvest far sooner than the control plants (Jiang et al., 2001). If these stress effects occur during ripening, the ageing processes accelerate and the grain-filling period is shortened, leading to substantial yield losses. The present paper investigates the effects of climatic extremes, reduced water supplies and rising temperatures, alone and in combination, on the photosynthetic and yield parameters. Materials and methods The effect of drought and heat stress was studied during the maturation of cereals grown under controlled conditions in the Martonvásár phytotron. The varieties Bánkúti 1201 (H) and GK Öthalom (H), which had widely different genetic backgrounds, were chosen</p><p id="Pg430">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1104 for the evaluation of drought tolerance. The experiment included four treatments: control (C), drought stress (D), heat stress (H) and combined drought and heat (D+H). Treatment commenced 12 days after heading (Zadoks 75) and continued for 15 days. The temperature in the control chamber was 24/20°C (day/night), while 35/20°C was programmed for 8 h in the heat-stress chamber (Tischner et al., 1997). The soil moisture content was 60–70% of natural water capacity (NWC) in the control and 40–45% in the drought stress treatment. The amount of irrigation water was determined by weighing the pots. Changes in the stomatal conductance, transpiration and net photosynthetic activity of the plants were measured using an LI-6400 Portable Photosynthesis System on the 2nd, 8th and 15th day of stress treatment. The grain yield and biomass per plant, the harvest index and the thousand-kernel mass were determined after the plants reached harvest maturity. Results and discussion In both Bánkúti 1201 and GK Öthalom the most intensive changes in the tested parameters compared with the control were recorded on the 2nd day of stress treatment (Fig. 1). The stomata of plants kept at extreme temperatures were already wider open than those of the control plants on the 2nd day. These plants exhibited more intense transpiration, as they attempted to overcome heat stress by evaporating more water. The high transpiration and stomatal conductance values decreased by the 8th day, and were even lower by the 15th day. While in Bánkúti 1201 the net photosynthesis rate gradually declined from the 2nd day of heat treatment until the 15th day, being below the control value throughout, the net assimilation rate of GK Öthalom was close to the control value. In the drought treatment both varieties responded to water deficiency by closing their stomata compared to the control. This resulted in a steep decline in transpiration and by the 15th day it was close to zero. The plants endeavored to avoid water loss by reducing transpiration, i.e. by closing the stomata. The resulting drop in the intercellular CO2 concentration led to the complete inhibition of photosynthesis by the 8 th day in both varieties, and in the case of GK Öthalom respiration processes had been initiated by this stage. The greatest reduction in the physiological processes compared to the control was observed when the two stress factors were combined. The minimal rate of transpiration and the closed stomata resulted in an almost complete cessation of photosynthesis. Consequently, the decline in the grain yield, biomass, thousand-kernel mass and harvest index was most pronounced for plants exposed to the joint stress (Table 1). Of the three stress treatments, heat stress caused the least damage to these agronomic parameters, while the effect of drought was more drastic than that of high temperature in both varieties.</p><p id="Pg431">VII.

Reduced water quantities, extremely high temperature and the joint application of the two stress factors resulted in similar reductions in the values of these parameters during the 15-day treatment in both varieties examined. The plants attempted to avoid stress-induced changes by means of natural defense mechanisms.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1107 GIS BASED ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT Vesna KOSCAK MIOCIC-STOSIC– Sonja BUTULA – Berislav MARKOVIĆ Department of Landscape Architecture, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zagreb, Svetosimunska 25, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia, vkoscak@agr.hr Abstract: The need for sustainable rural development is widely recognised and acknowledged as the European social goal. Such concept implies certain mechanisms and procedures that will assure implementation of landscape, environment and nature protection demands. This paper presents an approach for reconciliation of conflicting interests between development and protection from the planning perspective. The methodological approach of suitability modelling is presented in a case study of land-use planning process for a typical rural area of continental Croatia, the area of Samobor-Zumberacko Gorje. The suitability models were developed for a type of rural tourism – family estate, frequently listed in agro-environment programmes for similar areas. Suitability maps allowed the identification of both conflicting interests to be located in space. Such models are relevant tool for representation of spatial potentials and possible degradations due to a landscape change as well as society's diversified interests and can be a promising starting point for a process of resolving conflicts and reaching the best possible consensus on future land use in rural areas. Keywords: suitability, rural area, landscape, planning, plant-soil interrelation Introduction Sustainability concept, as the overall paradigm of our time is the basis for economic, social, technological and environmental considerations. The implementation of sustainability into planning outcomes – spatial plans is a complex task. It could be implemented by planning process which takes into account the whole complex system and use models that that offer alternatives of clearly defined aim, i.e. choosing location as Antal and Grasselli (2007) putted. In that respect a simulation models integrate different characteristics that play important role in site selection (Farkas et al, 2005). Recent European agro-environmental and rural policies aim at fostering economic, ecological and societal development of rural areas (Zanker, 2007). Many countries are presently evaluating existing policies and developing new ones on a basis of their observed and potential environmental impacts (Tarnawa, 2006). The landscape character of Croatia is highly rural. The national strategy of rural development envisages a rural tourism as important driving force directed towards the priority goal achievement: increase of competitiveness in rural areas without a negative impact on the environment. The current Rural development model refers to sustainable rural development and sets up measures for stimulation and promotion of rural tourism. Therefore, it is to be expected that new programmes and projects for development of rural tourism will be initiated. Methodological aspect of spatial dimension or allocation issue of such developmental activities is not so clearly set. Materials and methods The study is methodologically set as the part of the evaluation phase of a planning process that yields with a decision on environmentally sound allocation of certain land use. The assessment instrument was a suitability analysis that comprises dual assessment of spatial criteria for development (analysis of a space attractiveness) and environmental protection (vulnerability model), Patri and Ingmire (1972). The area of</p><p id="Pg434">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1108 Samobor – Zumberacko gorje designated in 1999 as protected in the category of Nature Park (fig.1) was used as the pilot zone. This predominantly mountainous area (350 km 2 in total) is located in the vicinity of the city of Zagreb. The forest occupies 60% out of total surface, agricultural land 38.6% and population density is extremely low, 11 inh/km2. Figure 1. Location of the pilot zone The suitability analysis was performed using geoinformation (GIS) software package ProVal® whereas homogeneous spatial unit for analyses was 30m x 30m. The data base consisted of spatial data on land cover and land use. A suitability of the area for rural development was tested through the interest for the rural tourism, a family estate in particular. Conceptually, attractiveness model was defined as an area having following qualities: healthy climate, noise free, high traditional agricultural potentials, unpolluted watercourses and outdoor recreation potentials. The concept of vulnerability assessment introduced by Fabos et.al. (1979), Marušič (1996) and Steinitz (1990) comprised the value system of three different conservational requests: (1) protection of unpolluted human habitat, (2) protection of natural resources and (3) protection of the naturalness and/or authenticity of the space. Finally, a suitability of the area was defined as an allocation potential to accommodate the type of rural tourism in the way that the two opposing interest for the space might be reconciled, by searching the highest degree of attractiveness and lowest degree of vulnerability. The suitability modelling also provides different weighting possibility when assessing the spatial potentials for development and their impacts. Suitability values here attached included three different attitudes: protectionist point of view, developmental one and the compromise or reconciliation between the two. Results and discussion The results of suitability analysis (fig. 2) are indicating that spatial distribution of the suitable landscape for the rural tourism differs between obtained models. Such differential spatial distribution of suitable locations is of the major importance because of several reasons. First, the suitability outcomes might serve as the departure point for further dialog between different stakeholders. Second, this suitability results might be generally perceived as a decision support model. In that case, as Antal and Grasselli (2007) stated, their function is to offer alternative solution or options. Searching for alternative solutions is the premise of sound problem-solving process, especially when implementing the principle of sustainable development in land use decisions (O’Riordan 1995, Davies 2001, Boersema 2001, Butula 2003).</p><p id="Pg435">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1109 Figure 2. Spatial representation of suitability for rural tourism: green - prioritising protection, red – prioritising development, blue – compromise between the two: darker areas are more suitable The results also show that the subject of conservation efforts is a specific quality of physical landscape component, not the physical component itself. The suitability model where potential landscape change is simulated does offer explicit and optimising evaluative procedure as opposed to decisions made without it. The example of such approach is the statutory allocation of tourism facility for the section of pilot zone, fig.3. That spatial allocation is based solely on developmental interest while the question - is that the optimum location for tourism facility in wider area, from conservational point of view remains silent. Figure 3. Comparison of evaluation model (left) and decision model (right) for section of pilot area Conclusions The suggested methodological approach directly tackles a conservation issue in the rural development policy decision making process. If objectives of EU agro-environmental schemes considered, the question still open is how to manage the protection system effectively. The possible answer might be found in the European Landscape Convention (Council of Europe, 2000). The Convention sets up the framework of three policies that ought to be equally implemented when rural landscape concerned: direct protection/conservation employing the apparatus of different conservational regimes being for example nature protected areas, landscape planning and landscape management. The nature of environmental problems differ, so thus the objectives and evaluation criteria of conservation efforts Therefore, the proposal is to expand conservational problem solving from solely standard-based (direct conservation) into optimisationLEGEND Tourism land use – family estate T4 T4</p><p id="Pg436">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1110 based (landscape planning). Such a need is, as Lyle (1985) stated based on the fact that the general social conservation aim is complex, many sided and ambiguous task and should be approached accordingly. Employing suitability modelling a potential landscape change is simulated. The model is the indispensable tool that precedes decision about optimal location of a land use in question. The advantages of using such instrument are seen as a contribution to improved communication and cooperation between lay people (space users) and experts. The latter is the concept of participative planning, widely acknowledged as important among planning professional circles, Arnstein (1969). Moreover, from EU legislative point of view, the role public participation in environmental decision-making is statutory recognised as important and regulated by Aarhus Convention (Decision 2005/370/EC) and Directive on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment (Council Directive 2001/42/EC).

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1111 LOW COST MECHANISATION FOR EFFICIENT LAND USE IN SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZE ARABLE FARMS László MAGÓ Hungarian Institute of Agricultural Engineering, Hungary - 2100 Gödöllő, Tessedik S. u. 4., Tel:+ 36 28 511 689, E-mail: laszlomago@fvmmi.hu Abstract: The participants of the Central- and Eastern European agriculture are faced by a great challenge in this years as they are to enter into competition with the producers of the European Community with their modern, substantially subsidized agriculture with significant capital adequacy in order to survive. The improvement of the production efficiency of the agricultural branch is, therefore, inevitable. Efficient mechanization is one of the means towards this aim. The aim of the present research is to promote the cognition of the machine provision of small and medium size farms and their intention for improving mechanization and for investment on machines. Keywords: mechanisation of small and medium sized farms, machine investment and usage cost, optimal machine fleet, machine utilisation, efficient land use. Introduction The diversified property structure characteristic at present is not always coupled with efficient power and working machine system (Hajdú - Gockler 2005; Sadowski – Takács-György 2005). In case of small size farming units the up-to-date, means and cost sparing solutions are rarely to be found and even the medium size farms do not necessarily own the efficient machine systems with all the technical-technological advantages of the present era furthering improvingly effective farming and land use (Baranyai – Takács, 2007; Fenyvesi et al. 2003; Késmárki-Gally – Szűcs 2007). Considering the prevailing diversified property structure the level of mechanization of the small and medium size farms acting in the different branches of crop production (arable farming, field vegetable growing, plantation) is to be estimated by means of questionnaires and personal interviews together with the characteristics of their machinery considering composition, function, modernity, working condition, utilization and value (Magó 2007; Takács-György 2007). By the survey of small size farming units special emphasis is laid on the following points: - whether they have machinery of their own for carrying out the work operations of the production technology, - which are the operations characteristically necessitating lease-work, - and in case of over-mechanization which operations show a capacity surplus, i.e. a possibility for offering lease-work (Husti 2004; Takács 2003). The method The first stage of the research work was gathering information on the form of farming (private entrepreneur, farmer, family enterprise, company, or farmer’s co-operative), on the range of activity (arable farming, horticulture, fruit or vine growing, animal breeding), on the size of the cultivated area, on the production structure, on the buildings and storing sheds located in the farm, on the fleet of machinery and appliances, on the future intentions for improving the machine fleet as well as on the idle and narrow machine capacities by means of questionnaires.</p><p id="Pg438">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1112 The survey was done in years 2006 and 2007 in eight counties among the small and medium sized farmers dealing with field crop and vegetable growing and plantations. These farmers had a significant investment in machines in last three years. 83 questionnaires were sent to farmers who live and work in Bács-Kiskun, Baranya, Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén, Csongrád, Heves, Jász-Nagykun, Pest and Tolna counties. Finally 39 valuable questionnaires were sent back to us. Following the elaboration of the questionnaires personal visits have been paid to several (about 20) farms covering a wide scale of different sizes and specific interviews made in order to obtain some personal knowledge of the level of the machine fleet applied to the given production structure, the possible ways of improving the machine fleet and the practice of machine use. On the basis of the information gathered this way I am trying to introduce and systematize the prevailing practice of machine use. Besides improving effectivity and reducing the costs of machine use my aim is to develop a realistic machine use determined by the applied technology. Results It is characteristic of the past period that the possibility of planned machine fleet improvement was very limited due to the income circumstances of the farmers. In many cases they could not afford anything but the expansion of machine capacity bottleneck or the replacement of the most outworn machine. The gradual expansion of the rate of agricultural machine investment subsidisation offers the farmers an increasing possibility for the planned deliberate improvement of their machine system. A machine system optimally sized in view of cost or other parameter vitally important in respect of machine utilization is not or hardly to be found by the agricultural enterprises developed in the nineties. It can be explained by the imperative and ad hoc mechanization taking place in the nineties when the machines of the parting farmers’ co-operatives were available at a very advantageous price. Accordingly, Belarus the former universal tractor of large scale farms and RÁBA 250 the high performance soil working machine have become the most frequently used tractor types of the certain farms. Broken into pieces the machine system of the former large scale enterprise was no longer adequate for the system approach mechanization of the numerous small and medium size agricultural enterprises. The power machine type RÁBA 250 has proved to be too big in relation to the capacity demand of the small and medium size farms. Mechanization can be realized in a cost sparing way if the gradually deteriorating Belarus power machines are replaced by power machines of appropriate technical standard and of a performance level determined by the size of enterprise a wide selection of which representing all performance categories are offered on the market by several international producers. A more favourable tendency can be observed in the mechanization of the surveyed plantation farms. In many cases modern plantation tractors adequate for the task are available which power machines have many technical advantages in relation to the classical T-25 or Belarus-50 tractors used for fruit cultivation earlier. They are developed according to the demands of ergonomics and labour safety. Regarding enterprise size categories it can be stated that in case of field crop growing one power machine is adequate for fulfilling the necessary tasks up to an area size of</p><p id="Pg439">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1113 about 30 ha. Within this category the tasks on a 10-15 ha farm can be satisfactorily fulfilled by a lower performance (40 kW) tractor, though this performance category is not optimal for the harder soil works, while those cultivating nearby 30 ha need a more powerful (60 kW) power machine. The farms working on 40-50 ha generally have two power machines. These are most frequently the variations of the popular Belarus type tractors with a performance of about 60 kW. Regarding the upper limit (300 ha) of medium size enterprises the power machine provision of the farms can be characterized by a higher capacity tractor with a performance of about 130-160 kW depending on soil structure and the nature of work. This is supplemented by an 80 kW and a 60 kW power machine. In this size category an own harvesting machine is also frequently available. By the enterprises operating on a farm size of 500 ha or more several different performance categories can be found. The chief machine with a performance of about 160 kW is also characteristic and it may be supplemented by a 80 or 100 kW tractor and the machine fleet also includes a further 2-3 generally Belarus type tractors depending on technical level. The more efficient fulfilment of transportation tasks is ensured by a lorry. In case of a nearby 1000 ha enterprise the performance categories are clearly differentiated. In order to ensure the workmanlike fulfilment of the different operations and the optimal division of labour on this size category 160, 130, 90, and 60 kW tractors are also available. The number of harvesting machines is also two at least depending on the capacity.

Cereal Research Communications 1114 By all the plantation farms surveyed the size of which was between 10-20 ha the machine fleet was based on one power machine. There were differences in the type and the structural set-up of the power machine determined by the financial possibilities and the relief- and cultivation conditions. Their performance varied between 20-60 kW. Conclusions It is clear also on the basis of the surveyed farms that the mechanization solutions of agriculture are in a transition period. The old dated solutions will gradually be replaced by new ones. The agricultural entrepreneurs are trying to favour the system approach low cost investments by their improvements. It must be kept in mind that economic optima and efficient land use can only be established or reached in case of a conscious improvement of mechanization. The theoretically grounded results, consequences and the analysis of the present state emphasize the future tasks at the same time. The professional and financial conditions enabling the entrepreneurs to make their improvements more conscious must be made available for them.

The second one, what we are here considering, was to find out the correlation between evapotranspiration of alfalfa measured in lysimeters from one side, and the potential evapotranspiration calculated by different methods (Thornthwaite, Turc, Penman) and measured evaporation by different methods (Class A, Ceracky, Piche, Wild) from other side. Keywords: soil moisture measurement, soil drought monitoring, plant-available soil water, evapotranspiration of alfalfa. Introduction The first step in choosing the method for soil moisture monitoring is a question why we need this information? Usually we need this information in irrigation practice in searching the answer when and how much water to apply? The answer to that question is possible to find out by soil moisture measurement. There are a lot of methods for soil moisture measurement like: gravimetric, tensiometric, gypsum-porous blocks, electrical resistance method, neutron probes and others. All of these methods need the trained people to apply and are not acceptable by small farmers. Some of them are very expensive and need laboratory measurements on the terrain. Besides, the results of measurements by these methods are not precisely exact. They are just approximation. We are totally agree with cited working paper initial propositions that …»available equipment or technique is not adequate for on-farm measurement of plant-available soil water». This result are based on four years research which lasted in the south Mediterranean area of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Materials and methods As we are always in the sphere of approximation we have to offer the more simple and not expensive method that the farmer could to apply. The method what we suggest is a method of determination of the rhythm of water depletion from the soil by evapotranspiration. It could be calculated by one of very known methods of potential evapotranspiration like Thornthwaite, Turc and Penman or by method of evaporation measurement such as: class A, Ceracky, Piche and Wild. The method of calculation of potential evapotranspiration is very complicated for small farmer and needs a lot of meteorological data’s for calculation. On the contrary, the measurement of evaporation is very simple, acceptable by farmer and is including the meteorological conditions (solar radiation, relative humidity, air temperature and wind). In our conditions the method of evaporation measurement by Class A pan has given the best results. But it may be changed by some smaller transparent pan graduated with the scale in mm. The scheme of registration of daily evapotranspiration (ET), rainfall and irrigation to be done is shown in Table 1.</p><p id="Pg442">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

He has to know that one millimeter corresponds to one liter per square meter or (1 mm = l liter/msqu = 10 m3/ha). He has to have just evaporation pan and raingauge. Even raingauge is not necessary if local meteorological service has established loco information service about rainfalls. Our proposal is based on the research YU-AM project No Yo-ARS-25-IB-38 which lasted four years in the south Mediterranean area of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Results and discussion The results are shown on the Tables 2. and 3., and on the figure 1. In Table 2., are shown the comparisons of average monthly results from four years research (in mm) of alfalfa Evapotranspiration, Potential evapotranspiration calculated by Thornthwaite, Turc and Penman and Evaporation measured by Class A , Ceracky, Piche and Wild. Evapotranspiration of alfalfa on the annual level is about 13 % (Penman) to 22% (Thornthwaite) higher than the calculated potential evapotranspiration. It means that results of calculated PET must be multiplied by factor 1, 13 to 1, 22 for to get the real evapotranspiration of alfalfa. Concerning the measured evaporation, the results are practically inverse. Evapotranspiration of alfalfa is about 21% (Ceracky), 25% (Class A) to 40% (Piche) lesser than measured evaporation except the evaporimeter by Wild which is 7% higher. The results of measured evaporation for to get real evapotranspiration must be multiplied by factors: Class A -0,75, Ceracky - 0,79, Piche – 0,60, and Wild - 1,07. Correlation analysis (Table 3.) was made between alfalfa evapotranspiration (Y) from one side, and all methods of calculation of potential evapotranspiration and methods of measured evaporation from the other side (X). The highest coefficient of correlation (r = 0,848)) was found out between alfalfa evapotranspiration from one side, and the measured evaporation by Class A from the other side. The other are: Ceracky: r = 0,689, Piche: r = 0,691 and Wild: r = 0,742. It means that highest confidence is going to Class A. That is the reason why we suggest this method to apply for soil moisture monitoring. Concerning the correlations related to calculated potential</p><p id="Pg443">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1117 evapotranspiration the highest coefficient was found out by method Thornthwaite (r = 0,825). The other are: Turc : r = 0,813 and Penman: r = 0,798. The diagram of this correlation analysis is shown in Figure 1. The simple equation for practical use for the farmers could be recommended as: E of Class A x 0,75 or ET Alfalfa = 0,75 Class A. Table 2.

Their competition with maize was examined in small plots in 2007. Cocklebur emerged before maize and caused 61-79% yield losses at weed density ranging from 5 to 10 plants m -2 . Jimsonweed emerged with maize and caused 26-53% yield losses at weed density ranging from 2 to 10 plants m -2 . Ragweed did not decrease yield of maize because of its late emerging. Keywords: cocklebur, ragweed, jimsonweed, maize, competition Introduction There were significant changing in dominance conditions both in arable land and plantations in Hungary: occurrence of some weed species was multiplied in the past tens of years, while other species were repressed. These spreading weeds are very competitive and often can decrease yield of crops more than those were dominant twenty or thirty years ago (Szőke 2001, Németh and Dorner 2004, Solymosi 2005, Buzsáki and Béres 2007). However, there is an increasing demand to protect crops using less herbicide and minimize environmental pollution and costs of protection. Ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia), jimsonweed (Datura stramonium), cocklebur species (Xanthium strumarium, X. italicum) are three of the most prominent and troublesome weeds of maize in Hungary (Szőke 2001, Solymosi 2005) and determine weed killing processes. There are a lot of results about competitiveness of these weeds from several parts of the World, but there are not enough data in Hungary on which weed control processes can be based. Beckett et al. (1988) investigated competition of maize with several weed species. Cockleburs were studied in densities ranging 0.4-6.6 plant m-2. As result of their investigations it was found that increases in common cocklebur density caused corn yields to decrease curvilinearly in some years, and yields decreased linearly as cocklebur density increased in other years. They observed 10-27% maximum yield losses at density of 6.6 plants m-2 in several years. Intraspecific interference among cocklebur plants increased and the individual effect of each additional weed on yield diminished at higher weed densities. Bloomberg et al. (1982) studied competition of cocklebur with soybean, and observed that the full season competition of cocklebur at density of 1 plant 3m-1 of row can reduce yield of soybean. Soybean seed yield increased at a declining rate as the length of time from soybean emergence to cocklebur emergence increased. Weber and Staniforth (1957), Cartter and Hartwig (1963) found that common cocklebur plant often form a canopy over the soybean crop while soybean plants are flowering and the resulting shade may increase pod abortion and reduce seed yield. Barrentine (1974) reported a soybean seed yield reduction of 52% from season-long competition with 26000 cocklebur plants ha-1, but removal of weeds within 4 weeks</p><p id="Pg446">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1120 after soybean emergence prevented seed yield reductions. Gossett (1971) observed 50% yield reduction as result of competition of 14 cocklebur plant 3.1m-1 of soybean row. McWorther and Hartwig (1972) found yield losses ranging from 63 to 75% for six soybean varieties from season-long competition with 7400-16500 cocklebur plants ha-1. Tranel et al. (2003) call attention to differences of effects of several cocklebur populations. They examined the effect of seven populations from several parts of USA on soybean on the same habitat, which caused yield losses of soybean ranging from 25 to 42%. Varga et al. (2006), Dávid and Kovács (2007) studied competition of sunflower with ragweed on several areas of Hungary and significant yield losses were found at weed densities of 2, 5, 10 plant m-2. Materials and methods Field experiments were conducted to study the effects of varying densities of three noxious weeds (Xanthium italicum, Ambrosia artemisiifolia and Datura stramonium) on growth and yield of maize in Debrecen (Eastern Hungary) in 2007. Treatments are listed in Table 1. Weed free control plots were maintained free of weeds all season. Weed seedlings were thinned within 2 weeks after emergence to give densities 1, 2, 5, 10 plant m-2 in treatment 5, 6, 7, 8. Table 1.

Cocklebur emerged from 13th April to the beginning of May, jimsonweed at the same time as maize, but ragweed in large numbers after 10th of May.

Yield of maize did not differ significantly from control in one time hoed plots and at density of 1 and 2 of the weed. Yield reduction was 84% in weedy control and 61, 79% at density of 5 and 10 plants m-2, respectively. Height and yield of maize competing with ragweed Height of maize was reduced by 21% in weedy control and by 6% by the highest level of ragweed competition.

Conclusions Cocklebur, jimsonweed and Ragweed are noxious, spreading weed species in row crops with excellent competitiveness. Their competitiveness was studied in maize in this experiment. Cocklebur seedlings emerge from as deep as 15 to 20 cm in the soil so dryness of soil near the surface did not influence emerging of them. Cocklebur emerged 10-14 days before maize and competition started early. Maize seed yield was decreased at a</p><p id="Pg448">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1122 constant rate with increasing weeds density ranging from 1 to 5 plant m-2, but it was decreased at a declining rate at cocklebur densities ranging from 5 to 10 plant m-2. Jimsonweed emerged with maize. Yield of maize decreased at a declining rate with increasing jimsonweed density at the examined range of density. Ragweed could not emerge because of dryness of soil until first significant precipitation so emerging 15 days or more after maize emergence was not highly competitive.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1123 CHANGES OF VEGETATION ON THE STONY SHORE OF LAKE BALATON UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FLUCTUATING WATER LEVEL Éva VARGA 1 – Anita CZUDAR1.– Viktor OLÁH2.– István GYULAI1 1 Department of Applied Ecology, Biological and Ecological Institute, Faculty of Natural Sciences and Technology, University of Debrecen, Hungary, Debrecen, Egyetem tér 1., H-4010 e-mail: vavica@gmail.com 2 Department of Botany, Biological and Ecological Institute, Faculty of Natural Sciences and Technology, University of Debrecen, Hungary, Debrecen, Egyetem tér 1., H-4010 Abstract: The limnological characters of Lake Balaton is largely determined and affected by the structures of her littoral regions. From 2000 to 2006 significant water level changes characterized the lake which had an effect on Lake’s life. We investigated the terrestrial plant on the stony shore. Changing of water level influenced the species number and the amount of the appearing plants. Keywords: Lake Balaton, stony shore, water level fluctuation Introduction Lake Balaton is the largest shallow lake in Central Europe. Its length is 77.9 km, average width is 7.2 km, surface area is 593 km3, mean depth is 3.14 m, and catchment area is 5182 km2 (Padisák et al., 2006). The dominant ions in the water are Ca, Mg, and HCO3; the average pH is 8.3. Natural stony shores can be found on the Zala County side of Lake Balaton as well as on the edge of the Tihany Peninsula. Regarding the living conditions of the sites and their stocking stone heaps and stone buildings which were bulked for the protection of the shore, moles and various structures can be considered as identical with stony shores and treated as natural substrata (Sebestyén, 1963). At present, 10% of the shoreline is shielded by stony shores that were originally created as a temporary solution for the previous problems, and an additional 40% comprises some other types of stone works on the shores of the lake. If we add to the shore parts that are naturally covered by stone, we will see that about 70% of the shoreline contains stony parts, even in Somogy County, where plain, sandy parts generally dominate (Lakatos et al. 2001). Before 2003, some dry years led to a negative water balance of Lake Balaton that resulted in a significant decrease of the water level. In 2004-2005, as a consequence of continuously increased water level, formerly exposed surfaces of stones were flooded again. Almost 50% of the shoreline consists of loose stones, most of which are covered by approximately 105cm of water. Since 2001, lower levels of rainfall have caused the water levels, mostly on the southern shoreline, to drop significantly. No less than three quarters of the stony shore is now exposed and above the water line. Since 2003, several botanical surveys have been carried out in ten different sampling areas near the waters edge. Included in the diverse vegetation observed are native Hungarian monocotyledous and dicotyledous weeds, which are situated sporadically along the shoreline. The results of these studies do not include details on higher plants, as a total of nearly 200 plants would have to be listed (Virág, 1997).</p><p id="Pg450">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1124 The aim of this paper is to describe the more important changes in vegetation on the stony shore from 2003 to 2006 and to compare last years water level fluctuation in case of Lake Balaton. Materials and methods Limnological investigations on the stony shores of the littoral zone were started by our research team in 1994, when mainly methodological problems concerning sampling techniques and sample analyses were in the focus. According to the preliminary results, ten sampling sites were selected in four basins of Lake Balaton which can be characterized by different water qualities. Sampling sites were marked out in Keszthely Basin (K), in Szigliget Bay (Sz), at the Balaton Limonological Research Institute of the HAS in the middle basin (M), and in Fűzfő Bay (F). The first survey on the dry sections of the stony shore took place in the autumn of 2003 and was repeated annually until 2006. The coordinates of the sampling areas were recorded using GPS. These data are not used in any statistics but are included so as to see general trends in the stony shore of vegetation over a long period. Results and discussion Between the year 2000 and 2003, there was less precipitation in the watershed of Lake Balaton than the overall average level between 2000 and 2006. Though the following years showed higher water levels, they were extremely low in 2003. As a result of this, a significant portion of the shoreline was exposed and became dry, hereby functioning as a habitat for terrestrial plant-life in the expanded littoral zone and at the same time reducing the surface area of the lake upon which epilithon could flourish. Gradual refilling of the lake began in the winter of 2003/2004, and continued into 2005. The water level fluctuations differed substantially between years. The water level at sampling occasions was lowest in 2003 and highest in 2006 (Fig. 1.). Lake Balaton received 7% more precipitation in 2004 and 12% more in 2005 than the average for the previous years. The excess water supply of the lake regenerated as a result of the rainy weather of September 2005. To divert this surplus away from it, the floodgates at Siófok were re-opened on the 1st of September after a 5-year closure. The water was higher than the 110cm maximum level for 178 days from 1st September 2005 to 22nd July 2006, when the sluices at Siófok were fully closed (Kravinszkaja et al. 2005). 0 20 40 60 80 1 00 1 20 1 40 199 9 jan 1999 jul 200 0 jan 2 000 jul 200 1 jan 2 001 jul 2002 jan 2 002 jul 2003 jan 2 003 jul 2004 jan 20 04 ju l 2005 jan 20 05 ju l 2006 jan 20 06 ju l w a te r le v e l (c m ) Figure 1.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1125 As our investigation shows, fluctuating water-levels have a significant effect on the numbers of plant taxons appearing on the stony shore. The water-level decreased a great amount in the summer of 2003 (Fig.1.), resulting in the exposure and drying up of two thirds of the shoreline. Changes in the microclimate and transpiration of reedbeds on the shores of Lake Balaton, some still standing in water and some from which the water has receded. The daily mean air temperature was lower in the dry stand, and exhibited considerable daily fluctuations. The plot of daily changes in transpiration exhibited two peaks for the dry stand and one for the wet stand (Anda, A. et al., 2006). „Guest” plants appeared on the ripraps of these shore sections. We found the greatest amount of plant taxa during the examinations of 2004. As a result of the greater precipitation levels between 2005-2006 the water-level increased, so that the section of the shore proper upon which plants could thrive decreased in size. The stony shore was characterized low density. As regards lithological substrate quaternary sediments and loams, which give rise to soils prone to erosion and to others negative process, and low plant cover density (Hernandez-Fernandez, et al., 2007). The persistent low water level during summer in 2003 may be a reason for the increased number of species that year. Table 1. shows the numbers of plant taxa and identified species found during the autumn field trips in 2003-2006. We found 84 plant taxa at the time of field-works in 2003, 80 species had been identified and four specimens were identified to genus level. 91 plant taxa occured in 2004, from this 82 species had been identified. The plants were surveyed on the stony shore in 2005 also. We found 88 plant taxa and 79 species were identified. 47 species were present from the 54 plant taxa in the autumn of 2006. On the basis of the classification of the (Nature) Conservation Value Category by Simon (1988) Table 2. shows the species occurring in the area. Weed species occurred in the greatest numbers, figures that (Virág, 1977) recorded previously. Table 1.

The most species were found on the ripraps located near the water on the beach in Zamárdi (Z) and the fewest species were in the Fűzfői bay. During the course of samplings only twenty-two plant taxons were common to each period of sampling. Two species (Bidens tripartita L., Lycopus europaeus L.) were present at each sampling area. The vegetation of the littoral zone on the land and the planted trees have an effect on the plant species present and the human impact is significant too, which is reflected in the appearance and presence of certain cultivated species. The presence of agricultural plant-life can be explained by the ripraps providing ideal areas for anglers to fish in. Maize, water-melon and sunflowers can be found at the sampling areas examined. We state that the value of the bio-diversity increased but the natural state decreased with the appearance of weeds and agricultural plants. Most of the plants can be classified as weed species, but it is worth noting the presence of wolfstrapp (Lycopus europaeus L.) and also of yellow iris (Iris pseudacorus L.), corresponding to the data recorded by (Tóth, 1960) more than 40 years ago.

Abstract: Constructed wetlands have been used for wastewater treatment for several years, since their natural processes effectively contribute to the removal of pollutants. During our survey, we examined an artificial wetland, which was constructed for the treatment of petrochemical wastewater. The treatment system has been studied by the Department of Applied Ecology of the University of Debrecen for more than thirty years. Besides examining of the effectiveness of pollutant removal in the system, the aim of our work was to reveal the role of vegetation in the functioning of the wetland-system. According to our results, concentration values of various nitrogen-forms (i.e. nitrite, nitrate and ammonium) suggest some kind of inhibition in the process of nitrification. Removal rates of BOD and COD were 40 and 51 respectively, which are considered to be satisfactory as well as the removal of phosphorous, since 21 per cent of total phosphorous was retained in the wetland. Keywords: constructed wetland, wastewater treatment, wetland vegetation Introduction Recently, construction of artificial wetlands for wastewater treatment has become an increasingly common treatment alternative all over the world. Compared with conventional treatment systems, wetlands have the following advantages: they can be established in the same place where the wastewater is produced; can be maintained by relatively untrained personnel; have relatively low energy requirements; and are low cost systems. In the wetlands, nutrient removal from wastewater occurs due to different mechanisms: (1) plant uptake; (2) microorganisms residing on the plant roots which transform nutrients (mainly N) into inorganic compounds (NH4 + and NO3 -) which are directly available to plants; and (3) physical processes, such as sedimentation and filtration (Ciria et al., 2005). At any given time, the water quality, hydraulics, water temperature, soil chemistry, available oxygen, microbial communities, macroinvertebrates, and vegetation greatly affect the treatment capabilities of the wetland. Inside the wetland, each of these components plays a functional role and the treatment outcome depends upon how the various components interact. Vegetation plays a uniquely important role in water treatment due to the large number of functions it supports (Lakatos et al., 1997. and Thullen et al., 2005). The aim of our work was to reveal the role of vegetation in the functioning of an artificial wetland, which was constructed for the treatment of petrochemical wastewater, in the north-eastern part of Hungary.</p><p id="Pg454">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1128 Materials and methods Area of the observed wetland is 15500m2, the water depth is approximately 1m and the water discharge is 200-250m3 day-1. After mechanical treatment, the wastewater flows into a pre-deposition pond, then it flows through the aeration and deposition basins and arrives to the oxidation pond, the vegetation of which is dominated by reed (Phragmites australis) and cattail (Typha latifolia, T. angustifolia). Approximately 80% of the oxidation pond is covered by submerged macrophytes (Potamogeton pectinatus and Chara sp.). The last part of the system is the post-treating pond, which is recently not in operation (Lakatos et al., 1997). For this survey, samples were taken three times (in spring, summer and autumn) in 2005. On each part of the system, samples were collected from the sediment, from the vegetation, and from the water as well. Measurements of water depth, transparency, pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen content, oxygen saturation, conductivity and electrode potential as well as listing of vegetation taxa were carried out on the sampling sites. Chemical analysis of samples (i.e. the assessment of nitrite, nitrate, ammonia, CODsMn, CODsCr, BOD5, ortho-phosphate, sulphate, sulphide, chloride and floating matters in water and measurement of element-content in macrophytes) was carried out in a laboratory. Treatment efficiency was calculated as the per cent removal (R) for each parameter and was calculated by R=(1-Ce/Ci)100 where Ci and Ce are the influent and effluent concentrations in mg l -1. Results and discussion As it can be seen in table 1., concentration values of various nitrogen-forms (i.e. nitrite, nitrate and ammonium) suggest some kind of inhibition in the process of nitrification. Typically, after a summer ‘depression’, nitrate concentrations showed a slight increase in autumn as it has been previously written by Sebíň et al., (2007) for surface and drainage water bodies. As nitrogen is one of the main components influencing ecosystems, proven effects of perturbation in nitrogen cycle have resulted in numerous monitoring programmes. Nitrogen cycle perturbations have compromised acidified ecosystems, degraded and eutrofied lakes and coastal estuaries (Holko et al., 2006). Unfortunately, the cause of the inhibition in nitrification in our sampling area has not been revealed yet. In our opinion, nitrogen removal would be more effective if the posttreating pond were putting into operation, since in this pond, surface of reeds provides spaces for denitrifying bacteria and the anaerobic conditions are also appropriate for denitrification. Decreased COD and BOD in the outlet points to a large organic matter mineralization within the wetland. Removal rates of BOD and COD were 40 and 51 respectively, which are considered to be satisfactory, however scientific literature usually mentions higher percentages (Gómez Cerezo et al., 2001 and Hadad et al. 2006). Biological</p><p id="Pg455">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1129 oxygen demand (BOD) removal in wetland is due to physical and biological processes that involve sedimentation and microbial degradation, principally by aerobic bacteria attached to plant roots. Macrophytes, by providing a suitable habitat for many decomposing microorganisms in the rhizosphere, play an indirect but important role in reducing organic matter from various types of wastewater (Ciria et al., 2005).

Phosphorous removal varied seasonally. The most efficient reductions occurred in</p><p id="Pg456">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1130 summer and the least efficient phosphorous removal occurred in the early spring. The removal variations observed might be explained by the fact that phosphorous could be presented in various forms (ortophosphates, acid-hydrolysable phosphates, organic soluble phosphates and particulate phosphorous), that are not removed or assimilated in the same way by plants and bacteria (Vaillant et al., 2003). Conclusions Constructed wetlands have been used for wastewater treatment for several years, since their natural processes effectively contribute to the removal of pollutants. During our survey, we examined an artificial wetland, which was constructed for the treatment of petrochemical wastewater. The treatment system has been studied by the Department of Applied Ecology of the University of Debrecen for more than thirty years. In accordance with the results of the previous decades, the constructed wetland functions properly, and its water quality is comparable to that of the natural water bodies. Together with the emergent flora and the periphyton developing on submereged surfaces, vegetation has an important biofilter role (Lakatos, 1998). According to our results, functioning of the examined wetland is satisfactory, however further researches are needed to maintain this favourable status.

The first sampling site in Stream Baláta is an area, which was not influenced by mining activities. The second sampling site was marked out on a recultivated area, while the third site had been formerly recultivated but later it went through intensive erosion. The aim of our examinations was to determine the impacts of the deposited mine tailing pile and to prove the effects of recultivation on living communities of Stream Baláta. Our researches consisted of fieldwork and laboratory analyses. Besides retaining samples of biotechton from the subaquatic stems of vegetation, analysis of zootechton community was carried out as well. Additionally, we determine the concentrations of certain elements in periphyton samples. Keywords: stream, macroinvertebrates, water chemical characters, mine tailing pile Introduction The environmental problems caused by the increasing of pollutant loads discharged into natural water bodies require a complex amount of information for setting out frameworks of regulation and control (Velísková, 2006).The discharge of heavy metal wastes into receiving waters may result in numerous physical, chemical, and biological responses. Depending on environmental conditions, there may be a change in density, diversity, community structure, and species composition of population (Moore &amp; Ramamoorthy, 1984). The precise nature of the environmental problems caused by mining vary, depending largely on the material mined, processing techniques used, local geography and geology, and time scales involved. However it is generally accepted that mining negatively affects the local biota, changing the natural community structure and reducing biodiversity (Batty, 2005). The characterization of heavy metal polluted abandoned mining sites is a complicated assignment due to the variable spatial distribution of the pollutants, therefore complex integrated method is required in order to assess precisely the amount and the distribution of the contaminants (Nagy et al., 2006). The aim of our examinations was to determine the impacts of the deposited mine tailing pile and to prove the effects of recultivation on living communities of Stream Baláta. Materials and methods Stream Baláta, which is a mountain stream, is situated in Baláta Valley, on the northeastern part of Mátra. Our examinations were carried out in summer of 2007, when we marked out three sampling sites in Stream Baláta and two sampling sites in Stream Kata-réti as a control area. The first sampling site in Stream Baláta is an area, which was not influenced by mining activities. The second sampling site was marked out on a recultivated area, while the third site had been formerly recultivated but later it went through intensive erosion.</p><p id="Pg458">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1132 Water depth, transparency, water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen and oxygen saturation were measured in the field. The list of the occurring macrophyte species was also noted. In the laboratory suspended solids, nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus forms), concentration of chlorophyll-a, and CODsMn were measured and calculated (Lakatos et al., 1999). Periphyton samples were taken emergent macrophytes and occasionally from stones (pebbles-gravels). Additionally, we determine the concentrations of certain elements in periphyton samples with ICP-AES. The samples of macrozootecton were directly fixed in 4% formaline. Results and discussion The water depth of Stream Baláta was 10-15 cm, while the other examined stream’s depth was 40-50 cm. Secchi depth was maximal in both streams. The value of pH in both sterams are nearly neutral, but in case of Stream Baláta pH reducing can observe towards the last sampling site. Study of nitrogen forms showed that the highest concentration value was determined in the first sampling site of Stream Baláta. For certain, these results could be explained because of an intensive agricultural land near the stream. On the contrary, the concentration of chloride and sulphate were increasing towards the last sampling site (Tab. 1). Table 1.

Further analysis of zootectonic samples revealed that the taxa of Mollusca, Trichoptera and Ephemeroptera were missing in all sampling sites of stream Baláta, while taxa of Amphipoda and Isopoda could live only the first sampling site (Tab 2).

According to the analysis, it is determinable that in the periphyton samples from the third sampling sites the cooper, lead and chromium are significantly increasing. The concentration of cooper is apparently the highest out of these elements, it reaches the 14 g/ kg value in the collected samples from common reed (Phragmites australis L.) (Fig. 1). In plants the concentrations of heavy metals are similar in case of the periphyton samples, however, in this case the concentrations of lead and chromium are not so exaggeratedly high as in the first sampling site. The concentration of cooper in the plants samples from the third sampling site is also the highest (Fig. 2). Figure 1.</p><p id="Pg460">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1135 THE USE OF FIELD GROWN PLANT MATERIAL IN SOMATIC TISSUE CULTURES OF SPRING WHEAT GENOTYPES Tamás MONOSTORI1 – Éva ROZIK – Tünde GULYÁS BÚS – Lajos TANÁCS University of Szeged, Faculty of Agriculture, Hódmezővásárhely, Hungary 1 e-mail: mt@mgk.u-szeged.hu Abstract: Immature embryos of field-origin were cultured following an in vitro plant regeneration protocol established for genetic transformation experiments. Callus formation and somatic embryogenesis were induced at all the three spring wheat genotypes involved. Best results have been achieved at the established cultivar ‘GK Tavasz’ (up to 99% tissue culture response and 43% of embryogenic structures) while “model” genotypes of genetic transformation studies (‘CY-45’ and ‘Bobwhite’) gave inferior results for both parameters. These results suggest that the latter lines are less amenable to present good plant material for tissue culture purposes if grown in the field. Embryos of smaller size (0.5-1.5 mm) resulted higher induction rate of somatic embryos at ‘Bobwhite’ and ‘GK Tavasz’ while at ‘CY-45’ larger embryos (&gt;1.5 mm) gave the better result. Keywords: wheat, Triticum aestivum, tissue culture, somatic embryogenesis Introduction The influences of genotype, year and agronomic factors on yield and quality of wheat are well-known (Bhutta, 2007; Pepó, 2007; Pepó and Győri, 2007; Tanács et al., 2007). Tissue culture response is also highly genotype dependent both in somatic and haploid in vitro systems (Felföldi and Purnhauser, 1992; Maës et al., 1996; Saikat et al., 2002). For genetic transformation and other somatic embryogenesis-based systems immature embryos proved to be the best plant material due to the remarkable embryogenic and plant regeneration potential of the scutellar tissues (Magnusson and Bornman, 1985; Vasil, 2007). The goal of our work was to study the tissue culture response of three spring wheat genotypes which are regularly (‘CY-45’, ‘Bobwhite’) or occasionally (‘GK Tavasz’) used in genetic transformation experiments. The culture protocol applied had been originally developed through studies on biolistic gene transfer into immature embryos of wheat (Varshney and Altpeter, 2002). Although, to achieve the highest regeneration rate plant material of greenhouse origin is preferred, field grown donor plants can also have a seasonal importance. Suitability of plant material of field origin was tested here by using immature embryos of different sizes to compare their regeneration capacity as well. Materials and methods Three spring wheat genotypes were used in the experiments: ‘CY-45’, ‘Bobwhite' and ‘GK Tavasz’. Donor plants were grown in field plots near Szeged (SE Hungary) in the spring of 2007. Ears were collected 12-15 days post-anthesis and processed after max. 7 days of storage at 4 ºC. Caryopses were surface-sterilized as described elsewhere (Altpeter et al., 1996). Aseptically isolated embryos were separated according to their size (length of scutellum: 0.5-1.5 mm or &gt;1.5 mm) and placed on induction medium with embryo axis in contact with medium.</p><p id="Pg462">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1136 The media and protocol of callus/somatic embryo induction as well as plant regeneration based upon the protocol of Varshney and Altpeter (2002) with the exception of not using any selection agent here: - Callus induction: D2 medium [MS medium (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) supplemented with 2 mg l-1 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)], incubation of freshly isolated embryos in the dark for 5-7 days - Transfer of calli to D2 medium supplemented with 63.75 g l-1 mannitol (D2Mannit), incubation in the dark for 20-24 hours. - Transfer of calli/embryoids to callus induction medium containing maltose instead of sucrose and an enhanced level of CuSO4 (D2Maltóz: see D2, maltose instead of sucrose, + 5 μM CuSO4), incubation in the dark for 10-14 days. - Transfer of developing calli to modified regeneration medium (D0Cu: hormone-free MS medium with 3% sucrose + 5 μM CuSO4), incubation in the light for 10-14 days. - Transfer of developing shoots and embryogenic structures to regeneration medium (D0Reg: see D0Cu without increased CuSO4), incubation in the light for at least 14 days. - Transfer of regenerated plantlets (&gt;2 cm) to rooting medium (0,5D0: 50% MS basic salts with 2% sucrose), incubation in the light. A representative sample of plantlets was involved because 100% rate of shoots developed roots already on the regenerating medium. Plantlets exhibiting a strong root system were transplanted to soil. Results and discussion Calli appeared on isolated embryos of each genotype 5-10 days after the start of culture. Genotype and size of the embryos influenced the quality of calli: - ‘GK Tavasz’ produced primarily soft calli of big size. This type of callus resembled the non-embryogenic type according to Maddock et al. (1983) in the initial period of culture, however later it showed a reasonably high embryogenic potential. - ‘Bobwhite’ calli were mainly those of the compact granular yellowish-white type however they showed a lower embryogenic potential than expected. - ‘CY-45’ embryos gave rise to similar type of callus like those of ‘Bobwhite’. 0 20 40 60 80 100 % CY-45 Bobwhite Genotype Responding embryos Embryogenic structures Figure 1. Induction frequency of calli and embryogenic structures in spring wheat genotypes</p><p id="Pg463">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1137 In the first experiment performed with immature embryos of various sizes (0.5-2 mm) ‘CY-45’ exhibited higher induction rate of embryoid structures compared to ‘Bobwhite’ (Fig. 1). The induction frequency of embryogenic structures at ‘CY-45’ was lower here (43% vs. 93%) compared to the earlier results (Felföldi and Purnhauser, 1992). This can be explained by the differences in the culture protocol among others by the osmotic treatment applied here. Pre- and post-bombardment incubation of calli on mannitolcontaining medium was found to enhance the survival rate of cells exposed to biolistic gene transfer. However, an extended (&gt;24 h) exposure to high osmotic conditions had deteriorating effect on cells (Altpeter et al., 1996). Other explanation for the low embryogenic potential can be the poor quality of plant material caused by the extremely dry weather during anthesis in April 2007. In the experiment performed with immature embryos selected by their size the cultivar ‘GK Tavasz’ gave the best response (Tab. 1). The two genotypes regularly used in genetic transformation experiments (‘CY-45’, ‘Bob White’) gave inferior results here. Average tissue culture response was 80% for embryos of 0.5-1.5 mm and 90% for those of &gt;1.5 mm and average induction frequency of embryogenic structures was 30% and 21%, respectively (Tab. 1). Immature embryos of ca. 1-1.5 mm are commonly used for the induction of somatic embryogenesis, among others in genetic transformation experiments (Felföldi and Purnhauser, 1992; Altpeter et al., 1996). In contrast, Maës et al. (1996) found larger embryos (up to 2 mm) more amenable to an accelerated regeneration method based on isolated scutella. Although, embryo axis was not removed in our experiments, their observations are in correspondence with ours regarding the high rate of responding larger embryos. Table 1.

The high tissue culture response of ‘CY-45’ was detected by Felföldi and Purnhauser (1992). ‘Bobwhite’ is a well-known genotype in genetic transformation programs. In fact, this name is a generic name for a cross combination covering 129 sister lines the diversity of which is responsible for the inconsistent tissue culture response detected in transformation programs worldwide (http://www.cimmyt.org/whatiscimmyt/ar00_2001/latinamerica/ whats/name.htm). The established cultivar ‘GK Tavasz’ was bred from CIMMYT lines and it has been found to be less amenable for transformation purposes in our earlier experiments (unpublished data).</p><p id="Pg464">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1138 Conclusions Climatic conditions had a strong influence on the suitability of field grown plants for in vitro usage: anomalies in precipitation and temperature during anthesis resulted in poor tissue culture response even if the size and morphology of the immature embryos seemed to be normal. This feature could be observed at both the introduced CIMMYT lines (‘CY-45’ and ‘Bobwhite’) and at the established cultivar bred under the climatic conditions of Hungary (‘GK Tavasz’), however to less extent at the latter one. Our current results and earlier experiences with the same genotypes (unpublished data) suggest that for genetic transformation and other somatic embryogenesis-based techniques - the usage of plant material of greenhouse origin is recommended for the genotypes ‘CY-45’ and ‘Bobwhite’, while - in the case of ‘GK Tavasz’ field grown donor plants can also be used assuming no extremities in weather conditions.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1139 ABANDONED LOESSY GRAPE YARDS AS REFUGES OF RARE STEPPE PLANT SPECIES Ákos MALATINSZKY1 – Irén SCHILLER2 – Károly PENKSZA1 1 Department of Nature Conservation and Landscape Ecology, Institute of Environmental and Landscape Management, Faculty of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Szent István University, 2103 Gödöllő, Páter K. 1. Hungary, e-mail: malata@zpok.hu 2 Department of Botany, Institute of Biology, Faculty of Veterinarian Sciences, Szent István University Abstract: Nature protected plant species characteristic for loess grasslands of the Hungarian Great Plain can be found in several grape yards of hilly areas that have been abandoned different times (20–200 years) ago. Small parcels of abandoned grape yards were studied in the Putnok Hills micro region of the Northern Hungarian Mountain Range. Rare loess plant species could be detected as a consequence of erosion driven by century-old hoeing and great slope angle, as loessy parent material has appeared on (or near) the surface of the soils, resulting in the appearance of plant taxa characteristic for loess grasslands of plain and foothill regions. Keywords: grape yard, secondary loess steppe, land abandonment, erosion, landscape history Introduction Land abandonment and, in parallel, regeneration of vegetation on the abandoned areas are characteristic processes in Hungary. Direction of these processes leads attention onto several problems of nature conservation and environmental protection (Centeri and Vona, 2006; Vona et al., 2007). Habitats generated by abandonment and being in a close-to-natural state usually differ from natural vegetation. Centuries old agricultural activities on diverse habitats of the Putnok Hills resulted in specially structured landscape mosaics. Agricultural landscape should play a role also in nature conservation (Szemán, 2007; Tasi, 2007). This paper presents results of studies started in 1999. Species richness of the mosaiclike areas was highly visible, leading to more detailed surveys. Besides floristical data, also habitats and historical and current forms of landscape management are also observed. Exploring pedological relations and state of soils has got a high importance as well, since as a consequence of great slope angles in parallel with anthropogenic processes, water and wind erosion has been strengthened on several areas during the latest decades (Várallyay, 2006; Várallyay, 2007). Landscape management and long term maintenance and conservation of main characteristics of soils is only possible by preserving the diversity of living beings generated on them in parallel (Birkás et al., 2006; Kádár, 2007). Materials and methods The studied area (consisting of two slopes of one valley: Iván-tető and Ragyás-szőlő) is situated between Szuhafő and Zádorfalva villages within the Putnok Hills (North-East Hungary). Its botanical relations have been explored between spring 1999 and spring 2007 (Malatinszky and Penksza, 2004), while landscape management, landscape history and pedological conditions were observed between 2002 and 2007. During floristical surveys, enumeration of plant taxa follows the nomenclature of Simon (2000). During coenological investigations describing the most valuable habitats on their typical vegetation patches, the method of Braun–Blanquet (1964) was followed. Coenological relevés were prepared in 2005. Sizes of quadrates were 2×2 meters.</p><p id="Pg466">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1140 Relevés are not presented in the current paper. Habitat types were observed several (at least 4) times, in different stages and in different parts of the vegetation period. Pedological surveys (and, in parallel, ones concerning erosion) were prepared during the vegetation period of 2003, 2004 and 2005 years. Field observations were made partly by using a Pürckhauer sampler (Finnern, 1994). Soil factors that are important from vegetation ecological aspect (pH, lime content, organic matter and nutrient content, water management factors) were analyzed on collected samples based on the soil and agro chemistry analyses method books of Buzás (1988, 1993) in the laboratory of the Department of Pedology and Agro Chemistry of Szent István University. Analyzed parameters were the following ones: pH/H2O, pH/KCl, humus % (with Tyurin method), total organic matter %, CaCO3 %, AL-P2O5, AL-K2O. Sources used during observations on historical forms and current methods of management, landscape history and effects of land abandonment were the following ones: narrations of local inhabitants, of colleagues of the Ecological Institute (Miskolc) and of the Aggtelek National Park Directorate (Jósvafő); maps of military mappings (based on which changes in land use can be followed up well); descriptions given to the first military mapping (Csorba, 1993); various literature on ethnography in the region; and collections on the history of villages in Gömörszőlős. Results and discussion Viniculture, that is management of grape yards (as well as fruit orchards in an extensive way) in the observed area has been present since the Middle Ages and has reached its maximum size in the early 1880’s. During that decade, vine-pest has destroyed all the areas covered by grape. Although reintroduction of grape yards has started closely after the vine-pest epidemic, parcels of several grape yards remained out of management (Dobány, 2004; and narrations of local inhabitants). In many cases, fruit orchards (plum, apple, pear breeds and walnut) were established on the slopes. Only a small area of grape yards, that could meet the local needs (without commerce), was reestablished. The observed areas are situated near villages that are surrounded by poorly fertile arable lands. After development of heavy industry in the vicinity (Borsod Basin) in the 1960’s, a significant part of the inhabitants became employed in mining and industrial centers and moved away from the observed area or started to commute, therefore the traditional land use was abandoned in several areas. Abandoned arable lands are currently in different stages of succession, depending on the time passed since abandonment. Slopes of abandoned grape yards are characterized by thin fertile soil layer, caused by strong natural erosion (due to high slope angle) and hoeing during the 18–19th centuries. Parent material has been found usually already at 10 cm deepness, being loess or loessy sediment, with high CaCO3 content. Besides that, these soils are characterized by bad soil structure, strong compaction, low humus content (around 1 %) and low nutrient content (phosphorous and potassium below 50 ppm). These soil features basically determine which plant species may appear on their surface (Csontos et al., 2007). Eroded slopes of abandoned grape yards served the generation of dry grasslands similar to those on steppes, giving home for nature protected plant species. Exposition of slopes played a significant role in abandonment. Terraces of grape yards with a northwestern exposition had been abandoned from grape production cca. 200 years ago (according to</p><p id="Pg467">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1141 military mappings), therefore, time passed since then could have been enough for revegetation and generation of a secondary dry grassland. Its structure refers to the dry loess steppes. Dominant grass species of this slope is Brachypodium pinnatum, which refers to the stabilization of the grassland, giving home for valuable loess steppe species indicating low nutrient content such as Linum falvum, L. tenuifolium, Pulsatilla grandis, Polygala major and Prunella grandiflora. Sites with southeastern exposition that have been abandoned from grape production after the vine-pest epidemic, that is cca. 120 years ago, are currently covered mainly by Brachypodium pinnatum, giving home for several rare species of natural and seminatural steppes, including Prunus fruticosa, Pulsatilla grandis, Linum tenuifolium, L. flavum, L. hirsutum, Polygala major, Aster amellus, Dianthus collinus, Orchis purpurea, O. tridentata, O. militaris, O. ustulata and Senecio erucifolius. Sites that are affected by regular burning (induced by local elder people who wish to sustain the view of landscape without shrubs) has become featureless, with much lower number of species, including those referring to disturbance (Bothriochloa ischaemum). Parcels still under grape cultivation are dominated mainly by weed species. Molinia arundinacea appearing among currently cultivated parcels (with southeastern exposition) of the upper parts of slopes refer to one-time oak forest coverage in the area (found also in historical geography works). In the foothill regions of grape yards, characterized by colluviums with deeper fertile layer, succession after abandonment starts with regeneration of grasslands, followed by appearance of different shrub species, however, this process is strongly set back by annual burning, and the regeneration of forests (eradicated in the early Middle Ages) is almost impossible due to erosion. Festuca species and Stipa pennata have become dominant on the driest and steepest zones. Less steep and less dry zones, not affected by burning are usually dominated by Crataegus monogyna and Prunus spinosa shrubs. Succession processes affect the directions of reforestation and generation of mosaic-like forested steppe. Gradually after abandonment, number of species is growing and character species of surrounding areas settle next to the disturbance tolerant weeds. Number of steppe species grows constantly and they take dominant position from weeds. In parallel with growing number of species, number of degradation tolerant ones is decreasing and naturalness value category of occurring species is growing. Forest steppe species appear in the parcels (such as Linum spp., Crepis praemorsa). Among habitat types registered during our researches, the following one is declared as priority habitat type of community interest in the Annex I of the Habitat Directive (92/43/EEC) of the EU: no. 6210 that is Semi-natural dry grasslands and scrubland facies on calcareous substrates (Festuco-Brometalia) as important orchid sites. Conclusions The view of nature has changed elementarily on the observed areas in the presence of humans during the past centuries. Changes in the environment have been accelerated in the past decades: with its direct and indirect effects, heavy industry founded in the vicinity has decreased the size and naturalness of habitats further. On the other hand, however, by attracting the working population away, it has helped nature’s new expansion and increasing mosaic-like areas in the landscape.</p><p id="Pg468">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1142 Natural environment of the studied area basically determines the types and intensity of management activities, which fact is verified also by data gained during landscape historical studies. Processes in grasslands are basically determined by their exposure, angle of slopes and vegetation cover, which affect water regime of the soil as well. In case of abandonment of small parcel grape yards, valuable plant species appear on the previously disturbed or eroded surfaces. Natural or induced burning of grasslands in some years may play an important role in avoiding closing of vegetation cover and becoming shrubbier, however, it may be undesirable considering invertebrate fauna. The abandonment of small parcels of grape yards in the Putnok Hills launched processes favorable for nature conservation (due to geological backgrounds). As a consequence of erosion driven by century-old hoeing and great slope angle, loessy parent material appeared on the surface, resulting in the appearance of protected plant taxa characteristic for loess grasslands of foothill and plain regions.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1143 INFLUENCE OF DRAINPIPE SPACINGS ON ATRAZINE LEACHING Ivan SIMUNIC1 – Mario SRAKA2 – Stjepan HUSNJAK2 – Franjo TOMIC1 – Klara BARIC3 1 Department of Soil Amelioration, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zagreb, Svetosimunska 25, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia, e-mail: isimunic@agr.hr 2 Department of Soil Science, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zagreb 3 Department of Herbology, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zagreb Abstract: Maize (Zea mays) is the leading culture according to sow area in Croatia. Herbicide products based on atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-1,3,5-triazine) are most widely used for weed control in corn crops. Therefore the aim of this study was to determine the concentration and leaching of atrazine in drainage water in four different variants of pipe drainage spacing (15 m, 20 m, 25 m and 30 m). The study was conduced on the Jelenscak reclamation test field, on hydroameliorated Gleyic Podzoluvisol during four years. Atrazine extracted from the samples of drainage waters was determinated by gas chromatography. Data were statistically processed by means of analysis of variance. The concentrations of the atrazine recorded in drainage waters varied in a wide range, with maximum values recorded soon after its application and at the start of higher drainage discharge. The results indicate that maximal and average concentrations of atrazine in drainage waters exceeded the maximum allowable concentration (MAC) for single herbicides in drinking water (0,1 µg l-1), respectively, in the larger part of the year in all variants of pipe drainage spacing. There were no statistically significant differences between the tested drainage systems in drainage water contamination with atrazine. Keywords: hydroameliorated Gleyic Podzoluvisol, drainage water, atrazine, leaching Introduction Pesticides have many side effects on the environment – soil, water, food and organisms (Jolánkai et al. 2006, Kirsch et al. 2007, Varga et al. 2007, Varróet al. 2007 Velisková, 2006,). Among herbicides, atrazine is one of the most widely use in the world, mainly due its relatively low price and broad spectrum of activity. In Croatia, products of atrazine are used in formulations of pure atrazine or in ready mix combination with other herbicides applied in pre-emergence or post-emergence. Due to its chemical properties, atrazine is characterized by high water mobility and environmental persistence. Because of these atrazine properties and its longlasting use as a plantprotecting agent in Croatia, residues of this contaminant have been identified in the samples of surface, ground and drinking waters (Vargha et al. 2004, Gojmerac et al. 2006, Sraka et al. 2007). Atrazine is most effective in wet soil, so it is usually applied in early spring, when soil is at field water capacity. It is moderately hydrophilic and in aquatic environment may persist for years. Atrazine has a greater mobility in soil than many other herbicides (Buhler et al. 1993) and is the most commonly detected herbicide in the groundwater of many countries. Their excessive quantities in drinking water may pose other dangers to humans, animals and plants. For this reason, its use has been restricted or banned in some Europian countries. The aim of the research carried out during 1991/92, 1993/94, 1996/97, 1999/00 was: - to determine the concentration and leaching of atrazine in drainage waters for four different drainpipe spacings (15 m, 20 m, 25 m and 30 m) - to determine, whether there is a statistical significant, difference in concentration of atrazine in drainage water and its leaching between different drainpipe spacings.</p><p id="Pg470">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1144 Materials and methods Trials were carried out on the Jelenscak reclamation test field, on hydroameliorated Gleyic Podzolluvisol during four years, which is located in the Sava river valley. Trial variants involved four different variants of drainpipe spacing (15 m, 20 m, 25 m and 30 m), set up in four replications. All variants were combined with gravel as contact material (ø 5-25 mm) in the drainage ditch above the pipe. Drainpipe characteristics were: length 95 m, diameter 65 mm, average slope 3‰ and average depth 1 m. Drainpipes discharged directly into open canals. Variants covered areas of: 1425 m2, 1900 m2, 2375 m2 and 2850 m2. Plastic (PVC)-annular-ribbed and perforated pipes were used. Maize was grown as the trial crop and the same agricultural practices were applied in all pipe drainage variants in each trial year. During intensive growing of maize weed control involved application of herbicide Primextra 500, based on active substance – atrazine 20% + metolachlor 30% (1991, 1993, 1996 i 1999 with 6 l ha-1). Drainage discharge was measured continually by means of automatic electronic gauges – limnimeters. Drainage water was sampled every day during the discharge period. Atrazine extracted from the samples of drainage waters was detected by gas chromatography. The detection limit for atrazine in drainage waters was lowered than 0,05-0,01 µg l-1. Total annual quantities of atrazine leached were estimated on the basis of average monthly concentration and monthly quantity of drainage discharge. Data were statistically processed by means of the ANOVA. Results and discussion To facilitate interpretation of research results, the factors of soil and precipitation were taken into consideration (Table 1 and 2), as well as hydrological relations (Table 3).

It can be seen (Table 3) that there were differences in the quantity and duration of drainage discharge, both between the tested variants in each year and between the trial years. There are several reasons for these differences, primarily the different total annual quantity and distribution of precipitation, different efficiency of each particular pipe drainage system, etc. Duration of drainage discharge</p><p id="Pg471">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1145 in each year increases with the width of drainpipe spacing. Therefore systems with shorter duration of drainage discharge are more efficient.

This was influenced by the date of atrazine application, quantity and distribution of rainfall, that is, the quantity of drainage discharge, and efficiency of each particular pipe drainage system. Maximum atrazine concentrations in drainage water were recorded soon after its application and at the start of higher drainage discharge (May 1991, June 1993, 1999 and September 1996); they decreased in all years with later drainage discharge. Namely, atrazine is highly water-soluble and it is readily transported with water and degraded in soil.

(2002). These authors point to the fact that the quantity of atrazine leached in these parts is strongly influenced by the distribution of precipitation (drainage discharge), time of herbicide application, their quantities added, and the phenological stage of maize. In the case of the mentioned atrazine rate (1200 g/ha) applied to hydroameliorated soil and the recorded quantities of precipitation drainage discharge, atrazine concentrations were higher than the tolerated limit in 10 months in all years.

Albanis et al. (1988) reported different quantities of leached atrazine with respect to soil texture (0.54% in clay, 0.66% in loam and 0.47% in silt-loam) and Accinelli et al. (2002) reported about 0.61% atrazine losses in silty loam. Conclusions In 10 months in all years and all variants concentrations of atrazine were higher from the tolerated limit. Quantity of atrazine leached is depended on the total drainage discharge and its concentrations in drainage water. ANOVA showed that there were no statistically significant differences between the tested variants in particular years either in atrazine concentrations or in the quantity of atrazine leached, at LSD=0.05.

Hungary, e-mail: jolankai.marton@mkk.szie.hu Abstract: All ecosystems in the world are based on life cycles manifested in soil-plant interrelations. Plant life is determined by soil conditions and processes, however soil is also much influenced by plants. Soil-plant interrelations cover a wide range of bottom-up as well as top-down systems that may be synergistic, antagonistic, or coexistent. This paper summarizes principles of plant and soil interrelations; the processes and magnitude of some mutual impacts. Keywords: environment, soil, plant growth, Environment. Ecologically, the environment is the sum of all external conditions and influences affecting the life and development of organisms. Environment is usually considered abiotic and biotic. These divisions are artificial in the sense that neither can be separated when organisms are studied. Holocoenosys comprises environmental aspects and their influences on living organisms (Schulze and Mooney, 1993). The particular environment occupied by an organism or by groups and communities of organisms is the habitat. Environmental conditions generally exist in an area independently of the occurrence of any species of plant or animal that may depend on them, and area is used to express this concept. The whole system of interaction between a particular organism and its physical and biotic environment is the niche of the organism. The term indicates not only the habitat, or microenvironment, but also the activity of the organism. The environment of small areas in contrast to that of larger ones, or of particular organisms in contrast to generalized environments of communities, is recognized as the microenvironment. Other terms commonly applied to this concept, but much more restricted in scope, are microclimate and bioclimate. Soil is a most general example for holocoenosys. Soil formation. Soils are made up of mineral particles mixed with decomposed organic matter. The top soil consists of the mixture which is so vital for plant growth. Below the top soil is the sub-soil which is largely composed of mineral matter. In addition to the mineral and organic matter, called the soil solids, there are spaces between the soil particles which are taken up by water and air, and make up the non-solid part of the soil. Within a soil composition, the amount and proportion of certain constituents constantly vary. Soil solids consist of particles of various sizes. According to their size, they are called gravel, coarse and fine sand, silt and clay particles. The mineral material in all soils is derived from the parent material by the process of weathering, which breaks down rocks into smaller particles, by mechanical disintegration, and chemical decomposition. Soil functions and processes. The main soil functions (Várallyay, 2004; 2006) in the biosphere can be summarised as follows: – The soil is a conditionally renewable natural resource</p><p id="Pg474">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1148 – It acts as a reactor, transformer and integrator of the combined influences of other natural resources (solar radiation, atmosphere, surface and subsurface waters, biological resources) and is the site of “sphere interactions” – It provides a medium for biomass production and is the primary food-source of the biosphere – It stores heat, water, plant nutrients and – in some special cases – wastes – It is a high-capacity buffer medium, which may prevent or moderate the unfavourable consequences of various environmental stresses – It acts as a natural filter and detoxication system, which may protect the deeper geological formations and the subsurface waters from various pollutants – It represents a significant gene reservoir and is an important element in biodiversity – It is the conservator of natural and human heritages. Society has utilized these functions in different ways (rate, method, efficiency) throughout history, depending on the given natural conditions and socio-economic circumstances. The multifunctionality of soil is determined by the combined influences of soil properties, which are the results of soil processes (mass and energy regimes, abiotic and biotic transport and transformation, and their interactions) under the combined influences of soil-forming factors. Any soil-related human activity influences the soil through these processes. Plant life. A plant is a living organism without power of locomotion. Plants consist of different parts, each of which has a specialized function. The basic parts of a plant are the root system and the shoot system. Roots absorb water and minerals from the soil. The shoot system consists of the stem, the leaves, flowers and fruit. The stem transports water and minerals upwards to the leaves and flowers and organic materials down to the roots. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 viability % 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 10 20 30 40 50 moisture % te m pe ra tu re o C Figure 1.

Plant life is manifested in various physiological processes, most of which are soil dependent both being parts of a complex holocoenosys. Thus, any soilplant system is determined by their interrelations. Plant life is much influenced by soil conditions, properties and processes (Nagy et al 2006). Figure 1 shows a model of some soil characteristics that have an impact on plant growth, e.g. viability. Since life criteria depend on three basic thresholds: moisture, temperature and the presence of oxygen, soils as the fundamental habitat for any plant growth provide optimal, suboptimal and hyperoptimal conditions for that. The model support the evidence, that germination may be performed between 10 to 90 % of moisture range, regarding temperature within a range of 10 to 40 oC. However an optimum range of this phenomena is much narrower as indicated by the upper levels of the viability pyramid. Plant life on the other hand provides a basis for soil formation, secures the physical, chemical and biological state of the soil, contributes to the maintenance of soil fertility and the cultural state of that, and last but not least that may obstruct soil degradation processes. Figure 2. illustrates a schematic map of major means and regions of land degradation in Hungary. Figure 2. Types of land degradation in Hungary Plants, land use and cropping structure may promote or prevent means of soil degradation like erosion, textural deteriorations, waterlogging, acidity, salinity and alkalinity. Conclusions Harmonization between crop plant requirements and production site characteristics should be as follows.  Coordination of production site (Optimization of cropping structure)  Adaptation of crop plants to production site characteristics (breeding tasks)  Adaptation of production site to crop plants (agronomy, amelioration)</p><p id="Pg476">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1150 The ideal arable soil is defined by Kellogg (1957): The farmer makes his arable soil from a natural soil or old arable soil. He develops and maintains a deep rooting zone, easily penetrated by air, water, and roots. It holds water between rains, but allows the excess to pass through it. It has a balanced supply of nutrients. It neither washes away during rains nor blows away with high winds. The combination of practices to use depends on what is necesary to develop and maintain a soil as nearly as possible to the ideal on a sustained long-time basis. A modern assesment of Birkás et al (2007) reshaped the classical Plinius statement: “Nothing causes as much damage as does neglected arable land.”. According to that a soil is regarded to be in favourable condition when it is workable within a wide range of different moisture content levels, if it provides a reliable basis for crop production and its physical, chemical and biological features have no negative impacts on the environment. The condition of a soil is unfavourable when one or more of its physical properties or biological features qualify as environmental damage and successful crop production requires costly interventions. Finally considerations related to the society may have sever impact on plant and soil interrelations as well. Alps-Adria series have been discussing in details, that sustainable – or believed to be sustainable – systems may have diverse impacts on our environment. On one hand we do something good, on the other hand this may have negative side effects. Success has always been escorted by failures. There is an old proverb, a rudiment of wisdom, according to what “the road leading to the hell is often paved by goodwill”. Politicians label agriculture, as if it was some kind of hobby farming. Actually it is an economic necessity in most countries. Green movements often manipulate the public with arguments of no scientific value. Agriculture and environment are bound together. There are several problems in their interrelation, however these problems should never be placed in the field of politics. Cserháti (1901) has written, that crop production is not an empirical craftmanship, but rather an art based on a wide range of knowledge. Let us be keen on to encourage knowledgefarming versus ecoanarchism.

Desimir KNEZEVIC1 -Nevena DJUKIC3 -Aleksandar PAUNOVIC2 -Milomirka MADIC2 1 Faculty of Agriculture, Zubin Potok, University Pristina, Serbia, deskoa@ptt.yu 2 Faculty of Natural Sciences, Department of Biology Kragujevac, Serbia 3 Agricultural Faculty, Cacak, Cara Dusana 32, 32000 Cacak, Serbia Abstract. Variability of harvest index and some yield components (plant height, number of spikelets per spike, number of kernels per spike) were studied in 10 wheat genotypes. Wheat genotypes were grown during three years on the experimental field in 3 replication. Samples of 60 wheat plants (20 plants/replication at each year) were analyzed in full maturity stage. Harvest index was computed as a ratio of grain yield and a total above ground part of the plant. The differences in average values for all the studied parameters among investigated cultivars were determined. High variability of investigated traits was established. The highest variability for grain yield (CV=5.60%) and stem height (CV=4.84%) and the lowest variability for number of spikelets per spike (CV=2.66%) and harvest index (CV=3.66%) was found. The strongest correlation was found between grain No.of kernels/spike and grain yield (0.485) as well between harvest index and grain yield (0.455). Key words: wheat, variability, grain harvest index, stem height, spike, yield. Introduction In successful breeding program wheat breeders has produced a series of cultivars with improved resistance to pests and diseases, wider adaptation to adverse soil and climatic conditions and better quality. The yield variability is less studied than yield itself. The genetic yield potential of a wheat cultivar may be dependent on favorable conditions and good agronomy for its expression (Agoston &amp; Pepo, 2005, Drezner et al., 2006). The levels of water, fertilizer, pesticide and herbicide application have influence to wheat yields (Balogh et al., 2006; Németh, 2006; Jolánkai et al., 2006). The ideal cultivar for high grain yield or for any other desirable traits need to express genetic potential in different environment with low value of variance in different environmental factors of growing (Josipović et al., 2005). The grain yield of wheat is variable traits, which depends on numerous yield components and environmental factors (Pepo, 2005). The harvest index represents the ratio between economical yield (wheat grain yield) and biological yield (yield of grain and straw) Borojevic (1986). The proportion of total mass to grain yield in mostly modern cultivars is more than 2:1 which indicates excessive consumption of nutrients for straw formation instead of grain (Djokic et al, 1992; Užik &amp; Žofajová, 2006). This is one reason for decreasing vegetative part of wheat to the optimal proportion in order to increase the harvest index to more than 50%. The characters as height of plants, length of spike, number of spikelets per spike are in positive correlation with grain yield (Zecevic &amp; Knezevic, 1998). The aim of this paper is study of variability of harvest index and yield components (height of plants, number of spikelets per spike, number of kernels per spike, thousand grain mass) in genetically divergent wheat genotypes. Materials and methods The variability of harvest index and some yield components were studied in 10 Serbian wheat genopypes. For this investigation used cultivars KG-35265-1/94, KG-52, KG3625/9, KG-3089/97, KG-3062/1-93, KG-4, KG-3617/98, KG-35171/94, KG-3419-</p><p id="Pg478">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1152 3/97, Pobeda. The seeds of cultivars were sown in basic plot 5 m2. For analysis of plant height, spike length and number of spikelets/spike were used 60 plants in full maturity stage (20 plants/replication). The folowing parameters were computed: the average value (x); the variance (2); the coefficient of variation (V) as an index of relative variability of the trait. The analysis of variance was performed and significant differences between the average value were estimated by F-test values. Results and discussion Analyzed wheat genotypes expressed differences of trait values (Tab. 1). Harvest index (HI) - represents plant efficiency in translocation nutritive matter from vegetative to generative plant part. Harvest index is the ratio between grain weight per plant, and the plant weight. The HI value ranged from x = 38.7 % for cultivar KG-3617/98 to x = 43.0 %, for KG-3625/97 cultivar (Table 1). Variability expressed by coefficient of variability (CV=3.66%). For analyzed genotypes grain harvest index influenced by genetic components 51.49% while environmet and interaction G/E had less influence (Tab. 2). The sensitivity of HI under environmental variation noticed Zecevic &amp; Knezevic (1998). Varieties expressed different reaction in plant height reducing, consequently that had the impact on HI, as well. Increasing of genetic yield potential in wheat can be realised by increasing of harvest index to 50% or more than 50% Borojevic (1986). Increase in harvest index with increase in yield potential has been found in wheat (Zecevic &amp; Knezevic, 1998). For wheat and its wild progenitors grown in the field, the HI ranged from 5-17% in the wild diploids to 51% in modern cultivars. Table 1.

All the genotypes in study belonged to semi-dwarf wheat class expressing the average plant height from x= 67.14 cm (KG3089/97) and x = 78.10 cm (KG-35171/94). In average for all cultivars and years the coefficient of variability was very low (CV=4.83%) that indicated that genotype had higher influence than environment on expression of plant height (Table 1). Decreasing of stem height gave higher possibility of efficient utilization mineral elements for the head development. Also translocation of mineral elements is more efficient in semidwarf cultivars from the vegetative organs to grain (Užik Žofajová, 2006; Bede et al., 2007). Genetic components of variance had lower partitioning than environments and interaction of G/E for plant height and number of kernels/spike (Table 3).</p><p id="Pg479">VII.

The genetic controls of stem height and other yield components are very important, but environment has influence on expression of analyzed traits. Generally speaking, genotypes reacted similarly to environmental variation for plant height, and number of spikiest per spike, number of kernels per spike, differing in main effect. On the contrary, genotype reaction for harvest index differed in main effect, as well as, in interaction making phenotypic expression for this trait more unpredictable. The remobilization of reserve into harvested organs varies among the cultivars. References Agoston, T., Pepo, P. :2005.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1155 THE EFFECT OF SOME HERBICIDES ON HOST-VIRUS RELATIONS Gabriella KAZINCZI 1 – Andrea ONOFRI 2 – József HORVÁTH 1 - Maria TORMA3 1 Plant Protection Institute, Georgikon Faculty of University of Pannonia, H-8361 Keszthely, P.O. Box 71, Hungary, e-mail: kg@georgikon.hu 2 Department of Agricultural and Environmental Science, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy 3 BASF Ltd, Budapest, Hungary Abstract: Two years pot experiments under glasshouse conditions were conducted in order to study the virus inhibitory side-effect of some herbicides (napropamide, pendimethalin, fluazifop-P-butyl) on pepper-Óbuda pepper virus (ObPV) and Solanum nigrum-ObPV host-virus relations. On the basis of our experiments three types of the herbicide effects have been observed: 1. herbicide treatments prevented virus infection of susceptible host plants; 2. plants were infected by ObPV, but the virus concentration in them was significantly lower as compared to the positive control; 3. herbicide treatments did not influence significantly virus concentration. It has been concluded that the effect of herbicides on host-virus relations greatly depends on hosts (species, varieties), type of herbicides, mode and dosage of application and year. The results draw attention to the fact, that certain herbicides may play an important role not only in weed control but they also have inhibitory effect on economically important plant viruses, occurring in horticultural and agricultural ecosystems. Fluazifop-P-butyl gave the best results, regarding the protective effect from viral infection, therefore it could be worth to examine the effect of other fatty acid synthesis inhibitors on host-virus relations. Keywords: herbicides, plant viruses, host plants, virus inhibition, soil conditions Introduction Plant viruses make up about 15-30% of the whole plant diseases. Virus particles create extremely close biological units with the host cell. The biosynthesis of viruses is done by the organelles of the host cell. Therefore chemical protection against viruses is unsuccesful in vivo and causes the death of the plant host cell and therefore also the death of virus particles. In spite of this, some artificial (Faccioli and Zoffoli 1998; Kálmán and Gáborjányi 1998) and natural substances (Vivanco et al. 1999) are known to inhibit the replication and cell - to cell movement of viruses and to reduce virus concentration. Even now chemical plant protection is the major part of the integrated plant protection and 50 % of pesticide sales is made up by herbicides. From practical point of view it is important to know the beneficial side effects of herbicides. So far only few data is available about antiviral effect of herbicides. The best known in this respect is the inhibitory effect of some triazines on virus replication. Beside triazines urea-type and aryloxyalkanoic acid type herbicides are known to have virus inhibitory effect (Schuster 1972). Horváth and Hunyadi (1973) studied the effect of trifluralin on the replication of Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) and Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). Rao et al. (1994) reported that the replication of Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) was inhibited in Chenopodium amaranticolor host species due to nitrofen and trifluralin. Wilcut et al. (2001) did not experience any effect of flumioxazin on the incidence of Tomato spotted wilt virus in groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) cultivars. Increase and decrease in viral disease incidence and severity on host plants depend on a lot of factors, like nutrient supply, vector activity etc. (Takács and Dolej 1998, Takács 1999, Nádasy and Nádasy 2006, Marczali et al. 2006, Keszthelyi et al. 2007). The aim of this study was to examine the effect of three commonly applied pepper herbicides on some host - Obuda pepper virus (ObPV) relations.</p><p id="Pg482">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1156 Materials and methods Pot experiments under glasshouse conditions were conducted in order to study the virus inhibitory side-effect of some herbicides on host-virus relations in two subsequently years. Seeds of four varieties of pepper (‘Macskapiros’, ‘Csipke’, ‘Belecskai’, ‘Szentesi piacos’) and black nightshade (Solanum nigrum) plants were sown in plastic pots (12 cm in diam.). Preplant (PPI) treatments with Stomp 330 (a.i. pendimethalin) at a dosage of 1350 and 2700 g a.i. ha-1 and Devrinol 45F (a.i. napropamide) at a dosage of 132 and 264 g a.i. ha -1 herbicides were applied one week before planting. Peppers and nightshade plants were mechanically inoculated at 4-6 leaf stages with ObPV. Stomp 330 and Fusilade S (a.i. fluazifop-P-butyl) herbicides at 1, 2 (0.33 and 0.66 g a.i. in 100 ml inoculum), and 0.75, 1.5 % (0.093 and 0.187 g a.i. in 100 ml inoculum) concentrations, respectively as postemergent (POST) treatments were mixed to the inoculum instead of buffer. Six replications were applied for each treatments. Inoculated plants were tested for the presence of ObPV on the basis of symptoms and DAS ELISA serological method, five weeks after inoculation. The higher the concentration of viruses in the plant samples, the higher extinction values were measured, therefore from the extinction values one could conclude to the virus concentration. Test samples were considered resistant to virus infection if their extinction values did not exceed two times those of the negative controls. After making this first determination, resistant samples and negative controls were removed from the data set and susceptible plants (i.e. plants with extinction values as high as at least two times those of the negative control samples) were subjected to ANOVA and to multiple comparison tests (Protected Fisher LSD at p=0.05), to asses the effect of herbicide treatments on the virus concentration in hosts as compared to the positive control samples. Preliminary analyses showed that a square root transformation was needed to ensure omoschedasticity. However, this transformation did not change the results of the analysis (in terms of significance of comparisons) and thus the original data are reported. It should also be noted that either excluding or including resistant samples lead to very similar values for the Fisher least significant difference. Regarding that biotest methods permit virus detection at lower concentration as compared to DAS-ELISA tests, in those host-virus relations, where symptoms could not be seen, and on the basis of DAS-ELISA tests samples were resistant to ObPV, back inoculation to N. tabacum ’Xanthi’ and ’Samsun’ as virus indicator plants have been also carried out. Results and discussion On the basis of our experiments three types of the herbicide effects have been observed: 1. herbicide treatments prevented virus infection of susceptible host plants (indicated with bold in Table 1); 2. plants were infected by ObPV, but the virus concentration in them was significantly lower as compared to the positive control (indicated with ithalic in Table 1); 3. herbicide treatments did not influence significantly virus concentration. One week after inoculation with ObPV, systemic mosaic, blistering and leaf deformation symptoms could be observed on all pepper varieties and black nighshade. But in some cases symptoms did not occur at all and low extinction values - not exceeding two times those of the negative control ones at the same time - suggested that plants were not infected by the virus due to the herbicide treatments. This was also</p><p id="Pg483">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1157 confirmed by the results of back inoculation. In 2002, napropamide (2700 g a.i. ha-1) and pendimethalin (132 and 264 g a.i. ha-1) as PPI treatments prevented virus infection of ‘Csipke’ pepper variety. Fluazifop-P-butyl (mixed at 1.5% concentration to the inoculum as post-emergent treatment) also prevented virus infection of ‘Csipke’ and ‘Szentesi’ pepper varieties. In 2003, all herbicide treatments inhibited virus infection of ‘Csipke’ variety. Beside this, fluazifop-P-butyl (mixed at 1.5% concentration to the inoculum as post-emergent treatment) prevented virus infection of S. nigrum. Reduced virus concentration in different host plants due to the herbicide treatments was observed in a lot of cases (Table 1) in both years. Protective effect of herbicides from virus infection was well expressed in ‘Csipke’ pepper variety and S. nigrum hosts. All herbicide treatments - except pendimethalin mixed at 1% concentration to the inoculum as postemergent treatment for S. nigrum in 2003 - prevented virus infection or significantly reduced virus concentration in these hosts in both years (Table 1). S. nigrum as natural host of over 40 viruses may play an important role in virus epidemiology, especially as a primary infection source in vegetables (Kazinczi and Horváth 1998). As our preliminary results show, not only direct, but also indirect harmful effect of S. nigrum may be reduced by herbicide applications. Conclusions It has been concluded that the effect of herbicides on host-virus relations greatly depends on hosts (species, varieties), type of herbicides, mode and dosage of application and year. Some treatments prevented the formation of compatible host-virus relations (e.g. all herbicides prevented virus infection of ’Csipke’ pepper variety in 2003). Other ones (e.g. fluazifop-P-butyl at 0.75% concentration in post treatments) significantly reduced the virus concentration in hosts. The results draw attention to the fact, that certain herbicides may play an important role not only in weed control but they also have inhibitory effect on economically important plant viruses, occurring in horticultural and agricultural ecosystems. Fluazifop-P-butyl gave the best results, regarding the protective effect from viral infection, therefore it could be worth to examine the effect of other fatty acid synthesis inhibitors on host-virus relations. Nevertheless, future examinations are necessary in order to study the beneficial side effect of some herbicides on host-virus relations, e.g. their application possibilities in practice, the mode of action of virus inhibition, possile relationships between herbicide biochemistry and protective effect on viral infection.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1159 THE INFLUENCE OF NITROGEN FERTILIZATION AND SOWING TIME ON THE WEEDINESS OF WINTER WHEAT László FODOR 1 –Ottó PÁLMAI 2 1 Department of Environmental Management and Agronomy, Faculty of Agriculture and Rural Development, Károly Róbert College, 3200 Gyöngyös, Mátrai str. 36., e-mail: lfodor@karolyrobert.hu 2 Agricultural Office of Fejér County, Plant Protection and Soil Conservation Directorate Abstract: The trial included 3 planting date treatments (early, optimum and late) and 2 nitrogen rate treatments (56 kg N ha -1 and 110 kg N ha -1 ) in spring top-dressing application. The influence of treatments on the weed infestation and crop plant vs. weed competition was studied at beginning of steam extension (twonode stage) and after harvest on the stubble-field. The competitiveness of weeds and crop plants were evaluated by biomass production and also by nutrient content of plant samples. Biomass forming of weeds in wheat canopy was negligible compared to that of weeds, but it was strong on the stubble. Delayed planting leaded to poorer wheat growth and better weed biomass production. The higher rate of nitrogen resulted in a less weediness on early and optimum time seeded plots, but the tendency was opposite in the late seeded treatment. Keywords: winter wheat, seeding date, nitrogen supply, weeds, biomass production, competition Introduction Weeds are very competitive with winter wheat because they compete with the crop throughout much or all of the growing season. Yield losses at middle or strong weediness can achieve more than 30 %. Wheat competes well with weeds, only if good production techniques result in an initial uniform stand establishment and when loss of stand due to winter injury is minimal. A good stand of vigorously growing winter wheat will have fewer weeds than a thin stand (Szabó et al. 2005). To have a competitive stand it is important to plant winter wheat during the optimum planting time. In Hungary the optimum seeding period is October 10 to 20 (Ivány et al. 1994). Early planting promotes weed competition because it allows the entire winter weed seed bank in the soil to potentially emerge and compete with the wheat crop. Winter wheat seeded too late may not tiller enough to suppress weeds in the spring and yield may be reduced. A good fertilizer program based on soil tests and appropriate application timing will increase the vigour and competitiveness of the winter wheat crop. It was published by Lehoczky et al. (2005) and Kismányoky - Lehoczky (2007) that increasing nitrogen doses resulted in increased biomass formation both of wheat and weeds, but weeds biomass production was infinitesimal compared to that of winter wheat. Jolánkai et al. (2007) reported that fertilizer application influenced both the biomass production as well as the composition of weed species. A split spring application program may be a benefit for better wheat competitiveness to weeds. In this case applications should be made after initial green-up and before the second visible node on the stem (Jolánkai et al. 2005, Kassai et al. 2006). The effects, interactions, and relationships of seeding time and nitrogen fertilization to weediness of winter wheat are discussed in this paper. Materials and methods The small-plot trial was set up in fall of 2005 at the experimental field of the Plant Protection and Soil Conservation Station of Fejér County on a calcareous Chernozem</p><p id="Pg486">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1160 soil. The main characteristics of the soil are as follows: pH(KCl) 7.1, KA 40, CaCO3 12%, humus 3.24%, salt 0.05%. Plot sizes were 2.5 x 10 m each. Plots were arranged in random block and in 4 replicates. In the crop rotation spring barley was the precrop of winter wheat. No fertilizer was applied in the fall. After seedbed preparation “Mv Suba” variety was planted on each plot at a seeding rate of 280 kg ha-1, that resulted in about 5.5-6 million seedlings per ha. Three different seeding dates were used in the experiment: (1) October 4, 2005; (2) October 13, 2005 and (3) October 24, 2005. Effect of two doses of spring applied top-dress nitrogen was investigated on the weediness of winter wheat at each seeding date: (N1) 56 kg N ha-1 and (N2) 110 kg N ha-1. First time (April 25, 2006) the total area of each plot was treated with nitrogen in form of “Nitosol” (28 % urea-ammonium nitrate solutions), 200 l ha-1. Two days later (April 27, 2006), half area of all plots were treated once more with “MAS” (27 % ammonium nitrate + lime), 200 kg ha-1. Treatments were conducted in eight replications. No herbicides were applied in the experiment. The influence of seeding time and nitrogen supply treatments on the weed infestation and crop plant vs. weed competition was evaluated in two weeks after the first nitrogen application (May 9, 2006), at beginning of steam extension (BBCH 32-33, two visible nodes on the steam) and after harvest on the stubble-field (September 1, 2006). Weed species were separately collected from 1 m2 sampling area of each plot and at the same time winter wheat plant samples were also taken from 1 meter per plot. Aerial parts of plants were collected. Plant samples were dried and the weight of air-dried phytomass was measured. Results and discussion The results of weed abundance analysis already have been published (Reisinger - Pálmai 2007). The air dried phytomass weights of weeds in different treatments are presented in figure 1. Figure 1.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1161 The less weed biomass production was found in wheat stands that were planted during the optimum planting time (October 13). On this optimum seeded plots higher nitrogen level (N2) resulted in the lowest weed infestation. The difference between the influences of the two nitrogen treatments on weediness was 29%. This tendency was also observed on early seeded plots and the difference was more significant (54%). On late seeded plots the double nitrogen application (N2) promoted weed competition because it increased weed phytomass forming by about 18%. Among the weed species were found on the experimental plots, biomass production of Lamium amplexicaule, Veronica hederifolia and Gallium aparine was more considerable. Biomass forming of winter wheat was approximately the same both at early and optimal seeding time treatments and no significant difference could be found among the two nitrogen treatments eider (figure 2). It is notable, that the late planting resulted in a considerable loss in biomass production of wheat plats. Air-dried weights of wheat shoot samples collected from the late seeded plots were less by about 35% compared to wheat samples grown on the two earlier planted treatments. A competitive crop utilizes resources – including nutrients and water - before they are available to the weeds. The less competitiveness of late planted wheat could be verified by the more intensive nutrient (NPK) uptake of weeds that were grown on plots of this treatment. This was detectable in case of both nitrogen application rates. Figure 2. Effect of seeding dates and nitrogen rates on the biomass production of winter wheat (May 9, 2007) The stubble was characterized by increased weed abundance (32-38%). Population of late summer annual weeds (T4) was extremely high (Chenopodium sp., Panicum miliaceum, Ambrosia artemisifolia), besides the perennial Sorgum halepens (G1) also had a significant abundance on the field. Biomass production of weed samples is presented in figure 3. The largest weed-biomass production was proved on early seeded plots and at double nitrogen rate. Dry weight of collected weed phytomass (150 g m-2) was approximately as much as other treatments (80-108 g m-2). 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 N1 N2 N1 N2 N1 N2 Seeding date 1 Seeding date 2 Seeding date 3 D ry w e ig h t o f w h e a t b io m a s s ( g m -2 )</p><p id="Pg488">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Effect of treatments on the biomass production of weeds on the stubble (September 1, 2007) Conclusions Increased weed biomass production on early seeded plots can be interpreted with favorable weather conditions for germination and strong growth of seedlings. The higher rate of nitrogen top-dressing helps the competition of early and optimum time seeded wheat, thus it leads to less weediness. On the other hand, the higher rate of nitrogen application resulted in a more significant weediness on the late seeded plots. Biomass forming of weeds during the vegetation period was negligible compared to that of weeds, but it was strong on the stubble.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1163 TEST OF DIFFERENT FERTILZATION RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS IN ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS OF THE NORTHHUNGARIAN REGION Erika FODORNÉ FEHÉR 1 – László FODOR 2 – Réka LÁPOSI 2 1 Mátra Secondary Technical School, Mátrafüred, e-mail: hanga5@vipmail.hu 2 Department of Environmental Management and Agronomy, Károly Róbert College, Gyöngyös Abstract: Sponsored by Nitrogenművek Zrt and professionally coordinated by RISSAC-HAS, a research program started in 2006 in the North-Hungarian Region to initiate recommendations of an environmental friendly fertilization system into the crop production technologies. Field trials were set up in three experimental sites of Károly Róbert College (Gyöngyös, Kompolt, Putnok) characterized by different ecological conditions. First year spring barley and maize were the test crops. Experimental data verified that environmental friendly fertilizer use is based on soil test and takes nutrient demands of crops into consideration. Recommended NPK rates were less by 30-60 % on balanced and 20-50 % on integrated level of nutrient supply, compared to the general use doses. Reasonable fertilizer use resulted in no significant grain yield loss. Keywords: soil, nutrient supply, fertilizer recommendation, ecological condition, crop yields Introduction Plants need balanced nutrition for normal growth and good health. Crops that grow in a good quality soil and have balanced nutrient supply yield better, because nutrient balance results in increased nutrient and water use efficiency by plants. When nitrogen is balanced with phosphorus and potassium crop yields increase and so does nitrogen use efficiency. That means more nitrogen is used by the crops and les left in the soil as a potential pollutant (Fodor et al, 2001, Cruse et al. 2004, Németh 2006, Kádár 2007). Both surface water and groundwater supply is limited in the world. People must have clean water to drink, but they must also have food to eat. Thus, each production method, which can do to increase nutrient and water efficiency, is good tool for sustainable agriculture (Várallyay 2006). Improved soil is also an important part of environment protection through the built-up of increased crop biomass and organic matter. Well developed and vigorous crop stand and extra surface residue left on the field after harvest protect the soil against rainfall and wind, thus reducing the potential for erosion (Eleki et al. 2005). Organic and inorganic fertilizers are used to maintain and increase soil fertility. In field crop production commercially produced inorganic fertilizers are more manageable than organic sources. Their impact on both crop and environment can be controlled through proper selection of rates, sources, placement and timing. Through careful management, it is possible to supply nutrients close levels and time of crop needs for best economic and environmental efficiency (Cruse et al. 2001, Fodor et al. 2002, Izsáki 2007). Depending targets of crop production, farmers can chose recommendations of different fertilization advisory systems in Hungary. For example aims of the intensive fertilization advisory system (“MÉM NAK”) are to have maximum yield and to get and maintain good – very good PK-supply in the soil, while the environment friendly fertilizer recommendation system (“RISSAC – RIA”) strives for economic yield and medium-good PK-supply (Csathó et al. 2007). The aim of this work is to test recommendations of the “RISSAC-RIA” cost-saving and environmental friendly system in ecological condition of the North-Hungarian Region.</p><p id="Pg490">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1164 Materials and methods The cost-saving and environmental friendly fertilization use advisory system was developed in cooperation of Research Institute for Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry (RISSAC) and Research Institute of Agriculture (RIA) (Csathó et. al 2007). Test of land specific use of this advisory system was started in 2006 in different parts of the North-Hungarian Region. Three experimental sites of Károly Róbert College (Gyöngyös, Kompolt and Putnok) were involved in this research project, representing characteristic soil types (chernozem brown forest soil, brown forest clay soil) and ecological conditions of the region. Data of soil tests and precipitation in the vegetation period are presented in table 1 and 2. Table 1.

Besides the control, effects of three different NPK fertilization levels on the growing and yield formation of crops were examined in the experiments. Treatments were as follows: (1) control, (2) generally used rates in the region, (3) balanced nutrition level and (4) integrated nutrition level. We used “Genezis” (trade mark) fertilizers for treatments. Plot sizes were 85-90 m2. Plots were arranged in random block in 4 replications. The experimental fields were cultivated with commonly used agrotechnics. Plant characteristics were evaluated during the growing season and grain yield was measured at harvest. Results and discussion NPK rates, which were recommended in different treatments as well as harvested spring barley and maize grain yields are presented in table 3. Lack of precipitation after the seeding period resulted in a poor germination and defective spring barley stand both in the Gyöngyös and Kompolt experiment. Poor barley stand and lack of plant vigour resulted in less than 2 t ha-1 grain yield in each treatment. General used fertilizer rates are 90-120 kg NPK ha-1 in the region, applied as basic fertilizer before planting of barley. This represented the “general used” treatment in the experiment.</p><p id="Pg491">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1165</p><p id="Pg492">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1166 Only nitrogen application was recommended in the “balanced level” treatments because of good- very good phosphorus and potassium supply in the soil at each experimental site. No potassium use was also recommended in the integrated system. Compared to the general used NPK rates, use of nutrients in inorganic form was less by 30-60 % on balanced and 20-50 % on integrated level without any grain yield loss. In Gyöngyös and Putnok experiment the balanced nutrient level provided the highest yield. Maize needs more nutrients for yield formation than cereals. Growers generally use about 100 kg N and 100kg PK per ha. Compared to this, the recommended rates are less by 10-30 % at balanced fertilizer supply, but the integrated nutrient supply needs 30-50 % more N fertilizer. The increased fertilization resulted in no significant extra yield. The recommendation of balanced nutrient use system seems to be the most economic in corn production. Conclusions Results of this study prove benefits of balanced nutrient use system compared to other fertilizer use methods. Crops produce adequate yield in addition to use of 30-60% lower NPK rates. Because of less fertilizer use, this nutrient management practice makes crop production more economic and an added bonus is increased environmental protection.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1167 THE EFFECT OF PLANT CULTURE ON THE SOIL BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY IN AN ECOLOGICAL FARMING SYSTEM Ágnes OLÁH ZSUPOSNÉ - Edina VERES, LUKÁCSNÉ –Magdolna TÁLLAI Department of Agricultural Chemistry and Soil Science, Faculty of Agriculture University of Debrecen, Centre for Agricultural Sciences and Engineering 4032 Debrecen Böszörményi u. 138. zsuposne@agr.unideb.hu verese@agr.unideb.hu Abstract: In this paper the effect of plant culture, the pre-culture, the nitrogen supply and the liming were examined on the pH and different carbon-form (organic-C, biomass-C, and the ratio of biomass-C/organic-C) in an ecological farming system on chernozem. The favourite effect of liming on pH was measured especially in the third year after liming. The pea/sweet maize crop-rotation had positive effect on the organic carbon content of soil. Correlation analyzes among the results were made and there were no close correlation among the results, even though the changes in the organic-C succeeded the changes in the biomass-C content of soil. Keywords: ecological farming, biological activity of soil, organic-C, biomass-C Introduction Soils are conditionally renewable natural resources. Keeping or increasing their sustainable multifunctionality is very important; it can be measure in different ways, e.g. proper agrotechnics tillage, fertilization, etc (Várallyay, 2006, 2007). The soil is the natural environment of micro-organisms; they need favourable physical and chemical conditions for function (Lynch, 1983). The microbial biomass and its activity are important indicators of changes in content and vertical distribution of the organic matter in a soil profile. The microbial biomass is the living fraction of organic matter; it has been suggested as a useful and sensitive measurement of the change in organic matter status. The microbial biomass normally comprises only 1-5% of the total organic C. (Sparling, 1992). The biomass-C/total organic C ratio is an indicator of the availability of soil organic matter to microorganisms (Anderson et al, 1989). In surface horizons biomass-C/total organic C ratio  1.0 indicate usually a disturbed turnover of soil organic matter (Meyer et al., 1996). In agricultural soils 200-1000 μg biomass-C g-1 soil is often found. The organics cell mass fixes 100-600 kg N and 50-300 kg P per hectare in the upper 30cm of soils. These amounts often exceed the annual application of nutrients supplied as fertilizer to soils in agricultural practice. The liberation or fixation of these nutrients depends on the life dynamics of the microorganisms. Growth of biomass and fixation of nutrients is promoted by rhizodeposits and plant debris and the liberation of nutrients is the consequence of microbial death (Martens, 1995). The intensive farming system of the last decades had an unfavourable effect on the number and diversity of micro-organisms living in the soil the soil biological activity so on the quantity and quality of yield. The activity and accordance with it the fertility of soil are influenced by several anthropogenic factors. Kátai (2006) stated that the number of soil bacteria and activity of some soil enzymes was significantly higher in triculture, than monoculture. Sándor (2006) measured the negative effects of some herbicides on total bacteria and microscopic fungi. The specialists turn their attention to the biological farming system as the protective methods of farming on the yield and soil life.</p><p id="Pg494">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1168 Materials and methods The experiment was carried out in an ecological farming system on calcareous chernozem soil (according to WRB: Calcic Endofluvic Chernozem) in the Experimental Station of the DU, in Látókép. In the experiment fertilizer isn’t used, only the Ncompensation is supplied with Biofert containing 6% N ingredient. The pH of Biofert is low, (pH=3-4) the site was amended in 2002 by 0 (1., 4. sample), 2 (2., 5. sample), 10 (3., 6. sample) t ha-1 beet potash (table 1.), the CaCO3-content of beet potash was 31,5%. Soil samples were taken in two years, two times in every year in the upper 20-cm layer. Table 1. contains the cultures, the pre-cultures and the doses of Biofert in 2005.

Filep, (1995) and the quantity of organic-C was counted from humus content. The measurement of microbial biomass-C was taken with fumigation-incubation method (CFI) according to Jenkinson et al. (1976) and fumigation-extraction method (CFE) by Vance et al. (1987). (The fumigationincubation method is the basic technique which is also used for calibration of the three other methods. It is characterized by simple performance without the need of expensive equipment. Its application is limited to soils with a pH above 5 and to soils that do not contain easily degradable C sources. If these limitations are not considered, too low or even negative biomass values will be obtained.) The measurement was taken in fresh soil samples in four repetitions, the results were evaluated statistically by Microsoft Excel program and the significance was studied at 5; 1; and 0,1%-level. Results and discussion The pH-of soils were slightly acidic. The pH of soils amended was statistically higher in several samples (table 2.) The favourite effect of liming on pH was measured especially in the third year after liming. The organic C-content was between 1,11-1,83%. The pea/sweet maize crop-rotation had positive effect on the organic carbon content of soil. The effectiveness of liming on the biomass-carbon couldn’t be proved neither in fumigation-incubation, nor fumigation–extraction methods. Table 2.

The pre–culture had no significant difference on the organic-C content of the soil. To compare the two methods for measuring the biomass-carbon, the ratio of biomass-C extraction/biomass-C incubation was between 0,78-1,74; while the results measured by the fumigation-extraction methods were higher in 1,13 times than the result by fumigation-incubation.

János KÁTAI––Zsolt SÁNDOR–– Magdolna TÁLLAI University of Debrecen, Centre for Agricultural Sciences and Engineering, Department of Agrochemistry and Soil Science Abstract: In a pot experiment, we have studied the effect of an organic manure, Bactofil ® A10 and an artificial fertilizer with Ca(NO3)2 content on two different soil types (humus sandy, calcareous chernozem). Rye-grass was used as a test plant (Lolium perenne L.). Both treatments satisfied the nutrient requirement of the test plant. The Bactofil treatments had a favourable effect on the total number of bacteria and the number of nitrifying bacteria in both soils and on the biomass N content of the humus sandy soil. The enzyme activity of urease was increased in both soil types by the Ca(NO3)2 treatment. The amount of plant biomass increased as a result of the treatments. In the statistical evaluation, relationships were found between the changes in the soil parameters due to the treatments and the amount of plant biomass. Keywords: organic manure Bactofil ® A10, Ca(NO3)2 artificial fertilizer, nutrient content, microbial parameters of soils, biomass of the test plant Introduction A basic pillar of sustainable development is to utilize soils as natural resources in a rational way and to maintain their diverse functions (Várallyay, 2005). One of the oldest fertilization methods is the application of manure; its favourable effects on the nutrient stock and microbial activity of the soil were verified by numerous researchers (Herac Custic et al., 2007; Kádár et al., 2007; Veres &amp; Oláh, 2006). Later, the application of manure was supplemented (in some places replaced by) with artificial fertilizers (Izsáki, 2006; Vida et al., 2007), which has favourable (Kátai, 2006) and unfavourable effects (Németh, 1996). Nowadays, the application of organic products for fertilization is increasing, via this the environmental load can be reduced and soil fertility can be improved and it can contribute to the activation of the natural microbe population of the soil (Biró, 2007; Redžepovič, et al, 2007; Kincses et al., 2007; Balla Kovács et al.,2007). In our experiment, we have studied the effect of an organic manure, Bactofil® A10 and an artificial fertilizer with Ca(NO3)2 content on some soil parameters and the biomass of the test plant, rye-grass (Lolium perenne L.) on two different soil types. Materials and methods The pot experiment was set up at the Department of Agrochemistry and Soil Science, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Debrecen in 2007 on two soil types [humus sandy soil (pH(H2O) 5.55) and calcareous chernozem soil (pH(H2O) 6.94)]. Rye-grass (Lolium perenne L.) was used as a test plant. Samplings were done in the fourth and eight weeks of the experiment. The laboratory examinations were carried out in the soil chemistry and soil microbiology laboratory of the Department. As a base treatment, 100 mg P2O5 and 100 mg K2O were applied to each pot in the form of a joint solution of potassiumdihydrogen-phosphate, potassium-sulphate. The applied treatments are included in Table 1. The nitrate-N content of the soil, the degree of nitrate mobilization (Felföldy, 1987) and the soluble phosphorus and potassium contents were measured (Gerei, 1970).</p><p id="Pg498">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1172 We measured the total number of bacteria (Szegi, 1979), the number of nitrifying bacteria (Pochon et al., 1962), the biomass-N production of these soil (Jenkinson et al.,1976), and the activity of the urease enzyme (Kempers cit.Filep., 1995). The biomass amount of the test plant was measured. Statistical evaluation was done using the program SPSS 13.0. Results and discussion In humus sandy soil, both the artificial fertilizer and the Bactofil treatments increased the readily available nutrient content (Table 1.). The nitrate-N content and nitrate exploration were significantly increased by both treatments. Regarding the readily available phosphorus and potassium content, the humus sandy soil was “well-supplied”. An increment was found in both values in both treatments, Bactofil treatments increased both parameters significantly, while the artificial fertilizer treatment significantly increased the potassium content of the soil. In the calcareous chernozem soil the artificial fertilization significantly and non-significantly increased the nitrate-N content and nitrate exploration, respectively. The Bactofil treatment resulted in a significant reduction of both parameters. Regarding the phosphorus and potassium supply, the calcareous chernozem soil was classified as “properly supplied” and “well-supplied”. The phosphorus content was increased by both treatments (significantly by Bactofil). In the case of potassium content, the Ca(NO3)2 treatment resulted in a significant reduction, while Bactofil increased it. Table 1. Treatments and their effect on the readily available nutrient content and nitrate exploration of soils (average values of 2007) Among the soil microbial parameters (Table 2.), we measured the total number of bacteria. It increased significantly in both soil types with higher values in the Bactofil treatments. The number of nitrifying bacteria was significantly increased by Bactofil treatments, though both treatments resulted in an increment. The biomass-N content of soils was significantly increased by Bactofil in the sandy soil, while a non-significant increment was obtained in the chernozem soil in the artificial fertilizer treatment. As a result of the Bactofil treatment, the biomass-N content was lower than that of the control. The urease activity was significantly increased in the Ca(NO3)2 treatment in both soils. Bactofil treatments reduced, though not significantly, the urease activity.

The effect of treatments on some soil microbial parameters (average values of 2007) In the experiment, we determined the biomass of the test plant, rye-grass (Lolium perenne L.) in the different treatments (Figure 1). In humus sandy soil, the plant biomass content ranged between 6.25 and 6.99 g kg-1 pot. Both treatments (Bactofil significantly) increased the plant biomass. In calcareous chernozem soil the plant biomass of rye-grass varied between wider limits – 8.78-10.38 g kg-1 pot. Both treatments significantly increased the amount of plant biomass. In both soils, the bacterium fertilizer treatments were more effective in both soils regarding the amount of plant biomass. 0,00 5,00 10,00 15,00 1 2 3 1: Control 2: 100 mg kg-1 N 3: *BactofilA10 d ry m a tt e r g k g 1 p o t Humus sandy soil SD5%=0,52 Calcareous chernozem soil SD5%=1,04 Figure 1.

As a result of artificial fertilization in humus sandy soil, we found tight correlations between the changes in the amount of nitrifying bacteria (r2=0.98) and biomass-N content (r2=0.98) and plant biomass. A tight positive correlation was found between biomass-N content and plant biomass (r2=0.93) in the Bactofil treatment and on calcareous chernozem soil in the artificial fertilizer treatment, between the total number of bacteria (r2=0.98) and changes in the number of nitrifying bacteria (r2=0.88) and plant biomass.

Conclusions Both treatments proved to be effective in the nutrient mobilization processes. Regarding the microbial parameters of the soil, higher values were obtained in the Bactofil treatment for the total number of bacteria and the number of nitrifying bacteria in both soils and for the biomass-N content in humus sandy soil. The activity of urease was significantly increased by the Ca(NO3)2 treatment. The biomass of the test plant increased as a result of the treatments.

While the effect of herbicides was negative an the total bacterim number and on the aerobic cellulose decomposing bacteria, the CO2-production and the microbial biomass-C was’t decreased, and what is more increased. Keywords: herbicide, soil microbes, C-cycle, maize monoculture, CO2-production Introduction The yield of maize are influenced not only the seeding year, but the different agrotechnical methods (Nagy 2006) especially the fertilizers (Kincses 2002, Vágó 2004.) and the plant protection. The herbicides applied effect the weeds (Jolánkai et. al 2006), but beside it they effect the organisms living in the soil. The effect of herbicides on the soil microorganisms can be impediment, so they could influence direct the degradational processes in the soil, unfavourable microbiological processes, decreasing organic matter (Várallyay 2006, 2007). Angerer et. al (2007a, 2007b) examined the effect a „new generation” herbicide , it is a chlorsulfon-content Glean, on the quanitiy of some microba groups. The quantity of microbial-biomass could be important because of the characterization of the soil state, its quantity are measured by the fumigation and incubation methods with chloroform (Szili-Kovács et. al 2006, 2007). In the carboncycle the quantity of cellulose decomposing bacteria also an important parameter (Zsuposné Oláh 2007). Materials and methods The small plot experiment was set up at the experimental site of UD CAS FA Department of Plant Protection from 2005-2007 on calcareous chernozem soil, [according to World Reference Base for Soil Resources 2006: Calcic Endofluvic Chernozem (Endosceletic)]. Soil samples were collected two times during the vegetation period from the different treatments. Samples were analysed in the laboratory of the UD CAS FA Department of Agrochemistry and Soil Science. In the experiment, the effects of four herbicides used in maize (Acenit A 880 EC – with a 80% acethochlor content –, Frontier 900 EC – with a 90% dimethenamid content –, Merlin 480 SC – 48% izoxaflutol –, Wing EC –25% dimethenamid + 25% pendimethalin –) were studied on some parameters of C-cycle. For determining the number of soil microorganisms, the total number of germs (on Bouillon soup agar) was determined from soil-water suspension by the plate dilution method, while the number of cellulose-decomposing bacteria was determined according to Pochon (1962). The CO2-production was measured Witkamp (1966, cit Szegi, 1979), the microbial biomass was measured by chloroform fumigation-extraction method according to the method Brookes (1985).</p><p id="Pg502">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

According to the view of sustainable agriculture, those microbes are examined in the soil life, that play important role in the plant nutrition and they are also important in sawing plant nutrients in the soil. To the effect of herbicides on the soil life could be deduce from the ability of stress-suffering and quantity of microorganisms. The sensibility against the herbicides of microbiological parameters examined - similar to the dates of literature- very different (Kapur el al 1981).

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1177 The quantity of cellulose decomposing bacteria is an important factor in the point of view of C-cycle, from this number to the mineralization of cellulose-content plan residue could be deduced. In case of Acenit and Wing, in accordance with the increasing dose of herbicides mentioned decreased total number of bacteria. In the Table 2b. the quantity change of cellulose decomposing bacteria could be seen. The number of cellulose decomposing bacteria decreased by the effect of herbicides compared to the control in every three year, the results were unambiguous. The effect of every three doses of Wing was the most unfavourable on the cellulose decomposing bacteria. Regarding to Acenit, in accordance with the increasing dose of herbicide mentioned decreased the number of cellulose decomposing bacteria. In the soil the organic materials go throw mineralization processes and at the end CO2, water and different nutrients accur. The respiration of soil refer to the intensity of mineralization. The Table 3a shows these results of the CO2-production. To compare the average results of the three years it can be stated that CO2-production in the different treatments were at the level of control, or abowe the results of control. It means that the inhibited effects of herbicibed applied were not experienced. The quantity of microbial biomass-C refer to the fixed organic carbon by the microbes, and the intensity of soil microbiological activity. According to our results, the biomass carbon -measured by CFI methods –increased compared to the control, overall majority the results were significant. Table 3b.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1179 THE EFFECT OF BENTONITE ON SOIL CHARACTERISTICS AND ON BIOMASS OF THE TESTPLANT IN A SMALL-POT EXPERIMENT Magdolna TÁLLAI1––Andrea BALLA KOVÁCS1––Péter Tamás NAGY1––János KÁTAI1 1 University of Debrecen, Centre for Agricultural Sciences and Engineering, Department of Agrochemistry and Soil Science Abstract: We have studied the effect of the different dosages of bentonite, in addition to basic treatments, on acidic sandy soil. Our test plant was rye-grass (Lolium perenne L.). Both regarding the changes in the soil nutrient content and microbial activity, small and medium dosages proved to be the most effective. The highest plant biomass was obtained in the medium dosage treatment. In the statistical evaluation we verified a relationship between the studied soil characteristics and the amount of plant biomass. Keywords: bentonite, nutrient content, microbial activity of soil, biomass of the test plant Introduction Regarding soil amelioration and appropriate fertilization, special attention should be paid to those soils which respond sensitively to environmental changes due to their unfavourable characteristics. Such soils include sandy soils with unfavourable water management, aeration and nutrient management. Manure and green manure are among the oldest methods used for enriching the inorganic and organic colloid content of these soils and for improving their water- and nutrient management (Blaskó, 2005). Later, with intensive crop production, the application of artificial fertilizers started, where nowadays the main aim is the environmentally-safe and cost-effective application (Csathó et al., 2007). For this purpose, there is significant research going on regarding the application of different dosages in different soil-plant systems (Németh, 2006; Balikó &amp; Sárdi 2007; Blazenka et al., 2007; Gáspár et al., 2007; Izsáki, 2007; Vágó et al., 2007). Finally, the application of natural substances, such as alginite (Solti, 1987), zeolite (Köhler, 2000), or bentonite (Makádi et al., 2007) for soil improvement was started in the last years to meet the requirements of sustainable production. In our pot experiment on sandy soil, we studied the effect of different dosages of bentonite on some chemical and microbial properties of the soil and the biomass of the test plant, rye-grass (Lolium perenne L.). Materials and methods The pot experiment was set up on humus sandy soil (pH(H2O) 5.65). In 2007 at the Department of Agrochemistry and Soil Science, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Debrecen. Rye-grass (Lolium perenne L.) was applied as a test plant. Samples were collected in the fourth and eigth week of the experiment. The laboratory examinations were carried out in soil chemistry and soil microbiology lab of the Department. As a base treatment 100 mg P2O5 and 100 mg K2O was applied to each pot in the form of a joint solution of potassium-dihydrogen-phosphate, potassium-sulphate. The applied treatments are included in Table 1. The nitrate-N content of the soil, the degree of nitrate mobilization (Felföldy, 1987) and the soluble phosphorus and potassium contents were measured (Gerei, 1970). Among the microbial parameters, we measured the total number of bacteria (Szegi, 1979), the number of cellulose-decomposing bacteria</p><p id="Pg506">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1180 (Pochon &amp; Tardieux, 1962), the CO2 production of the soil (Witkamp cit. Szegi, 1979), biomass-C production (Jenkinson et al.,1976), and the activity of the saccharase enzyme (Bertrand cit. Szegi, 1979). The biomass amount of the test plant was measured. Statistical evaluation was done using the program SPSS 13.0. Results and discussion Regarding the readily available nutrient content (Table 1), the nitrate-N content of the soil significantly increased as a result of treatments 2 and 3, however, it was lower than that of the control in the treatments with the two highest dosages. The degree of nitrate mobilization increased significantly, except for the highest dosage treatment, the highest values were obtained in treatment 4. Regarding the readily available phosphorus and potassium content, the soil belonged to the category of ”well-supplied”. Regarding the phosphorus content, treatments 2 and 3 were the most effective, as a result of these, P content increased significantly. The two highest dosages reduced phosphorus content (it was significant in treatment 5). The AL-soluble potassium content was the highest in treatment 2, but it increased significantly also in treatments 3 and 4. A non-significant increase was measured also in the treatment with the highest dosage. Table 1. The effect of bentonite treatments on the readily available nutrient content of the soil and on nitrate exploration (average values of 2007) Among soil microbial parameters (Table 2) we studied the total number of bacteria. For this parameter, a non-significant increment was observed already in treatment 2. The two medium dosages (treatments 3 and 4) significantly increased this value. The highest dosage reduced the total number of bacteria to the level of the control. For the cellulosedecomposing bacteria, the highest number was measured in treatment 3 (four times higher than that of the control and a significant increase was observed already in treatment 2. As a result of treatment 4, the number of bacteria was somewhat higher but around the value of the control. The highest dosage resulted in a (non-significant) reduction. The CO2 production of the soil showed a significant increment in the low- dosage treatments, the highest values were measured in treatment 2. Treatments 4 and 5 reduced soil respiration, the highest dosage resulted in a significant reduction. The biomass C content of the sandy soil was significantly increased by treatments 2 and 3. Treatments 4 and 5 reduced this value to the level of the control treatment. Finally, the activity of the saccharase enzyme was measured which was 2.5 times higher in the lowdosage treatments as compared to that of the control.

The effect of treatments on some soil microbial parameters (average values of 2007) Measurements were made regarding the biomass of the test plant, rye-grass (Lolium perenne L.) – in relation to the applied treatments (Figure 1.). In the average of two samplings, the amount of plant biomass ranged between 7.13-8.50 g kg pot-1. As compared to the control a non-significant and significant increase was measured in treatment 2 and treatments 3 and 4, respectively. Treatment 3 with the highest measured values proved to be the most effective. As a result of treatment 5, a significant reduction was observed and the values were lower than those of the control. 0,00 2,00 4,00 6,00 8,00 10,00 1 2 3 4 5 Treatments d ry m at te r g k g1 p o t First sampling date Second sampling date Figure 1.

Here, we mention the medium and tight correlations. Regarding the nutrient content of the soil, a medium correlation was found between nitrate-N content and the readily available potassium content (r=0.679). A medium correlation was found also between nitrate-N content of the soil and the total number of bacteria (r=0.667).

Conclusions As a result of the bentonite treatments, the readily available nutrient content of the soil increased, the most effective dosages were the low and medium dosages. The high dosage reduced the nutrient content of the soil, except for potassium content. Regarding the microbial activity of sandy soil, the most effective dosage was the medium dosage for inducing the total number of bacteria, the number of cellulosedecomposing bacteria, the activity of saccharase, while for biomass C and CO2 production, the low dosage proved to be effective. The amount of plant biomass was the highest in the medium-dosage treatment. In the correlation analysis, we found relationships between the studied soil parameters and the amount of plant biomass.

Abstract: In this paper the effects of 10 nutrient treatments on different yield components of winter wheat have been investigated. The research was established in 3 growing seasons (2003/2004, 2005/2006, 2006/2007), with 2 winter wheat cultivars (GK Kalász, GK Petur), in 4 repeats, on 20 squaremeter random layout plots. We can diagnose that the PK and the NPK treatments significantly extended the number of shoots, the number of ears, the number of spikelets and the weight of grain per area unit, but we couldn’t find a significant difference in each yield component in the effect of N treatments. Keywords: winter wheat, fertilization, nitrogene, phosphorous, potassium, yield components Introduction The research on the nutrient treatment of the winter wheat is versatile and extensive in Hungary. Matuz et al (2007), Tanács (2007) and Tanács et al (2006) examined the effects of fertilisers and fungicide treatments on the quality, while Jolánkai et al (2006) on the quantity of the crop. Pepó (2006) proved that significant differences can be indicated among the fertiliser needs, utilisation and reaction of the winter wheat cultivars. Löhnhartné et al (2005) concluded that the nutrient treatment profoundly influenced the quantitative metrics of the spikes (length of spike, weight of spike, number of grain spike). On the other hand Harmati (1987) does not attribute the larger proportion of the crop surplus caused by fertilisers to the quantitative parameters of the spikes but to the productive tiller (increase in the number of spikes). A lot of research is to be found in the scholarly literature concerning the agrotechnological investigation of winter wheat, which provide detailed analysis about the effect of particular treatments on yield, or on some crop components. However, crop quantity is only an end product of wheat development, which fails to shed light upon the ways particular treatments affect the development of the plant, and cannot reveal how these components contribute to future improvements. Because of these reasons, we studied, with the help of yield components, the effects different proportions and doses of nutriant treatments have on the development of winter wheat. We employed Sváb's cumulative development analysis (Sváb 1961) for our investigations. Crop elements in a cumulative crop analysis: A=number of seed m-2, B= number of stem m-2, C= number of ear m-2, D= number of spikelet m-2, E= number of grain m-2, F= grain yield m-2. Cumulative crop analysis provides a method for the graphical representation of the stand's development, where the horizontal axis (x) shows the crop components in the order of development, with reference to area unit (development phase-end products), and the vertical axis (y) shows the percentage of the crop components, with reference to the basis of comparison.</p><p id="Pg510">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1184 Materials and methods We made our fertilizing experiment with two breeds of winter wheat (GK Kalász, GK Petur) at the experimental fields of the Cereal Research Non Profit Co. in Fülöpszállás, Hungary, in 3 growing seasons (2003/2004, 2005/2006, 2006/2007), with 2 winter wheat cultivars, in 4 repeats, on 20 squaremetres random layout plots. We selected 10 typical treatments out of the 16 fertilizer treatments from the 25 years long duration experiment. (Table 1) Table 1. In the experiment used data of fertilizer treatments N P2O5 K2O Number of treatment kg ha -1 active substance 1. 0 0 0 2. 0 30 30 3. 0 60 60 4. 0 90 90 5. 30 0 0 6. 60 0 0 7. 90 0 0 8. 60 30 30 9. 120 60 60 10. 180 90 90 The green crop for the experiment was closed. Each year plots were sowed in midOctober, with a sowing density of 500 seeds m-2. We unearthed developed plants on a given unit (0,25 fm) from the outer (1.) and inner (4.) lines for the examination of crop components. We collected samples right before the harvest of the plots, in the time of the plants' full maturity. We determined the number of shoots, the number of ears, the number of spikelets and grains having developed in the ears and the grain weight. The variance analysis of the crop components in the samples was performed with Microsoft Excel software, whereas the graphical illustration of relative development was completed with Sváb's cumulative yield analysis method. Results and discussion Based on the variance analysis of the crop components, we can conclude that PK treatments, and NPK treatments of 2:1:1 ratio differed in a statistically proven way on a 5% level of significance in terms of shoot number, ear number and spikelet number from the values of unfertilised treatments, while no significant effect of the treatment could be proven in case of one-sided N fertilisations (Table 2.). Regarding the values of grain number and grain weight, all fertilisation treatments, except for N30P0K0, differed significantly from the results of untreated plots. 100% represents the crop elements of a control treatment not fertilised for a long time, in the average of examined years. Plants on plots treated with 30, 60 and 90kg ha-1 N agent produced a significantly weaker tiller. Therefore, compared to the unfertilised treatment, the shoot number of a stand treated with one-sided N dosage decreased. The direction of the next lines joining the end phase product demonstrates that, compared to unfertilised treatment, different N dosages all increased the productive tiller, the spikelet per ear number, and the grain per spikelet number as well. Based on the lines running between grain number and grain</p><p id="Pg511">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1185 weight, we can draw the conclusion that one-sided N treatments lead to a decrease in the weight per thousand grains of winter wheat.

Cereal Research Communications 1186 grain per spikelet number worsened. The conclusion of the three-years-long investigation is the following: treating winter wheat with an NPK treatment of 2:1:1 ration (Figure 3.) significantly increases the shoot number, the ear number, the spikelet number, the grain number and the grain weight, as opposed to unfertilised treatments. In the phase of the formulation of shoot number and ear number, we experienced some recoil in the development of winter wheat, which may be attributed to the denser presence of inproductive shoots. Conclusions One-sided N treatment has a depressive effect upon the first phases of the development of winter wheat, however, the rare stand caused by N surplus is later able to compensate the drawback. We can claim that on habitats with originally good N-supplies, one-sided N treatments affected the weight per thousand grains in a negative way, which is contradictory to the claims of Lesznyákné (2001). During our investigations, we found that in the habitats around Fülöpszállás, which are rich in humus, solely PK-treatments could positively affect the development of winter wheat, which justifies the opinion of Harmati and Gyuris (2002). Besides, our experiments also exemplify the importance not only of the quantity of nutrative substances, but also of their interrelations and proper proportions. In case of NPK-treatments of 2:1:1 ratio, not only the addition of the effects of different nutritive substances, but also their strengthened effect upon the development of different winter wheats could be observed through the investigation of end phase products.

Concerning the changes in atmosphere there has been an increase in the periodicity of the occurence of extreme hydrologic events in the past few years. Both periods without rain have lengthened and the occurence of extremely heavy and intense rainfalls increased. These changing parameters of the climatic elements has significant impacts on the soil-water regime and plant production. The aim of this study is to quantify the impact of climatic elements on the soil-water regime. Keywords: climatic elements, aridity index, soil-water regime, numerical simulation Introduction Changing parameters of climatic elements are gradually leaving impact on hydrological processes occurring in the system: atmosphere - vegetation cover - unsaturated zone - ground water (Stekauerová and Nagy, 2007). In the unsaturated zone of soil profile, which serves as water source for biosphere, extreme hydrological events are manifested by the changes of soil-water regime (Stehlová, 2007). Soil moisture often reaches the values under the threshold point, which is exactly when the deficit of water is becoming to be evident and when the state of soil drought is initiated (Várallyay, 2006). For better understanding of the origin, duration and end of drought it is necessary to quantify the interactive relations between the unsaturated zone and climatic elements. The aim of this submission is to quantify the impact of climatic elements on the soilwater regime. Materials and methods The influence of climatic elements on the soil - water regime was investigated in the area of Milhostov, which is situated in the central part of the Eastern Slovakia Lowland (VSN). The research was focused on the analysis of the daily processes of soil-water content and climatic elements, both analysed during the vegetation periods (from April to September) between the years 1970- 2007. The daily development of moisture regime and soil-water content were acquired via numerical simulation using mathematical model GLOBAL. The results of the numerical simulation were verified by applying it on the results of monitoring performed between the years 2001- 2007. After the verification was successfully concluded, the soil-water regime during the period of interest, from 1970-2007, was simulated to the depth of 3 m. The main object of analysis was 1m thick upper layer of the soil profile, which is caracterised by an occurrence of the major part of root zone of the vegetation cover. Besides, this model enabled the calculation of daily development of potential (ET0) and actual (ETa ) evapotranspiration.</p><p id="Pg514">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1188 The database of our analysis comprises the mean daily precipitation (Z), the daily values concerning maximum (Tmax), minimum (Tmin) and average (Tavr) daily temperature, wind velocity, relative humidity and solar radiation. The selection of climatic elements for the needs of analysis was due to their applicability in the quantifying of the evaporation and the potential impacts on the soil-water regime. In the pursuit of this objective, there can be made a heavy use of various coefficients, which usually lead to the values concerning deficit of precipitation and evaporation durind periods of interest. With reference to this particular analysis, there were investigated on a case-by-case basis 9 different climatic coefficients and precipitation amounts. Their impact on the water regime was quantified via value of correlation coefficient between the soil-water contents to the depth of 1m and value of the corresponding climatic coefficient. Results and discussion Comparisons The precipitation amounts and the three most representative cases are illustrated in Table 1. For better illustration there are identified the dryest and humidest vegetation zones with regard to the individual coefficients. Table 1.

This is due to its solid physical basis, neverthless, its disadvantage lies in the excessively demanding computational procedure and extensiveness of its input database of numeric data. Considering the influence of climatic elements on soil-water regime, the advantage of the evaporation coefficient Ec is mainly the fact that it is based on evaporation balance, combining the processes of water and energy transport. This is the reason why it is suitable especially for quantifying the impact of climate on water regime, mainly in the periods of water deficit. These are the conclusions evident from the table1, where both the coefficient Ec and PDSI show that the year 2007 was the dryest year in the investigated period, between the years 1970-2007. Moreover, this finding was</p><p id="Pg515">VII.

For better illustration there is indicated a threshold (TP) and wilting (WP) point as well. It is obvious from the picture that even in the periods of above-average precipitation amounts there can occur below average water content in a soil profile. If there is optimum volume of soil-water content, then ETa = ET0 and Ec = 0. All these findings lead to the ascertainment that when investigating soil-water regime we should take into account not only precipitation amount but also climatic elements that have an impact on energy balance at an active surface level and, consequently, on evaporation as the process of major energy consumption. In the Figure 2 the development of soil-water content and potential, as well as actual, evapotranspiration is illustrated. For better illustration, the positions of hydrolimits TP and WP are included as well. The Figures of the soil - water content development imply that the soil profile was during the vegetation period of the year 2007 constantly drained until 5.9 2007 limiting the possibilities of the crop roduction. Conclusions The results described in this submission reveal the importance of evaporation in soilwater regime in comparison to other climatic elements. On account of the deficit between the potential and actual evapotranspiration, the soil profile, and consequently biosphere, suffers from constant water deficit, that is to say, get into the state of soil drought. This condition was thoroughly examined in the year 2007. The understanding of climatic elements and their impacts on water and energy balance is inevitable for being able to develop necessary adaptation measures for lessening the negative impacts of climate changes on biosphere.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1191 WATER STORAGE DEPENDABILITY IN ROOT ZONE OF SOIL Milan GOMBOŠ 1 1 Institute of Hydrology, Slovak Acagemy of Sciences SAV, 071 01 Michalovce, Hollého 42, gombos@uh.savba.sk Abstract: Atmospheric precipitation represents the main water source for rivers in Slovakia. The water storage in the unsaturated zone is a resultant of the interaction processes between the unsaturated zone and the surrounding subsystems, while the intensity of these interactions depends on the hydrophysical properties of water. To assess the available water storage for the plant cover, we conventionally use the following characteristic points of the moisture retention curve (soil-water content), wilting point (WP) representing the value of pF = 4,18 (it is a soil moisture state where the plant cover is permanently insufficiently supplied with water and wilts), threshold point (TP) representing the value of pF = 3,3 (it is a soil moisture state where the physiological processes in the plant cover are limited by the lack of water), field water capacity (FWC) representing the value of pF = 2,0 to 2,7 (Field capacity is the quantity of water that a well-drained soil would hold against the gravitational forces) (Štekauerová et al., 2006, Štekauerová et al., 2003). The following submission presents the data concerning the dependability of water storage in root zone of a soil profile to the depth of 1m, in relation to hydrolimits. Keywords: dependability, water storage, hydrolimits Introduction The unsaturated zone represents a source of water for biosphere and as such it is known as the 3rd water source of a given location after surface water (known as 1st water source) and groundwater (2nd water source). During the vegetation period, the third water source continually provides water for the plant cover (Kandra, 2006, Tall, 2007). Throughout the hydrological year, it continually participates in the water runoff to lower geological structures as well as the underground runoff from the river basin (Stehlová, 2007, Stehlová, Nagy, 2007). The submission provides the evaluation of dependability and avalability of water to plant cover in root zone of a soil profile. Materials and methods The evaluation of dependability and availability of water to plant cover in the unsaturated soil zone was executed in the area of Milhostov, which is situated in the central part of the East Slovakia Lowland (VSN). The investigation was based on the analysis of a series of vegetation periods (april-september) in the course of 38 years, from 1970 to 2007. During this period, the development of water storage in the unsaturated zone was calculated, with a daily interval, via numerical simulation on a mathematical model GLOBAL (Majerčák, Novák, 1994), up to the depth of 1m, which is the layer providing the overwhelming part of the vegetation root zone. The results of the numerical simulation were verified by applying them on the results of the monitoring of soil-water content performed between the years 2001-2007. The analysis was based upon the determination of the empirical exceedance curves development and on the quantification of the parameters of their theoretical distribution, which was calculated via method of moments with regard to the binomial probability distribution. These methods were applied to evaluate the maximum annual deficit of water in a soil profile during a vegetation period, until reaching the point of field capacity. By way of</p><p id="Pg518">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1192 this methodology there was acquired a probability quantification of soil drought and volumetric moisture at the wilting and threshold point level. Results and discussion The illustrating table 1 shows that the probability of the soil-water storage getting at the wilting point level, or even lower, and remaining there at least for one day, is 14,9%, which in practice means one occurrence in 7 years.

The probability that the water storage in a soil profile get at the level of wilting point or lower and continue in this condition for the whole vegetation period is 2,3% which means the occurrence of one case in 44 years. Applying it on the extremely dry year of 2007, the probability of recurrence of the vegetation period with the soil-water storage volume of that year, which was 221,2mm, is once in 18 years. Figures 1, 2 and 3 the empirical points and theoretical developments of the exceedance curve for maximum daily, mean monthly and mean deficit (deficit = FC- WC) of soil water in a vegetation period are illustrated. For the needs of comparison, there are indicated the deficits corresponding to the threshold and wilting point as well. Conclusions The goal of the presented submission was to evaluate the availability of water in the unsaturated soil zone, special attention being paid to its 1m thick upper layer. The analysis was based upon the determination of the empirical exceedance curve development and quantification of the parameters of their theoretical distribution. There were evaluated the moisture contents at the wilting point level with regard to the probability patterns. The calculations show that the probability that the mean soil-water storage remain at the level of wilting point during the whole vegetation period is 2,3%, which is the periodicity of occurrence once in 44 years. The probability of recurrence of the moisture conditions from the year 2007 is once in 18 years.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1195 APPLICATION OF THE PALMER DROUGHT SEVERITY INDEX IN EAST SLOVAKIAN LOWLAND Andrej TALL 1 1 Institute of Hydrology, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Hollého 42, 071 01 Michalovce, Slovakia e-mail: tall@uh.savba.sk Abstract: Values of Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) were calculated for East Slovakian Lowland for the period of 45 years (1961-2007). Dry and wet periods were determined and analysed according to the PDSI. To compare obtained results with other way of drought identification, courses of selected meteorological drought indexes were computed. Results have shown that the most similar results to PDSI gave those indexes, which take into account the values of evapotranspiration. Keywords: Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), soil moisture content Introduction Drought can be evaluated as a meteorological anomaly characterized by a prolonged and abnormal moisture deficiency. The climatic changes are ensued and drought phenomenon must be taken into account particularly in agricultural and water management (Stehlová, 2007; Štekauerová-Nagy, 2007; Várallyay, 2006). For drought quantification many methods were developed. Some of them arise only from amount of precipitation. Apart from precipitation more sofisticated methods are also based on an additional meteorological elements, which are bounded to evapotranspiration. The most used method in the USA is the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). The PDSI was developed during the early 1960's by W. C. Palmer as a standard way to quantify the severity of drought conditions (Palmer, 1965). Palmer wanted a single methodology that could be used in any climate that was accurately representative of how the drought conditions affect the local climate. Since then the PDSI has become one of the most widely used drought assessment tools. This paper is devoted to the practical application of the PDSI in conditions of East Slovakian Lownland, which is characterized by its soil heterogenity (Šútor-Gomboš, 2006; Gomboš, 2007). Other selected meteorological drought indexes were computed, as well (Kandra, 2007). Materials and methods For application of the PDSI in East Slovakian Lowland, the locality Milhostov was chosen. The near meteorological station was used as a source to obtain all meteorological elements. To calculate the PDSI values, the precipitation (P) and the potential evapotranspiration values (PET) are needed. The value of Available Water Holding Capacity (AWC) of the soil must be shown, too. The values of PET were originaly computed by Palmer according the Thorntwait´s method. In our case PET values were calculated using the Penman-Monteith equation, which is considered by FAO as a standard (FAO, 1990). The computation of the PDSI begins with a climatic water balance using historic records of monthly precipitation and calculated PET. In case of Milhostov, we have used a period of 45-year long (1961-2007) measurements of daily meteorological elements. Soil moisture storage is considered by dividing the soil into two layers. The upper layer is assumed to contain 25.4 mm (1 inch) of AWC at the field capacity. The underlying layer has an AWC that depends on the soil characteristics</p><p id="Pg522">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1196 of the site. Calculated depth of soil profile in Milhostov was 1.00 m, which resulted in the value of AWC = 315 mm. The algorithm for calculating PDSI values was written on the basis of an original Palmer´s method using Visual Basic for Application (VBA). Results and discussion The computed course of monthly values of AWC in Milhostov during 1961-2007 is presented in Fig. 1. Reduced amounts of soil´s water can be identified especially during some months in 1974, 1990 and 2007. It can be explained by insufficient water recharge during previous winter and spring periods. 1961 1972 1983 1994 2005 0 100 200 300 400 A v a ila b le w a te r c a p a c it y ( to t h e d e p th o f 1 .0 m ) [m m ] Figure 1.The course of available water capacity in Milhostov according the Palmer during 1961-2007 Calculated monthly values of PDSI are demonstrated in Figure 2.

Total N content in grain, yield, N uptake by grain, and soil N (N-NH4, N-NO3) status were examined as well to indicate relations between N trial treatments and growing years. Over total investigated period, above mentioned factors significantly differ per nitrogen levels and years. The highest total N content in winter wheat grain was recorded in N300PK treatment during 2002/03, but the highest yield was reached in growing period 2005/06 in treatment with 300 kg N ha -1 . Growing period 2002/03 was signed as extremely hot and dry, which is the reason for lower yields, N content and NUE per fertilization treatment, compared to 2005/06. NUE values varied from 9.21 kg kg -1 in treatment with 300 kg N ha -1 (2002/03) up to 24.13 kg kg -1 in treatment with 100 kg N ha -1 (2005/06). During investigated growing years NUE was decreased with increasing nitrogen fertilization levels. The best use efficiency of applied nitrogen fertilization was at level of 100 kg N ha -1 , which is consider as rational application regarding nitrogen emissions into environment. Keywords: nitrogen use efficiency, mineral N fertilizer rates, winter wheat, N content, soil available N status Introduction Efficient nitrogen fertilization is crucial for economic wheat production and protection of ground and surface waters. Dynamics of nitrogen (N) in soil-plant system is a part of much bigger environmental frame, including water ecosystems. Possible ground and surface water pollution caused by nitrate leaching is a result of excessive and inadequate N application. Valuable indicator for rational N fertilization supply is N use efficiency (NUE) of mineral nitrogen fertilizer by growing crop, winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in this case, together with nitrogen status in soil and plant. Nitrogen cycle in agroecosystem in winter wheat as test crop has been investigated in number of studies. Mineral fertilizer NUE for winter wheat was shown as factor which decreases with increasing N levels (Sieling et al., 1998). Hatfield and Prueger (2004) found that the efficiency of N use by a crop depends upon the response of water and N availability during the growing season. Usage of nutrients from fertilizer and forming of wheat yield are influenced by growing year and site conditions (Bertic et al., 2007). The main issue of this paper was to investigate how different mineral nitrogen fertilization rates affect available soil N, total N content in grain, yield, N uptake by grain, and grain N use efficiency of applied fertilization in period of two vegetation years. Materials and methods Investigated experimental filed is a part of farmland in middle continental Croatia. Area has temperate continental climate, with 10.7°C mean temperature. The annual average rainfall takes 865mm. Region characteristic are small-holdings which dominates within agricultural land from one side, and hydro-ameliorated area with organized agricultural production within larger agricultural holdings.

Sufficient moisture is present in upper part of soil profile as result of precipitation and stagnation of water. Groundwater occurs under 175cm below soil surface. Precipitation water periodically stagnates on illuvial horizon. Trial presented here (cca. 1,5ha) is a part of a long time experiment conducting research on mineral nitrogen fertilization, nitrogen use efficiency and nitrogen leaching. This paper presents results for two growing years – 2002/03, 2005/06 - with a winter wheat as test crop. Field trial fertilization included four different mineral N amounts (NPK 10-30-20, UREA, CAN): I. N0PK; II. N100PK; III. N200PK; IV. N300PK, (kg N ha -1). Each trial treatment has 4 replicates (30x30m). Parcel dimension is conditioned by distance between drain pipes. Each treatment area includes two drain pipes. Dimension of each trial treatment is 30x130m including blank space. Distance between treatments, as well as between 4 replicates, is 2m by each side. Fertilization and seeding practice is implemented on total area of each variant. After harvest in the late June, grain yield data were measured and standardized to t ha-1 of total dry matter, and adjusted to 14% moisture content. Soil samples were taken three times during vegetation period 2005/06 and two times at 2002/03, by each trial treatment and three horizon depths (0-30cm, 30-55cm, 55-80cm). Values of soil N status were averaged by treatments and times of sampling and presented by horizons as sum. Preparation of plant and soil samples for chemical analysis was conducted according to HRN ISO 11464:2004. For vegetative year 2005/06, NO3 - content in soil was analyzed in soil water extract (1:10) according to HRN EN ISO 10304-1:1998, and soil NH4 + according to HRN EN ISO 14911:2001 on Dionex ICS-1000 system. In year 2002/03, samples analysis have been done by spectrophotometry method with phenildisulphonic acid for NO3 -, and by spectrophotometry Nessler method, for NH4 +. Concentrations of total N (TN) in winter wheat grain was obtained by dry combustion method on CHNS Elemental Analyzer Vario Macro according to HRN ISO 13878:2004. The N uptake, needed to obtain NUE of the grain, was calculated by multiplying yield total dry matter by the total N content of the winter wheat grain. The N use efficiency of mineral N fertilization was calculated according to Craswell and Godwin, 1984, by equation: NUE = (Grain yieldF – Grain yieldC) / Fertilizer N applied kg kg -1 F-fertilized crop; C-unfertilized control Statistical analysis of the N content, grain yield, N uptake and NUE data were accomplished by standard analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results and discussion Mean values for soil N-NH4 and N-NO3 content in two vegetation years are shown in Table 1. Difference in N-NO3 content between years per N levels indicates effect of water deficiency through lack of precipitation in year 2003 on nitrate accumulation in soil (0-80cm), especially on treatment with 300 kg N ha-1. Results for N-NH4 soil content show variability between years and N levels, which means that annual variations in mineralized soil N may be large. Values for nitrogen (N) content in winter wheat grain, yield and NUE are presented in Table 2. Total N content in winter wheat grain in investigated period varied from 1.88 % in N0PK treatment in vegetation period</p><p id="Pg527">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1201 2005/06 up to 2.82 % recorded in N300PK treatment during 2002/03. According to ANOVA results, N plant content was significantly affected (P≤0.05; P≤0.01) by increasing nitrogen fertilization in both growing years. Grain yield had in both years significantly increasing trend with N fertilization levels. The highest yield of 7.48 t ha-1 was recorded in growing period 2005/06 in treatment with 300 kg N ha-1. Growing period 2002/03 was signed as extremely hot and dry, which is the reason for lower yields per fertilization treatment, compared to 2005/06. The same relation was investigated by Pepo (2007) who proved that the efficiency of fertilization was strongly modified by the properties of the year. According to statistical analysis for yield, significant differences (P≤0.05; P≤0.01) were obtained between trial treatments in both vegetation years. Table 1.

Effect of mineral N treatments on winter wheat N use efficiency (kg yield per kg of mineral N applied) and yield (t ha -1 ) during two vegetation periods Conclusions Significant differences in total N content in grain, winter wheat yield and grain N use efficiency were obtained for two winter wheat vegetation years per N treatments. All mentioned parameters are conditioned by soil type and climate factors as precipitation and temperature during vegetation stages. Water stress was probably the main reason for lower yields, N uptake and NUE in year 2002/03. Due to NUE values, it is noted that the best use efficiency of applied nitrogen fertilization was at level of 100 kg N ha1, which is consider as rational application regarding increased N losses with excess mineral N by nitrogen emissions into environment like water pollution by nitrate leaching and NOx emissions to the atmosphere. To improve NUE of N mineral fertilizer by winter wheat, more information on seasonal changes in crop utilization of soil fertilizer and non-fertilizer N.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1203 SOIL TILLAGE AS INFLUENCED BY CLIMATE CHANGE Ivka KVATERNJAK1- Ivica KISIC2- Marta BIRKAS3- Krunoslav SAJKO2- Ivan SIMUNIC2 1 College of Agriculture, Milislava Demerca 1, Krizevci, Croatia 2 Faculty of Agriculture, Svetosimunska cesta 25, Zagreb, Croatia, e-mail: ikisic@agr.hr 3 Szent Istvan University, Gödöllő, Hungary Abstract: A long-term field trial was set up in order to define the effects of autumn or spring primary tillage upon the physical characteristics and yields of spring row crops – maize and soybean. The objectives were to assess and recommend the most effective tillage method. In the first trial year, the year factor had a stronger influence on maize yields compared to the tillage factor. In the second trial year, however, the situation was quite contrasted. The tillage factor had a stronger impact on soybean yields compared to the year factor. The twoyear investigation period was only allowed to draw some preliminary conclusions. For this reason the research will be continued. Keywords: autumn and spring tillage, maize, soybean, climate change Introduction As much as it may seem unreal, climate change has been ensued over last decade going with extreme incidences. According to data, agricultural activity is among the causes of the climate change at the same time being one of the human activities is most susceptible to climate change (Várallyay, 2006). This fact is evidenced by three extreme dry years (2000; 2003 and the autumn of 2006) in the last decade both in Croatia and in Hungary. It is common knowledge that agriculture is an open, roofless factory, which means that weather conditions of a certain region often have a decisive influence on yields of crops grown. Man can change and influence soil tillage, sowing time, cultivars and hybrids but he has to adapt to climate conditions. For these reasons, perseveration of moisture from the period of its abundance (winter) and its utilization by crops in the period of its deficiency (summer) is of the utmost importance. Materials and Methods The experience so far and investigations of many years (Birkas et al., 2007; Jolankai and Birkas, 2007, Jug et al., 2006) show that coincidence of adverse effects of the "year factor" and/or "tillage factor" may drastically reduce crop yields. It is, however, clear that the opposite also holds, viz. the beneficial effect of the year factor and the tillage factor may lead to memorable yields. The problem is the increasing prevalence of climatically unfavourable years over the last period of time (Dobo et al., 2006). The project that will be partially presented in this paper was conceived for these reasons. Special attention will be paid to changes in soil physical properties, moisture content, and yields of the crops grown. Investigations involve spring row crops of low plant density: maize (Zea Mays L.) and soybean (Glycine hyspida L.). The experimental field was set up on arable areas of the College of Agriculture at Krizevci in Central Croatia on the soil type Stagnic Luvisol. Tillage treatments included in the trial are shown in Table 1.</p><p id="Pg530">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1204 Table 1. Tillage treatments A B Spring ploughing to 30 cm + surface preparation with seedbed preparation implement Spring ploughing to 30 cm + surface preparation with rotary harrow C Autumn ploughing to 30 cm + winter furrow closing with spike-tooth harrow, surface preparation with rotary harrow D Autumn ploughing to 30 cm + winter furrow closing with spike-tooth harrow E Autumn ploughing to 30 cm + winter furrow + disc-harrowing Each treatment has an area of 280 m2 (20 x 14 m) and is laid out in 4 replications, which makes a total trial area of 0.8 ha. Soil samples for the analyses was taken prior to sowing, upon emergence, during silking (maize) or flowering (soybean) and after crop harvesting. On average, 48 soil samples were taken during the growing period from the plough layer of each treatment. Maize was represented by the hybrid Pioneer PR 38A24 (FAO group 380), soybean cultivar Visnja was used with seed rate of 130 kg ha-1. Results and discussion The first research objective is to define the effects of time and soil tillage method, as well as climate parameters, upon changes in soil physical parameters and yields achieved. Climate indicators for the region under study were calculated on the basis of a long-term period (1976-2005) and the years in which investigations were conducted in 2006 and 2007 (Figure 1, 2). Although a two-year period is clearly short for drawing any significant science-based conclusions, the factors influenced the year effect are given here. Climate conditions in the first spring (2006) corresponded to the long-term average, while a perceptible precipitation deficit was recorded in the autumn-winter period (Figure 1). This water deficit and the higher temperature (Figure 2) in the winterspring season of 2007 had a significant influence on the given tillage methods and the soybean yields. Table 2 shows the mean values of the soil physical parameters in relation to the different tillage methods. In the first trial year we found a statistically significant difference between treatments regarding to the effective moisture, soil bulk density and porosity. During maize phase, treatment B had on average the highest moisture and bulk density while the highest value of total porosity was recorded in treatment A. In the second trial year, significant differences were recorded between treatments only for soil water capacity, while no significant differences were stated for other parameters.

However, surprising changes occurred during maize growth in statistically significant differences. In the treatments of spring ploughing (A and B), a statistically higher value of hectolitre mass was recorded compared to treatments involving autumn ploughing. This fact can be explained by soil management used in the preceding period of the trial. The area on which the trial was set up used to be uncultivated fallow for 4 years. In the autumn of 2005, a vetch and oats mixture was mistakenly sown on the area foreseen for treatments with spring ploughing, while the planned autumn ploughing was applied on the remaining part of the trial area. In the spring of 2006, the crop remains were incorporated into soil as green manure by means of the foreseen spring ploughing practices. This probably had a decisive influence on the yields attained in the first year. Table 3.

If the year climatic factors were within the limits of the long-term average (especially the winter-spring part of the year), the autumn ploughing had slight efficiency on yields compared to the spring ploughing practices. In treatments involving spring ploughing (A and B) as well as in a variant with autumn ploughing (C) a statistically higher yields were recorded compared to the other two autumn ploughing variants. This indicates that the tillage factor had less influence in that year whereas the</p><p id="Pg532">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1206 impact of the year factor on yields was stronger. Following the planned methodology, soybean was sown in the trial field in 2007. Counts of soybean plants at its full emergence stage and immediately prior to harvest showed a significantly larger number of plants per square metre in treatments (D and E) involving autumn ploughing, as well as in treatment B with spring ploughing, compared to the remaining two variants with spring ploughing. This had a decisive influence on the obtained yield. As regards absolute and hectolitre mass, there were no statistically significant differences between the treatments. Compared to treatment A, statistically higher yields were recorded in all other treatments. Accordingly, the year factor had a stronger influence in given year compared to the tillage factor. This is confirmed by the climate conditions determined during the autumn of 2006 and the spring of 2007. Drought started as early as in June 2006. That drought had no strong reflection on the preceding crop (maize) because in August above-average rain was fallen. But, all months from that month to February 2007 had much lower precipitation compared to the average. At the same time, all those months were warmer than the average (Figures 1 and 2), and unfavourable situation continued also in 2007. Although January, February, March and May of 2007 had above-average rainfall, precipitation deficit was recorded again in April, June and July. We think that for these reasons the precipitation deficit could have been alleviated only by autumn tillage, i.e., by accumulation of precipitation water from the winter period. The results for the given year, climatically very unfavourable for spring crops growing that pointed to the advantages of autumn ploughing. Although the two years investigation may provide preliminary information, the presented data are used as the bases to the time and method of soil tillage in future investigations. Conclusions The applied soil tillage variants had no significant influence on the studied soil physical parameters that is effective moisture, soil densities, total porosity, soil water capacity and air capacity. In the first trial year, the year factor had a stronger influence on maize yields compared to the tillage factor. In the second trial year, however, the situation was quite contrasted due to extreme climate. The tillage factor had a stronger impact on soybean yields compared to the year factor. Considering the probable climate extremes role of the soil tillage through water conservation and yield establishment will be widened in the near future.

Drainpipes installed at two different soil types - Stagnosol and Gleysol have been with similar ways of installation. Stagnosol had higher average drainage efficiency in February, April and December, while Gleysol had higher drainage in all other months, with exemption of November, when average efficiency was the same. Average soybean yield in 2002 at drained Stagnosol was 3.0 t ha -1 compared with the yield at drained Glaysol of only 2.1 t ha -1 . Keywords: Stagnosols, Gleysols, drainage efficiency, soybean yield Introduction Subsurface drainage is important to maintain productivity of the poorly drained soils, especially in humid regions. In this paper we present results with drainage efficiency obtained in two field trials, one was carried out at drained Stagnosol, and the other one at drained Gleysol. Both field trials are placed in a same area and they are relatively close each to other, at the distance about 1000 m. Stagnosols and Gleysols in Croatia are the soil types that are very often hydro-ameliorated with drainage installation. According to the FAO WRB for Soil Resources (2006), the main obstacle to utilization of Gleysols is the necessity to install a drainage system and to lower the groundwater table. At the same time agricultural suitability of Stagnosols is limited because of their oxygen deficiency resulting from water stagnation above a dense subsoil. The main goal of our research was to find out differences in drainage discharge of two different soil types in same years and to define soil fertility in terms of soybean yield. According to Gombos (2007), presence of clay minerals in heavy soils influence soil volume and water regime in the case of high rainfall. Different drainpipe spacing and different nitrogen fertilization levels significantly influence productivity of soils in experimental area (Simunic et al., 2002., Mesic et al., 2007.). Soil tillage practices are also very important for soil fertility (Birkás et al., 2007, Kisic et al., 2006), but at drained soils tillage is also influenced by drainage efficiency. Materials and methods Research was carried out at two experimental fields in Jelenscak near Popovaca in the period 1999 – 2002. Drainpipes installed at two different soil types - Stagnosol and Gleysol have been with similar ways of installation. Between different treatments with different drainpipe spacing we have selected treatments with same properties. At both locations drainage pipes were installed at distance of 20 m and have the following characteristics: length 95 m to 120 m, diameter 65 mm, average slope 0.3% and average depth 1m at Gleysol and 1.20 m at Stagnosol. Stagnosol have been subsoiled during year 2000. to the average depth or 55 cm. In the periods with drainage discharge at</p><p id="Pg534">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1208 Stagnosol water amounts were measured on a daily basis, while at Gleysol drainage discharge was measured permanently by means of electronic gauges – limnimeters. On both experimental plots soybean (Glycine hispida max.) was grown in 2002. Soil tillage practices were also the same, as well as it was fertilization with NPK. From field experiment on Stagnosol, with different nitrogen fertilization rates we have selected treatment with fertilization of 100 kg ha-1 N, that is the same amount that was applied for fertilization at Gleysol. Application of mineral fertilizer was the same for both fields, as well as it was application of herbicides, topdressing, the date of sowing (May 4. 2002) and the date of harvest (Oct. 17. 2002). Results and discussion Both soil types are located in Sava river valley, drained Stagnosol at an average altitude of 97.2 m, and drained Gleysol at altitude of 96.4 m. Average groundwater table depth is 1.75 m for Stagnosol and 1.25 m for Gleysol with strong fluctuations influenced by precipitation and drainage. Basic soil properties are presented in Table 1. According to the mechanical composition of arable layer Stagnosol is loamy, while Gleysol is silty clayey. Soil swelling and shrinking properties are determined by the percentage and type of clay minerals in soil, together with humus content. When it is dry Gleysol has a high proportion of large blocky aggregates, cracks are large and rainwater can easily percolate through the soil. When soil is wet, clay particles swell and water retention is very low. At Stagnosol structure is also problematic, but lower percentage of clay result with lower porosity when soil is dry, compared with Gleysol. Vertical hydraulic conductivity of Stagnosol is 0.40 m day-1, while of Gleysol is only 0.01 m day-1. Table 1.

Annual precipitation for the studied period and average monthly precipitation representative for the experimental station are presented in Table 2. According to analyses of average monthly values of drainage efficiency for Stagnosol and Gleysol (Table 3), it is possible to conclude that differences are noticeable during whole year. Despite of that, average annual drainage efficiency is almost the same for both studied soil types. Although it is not possible to explain all recorded differences, it is obvious</p><p id="Pg535">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1209 that Stagnosol has higher average drainage efficiency in February, April and December, while Gleysol has higher drainage in all other months, with exemption of November, when average efficiency is the same.

In dry years formation of cracks in Gleysol is much more evident than in Stagnosol. According to Novak (1999) crack closing is not immediate even during heavy rainfall, and it can last for few days. Differences in drainage efficiency between Stagnosol and Gleysol, in autumn period for years 1999 and 2000, can be explained with faster water percolation through cracks in Gleysol than in Stagnosol. During vegetation period of soybean in 2002. there is no recorded drainage discharge for Stagnosol in the period from June to September, while drainpipes installed in Glaysol were active during whole summer. Differences in drainage efficiency for Stagnosol and Gleysol in 2002 can serve for the estimation of water saturation and soil moisture. Table 3.

Cereal Research Communications 1210 According to the soybean yield it can be concluded that response to drainage was greater in coarser textured Stagnosol than finer textured Glaysol (Figure 1). The difference is statistically significant at the 95% probability level. If absolute values of soybean yield were compared, than it was clear that drainage efficiency had strongly influenced on the soybean development, especially when all agrotechnical practices were unvariant in the soybean cultivation.

Soybean yield at Stagnosol and Gleysol Conclusions Average soybean yield in 2002 at drained Stagnosol was 3.0 t ha-1 compared with the yield at drained Glaysol of only 2.1 t ha-1. Before drainage installation area with Stagnosols have been used as arable land, while lower positions with Gleysols as dominant soil type were pastures, very often flooded after periods of high precipitation. Drained Stagnosols and Glaysols can be fertile soils owing to their chemical properties, but drainage efficiency can strongly influence their fertility.

Winter wheat was cultivated in 2005/2006. The highest grain uptake of 16.9 kg S ha -1 and the highest S-S04 2- leaching via lysimeters was achieved at treatment with 300 kg of nitrogen per ha. Annual sulphur deposition in 2006 resulted in 4.88 kg S-SO4 ha -1 . We found that sulphur grain uptake was higher compared to the annual sulphur atmospheric deposition. Keywords: sulphur balance, nitrogen fertilization, N/S ratio, winter wheat, leaching Introduction The aim of this research was to quantify the sulphur losses via lysimeters and sulphur losses by grain uptake in experiment with different nitrogen fertilization levels applied for fertilization of grown crops and to define possible influence of fertilization levels on sulphur balance. Sulphur (S) occurs in the soil in organic and inorganic forms. Plants mainly absorb S in the form of SO4 2-. Sulphur is essential constituent of proteins and its deficiency results with inhibition of protein synthesis. Győri (2005) noted that sulphur content in winter wheat grain was influenced not only by sulphur fertilizers, but nitrogen fertilisers as well. Kalocsai et al. (2006) proved that due to N, P, K fertilization the S content of winter wheat increases. Mars et al. (2006) examined the effects of sulphur on winter wheat yield and Eriksen et al. (2002) investigated sulphate leaching and S balance in organic cereal crop rotation. They found that sulphate leaching was quantitatively the most important item of the S balance. Materials and methods This study was carried out on drained Stagnosols near village Potok in the vicinity of Popovaca. Area is characterised with continental climate where mean annual temperature is 10.7 °C and annual average rainfall is 865 mm. Experiment has 10 treatments but only four are taken into consideration in this paper: 1. N0+P+K, 2. N100+P+K, 3. N200+P+K, 4. N300+P+K. Zero-tension pan lysimeters are installed at the depth of 80 cm. Water samples were taken in periods with lysimeters discharge. This research presents results for the year 2006, when winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was grown in the experiment. Soil samples were taken in spring, summer and winter from each treatment and each horizon (0-30 cm, 30-55 cm and 55-80cm). Samples were air dried, sieved (&lt; 2mm), oven-dried at 105°C until constancy of weight, and analysed for total S. Total S content in soil samples was determined by dry combustion method (HRN ISO 15178:2005, Soil quality-Determination of total sulphur by dry combustion) using an Elemental Analyzer vario Macro. SO4 2- content in lysimeters water was determined by ion chromatography method (HRN EN ISO 10304-1:1998, Water quality-Determination of dissolved fluoride, chloride, nitrate, orthophosphate, bromide, nitrate and sulphate ions, using liquid chromatography of ions – Part 1: Method for</p><p id="Pg538">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

After harvest, winter wheat grain was oven-dried at 70°C until constancy of weight and then analysed for total S content by dry combustion method using an Elemental Analyzer vario Macro. Values obtained by laboratory analysis were subjected to ANOVA, and the LSD test at 5 % probability was calculated. Results and discussion Average total S content in soil and average S-SO4 soil content per treatments and depths are presented in Figure 1. The highest total S content (4416 kg S ha-1) was recorded in the treatment with 200 kg N ha-1 and the highest S-SO4 soil content (40.3 kg S ha -1) was found in the treatment with 100 kg N ha-1 at soil depth 0-30 cm (Fig. 1.a). Total S soil content at soil depth 30-55 cm ranged from 2508 kg S ha-1 in the treatment with 0 kg N ha-1 to 2825 kg S ha-1 in the treatment with 100 kg N ha-1. S-SO4 soil content decreased with increased nitrogen fertilization levels (Fig. 1.b). Total S soil content at soil depth 55-80 cm decreased with increased nitrogen fertilization levels (Fig. 1.c). The sum of average total S content for three depths varied from 8293 kg ha-1 at treatment with 0 kg N ha-1 to 9937 kg ha-1 at treatment with 200 kg N ha-1. The sum of average S-SO4 soil content for all three analysed depths varied from 102 kg ha-1 at treatment with 300 kg N ha-1 up to 143.7 kg ha-1 at treatment with 0 kg N ha-1. 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 5000 N0 N100 N200 N300 k g S h a -1 0,0 10,0 20,0 30,0 40,0 50,0 k g S -S 0 4 h a1 Total S soil content S-SO4 soil conten 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 N0 N100 N200 N300 k g S h a -1 0,0 10,0 20,0 30,0 40,0 50,0 k g S -S 0 4 h a -1 Total S soil content S-SO4 soil conten (a) (b) 1500 2000 2500 3000 N0 N100 N200 N300 k g S h a -1 0,0 10,0 20,0 30,0 40,0 50,0 60,0 70,0 k g S -S 0 4 h a1 Total S soil content S-SO4 soil conten (c) Figure 1.

Annual deposition of sulphur and annual precipitation Sulphur uptake in wheat grain was significantly higher with increased nitrogen fertilization levels (Table 2.). This was due to positive influence of nitrogen fertilization on the winter wheat yields. The highest yield of winter wheat (7.5 t ha-1) was recorded in the treatment with 300 kg ha-1 of applied mineral nitrogen. Significantly lower yield (3.1 t ha-1) was recorded in treatment without nitrogen fertilization (P≤0.05). Sulphur uptake in wheat grain is quantitatively the most important item of the balance. Sulphur wheat grain uptake varied from 6.1 kg ha-1 up to 16.9 kg ha-1. Eriksen et al. (2002) reported that sulphur output by winter wheat uptake varied from 0 kg ha-1 to 4 kg ha-1 depend on year and soil type. The S-SO4 2- losses via lysimeters varied from 1.1 kg ha-1 up to 5.0 kg ha-1. Eriksen et al. (2002) reported that sulphur leaching losses varied from 19 kg ha-1 to 34 kg ha-1 depend on year, soil type and crop type. Table 2.

(1999) recorded the N/S ratio in winter wheat grain increased from 12.0 to 16.0 depending on year. Conclusions 1) Atmospheric sulphur deposition at studied area decreased from 10.56 kg ha-1 in 2001 and to 4.88 kg ha-1 in 2006. 2) Total S content of soil to a depth of 0-80 cm varied between 8293 kg ha-1 at treatment with 0 kg N ha-1 and 9937 kg ha-1 at treatment with 200 kg N ha-1. S-SO4 content of soil to a depth of 0-80 cm varied between 102 kg ha-1 at treatment with 300 kg N ha-1 to 143.7 kg ha-1 at treatment without nitrogen fertilization. Compared to the total sulphur content in soil the amount of S-SO4 2- varied from 1.2 to 1.7 % at all studied depths. 3) Average S grain uptake varied between 6.1 kg ha-1 at treatment with 0 kg N ha-1 to 16.9 kg S ha-1 at treatment with 300 kg of nitrogen per ha. 4) Average S-SO4 2- leaching via lysimeters was between 1.1 to 5.0 kg ha-1. The highest quantity of leached S-SO4 2- is recorded at treatment with 300 kg of nitrogen per ha. 5) Sulphur uptake and leaching were higher with increased nitrogen doses, but the total sulphur soil content and S-SO4 soil content revealed that no substantial sulphur deficit may be expected in longer term. Sulphur grain uptake was higher then annual sulphur atmospheric deposition.

Research involves monitoring of changes in soil chemical composition. The experiment was set up in May 2006 and included seven treatments with four replicates on a total trial field area of 750 m 2 . Experimental treatments were as follows: control (clean soil), soil contaminated with doses of 8, 4 and 2 l m -2 crude oil and soil contaminated with doses of 30, 20 and 10 kg m -2 oil solidificate. Influence of crude oil contamination on changes in soil chemical characteristic and yield was significant only in the first investigated vegetation year. With increasing the content of solidificate doses in soil, concentration of hydrocarbons increased as well as soil reaction, content of organic matter and content of total and mineral oils. After statistical data analysis we noted that there are no significant statistical difference in plant density and yield for oil seed rape, barley and wheat. Key words: polluted soil, crops, yield, waste oil Introduction Man’s activity has been causing environmental changes since his beginnings on the Earth. These changes had been slow and slight for millions of years of the development of mankind; after industrialisation, however, they became more adverse. Environmental pollution is one of the consequences of crude oil exploitation. All phases of oil exploitation, from the starting oil-drilling works to construction of the transport system (underground pipeline network) are accompanied by interventions and procedures hazardous to the environment. Although the state-of-the-art technical solutions and modern materials used in all phases warrant a high level of safety, the possibility of different incidents is not fully excluded. This issue has been addressed in order to determine its environmental harmfulness, in particular potential harm to soil and water, as well as crops, since contaminants/pollutants enter the animal and human food chain via soil. In the spring of 2006 a stationary field trial was set up within the Stružec gathering station. Research involved monitoring of changes in the soil chemical composition (soil reaction, organic matter, total and mineral oils, heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), crop yield, crop establishment, and the rate of heavy metal translocation from soil via plant to the grain. Materials and methods Modern and well conceived pipelines used for transport of hydrocarbons provide a high level of safety, but the possibility of incidents is not excluded. Unfortunately, attempts at boring pipelines and stealing petroleum products have been recorded recently. Such incidents endanger natural resources, primarily soil and water, and depending on their severity, may for a certain length of time jeopardize the intended use of the land on</p><p id="Pg542">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1216 which the incident has occurred, that is, rule out the possibility of its use for plant or livestock production (Bálint et al., 2007; Várallyay, 2006). Influence of increased levels of hydrocarbons in soil upon the monitored soil and plant indicators will be studied in the course of three-year field investigations. The investigations comprise variants in which changes were expected both in soil and in crops grown. Trial variants are: control (clean soil); soil contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbons at three levels (8; 4 and 2 l m-2) and soil contaminated by oil solidificate, also at three levels (30; 20 and 10 kg m-2). The trial, with four replications, was set up in May 2006 on a trial field of 750 m2. Maize (Zea Mays L.) was sown in May 2006, oil seed rape (Brassica napus var. Oleifera L.) was sown at the beginning of September of the same year, and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and winter barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) were sown in November. Soil samples were taken for soil chemical analyses: 36 average soil samples (3 crops – 3 depths – 4 replicates) for each variant from the studied depths of 0-15; 1530 and 30-45 cm, making a total of 252 soil samples. Results and discussion After maize was sown, soil samples representing the initial state were taken from the trial variants. Figure 1 shows the average soil reaction for each trial variant (3 crops – 4 replicates). Changes corresponding to the added amounts of hydrocarbons or solidificate are discernible. Hydrocarbons caused no alteration in soil reaction while solidificate brought about statistical changes to soil reaction. Owing to its chemical composition (increased lime content), solidificate acts as liming material causing an increase in soil pH. Opposite values were determined for soil organic matter (Figure 2). The highest soil content of organic matter was found in variants in which the largest amount of hydrocarbons was applied. Figure 3 presents the average content of hydrocarbons in particular trial variants. The highest content of hydrocarbons was determined in the variant in which their largest amount was applied (8 l m-2). As expected, the greatest changes in the studied parameters were recorded in the surface 0-15 cm; the changes decreased with increasing depth.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1217 Due to lack of space, it is only pointed out that soil concentrations of some heavy metals (mercury and barium) were increased in the first trial year in variants in which solidificate was applied. Investigations of the plant material of crops grown (stalk and grain) will show whether contents of heavy metals differ in particular trial variants. The measured chemical parameters had a direct influence on the assessed plant density and yield of maize. Soil contamination by hydrocarbons played the crucial role for the reduction of plant density and thereby also of yield (Table 1 and Figure 4). In maize culture, differences in plant emergence were observed as early as at the germinationemergence stage in dependence on the different levels of hydrocarbons in soil.

Differences in plant density and yield were not so marked for crops sown in summer (oil seed rape) or in autumn (wheat and barley). As a statistically lower content of oil hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic compounds was recorded in the given period, they are taken to be most responsible for the established differences. Changes in heavy metals, i.e., heavy metal translocation coefficient from soil to plant will be elaborated and discussed in the further studies. Conclusions The level of soil contamination by oil hydrocarbons played the key role in the studied chemical parameters and the yield of only the first crop grown immediately after the trial was set up. Increased solidificate content led to statistical changes in soil reaction while increased levels of hydrocarbons caused statistically significant changes in soil content of organic matter as well as of total and mineral oils. In maize sown immediately upon setting up the trial, the largest number of plants was recorded in the control variant; a significantly smaller number of plants was determined in variants involving application of 8 or 4 l m-2 hydrocarbons. After a time delay of six months, in which loss of hydrocarbons occurred in soil (evaporation or leaching), the differences in plant density and yields achieved in trial variants were reduced. Differences in plant density and yield were not statistically significant at oil seed rape, barley and wheat plants. Further investigations will help clarify the changes caused by hydrocarbons in the soil, and the possible changes associated with the heavy metal translocation coefficient from soil into plant.

WENZEL 2 - Hamid CUSTOVIC 3 1 Department of General Agronomy, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zagreb, Svetosimunska c. 25, Croatia, zzgorelec@agr.hr 2 Department of Forest and Soil Science, University of Natural and Applied Life Sciences, Vienna, Austria 3 Institute for Pedology, Agrochemistry and Amelioration, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Sarajevo, BiH Abstract: Around the city of Tuzla, BiH, soil covered coal ash disposal sites have been used for food and fodder production since 1992. To our knowledge this is the first report on the cultivation of coal ash disposal sites for agriculture purposes. We observed high concentrations of As and Ni in alkaline coal ash. In this paper, we investigated arsenic and nickel transport and accumulation in barley and soybean grown on substrates made up of different soil and ash ratios. After three growth in the greenhouse we observed significant differences (p&lt;0.05) between the Ni enrichment coefficients of Dora cultivar of soybean and Rex cultivar of barley, but no significant difference between the As enrichment coefficients of soybean and barley. Dora cultivar of soybean and Rex cultivar of barley showed very low uptake of arsenic, the enrichment coefficient varied between 0.05 % and 0.51 % depending on the crop and the treatment. The nickel enrichment coefficient of Rex cultivar of barley varied between 0.01% and 0.94%. The enrichment coefficient for Ni in Dora cultivar of soybean indicated higher uptake and varied between 5.64% and 34.79%. Keywords: arsenic, barley, enrichment coefficient, coal ash, nickel, soybean Introduction Thermoelectric power plant Tuzla, fueled by coal, is providing energy (electricity, process steam and community heating) to the city of Tuzla, the surrounding villages and other parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The combustion residues are disposed wet into nearby settling ponds. Two of four disposal sites have been closed and covered with a soil layer of varying thickness to prevent wind erosion (Plane and Dreznik). Since 1992 war refugees and local population used the sites (63 ha) for food and fodder production (barley, maize, potato, alfalfa, beans) due to deficiency of available food products and possibility of migration. The uncontrolled agricultural use of the sites bears the risk of food chain contamination by trace elements. High concentrations of As and Ni in the alkaline coal ash were observed by Dellantonio et al. (2007). The mean total As and Ni concentrations in ash were 61 mg/kg and 682 mg/kg (n=19), respectively at disposal site Plane, and 69 mg/kg and 597 mg/kg (n=36), respectively at disposal site Dreznik. High As concentrations with means of 242.3 mg/kg were observed by Máthé et al. (2007) at polluted areas along the Toka-creek. In this paper results of arsenic and nickel accumulation in barley and soybean grain grown in controlled conditions at different soil and ash ratios as growing substrate for three investigated vegetative years are discussed. Biró et al. (2007) found that Ni was accumulated in roots rather than translocated in leaves of poplar trees. Materials and methods Winter barley and soybean were chosen as test crops. Plants were grown on substrates made up of different ash and soil ratios (growing substrate) under greenhouse conditions to investigate pollutant uptake in Rex cultivar of barley and Dora cultivar of</p><p id="Pg546">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1220 soybean. The pot experiment was designed with six soil/ash ratio treatments in 4 replicates, resulting in a total of 24 pots (Figure 1), and was run for three cropping cycles: winter barley 1 (November 2005 – June 2006), soybean (July 2006 – October 2006) and winter barley 2 (November 2006 – June 2007). The mass of growth substrate in each pot was 5 kg. Water was added as required. A layer of approximately 2 cm of stones was filled at the bottom of the pots to improved water permeability. The coal ash was collected at the disposal site Jezero, the soil used for obtaining different soil/ash ratios is a Gleysol inform the location Sasinovec, Croatia (the same type as cover soil). Figure 1. Trial treatments, green house experiment, winter barley 1, March 2006 Mineral fertilization was applied uniformly in all treatments. Applied doses per pot were: for winter barley 0.72 g N, 0.72 g P and 0.48 g K and for soybean 0.72 g N, 0.72 g P and 1.08 g K. The substrates were analysed for total As and Ni concentrations at the beginning of the experiment, the edible parts (grain) of the crops at the end of each cropping cycle. Preparation (drying/grinding/sieving) of plant, soil and ash samples for chemical analysis followed the protocols of HRN ISO 11464:2004. Arsenic and nickel were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, ELAN 9000 DRC-e, Parkin Elmer). The substrate samples were digested in aqua regia (ONORM L 1085; 0.5 g sample + 4.5 ml HCl + 1.5 ml HNO3 in open Heating digester, DK, Velp, Scientifica), plant samples in a mixture of nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide (0.2 g sample + 5.0 ml HNO3 + 1.0 ml H2O2). Results and discussion Mean values for total arsenic and nickel concentrations in the growth substrates and plants are shown in Table 1. According to Croatian legislation, threshold values of As and Ni for heavy agricultural soils are 30 mg/kg and 60 mg/kg, respectively. According to Scheffer (1992) normal ranges of As and Ni for plants are 0.01-1 mg/kg and 0.1-3 mg/kg, respectively. Arsenic concentrations in substrates varied from 27.65 mg/kg in pure soil up to 111.58 mg/kg in pure ash. Nickel concentrations in substrates varied from 96.40 mg/kg in pure soil up to 592.60 mg/kg in pure ash. If we consider both cropping cycles of barley, arsenic concentrations in grain varied between 0.03 mg/kg when grown on pure soil up to 0.57 mg/kg when grown on pure ash. Nickel concentrations varied between 0.03 mg/kg when grown on substrate with a 75/25 soil/ash ratio up to 1.81 mg/kg when grown on pure ash. In soybean grain we observed arsenic concentrations from 0.03 mg/kg (on pure soil and substrate with a 75/25 soil ash</p><p id="Pg547">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1221 ratio) up to 0.47 mg/kg (on pure ash) and nickel concentrations from 16.33 mg/kg (on substrate with a 75/25 soil ash ratio) up to 54.54 mg/kg on pure ash. Enrichment coefficients indicate the transfer of metals and metalloids into food and fodder and provide some estimate of potential risks for the food chain and human health. Table 1.

Response of soil respiration was measured monthly in the vegetation periods between 2003 and 2007. Besides the very low soil carbon efflux rates (0.09 – 1.60 μmol CO2 m -2 s -1 ), close correlation was found between soil respiration rate and soil temperature, while the influence of soil moisture could be detected only below 2.5 vol%, when water stress supressed the temperature response of soil respiration. The primary temperature effect is obvious from the diurnal changes of soil respiration, even during water-limited periods of the growing season, while the seasonal course is characterized by clear temperature limitation in winter and water limitation in summer. For the soil respiration rate – temperature relationship a bell-shaped function gave the best fit in this ecosystem. Both nocturnal warming and rain exclusion treatments had negative influence on soil respiration, presumably because of the drought imposed by both treatments. These results suggest a decline in the amount of carbon emission from the soil in this ecosystem with the forecasted climate change. Keywords: experimental warming, soil carbon dioxide efflux, temperature response, water limitation Introduction Interactions between the atmosphere and the biosphere are strongly determined by soil carbon dioxide efflux (Schlesinger and Andrews 2000, Anda and Lőke 2006, LelleiKovács et al. 2008). Global environmental changes can fundamentally alter these interactions in various ways in the different ecosystems (Davidson et al. 2006, Vágó et al. 2006, Várallyai 2007). Soil respiration is affected by the soil-plant relationships and plant traits, and, particularly in arid ecosystems, by water availability (Tingley et al. 2006, Viliam and Ján 2006). In this study we document and evaluate the effects of limiting factors on soil carbon efflux in a multiyear measurement series. Materials and methods A plot-scale climate change simulation experiment was established at the Kiskun Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site in Central Hungary within the frame of the EU FP5 VULCAN Project (Beier et al. 2004). Passive nighttime warming throughout the year, or rain exclusion in the main vegetation period were applied in 3 plots of 4x5 m size in both treatments. There were also 3 control plots maintained. The vegetation is a forest steppe mosaic developed on coarse, calcaric sand soil with low humus content and extreme heat and water regimes (Kovács-Láng et al. 2000, Várallyai 2006). Soil respiration measurements were conducted once monthly during the vegetation period with one measurement series at dawn and another one during midday, by using an IRGA system with an open air flow soil respiration chamber (98.5 cm2, ADC LCA4</p><p id="Pg550">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1224 with PLC 2250 Soil hood, ADC BioScientific, Hoddesdon, U.K.). Soil temperature in 1 cm depth and soil moisture in the top 10 cm layer were measured simultaneously with soil respiration. The effects of time and experimental treatments were tested by Repeated Measures ANOVA followed by Tukey post hoc tests for the comparison of means. Soil respiration data were log-transformed to improve homogeneity of variances. Dawn and midday data were analyzed separately. All analyses wer perforemd by using the Statistica 6.0 package. Results and discussion Throughout the five years of the study period soil carbon efflux rates remained very low (between 0.09 and 1.60 μmol CO2 m -2 s-1) most probably due to the limited biological activity and low substrate content of the calcareous coarse sand soil typical of the Kiskunság forest steppe. A clear temperature limitation in winter and water limitation in summer was observed, as it is described by Tingley et al. (2006). The primary temperature effect is obvious from the diurnal changes of soil respiration which was significantly lower at dawn than at midday, throughout the study period (Figure 1). 0,0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1,0 1,2 1,4 1,6 07 .M ay 11 .J ul y 03 .S ep t 05 .N ov 20 .A pr il 15 .J un e 03 .A ug 13 .O ct 05 .A pr il 06 .J un e 01 .A ug 5.

Seasonal course of soil respiration between 2003 and 2007 in the Kiskunság experimental site For the close correlation, found between soil respiration rate and soil temperature, a bell-shaped function gave the best fit (R2 = 0.31) in this ecosystem, instead of the widely accepted exponential relationship (Emmett et al. 2004). This function has a maximum value at 33.4°C, based on the five years of our study (Figure 2). As this characteristics applied also to the non water-limited periods, it is probably because of the temporary substrate depletion of the soil caused by the enhanced microbial activity. Szili-Kovács and Török (2005) observed increased microbial respiration as a consequence of addition of various carbon sources in the same ecosystem. Impact of soil water on soil respiration could be detected only below 2.5 vol%, when water stress supressed the temperature limitation of soil respiration, and above 30°C, when temperature limitation was certainly negligable. The water limitation effect, however, is hardly detectable in the field in the coarse sand soil, because of the narrow range of</p><p id="Pg551">VII.

On the one hand, dewfall could be excluded by the nighttime sheltering, which is an important water source in particular in this semiarid ecosystem. On the other hand, underground dew formation could be diminished because of the reduced cooling down of the soil in the warming treated plots. Moreover, the evapotranspiration could also be enhanced if compared to the control plots.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1227 INFLUENCE OF NITROGEN FERTILIZATION ON THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF AMARANTH (AMARANTHUS SPP.) SEED Ana POSPIŠIL1 - Milan POSPIŠIL1 – Milan POLJAK2 – Željko JUKIĆ1 1 Department of Field Crops, Forage and Grasslands, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zagreb, Svetosimunska cesta 25, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia, e-mail: apospisil@agr.hr 2 Department of Plant Nutrition, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zagreb Abstract: The goal of the research carried out in Zagreb (Croatia) in the period 2002-2004 was to determine the influence of nitrogen fertilization on the seed chemical composition of two grain amaranth varieties belonging to different species: G6 (Amaranthus cruentus L.) and 1008 (Amaranthus hypochondriacus L.). Nitrogen was applied before sowing at the rates of 0, 50 and 100 kg N ha -1 . No significant effect of nitrogen fertilization on the seed concentrations of crude protein, fats, fibre, starch or total sugars was recorded in any trial year. The studied species did not differ in the seed chemical composition. High concentration of essential amino acids, points to the high nutritive value of amaranth seed and to its potential use in human diet. Nitrogen fertilization (50 and 100 kg N ha -1 ) led to a significant increase in arginine and tyrosine concentrations. Amaranthus cruentus L. had significantly higher concentrations of valine and leucine. Keywords: grain amaranth, nitrogen fertilization, seed chemical composition, amino acids Introduction Grain amaranth seed has a high concentration of protein of better quality than the majority of other cereals (Bejosano and Corke, 1998). In the investigations done in Slovakia, protein concentrations ranged from 185 to 201 g kg-1 (Jamriška, 1996). Žajova et al. (2001) say that grain amaranth seed has 150-160 g kg-1 protein that do not contain prolamine and gluteline as glutene components. The high nutritive value of grain amaranth seed is due to its favourable amino acid composition. Sulphur containing amino acids are particularly abundant (Aufhammer et al. 1999; Jamriška, 1996). Czerwiński et al. (2004) maintain that grain amaranth can be a valuable replacement for cereals in human diets especially for hypercholesterolemic patients allergic to cereals. Nitrogen fertilization of grain amaranth and its influence on the chemical composition of the seed is of special importance for efficient production of this alternative cereal and its use in the food industry. The objective of these investigations was to determine the influence of nitrogen fertilization on the chemical composition of the seed and the amino acid composition of two grain amaranth varieties belonging to different species. Materials and methods Research was done in field trials, set up on the experimental field of the Faculty of Agriculture in Zagreb, in 2002, 2003 and 2004. The trial was set up on eutric cambisol of acid reaction in the plough layer (pH 5.30), poorly supplied with humus (2.96%) and well supplied with total nitrogen (0.21%), available phosphorus (21.1 mg/100 g soil) and potassium (30.0 mg/100 g soil). Research involved two grain amaranth varieties belonging to different species: G6 (Amaranthus cruentus L.) and 1008 (Amaranthus hypochondriacus L.). Nitrogen fertilization was applied before sowing at the rates of 0, 50 and 100 kg N ha-1. Fertilizers were hand-broadcasted as N-P-K (8-26-26), granular N (27% ammonium nitrate NH4NO3), Triplex (47% P2O5) and muriate of potash (60% KCl). Amaranth plant density at harvest was 40 plants m-2. Correction to the desired density was done manually when plants were 10 cm high. The trial was laid out</p><p id="Pg554">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1228 according to the randomized block scheme with four replications. The main plot size at sowing was 12 m2 (4 rows, 0.60 m wide x 5 m long). Sugar beet was sown as forecrop to amaranth in all the three trial years. Amaranth was harvested manually by shaking inflorescences. Seed chemical composition and amino acid composition were determined after the harvest. Total nitrogen, starch, total sugars, crude fibre and ash were determined by the standard methods (AOAC, 2002). Amino acid analyses were carried out by ion exchange chromatography following postcolumn derivatization with ninhydrin. IEC analyses were carried out using an amino acid analyzer (Aminochrom OE-914, LaborMIM, Hungary). Amino acids were separated on a cation-exchange column (230 mm x 4.5 mm, “Kemochrom 9” resin), postcolumn ninhydrin derivatives of amino acids were detected with an on-line photometer at 570 nm (Csapo et al., 2004). Results of the seed chemical analyses were recalculated into absolute dry matter and processed by the analysis of variance using the MSTAT-C program. Results and discussion Higher protein concentration in grain amaranth was determined in these investigations compared to wheat and maize (Szalay, 2005; Izsáki, 2006; Jolánkai et al., 2006; Kovacevic, 2007). Protein concentration in amaranth seed ranged from 165 to 167 g kg1 (Table 1). There was no significant response of grain amaranth to nitrogen fertilization because the soil was well supplied with nitrogen. This points to the conclusion that production of grain amaranth without nitrogen fertilization may be possible on such soils. Obtained values of protein concentration in amaranth seed are within the scope of those reported by other researchers (Aufhammer et al., 1999, Žajova et al., 2001, Peterka et al., 2001). Muchova et al. (2000) found the highest protein concentration in A. cruentus L. and the lowest in A. hypochondriacus L. while in our investigations A. hypochondriacus L. had on average a higher concentration of protein, but the difference from A. cruentus L. was not statistically significant. Its high protein content makes grain amaranth a valuable alternative source of protein for human diet, particularly because it contains a smaller amount of saturated fats, and no cholesterol (Escudero et al., 2004). Nitrogen fertilization had no influence on the concentration of fats in grain amaranth seed (Table 1). Higher concentration of fats was recorded in A. hypochondriacus L. but the difference from A. cruentus L. was not statistically significant. Obtained values are in agreement with those reported by Aufhammer et al. (1999), while Peterka et al. (2001) recorded a lower concentration of fats in grain amaranth seed. Concentration of fats in grain amaranth seed, on average from 78 to 81 g kg-1, is higher compared to other cereals that are more widely used in human diet. According to Grbeša (2004), the concentration of fats in wheat grain is 15 g kg-1, in maize grain 37 g kg-1, and in oat grain 42 g kg-1. Grain amaranth species did not differ significantly in the concentration of crude fibre (Table 1). Concentration of crude fibre recorded in our trial was lower compared to the results of Aufhammer et al. (1999) while the ash concentration was approximately the same. Starch concentration ranged on average from 620 to 625 g kg-1. Similar values for seed starch concentrations were obtained by Žajova et al., 2001. Concentration of total sugars determined in this study is similar to the total sugars concentration in wheat (Grbeša, 2004).</p><p id="Pg555">VII.

Other cereals have several times lower lysine concentration in grain.

Nitrogen fertilization (50 and 100 kg N ha-1) led to a significant increase in arginine and tyrosine concentrations. Amaranthus cruentus L. had significantly higher concentrations of valine and leucine (Table 2). Jamriška (1996) obtained an almost equal concentration of lysine, while concentrations of most other amino acids were higher than our research values. However, the values of amino acids concentrations obtained in our trial are higher compared to those of Bejosano and Corke (1998). Table 2.

The species did not differ in their seed chemical composition. The very favourable amino acid composition, notably the high concentration of essential amino acids, points to the high nutritive value of grain amaranth seed. Nitrogen fertilization caused a significant increase in arginine and tyrosine concentrations, while it had no influence on the concentrations of other amino acids. Amaranthus cruentus L. produced a significantly higher concentration of valine and leucine.

It unfavourably effects crop production and degrades soils. The EU included compaction as a dangerous threath on our soil cover in the proposal of the soil framework directive [COM(2006)232] to reduce the spread of harmful tendencies that are present nowadays.Present paper demonstrates a simple, but easy-to-use field method developed earlier in Germany, through the examination of soils of a recultivated strip mine territory. Our approach was to test the so called 'Packungsdichte' or packing density and to define the macromorphological characteristics of each compaction state. For this aim we have chosen a sampling site where soils were created and effected artificially. Keywords: soil compaction and compactness, soil micromorphology, World Youth Day 2005 Cologne Introduction For the World Youth Day in 2005, a 200 km-long temporary road was built near the city of Köln at an almost 300 hectare area of a former strip mine (Figure 1.). The subjected road was built to serve more than 1 million visitors. At the end of the event, in the autumn of 2005, the roads were demolished and the whole territory was brought under cultivation again. Despite of the carefull planning, significant soil compaction occured during the construction and use of the road and this phenomena should have been dissolved (Dumbeck, personal communication). For the simple examination of soil compactness, numerous prevalent method exists, eg.: penetrometer, bulk density measurement, macromorphological description, but we have chosen a simple practical method: the so called ’Packungsdichte’ (packing density), which is based on the analysis of soil structure. The degree of the soil compactness can be classified into a value scale from 1-5. This helps to define the sufficient degree of soil easing and the depth of melioration. To supplement our study, soil physical and micromorphology surveys were made to justify the field method. Soil compaction is a huge problem in agriculture. Generally it is a human-induced physical deviation that must be considered as a soil failure, because it seriously influences soil moisture regime (Várallyay 1996). Relevant damages caused by human activity is linked either to walking on wet soil surface (’squelching’ linked damage type) or cultivation processes (’cultivation’ linked damage type) (Birkás et al. 2006). Environmental and economical effects of soil compaction are serious (Gyuricza et al. 2007). As a result of soil degradation not only the degree of infiltration decreases, but nutrient uptake is limited, too. According to these phenomena, soil degradation is in close relation with the loss of crop yields (Várallyay 2006).</p><p id="Pg558">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1232 The EU, indentifying the problems of – cultivation linked – soil degradation processes – including the problem of soil compaction – developed a proposal for a soil framework directive [COM(2006)232] to reduce the spread of these harmful tendencies. A possible way to avoid this unpleasent soil property is to reduce the weight of agrotechnical machinery. Machines in agrotechnique are usually oversized and way too heavy, therefore it is a current topic to reduce machine weight (Samyn et al. 2007) Materials and methods The World Youth Day 2005 has taken place at one of the biggest recultivated area of Germany, which was brought under agricultural production again in 1983. During the recultivation the upper 150 cm deep layer has been exchanged with a mixture of loess and soil (80% loam; 15% clay and 5% sand), which served as a proper basis for crop cultivation. However, the artificial medium was suitable for cropping, the ’young soil’ was highly vulnerable for compaction. To arrange the ’mega’ event, suitable equipments and serving facilities had to be built together with roads that can serve highweighted trucks used for transportation. The road was built of geogitter protection foil, 45 cm thick coria layer and 2 cm-s of soft material to reach the best resistence against big weights. For the estimation of soil compaction the five-class scale was used based on the DIN 19682-10 German standard. Macroscopic observations were done on the profile in order to develop the ’field soil compactness scale’. The code PD1 is for the least compacted, while the code PD5, is for the most compacted state of soil. For the sampling for soil micromorphological examinations Kubiena-boxes (10x5 cm) were used. Samples were left to dry for 3 weeks, before emerging them into polyester resin (Hans 1974). Appart from the examiation of soil compaction, the bulk density of the samples has been defined with the help of Kraus-rings. Results and discussion The compaction of the soil could only be examined after the event was over and the roads have been deconconstructed. During the on-site macromorphological survey soils have been catagorised into one of the 5 categories of the so called ’Packungsdichte’ (packing density) by root density, by the size of aggregates, connection among structural elements, macropore size. The uppest layer was found to be PD5 – meaning that it belongs to the category of the most compacted soil states. On the compaction scale, this, the category 5 means the biggest problem. In these cases polyhedra-formed aggregates with sharp edges appear, which in this occasion, could not develop as the surface has only been covered by the road for a short period of time. However, traces and signs of reduction were detectable in this layer, which is typical for PD4 and PD5. Soil matrix turned into grey-greyish blue, whilst in root channels – where oxigen could access the soil – redish flecks developed. The most significant key of the layer were the occurence of parallel laminate structures. PD4 compaction was found 25 cm-s beneath the former road. The PD4 layer – lying right beneath the extremely compacted PD5 layer (1,85 g/cm3 bulk density) – can also cause the deformation and necrosis of plants. According to field observation, in these layers softer, slightly developed polyhedra structures appear (Figure 2.). 20-30% of the</p><p id="Pg559">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1233 voids were found to be between 6-10µm-s, so the question may sound logical; could the roots grow and live in lack of macropores? The total porosity of the layer is around 30%, which is not favourable for root growth at all. Voids in sample PD3 were between 50-300 µm-s, and they are almost circular in shape (2D description), while inner surfaces are absolutely smooth. Such structure with so high density do not develop in natural conditions. Probably air bubbles formed these even voids during the turbulation that occured when the recultivation works were done and structures remained after water evaporated. These are good indicators of soil compaction as their inner wall should have already been broken in case of mechanical pressure. So in this case, we could observe the soil’s self-compaction and not an artifical compactness caused by cultivation or any other impact. In lower layers and section of the profile PD2 compaction was observed, where apportionment of the roots were optimal and pores between aggregates appeared thicker, broader. Macropore rates were higher, which was easy to see from the many earthworm crotovinas occuring in the thin sections. Aggregation forms typical for recultivated soils were observed both macroscopically and microscopically. These rounded, often 1-2 cm sized forms are the result of the recultivation as well. Bulk density was 1,57 g/cm3 in this layer, which indicates low compactness state of the relevant layer. Figure 1. Road construction before the World Youth Day 2005 Figure 2. Polyehedra structure at PD4 According to the thin section the total porosity was 45%, which is favourable. Table 1.

In case of PD1 compactness state, the soil is rich in macropores, the cohesion between aggregates is small and can be characterised with favourable crumby structure. The best example for that is a mole-hill.</p><p id="Pg560">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1234 Conclusions Main causes of soil compaction is the mechanical pressure of tractors, engines and special heavy machinery (Kalácska et al. 2006). To define the state of compactness the ’Packungsdichte’ (packing density) field method can be easily utilized. On the basis of the additional examination of pore conditions and structure, soil micromorphology can be helpful. However, in many cases meliorative interventions and the precies level of soil compactness can only be be adjudged at the field. By virtue of on-site structural observations, we may draw the conclusion that; the more compacted the soil is, the less pore appears in the sample. However, soil micromorphology has pointed out the fact that in case of strong compaction many – surface parallel – pores may develop. Though these raise soil porosity, they are not favourable for roting processes. Furthermore, these appear only during dry conditions and ’dissolve’ as soon as water effects the profile. The life of a compacted layer depends on nature and human (Várallyay 2007). Soil cultivation and in general, tools of soil management are suitable means to solve problems originating in compactness, though inconsiderate usage of these tools may lead to higher demage in soil structure (Bádonyi 2006).

GYŐRI – Lajos BLASKÓ – Mária HORNOK – György ZSIGRAI – Nóra ŐRI Karcag Research Institute of University of Debrecen CASE, H-5300 Karcag Kisújszállási út 166., gyorizoltan@dateki.hu Abstract: Effect of sulphur fertilization on the chemical features of the tested soil and of the baking quality parameters of winter wheat and correlations between them were examined. It was established that the CHNS contents of the flour were in close positive correlation to the flour quality parameters generally used in the practice. Keywords: baking quality, CHNS contents, sulphur fertilization Introduction Soil sulphur deficiency is an increasing incident in Western Europe and in Hungary as well (Flaete et al. 2005). This may be derived from leaving the application of super phosphate fertilizers and the decrease of S-deposition from the air (Győri 1999). Anyway, reducing of fertilization is a tendency of the Hungarian crop production in spite of all the known positive effects of these chemicals on grain yield (Schrerer 2001, Pepó 2007). Although Hagel (2005) found no effects of any S-application on baking quality, several studies establish that applying gypsum as a fertilizer can result in higher grain yield and better quality (Wieser et al.2004, Mars 2006, Zia et al. 2007), whereas sulphur containing gluten proteins largely determine the baking quality of winter wheat Prange et al. 2001). Analyses showed that S status (S concentration and N:S ratio) was more influential on breadmaking quality (Zhao et al. 1999a) and on loaf volume (Zhao et al. 1999b) compared to grain N concentration. According to the observation of Győri (1999) the quality parameters of winter wheat flour are strongly dependent on the conditions of the cropping site. For mitigating the sulphur deficiency the gypsum application on arable lands seems to be a promising method, because it has effects on the soil structure and the Ca and S contents of soils. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of different gypsum doses on the C, H, N and S contents and the baking quality of winter wheat in the Middle-Tisza region. Materials and methods Our study was carried out on a meadow chernozem soil at Karcag. The soil is slightly acidic but has a significant potencial acidity. Its phosphorous and potassium supply is good. In this experiment we examined the effect of two gypsum doses (2 and 4 t ha-1) on the quality and CHNS content of the flour of 14 winter wheat varieties and lines. Samples from the yield of the plots were taken at harvest time and which were grinded with a laboratory mill. We established the following quality parameters: valorigraphic value, wet gluten content, gluten spreading, Zeleny sedimentation value and Hagberg falling number. The CHNS contents of the flour were determined with a Vario MACRO CHNS element analyzer. The concentrations of the combustion products were determined against sulfadiazine as a known standard. Soil samples were taken from the upper 20 cm of the soil of the plots after harvest. The acidity, hydrolytic acidity, humus content, AL-soluble P2O2, K2O, Ca, Mg, Na and SO4 2-</p><p id="Pg562">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1236 contents of the samples were determined according to the relevant standards (MSZ-080206-2, MSZ-20135). The experimental data were processed with the statistical methods of MANOVA and regression analyses. Results and discussion The results of the analysis of the soil samples taken from the plots treated with different gypsum doses are shown in Table 1. in the average of the examined varieties. It can be seen that statistically significant decreases of each pH value occurred as a result of the application of the larger gypsum dose. The value of hydrolytic acidity tended to increase as a result of the gypsum treatment, but the differences were not statistically significant. The humus matter content was not modified by the gypsum treatment as it was expected. Similarly to this observation we found no differences in the AL-soluble P2O2 and K2O contents. The process leading to the decrease of the AL-soluble Ca content of the soil in the case of gypsum application could not be discovered. Further examinations are necessary to solve this problem. While the Mg content of the soil showed decreasing tendency as a result of the gypsum treatments, the AL-soluble Na content did not change. The sulphate fertilization resulted in an increase of SO4 2- content of the soil, but these changes were not statistically significant. Differences between the SO4 2- contents of the plots treated with different gypsum doses were significant only at the probability level of 10 %. Table 1.

Such quality parameters were the valorigraphic value, the gluten content, the Zeleny sedimentation value and the Hagberg falling number. Except for the gluten spreading and the falling number, the observed differences were statistically significant in the cases of all parameters. The values of all parameters increased as a result of the application of the bigger gypsum dose and showed numerical values similar to the observed ones in the cases of the control plots. We found consequent changes (increase) caused by the sulphate fertilization only in the case of gluten spreading. There were significant differences between the flour quality of the examined winter wheat varieties and lines. In our opinion, the different genetic backgrounds could play the main role in the development of these differences.</p><p id="Pg563">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1237 We established that the changes of the N and S contents of the flour samples were similar to the changes in the case of the tested flour quality parameters described above. The concentration of these elements decreased significantly as a result of the 2 t CaSO4 ha-1 treatment comparing to the control. But, this unfavourable effect was compensated by the further increase of the gypsum dose. While significant differences were observed between the wheat varieties in the case of the flour C content, the C and H contents of the flour did not vary significantly as an effect of the sulphate fertilization treatments.

All the observed correlations between the tested features were linear except for the correlations between the S content and Zeleny sedimentation value, and between the S content and the Hagberg falling number. Conclusions On the basis of the experimental data it was established that significant changes occurred in the values of some chemical parameters of the soil caused by the small dose sulphur fertilization, of which the decrease of the AL-soluble P content and the increase of acidity and sulphate concentration can be mentioned first of all. While the values of the examined flour quality parameters were reduced by the smaller sulphate treatment, the bigger gypsum dose influenced them positively. The effect of the different genetic background of the tested varieties was well traceable in the case of all the examined parameters. The CNS contents of the flour were in close, and in the most part of the cases, positive linear correlation with the flour quality parameters.

So, the further development of the fertilisation technologies is still one of the most important tasks of the scientists of agronomy and agrochemistry. The latest results of the National Uniformed Long-Term Fertilisation Experiments at Karcag concerning the effects NPK fertilisation on different chemical properties of the soil are summarized in this article. Keywords: long-term artificial fertilisation, soil acidification, readily available element content Introduction Significant changes could occur in the direction and the intensity of some soil chemical processes caused by regular artificial fertilisation. Fertilisation has effects on the availability of nutrients and on the nutrient supply of crops through the modification of the soil pH and the interaction of nutrients (Blaskó, 2006, Blaskó et al. 2006). Longterm fertilisation experiments provide important information for the further development of sort- and site-specific fertilisation technologies. Results of such kind of experiments related to changes of soil parameters and nutrient availability were summarized by Blaskó and Zsigrai (2003), Csathó et al. (2007), Debreczeniné et al. (2003), Kádár and Holló (2006), Kádár et al. (2007), Kismányoki et al. (2003), Loncaric et al. (2007), Rastija et al. (2007), Szabó and Szegi (2006) and Zsigrai (1999, 2001). The latest results of the National Uniformed Long-Term Fertilisation Experiments (NULTFE) at Karcag concerning the effects of regular NPK fertilisation on different chemical features of the tested soil are introduced in this paper. Materials and methods The effect of NPK fertilisation on the chemical features of the soil was tested on a deeply humic meadow chernozem soil, solonetzic in the deeper layers at Karcag in 2006. The experiment was executed in the framework of the NULTFE with the maize hybrid PR 38A24. The processed fertilisation treatment number was 18 in 4 repetitions. The applied fertiliser doses were published previously in the following papers: Zsigrai (1999, 2001). The soil samples were taken after the harvesting period. After the preparation of the soil samples, the following parameters were determined according to the relevant standards (MSZ-08-0206-2, MSZ 20135): pH(H2O), pH(KCl), humic matter content, AL-soluble P2O5, K2O, Ca, Mg-content, potential acidity (y1), KCl+EDTA soluble Na, Mn, Cu and Zn-content. The experimental data were processed with the statistical methods of MANOVA.</p><p id="Pg566">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

It seems to be a very important result, that the meliorative liming of 11.05 t CaCO3 ha -1 carried out in 1999 had significant pH and hydrolytic acidity (y1) regulation effects even after 7 years. Their average values proved to be 1.7 and 18.3 units respectively. The experimental results of the vegetation period in 2006 could be regarded as a milestone, because it was the first time when statistically significant differences were found between the humic matter contents of the soil samples originated from the plots treated with big N-doses and from the non-treated ones. While the control plots contained 2.44% humic matters, the humic matter content of the plots regularly treated with 100 kg N ha-1 dose was 0.1% higher. In our opinion, the observed difference was not due to the N fertilisation, but rather due to the decrease of the organic colloid content of the control plots caused by the absence of regular fertilisation. The further rise of the N dose resulted in the decrease of humic matter content of 0.07-0.08%, which exceeded the amount of the biggest difference (0.05%), still attributable to the experimental error. We must mention that the byproducts were harvested in each vegetation period, so their biomass could not influence the organic matter content of the soil. The readily available nutrient contents of the soil increased significantly due to the regular fertilisation. This observation met the requirements well. In accordance with other scientific observations reported in different papers, the meliorative liming raised the AL-soluble P2O5 content of the soil, which was due to the intensification of the Pmineralizing microbiological processes caused by the liming. Contrary to that, in the case of liming the AL-soluble K2O content of the soil decreased by 20 mg K2O kg -1, which could be correlated with the new equilibrium of the absorption circumstances</p><p id="Pg567">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1241 evolved after the meliorative liming. While the big N-doses and the K-fertilisation reduced the AL-soluble Ca content of the soil, the P-fertilisation raised it significantly. It was due to the fact that the superphosphate applied for P-fertilisation contained significant amount of gypsum as secondary substance besides the monocalciumphosphate. The Ca-content of the gypsum resulted in the increase of the AL-soluble Ca content of the soil during the experimental period. The observed changes of the ALsoluble Mg content of the soil caused by the fertilisation treatments were similar to the changes of the Ca content. The N- and the K-fertilisation reduced the Mg content. Contrary to the results observed in the case of Ca content, the P-fertilisation reduced the AL-soluble Mg content of the soil as well, because the superphosphate did not contain Mg of significant amount. The KCl+EDTA soluble Mn content of the soil was raised by the NK-fertilisation but not modified by the P-fertilisation. The meliorative liming reduced the readily available Mn content of the soil by rising the pH value, which has an important effect on the solubility of different Mn compounds. The KCl+EDTA soluble Cu and Zn contents were not modified by either the applied fertiliser treatments or the chemical amelioration. This finding is in contradiction to the earlier observation regarding to the fact that the young maize standings of the experimental plots treated with big P-doses showed typical symptoms of Zn deficiency (Figure 1). Figure 1. Symptoms of Zn deficiency of a young maize standing It may be hypothesized that the observed problems in the Zn supply of the plants were not caused only by the decrease in the readily available Zn content of the soil (as it could be expected), but also the Zn uptake of the plants was retarded by the high Pconcentration of the soil solution. The long-term fertilisation did not result in significant</p><p id="Pg568">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1242 changes in the toxic element content of the soil. Activity increase originated in the soil acidification was observable only in the case of the Mn and Al contents. Conclusions We established that the long-term artificial fertilisation had significant effects on the readily available nutrient contents and on the soil acidity. The meliorative liming had significant pH and hydrolytic acidity regulation effects even after 7 years under the circumstances of the experiment. The experimental data proved that the humic matter content of the soil can decrease significantly if the soil is not treated with N fertiliser for a long time. The KCl+EDTA soluble element contents of the soil were in accordance with the expectations.

Using pea as a forecrop at a low nutrient level led to a higher yield than in the case of maize as a forecrop. The highest yield was observed at the N50-150+PK (7035-8657 kg ha -1 ) fertilizer dose after pea, while at the N100-200+PK (5448-8352 kg ha -1 ) fertilizer level after maize. In the droughty cropyear of 2006-07 a 2,5 times (2775 kg ha -1 ) higher yield level was realized without irrigation at the control field after pea (that withdrowes less moisture from the soil) than after maize. Application of 10 mm irrigation water produced a 1146-2480 kg ha -1 yield surplus. Our results showed the importance of careful selection of forecrop plant that could significantly reduce our expenses. Keywords: winter wheat, forecrop, fertilization, irrigation, yield Introduction Cereals are the most important cultivars determining the plant cultivation in Hungary. Winter wheat is widely cultivated in almost every enterprise or farm. The level of production, the average yield and the economical efficiency depends on the ecological conditions of the field and on the appropriate selection of the biological basis and the agrotechnical elements. Among those factors biological basis and agrotechnics could be controlled and their wilful application could realize higher yield and best quality. Optimization of crops structure is an important factor in the preservation of soil fertility. The proper forecrop could increase the nutrient supply of the soil (Kraljevic, 2007). In the case of winter wheat fertilization is also the most effective tool for yield- increasing. (Ágoston, 2006; Zsigrai and Őri, 2006; Bertic et al. 2007; Pepó, 2007; Varga et al. 2007). Among the N-P-K fertilizers nitrogen results the greatest yield increase in wheat (Baric et al. 2007). In our country wheat is irrigated in only special cases because of economical reasons. The benefits of irrigation could be expected only at proper nutrient supply. With appropriate irrigation technology an 500-2000 kg ha-1 yield surplus could be achieved. Forecrop (depending on the rate of water withdrawal from the soil) significantly influences the efficiency of irrigation. After a forecrop of high water demand (such as maize) the yield surplus could reach the amount of 2000 kg ha-1 (Ruzsányi, 1991). Materials and methods The research was conducted in the growing seasons of 2004-2007, after forecrops of maize and peas on five different fertilizer levels (control, N50+PK, N100+PK, N150+PK, N200+PK), by using average plant protection technology (herbicid + 1x fungicide) and in cropyear 2007 three irrigation variations (without irrigation, irrigated with 50 mm, irrigated with 100 mm), at Látókép Experimental Station of the University of Debrecen, Centre of Agriculture under the polifactor long-term experiment adjusted by professor László Ruzsányi in 1983.

Results and discussion In our experiment during 2004-07 the effects of forecrop, nutrient supply and irrigation were studied on the yield formation of winter wheat. In each examined year of the four we examined higher yields after pea as a forecrop (2004: 7042-8543 kg ha-1, 2005: 7384-8657 kg ha-1, 2006: 4973-7035 kg ha-1, 2007: 4583-8319 kg ha-1) than after maize (2004: 2564-7647 kg ha-1, 2005: 3299-8352 kg ha-1, 2006:2563-7052 kg ha-1, 2007:1808-7562 kg ha-1). The difference between the two forecrop manifested mostly in the yields of the control field and that of the field treated with N50+PK fertilizer dose. The yield surplus after pea was 2410-4478 kg ha-1 in the case of Ø treatment while it was 1755-3566 kg ha-1 in the case of N50+PK treatment. Higher fertilizer doses however produced decreased differences between the yields of the stocks after the two different forecrop plant, since the yield production after pea was decreased and the unfavourable effect of maize forecrop was reduced by higher nutrient doses (Figure 1.). 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 Ø N50 N100 N150 N200 Ø N50 N100 N150 N200 maize forecrop pea forecrop y ie ld k g h a -1 2004 2005 2006 2007 Figure 1. Effects of fertilization and forecrop on the yield of winter wheat (Debrecen, 2004-2007) The yields gradually increased with the increasing nutrient doses. The stocks after pea as a forecrop produced the highest yield at N50+PK (8543-8657 kg ha -1) nutrient level during 2004-05 and at N150+PK (7035-7095 kg ha -1) during 2006-07. After maize as a forecrop the highest yield formation was experienced at N100+PK (7647-8352 kg ha -1) during 2004-05, at N200+PK (7052 kg ha -1) during 2006 and at N150+PK (5448 kg ha -1) during 2007. Greater nutrient doses however resulted reduced yield. The maximum yield was 2.5-3.1 times higher than that of the control in the case of maize forecrop while 1.2-1.6 times higher in the case of pea forecrop. In the droughty cropyear of 2006-07 we applied different irrigation treatments on April 23 and on May 23-24. The I1 irrigation treatment was not irrigated, the highest yield</p><p id="Pg571">VII.

An amount of 2*25 mm water was applied in the case of I2 irrigation treatment. The maximum yield was observed at N200+PK (7336 kg ha -1) fertilizer level in the case of maize forecrop while at N100+PK (7959 kg ha -1) fertilizer level in the case of pea forecrop. 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 Ø N50 N100 N150 N200 y ie ld k g h a -1 I1 I2 I3 I Figure 2.

Cereal Research Communications 1246 Conclusions During all the four years of our research work cultivars produced a higher grain yield after pea than after maize as a forecrop. The yield surplus after pea as a forecrop was 2410-4478 kg ha-1. The maximum yield of wheat stocks was achieved with N50 and N150+PK fertilizer rate after pea while with N100-200+PK fertilizer rate after maize. Fertilization resulted in a 4489-5053 kg ha-1 yield surplus after maize forecrop and 1273-2862 kg ha-1 after pea forecrop. Application of 50 mm irrigation water increased the yield with 2254 kg ha-1 after maize forecrop and with 1086 kg ha-1 after pea forecrop 2254 kg ha-1, while treatment with 100 mm irrigation water led to a 2480 kg ha-1 yield surplus after pea and 1446 kg ha-1 after maize. The unfavourable effect of maize forecrop could be reduced with a higher fertilizer dose and trough irrigation during the droughty seasons.

The tools we used for the measurement were developed further; hence their test was our goal as well. The alternative soil cultivation methods based on the reduced disturbance of the soil create different structural state and organic matter content in the soil comparing to conventional tillage systems. There is close correlation between CO2-emission from the soil and the soil state determined by the tillage operations, hence by measuring the CO2-emission the effect of various tillage operations as the elements of different soil cultivation systems on the microbiological activity of the soil can be judged. Contrary to our previous results and the literature data, the highest values of CO2-emission were measured in the conventionally ploughed treatment. Nevertheless correlation could be figured out between the degree of disturbance and the CO2-emission of the soil. On the base of our experiences gained from the test of the newly developed measurement tool it can be concluded that an effective and handy set is at our disposal to continue the project. Keywords: CO2-emission, soil tillage systems Introduction All over the world several soil cultivation methods were studied in order to investigate their effects on soil state and properties including the water balance of the soil (UNGER and PARKER, 1976; AASE and TANAKA, 1987; STEINER, 1989;. BIRKÁS et al., 2006, BIRKÁS et al., 2007). According to research results mulching and residue management can effectively decrease evaporation, even up to 43 % comparing to bare soil surface (SAUER et al., 1996). In the Department for Soil Utilisation and Rural Development of Karcag Research Institute of the University of Debrecen, Centre of Agricultural Sciences in close co-peration with the Department of Water- and Environmental Management broad examination of new soil tillage methods was started in 1997 based on the research achievements gained in the past decades (FORGÁCS et al.,). As the soil - besides the climate and weather - is one of the main factors of production, which basically determines the quality and economical conditions of production, the knowledge of the effects of plant production on soil is very important. Among the land use practices the soil cultivation has the most radical effects on soil properties. Beyond investigating the effect of reduced tillage systems on the water balance of the soil, measuring the CO2-emission from the soil can also provide several valuable information in the respect of soil utilisation. Materials and methods In order to determine the effects of the different soil tillage operations as the elements of the prospective reduced tillage systems, we designed and set a new, hopefully longterm, experiment in 2007. The experiment was set on a plot of 9.4 ha divided into four sub-plots according to the treatments. In this experiment tillage systems of direct seeding and reduced tillage based on mulching were compared to the conventional cultivation system based on ploughing. The soil type of the investigated plot is meadow</p><p id="Pg574">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1248 chernozem solonetzic in the deeper layers, a soil type that is characteristic for the TransTisza Region of Hungary. Previously winter barley occupied the plot, after harvesting it, the soil tillage opearations were carried out as the treatments of the experiment. In the case of conventional tillage all the crop residues were baled and removed from the subplot, then millet was sown conventionally. In the reduced tillage treatments direct seeding was used but three different methods were applied regarding the fate of the crop residues: all residues remained (mulch), remaining mulch and application of a mulch tiller and pure direct seeding with no mulching. The treatments of the experiment are summarised in Table 1. Table 1. Treatments of the soil tillage experiment TREATMENTS mulch, direct seeding mulch, mulchtiller, direct seeding direct seeding conventional tillage One fraction of the experiment is to investigate the CO2-emission from the soil and the soil state determined by the tillage operations, hence by measuring the CO2-emission the effect of various tillage operations as the elements of different soil cultivation systems on the microbiological activity of the soil can be judged. In order to quantify this, in situ CO2-emission of the soil was measured by means of an ANAGAS 98 infrared gas analyser. For the spatial delimitation of the measuring area the original cylinders (ZSEMBELI et al., 2005) were subsited with a newly developed frame+bowl set (Figure 1.). Six sets were constructed, hence we could measure in two different points at the same time. There are several methods and tools for the delimitation of the measuring area. In Hungary TÓTH and KOÓS (2006) also developed their own technique, that also accommodate to the requirements of the measuring environment. Figure 1. The new set of the frame+bowl method Results and discussion The CO2-emission values calculated for the soil tillage experimet set on parcel I-2 are summarised in Fig. 2. The data of four measurement dates are indicated, these four measurements were carried out between the middle of June and middle of July, a onemonth-long period directly following the sowing of millet. Our goal involved the</p><p id="Pg575">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1249 determinaton of the differences due to the treatments as well as the duration of their effect. The first measurement was done directly after the set of the treatments, the other three occassions follwed the first approximately every ten days. As the microbiological activity of the soil, hence its CO2-emission are in strong correlation to the moisture content of the soil, we took the amount of precipitation fallen int he investigated period into consideration. In June, before the start of the measurements, 12.8 mm of rainfall was detected, between the first and the second measurements 18.9 mm, while 9.5 mm and 33 mm between the second and the third and between the last two ones respectively. These amounts, which are considered high int he summer period, ensured the relatively high values of CO2-emission along the investigated period. Our data, gained in other experiments previously, showed that in dry periods the CO2-emission increasing effect of different soil cultivation operations lasts 6-10 days only. This duration is in correspondence with the literature data (FRANZLUEBBERS et al., 2000; FIERER and SCHIMEL, 2003). Nevertheless Figure 2. shows no significant decrease in the absolute values, but the differences originating from the soil tillage treatments were remaining during the investigated period. In accordance with the literature, all the tillage operations induced increased CO2-emission. The highest values were detected int he case of the conventionally cultivated, in other words ploughed plot, and this highest value was characteristic all along the investigated period. This was an unexpected result as reduced tillage is considered to be resulted in higher emission. Of course the shortness of the investigated period and the high amount of precipitation can not let us to conclude general conclusions, but there is no doubt that we gained remarkable results about the correlation between the soil status and the CO2-emission from the soil. These results motivate us to continue our investigations. 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 15th June 25th June 3rd July 13th July C O 2 -e m is s io n ( g *m -2 *h -1 ) mulch+direct seeding mulch+muchtiller+direct seeding direct seeding conventional till Figure 2. CO2-emissions int he soil tillage experiment Comparing the treatments with direct seeding, we gained the expected results as the lowest emission values chatacterised the pure direct seeding treatment with no soil cover or mulching. These lowest values were characteristic during the whole investigation period, and could be explained with the lowest soil moisture values (app. 7 v% lower than in the mulched versions) measured in this plot originating from the lack</p><p id="Pg576">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1250 of the soil protective cover layer. In close correlation with the low soil moisture content, the highest values of soil temperature were detected in this treatment, 4-5 oC higher than in the mulched plots. The high temperature induces higher evaporation loss and the lack of moisture in the soil is unfavourable for the microbiological activity, hence results in lower CO2-emission. We compared the two versions of mulching as well. Due to the application of the mulch-tiller, a significant portion of the plant residues remained on the soil surface after the harvest was mixed into the upper 10 cm of th soil. This procedure does not result in such a soil cover as pure mulching without tillage application, but it has favourable effect on the soil structure enriching the soil in air and organic material. Nevertheless we expected higher values of CO2-emission on the base of our last experiences. Conclusions Our objective that we intented to gain more detailed information on the dynamics of CO2-emission from the soil in-situ measurements was reached, but at the same time the unexpected results motivate us to go on with the measurements. Contrary to our previous results and the literature data, the highest values of CO2-emission were measured in the conventionally ploughed treatment. Nevertheless correlation could be figured out between the degree of disturbance and the CO2-emission of the soil. The newly developed tools we used for the measurement proved to be effective and handy, so they can be advised for measurements with similar purposes. References Aase, J.K. – Tanaka, D.L.: 1987.

Keywords: sorghum, bio-energy, tillage, sugar yield Introduction On the Great Hungarian Plain the most important ecological factors limiting plant production are the frequently occuring drought (VÁRALLYAY et al, 2007; FARKAS et al, 2005) and the big territory of problematic (acidification, salt accumulation, compaction) soils (VÁRALLYAY, 2006). When producing energy crops, besides the adaptability of plants, the energy balance of production must be taken into account. The main possibilities of mitigating the input energy of plant production are the reduced tillage (BIRKÁS, 2006; JUG et al, 2006) and the breeding of varieties suitable for low input agriculture (UPTMOOR et al, 2006). Sorghum seems to be a promising candidate for energy plants because it is a C4 plant with high net assimilation rate. The crop shows a good adaptability to many types of soils, and it is resistant to saline soils. In the Karcag Research Institute sweet sorghum as an alcohol source was introduced by KAPOCSI et al (1984). The investigated sweet sorghum yielded 50-60 t/ha fresh biomass. Pressing out the green-mass they could produce 17-20 t/ha juice of 10-16% sugar content. In the juice there was 2000-3500 kg sugar. The highest alcohol yield was 1372 l absolute alcohol/ha. Sorghum has the 5th biggest production area in the world (NÉMETH, 2006). Materials and methods To asses the response of sweet sorghum to low-input cultivation, a field experiment was carried out at Karcag in the framework of a long-term reduced tillage experiment established by Nyíri in 1997, on a meadow chernozem soil. The main plot treatments were two tillage variants: traditional tillage with ploughing (Rabawerk 6/5, working depth 22 cm) and reduced tillage using machines that ensure the improvement of the compacted soil structure (JD-510 Disk Ripper, working depth disc: 15 cm, ripper: 38 cm) and a special sowing machine (JD 1750). The experimental territory for the conventional tillage is 3.5 ha and 12.5 ha for the reduced tillage. In 2007 half of the area was used for sweet sorghum production. Different genotypes of sorghum (Monori édes, Róna 1, Cellu) were the sub-plot variants. The amount of precipitation in 2007 - in particular in early spring and during summer - was less than the 50-year-average (Table 1.). Table 1.

Cereal Research Communications 1252 On each sub-plot 9 sampling plots of 10 m2 were formed for measuring the productivity of sweet sorghum, and 9 sampling points of 2 m2 for measuring the juice and sugar content. For measuring the juice content, the sorghum was chopped with AL-KO dynamic H1600 and pressed with press machine STM Bologna AMP/E∙50/2. Results and discussion According to the measured data the tillage with traditional ploughing and seedbed preparation costs 2456 MJ/ha, on the other hand the input energy requirement of reduced tillage is 904 MJ/ha (Forgács and Czimbalmos, 2008). Tuba et al (2006) measured higher moisture content in the soil of reduced tillage variant compared to the ploughed one in this experiment. Similar to the antecedents in 2007 in sowing time (04.26.) of sweet sorghum the moisture content in the soil with reduced tillage was somewhat higher than in the ploughed one (Table 2.). Table 2.

Plant density in different tillage variants The emergence of plants was similar in both tillage variants, consequently there were not significant differences in the plant density either (Figure 1.). Three different sweet sorghum and one fibre-type hybrids were compared. Two of them (Monori édes, Róna 1) are hybrids with a short vegetation period. The hybrid “Cellu” is for sugar and fibre production. It has a long vegetation period. The types of different vegetation periods showed different sugar accumulation processes. The sugar content of juice in sweet sorghums with short vegetation period reached a maximum Brix-value at the end of September, whereas the sweet sorghum with long vegetation period showed a linear increasing sugar content until the end of October (Figure 2., 3..). The fresh material yield was the highest in the case of the sweet sorghum with long vegetation period. The influence of tillage on the green mass was not significant.

The juice content of each hybrid was somewhat higher in the crops grown on the soil cultivated with reduced tillage. The higher juice production was always connected with lower sugar content. The only significant negative effect of reduced tillage was the reduction of the Brix-value. Because of the opposite changes of the juice production and the sugar content, the tillage did not cause any difference in the sugar yield. There was significant difference between the sugar yields of sweet sorghums with short vegetation period. Considering the sugar yield, the better hybrid of short vegetation period was comparative with the hybrid with long vegetation period (Figure 4.).

Cereal Research Communications 1254 Conclusions The sweet sorghum can be produced in low input cultivation system without significant decrease of sugar yield and with non significant decrease of bagasse yield. For producing alcohol from juice the hybrid of short vegetation period is more suitable, whereas for producing first (from juice) and second generation of alcohol (from cellulose and hemicellulose) and biogas production the hybrid of long vegetation period can be more economical. The sugar and bagasse production of the hybrid with short vegetation period is not endangered by frost, which is usual in Hungary in early October.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1255 EVALUATION OF SWEET SORGHUM LINES FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF BIOETHANOL AND CELLULOSE PRODUCTION Károly ANTAL – Éva Babett ÁBRAHÁM - Lajos BLASKÓ – István BALOGH Karcag Research Institute of DU CASE; H-5300 Karcag, Kisújszállási út 166., abrahameva@dateki.hu Abstract: Inbred sugar sorghum lines (Sorghum bicolour L/Moench.) were examined in the point of view sugar and cellulose production for breeding hybrids for energetic utilization. We measured the sugar content of 32 lines by refractometric method, and the cellulose content of 53 inbred lines by acidic digestion method. Keywords: sorghum, cellulose examination, cellulose content, sugar content Introduction Bioethanol from biomass resources can be an excellent renewable alternative for energy (Voća et al., 2007, Sípos et al., 2007). Bioethanol can be stirred with petrol in 10-15% but after the transformation of the engine the vehicle can be operated with bioethanol too (Sárvári et al., 2006). Ethyl alcohol can be made from saccharose or from polisaccharides (starch, cellulose, inulin) (Szakál et al., 2007). In Hungary the growing area of sweet sorghum is very small, but it can grow in the future because of its high sugar content (Németh, 2006). In Hungary Kapocsi et al. (1984) dealt with the sugar production for the first time. According to their experiment, there is 2,000-3,500 kg ha1 sugar in the pressed sorghum juice depending on the variety. Above the sugar content of sorghum, the starch, the cellulose and hemicellulose contents are important too. The sugar content of stem ranged between 13.4% to 20.2%, and the sugar yield ranged from 2.3 t ha-1 to 5.7 t ha-1 in the experiment of Smilovenko and Poida (1999). Lignocellulosic agricultural by-products are a copious and cheap source for cellulose fibres, in addition, bio-fibers can also be used to produce fuel (Reddy-Yang, 2005). For assay cellulose, there are more alternatives, acidic (Chauvelon et al., 2000) and basic methods (Norman and Jenkins, 1933). In the examination of Gontijo-Neto et al. (2004) the evaluated hybrids showed significant differences among hemicellulose (28.56 to 33.87%), cellulose (19.20 to 24.34%) and lignin (6.04 and 6.51%) contents. In the trial of Pedreira et al. (2003) the cellulose content changed between 25.3 and 31.2%, and the lignin content from 3.6 to 5.5%. The role and weight of every agrotechnical elements could be modified by the intensity of crop management (Pepó, 2007). Amaducci et al (2004) examined the chemical composition of sorghum at low- and normal-input agriculture. Due to their examination, input level had never influenced the chemical composition of fibre. Materials and methods In the course of research inbred sweet sorghum lines (Sorghum bicolour L/Moench.) were examined for the sake of selection lines for breeding hybrids of high stem sugar content and high cellulose content. The sugar content was measured with refractometer from the stem between the 3rd and 4th nodes. We measured the sugar content of 32 lines. 4 plants per lines were examined from 20th July till 5th November at 11 occasions.</p><p id="Pg582">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1256 Three times (1st part of September, 1st part of October, 3rd part of October) the whole sorghum plants were examined. We measured the weight of the plants, the weight of the stem juice and the pellet from 53 inbred lines. The date of the first frost was 14th October. For the examination of fibre, 4 sorghum plants (without the panicle) were chopped with AL-KO dynamic H1600 and pressed with S.T.M Bologna AMP/E 50/2. The amount of juice and the pellet was measured. For assaying cellulose we used acidic method: 1 gram dried plant pattern was measured into 500 ml retort in. 20 ml ethyl alcohol 96% and 5 ml nitric acid 65% were added to each sample. After the measurement the samples were digested at 100 oC (± 5 oC) for twenty minutes. When the sample got colder, it was filtered with porous glass filter (G2) and the remainings were washed with special solvent (ethanol and nitric acid in 5:1 ratio) and were put into oven to dry at 105 oC (± 5 oC) for 2 hours. After drying the weight of cellulose mass was measured. The amount of cellulose was expressed in the total dry matter of the pellet. We could examine the cellulose content only for the 1st sampling date in 3 replications till now. The evaluation of the results was done by means of two-way ANOVA analysis with Microsoft Excel 2003 and SPSS for Windows 13.0.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1257 reached 18% at the end of August, at the saturation of grain, and was the highest after the first frost. The sugar content of ZKR-295 and ZKR 162 was about 19-20% on 10th August, just after blooming. The total weight of the 4 processed sorghum plants in the average of the examined lines were 2.40, 2.61 and 2.01 kg at the 3 sampling time, respectively. The total weight at the 3rd sampling time was the lowest because the water content decreased after the frost.The juice content of stem was 0.89 kg at the 1st, and 0.81 kg at the end 2nd measurement, and reduced to 0.56 kg after the frost. Projecting these values for the whole plant, the juice content of the total weight was 37% in the 1st decade of September, and decreased to 30% to the end of September, and was only 27% in the end of October. The average production of sugar was 0.13 kg at the 1st and the 2nd measurement, and it fell to 0.10 kg for the end of October. The weight of the juice of the ZKR-251 (1.86 kg) and the ZKR-186 (1.71 kg) was salient in the average of the 3 sampling dates. At the beginning of September the weight of the juice was higher in the case of ZKR 305, ZKR-117 and ZKR-136. By the end of September the juice content of ZKR-251 was outstandingly high (2.57 kg), and after the frost the highest weight was only 1.62 kg (ZKR-186). Regarding the sugar production, the order was the same; the sugar production of ZKR-251 (0.31 kg) and the ZKR-186 (0.29 kg) was the highest, but there was not such a big difference between the lines, like there was in the juice content. Table 1 shows the comparison of the best lines according to sugar content and sugar production, and the change of the variables. The average cellulose content of the dried pellet of the examined lines was 47.47% (SD5%=3.60%). The cellulose content of ZKR-158 (52.70%), ZKR-205 (52.48%) ZKR252 (51.11%) ZKR-307 (50.17%) ZKR-201 (50.00%) and ZKR-255 (49.94%) was salient. Calculating the cellulose content of the pellet for the whole plant, the average cellulose production of the 4 chopped plants was 0.17 kg. The cellulose production of the ZKR-136 (0.41 kg), ZKR-150 (0.39 kg) and ZKR-195 (0.39 kg) was significantly higher than of the other lines. Table 1.

Breeding for high sugar production, the ZKR-251, ZKR-186, ZKR-117, ZKR-311, ZKR-305 are suitable. ZKR-158, ZKR-205, ZKR-252 and ZKR-307 are good bases to breed for high cellulose content. Regarding the process of sugar accumulation in time, there are different types of sorghum lines. One group can be characterized with continuously increasing sugar content (ZKR-295), and one group shows a maximum at the end of September, and after reaching the maximum there is a decrease (ZKR-1999), and maybe there are sorghum lines with 2 peaks. These different types of lines can be used to breed hybrids with different lengths of growing period. In the production of plants for energy, the postponement of consuming time is important.

Liebig-Weg 6, D-18051 Rostock, Germany, bettina.eichler@uni-rostock.de 2 Research Center of Center for Agricultural Sciences and Engineering of University of Debrecen, makadim@freemail.hu 3 Department of Agricultural Chemistry and Soil Science, Faculty of Agricultural Science, University of Debrecen, Hungary, vago@agr.unideb.hu Abstract: The reutilization of residues of the bio-energy processes in crop production is important to realize nutrient cycling in agriculture. Studying the effect of these residues, the nutrient contents of four ashes remained from combustion process of different biomasses were analysed as well as the effect of a selected poultry litter ash on plant and soil characteristic in pot experiment. For all ashes the very high percentage of the total phosphorus (P) was found in a good available form for plant uptake. All ashes increased the yield and P uptake of test plants as well as the soil pH. The use of secondary raw materials in agriculture provides an opportunity for waste recycling and an adequate substitute for commercial P fertilizers. Keywords: phosphorus, poultry litter ash, P pool Introduction The use of biomass as a source of energy (bio-energy) will probably tripled in the next years up to 2020. That means that the amount of residues of the bio-energy processes will increase as well. The reutilization of these residues in crop production is an important matter to save fertilizers and to realize nutrient cycling in agriculture. Generally, applying fertilizers affects not only on the nutrient content of soil, but as well the corresponding soil parameters, which may influence the nutrient status in soil again (Kátai, 2006; Kádár, 2007). This may have special importance for the application of secondary row materials, since they are usually a mixture of different base materials and may differ very much in their composition. Biomass ashes are probably the oldest mineral fertilizers in the world. It contains nearly all nutrients except nitrogen (N). This has especially importance for phosphorus (P) since the P resources worldwide are limited and the prices for commercial P fertilizers continue increasing. Alternative sources of fertilization, like biomass ashes, may help to improve the plant P nutrition (Bhattacharya and Chattopadhyay, 2002; Uckert, 2004). However, beside nutrients secondary raw materials like biomass ashes may contain harmful substances, mainly heavy metals. Therefore other elements in waste materials will have to be examined closely to avoid drawbacks of the application of residues. At the Rostock Institute of Land Use, the nutrient contents of different unloaded biomass ashes were analyzed as well as the effect of a selected poultry litter ash on plant and soil characteristics. Materials and methods Four ashes remained from combustion process of different biomasses (poultry litter, rape meal, cereal whole plants, and wood) were analyzed for the P contents with different extracting agents; water, double lactate, citric acid, and aqua regia.</p><p id="Pg586">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1260 Furthermore, a pot experiment with poultry litter ash was conducted in summer 2005. Different crops were cultivated in 6 kg soil in Mitscherlich pots for 2 month (see Tab. 1). Before sowing the nutrient solution and the ash were supplied. For control no P was added. For the second treatment P was added in high soluble form (KH2PO4) and for the third treatment P was added with poultry litter ash. This ash remained from combustion process in a special SFBC combustion plant (Small scale fluidized bubbling bed Combustion Plants). Water was supplied according the plant needs using deionized water. Plant and soil samples were collected and stored for further analyses. The P content in plant tissue was measured after dry ashing using the vanadatemolybdate method (Page et al., 1982). The P uptake was calculated by multiplying yield and P content of plant tissue. Various methods were used to determine the P contents of the soil. For water extractable P (Pw) the method of Van der Paauw (1971) was used. P concentration in the extract was determined by the phosphomolybdate blue method applied to flow injection analysis with a Tecator FIAstar 5010 colorimeter. The double lactate extractable P (Pdl) content as well as pH (CaCl2) were determined by routine methods as described by Blume et al. (2000). The oxalate soluble content of P, Al and Fe in soil (Pox, Alox, Feox) (Schwertmann, 1964) were extracted by shaking 2 g of soil samples in acid oxalate solution (100 ml) for one hour in the dark. Elemental concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectrometry. With these data the P sorption capacity (PSC [mmol kg-1] = (Alox + Feox) / 2) and the degree of P saturation (DPS [%] = Pox / PSC * 100) were calculated (Schoumans, 2000). The chemical analyses for heavy metal concentration of ashes were carried out by LUFA Rostock applying standard procedures. All heavy metal contents were explicit below the threshold values. The least significant difference (LSD) test at p&lt;0.05 was used to compare means of soil and plant parameters (ANOVA). Table 1: Proofed factors in the pot experiment Factor A- Crop species Factor B - P supply a1 Phacelia a2 Buckwheat a3 Common ryegrass a4 Oil raddish b1 Nutrient solution without P b2 Nutrient solution with P (KH2PO4), 0.23 g P per pot b3 Nutrient solution poultry litter ash, 0.4 g P per pot Results and discussion The highest P content was found for cereal ash with more than 13% total P (aqua regia). For that ash even the water soluble P content was found to be high with more than 1%. For all ashes a very high percentage of the total P was found to be soluble also in citric acid which indicates a good availability to plants. For further investigation we used the poultry litter ash in a pot experiment. The P supply affected the yield and P uptake of crops positively, independent of whether the P source was given as KH2PO4 or poultry litter ash (see Tab. 3). The different P supply became even more obvious for plant P uptake (see Tab. 3). For each crop significant differences were found between the treatments with and without P supply. In average, no differences were found between the ash treatment and the</p><p id="Pg587">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1261 treatment with KH2PO4. But for oil radish the P uptake was even the highest when ash was added.

Beside the nutrient supply this liming effect plays an important role, especially for acid soils. The cultivation of phacelia resulted in an pH decrease in all fertilizer treatments which coincides with the high cation:anion ratio of the nutrient uptake, which was detected for phacelia in former experiments (Eichler and Schnug, 2006).

Cereal Research Communications 1262 The P contents in soil increased when P was added as highly soluble P, as well as when added with ash. The Pdl content, which is considered as plant available P was found to be highest in the ash treatment (see Tab. 4). In average in this treatment the Pdl was with 67 mg kg -1 soil nearly double as high as in the treatment without P. Especially for buckwheat and grass high values were found. The Pw content was about 3 mg kg-1 soil in the treatment without P. It was higher in the treatments with P supply (about 5 mg kg-1), but despite of the higher P supply in the ash treatment, the Pw was found to be lower here than in the treatment with KH2PO4. This reflects the low water solubility of P in this ash. For the P sorption capacity (PSC) and degree of P saturation (DPS) no significant differences were found between the crops. However, in average of all crop plants the DPS was slightly but significant higher when P was added (as KH2PO4 or ash). In average of all crops PSC was 32.4 for the control, 32.8 for KH2PO4 treatment and 32.6 for the ash treatment (all values in mmol/kg soil). The DPS was 38.5 % for the control, 42.8% for the KH2PO4 treatment and 42.1% for the ash treatment. Conclusion The use of secondary raw materials (such as biomass ashes) in agriculture provides an opportunity for waste recycling and an adequate substitute for commercial P fertilizers. Provided the ashes are not loaded with harmful substances, the usage of biomass ashes in crop husbandry is an important method for the recirculation of nutrients in agriculture and saving of nutrient resources. The high plant P uptake and the high P content in soil in the ash treatment showed, that ashes may have a high P availability to plants. References Bhattacharya, S.S. - Chattopadhyay, G.N.: 2002.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1263 EVALUATION OF THE GRAIN YIELD AND QUALITY POTENTIAL OF MAIZE HYBRIDS UNDER LOW AND OPTIMUM WATER SUPPLY LEVELS Zsuzsanna HEGYI – Tamás ÁRENDÁS – János PINTÉR – Csaba L. MARTON Agricultural Research Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Martonvásár, Hungary e-mail: hegyizsuzsa@hotmail.com, gyenesne@mail.mgki.hu Abstract: A total of 96 hybrids from four maturity groups (FAO 200, 300, 400, 500) were tested in two years (2006, 2007) at two locations (Martonvásár, Szarvas). Considerable differences were found between the years for the grain yield per hectare and for the grain quality parameters. In 2006 record yields were achieved at both locations, averaging 11.61 t ha -1 in Martonvásár and 12.20 t ha -1 in Szarvas, due primarily to well-timed irrigation in Martonvásár and to good rainfall supplies in Szarvas. In 2007 both locations suffered from drought, with less rainfall than average during the critical months of the vegetation period, which was partially compensated for by irrigation in Martonvásár, giving a yield average of 5.96 t ha -1 , while the hybrids grown in Szarvas had a yield average of 5.06 t ha -1 . The grain quality parameters exhibited a close correlation with the grain yield in the individual FAO maturity groups. Hybrids of the flint type, which have a short vegetation period, had high protein and oil contents, but the yield averages were low due to the slower rate of starch incorporation. Hybrids of the dent type have a longer vegetation period and more intense carbohydrate accumulation, but low protein and oil contents. In wet years and locations there was a higher rate of starch accumulation, while dry years are favourable for protein and oil accumulation. The Bravais correlation coefficient was calculated between the yield and the grain quality parameters (averaged over years, locations and varieties). A positive, moderately strong correlation (0.68) was found between the yield and the starch content, a negative, moderately strong correlation (–0.52) between the yield and the protein content, and a loose negative correlation (–0.19) between the yield and the oil content. Key words: maize hybrid, water, FAO maturity group, yield, protein, oil and starch content Introduction Under Hungarian conditions the quantity and distribution of rainfall during the vegetation period are unfavourable. Gyenesné et al. (2002) recorded a close positive correlation between ear yield and the rainfall quantity in July. Long-term water deficiency during flowering increased the frequency of aborted kernels in the ears (Zinselmeier et al., 1995). Quaranta et al. (2001) reported that water stress affected flowering, yield quantity and grain quality parameters. In wet locations more starch was incorporated in the grain, leading to higher yields (Hegyi et al., 2007). According to Pásztor et al. (1998) the year had no great effect on starch content, but the starch and fat contents increased with the thousand-kernel mass (TKM). Bálint (1977) found that in hybrids with lower TKM the endosperm and the starch accumulation were smaller, while the grain protein content was relatively greater. In field production, greater per hectare maize yields generally have a lower protein content, while varieties containing 12% or more protein usually have lower yields (Sprague, 1955). Similar findings were reported by Svecnjak et al. (2007), who revealed negative correlations between the grain yield and the grain protein content (r = –0.48) and oil content (r = –0.19). No heterosis has been observed for protein and oil content; hybrid progeny had values less than the parental mean for these parameters (Pepó et al., 2007). In wet years maize hybrids had lower protein contents than in dry years. Irrigation had a significant effect on the protein and oil concentrations (Josipovic et al. (2007).</p><p id="Pg590">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1264 Materials and methods An experiment was set up at two locations in Hungary (Martonvásár, Szarvas) in 2006 and 2007 in a randomised block design with four replications. At each location 24 hybrids were tested from each of four maturity groups (FAO 200, 300, 400, 500). The experiments were sown and harvested mechanically. Prior to harvest, five sample ears were taken from each plot, and the yield average per hectare of each hybrid was corrected based on the ear mass of the sample ears. Evaluations were made of the yield average (t ha-1), followed by chemical analysis to determine the protein, oil and starch contents of the kernels. The measurements were made using a Fourier transform NIR spectrometer (Bruker, Germany, Ettlingen). Rainfall conditions differed between both the locations and the years. In Martonvásár there was less rainfall than average during the vegetation period in both years, with a critical rainfall deficiency during flowering in July (only 10 mm of rain and 23 very hot days in July in 2006; 25 mm and 13 very hot days in 2007). Irrigation water equivalent to 80 mm rainfall was applied during flowering in both years to reduce the atmospheric drought. In Szarvas rainfall exceeded the many years’ average during the vegetation period in both years, but in July 2007 the rainfall during flowering was 17 mm less than average, with 15 very hot days. The rainfall deficiency, combined with atmospheric drought, contributed to poor fertilisation. Results and discussion In 2006 the grand mean for the yield of maize hybrids in Martonvásár (Mvásár) was 11.61 t ha-1, compared with 12.20 t ha-1 in Szarvas. Although there was less rainfall than average during the vegetation period in Martonvásár, the distribution was favourable, and the plots were irrigated during flowering. In Szarvas there was above-average rainfall, so record yields were achieved without irrigation. There was a significant difference between the locations. At both locations the greatest yields were recorded for varieties in the FAO 400 maturity group (12.58 t ha-1 in Szarvas; 12.52 t ha-1 in Martonvásár; Fig. 1). In the droughty year of 2007 there was less rainfall than average in Martonvásár throughout the vegetation period, with the exception of August and September. The irrigation water applied in July moderated the drought damage. In Szarvas there was more rain than usual during the vegetation period in 2007, but the distribution was unfavourable. The rainfall deficiency in July, coupled with very hot days, led to poor fertilisation and lower yields. The grand mean for the maize yield was 5.96 t ha-1 in Martonvásár and 5.06 t ha-1 in Szarvas. In Martonvásár the highest yields were obtained in maturity groups FAO 400 (5.93 t ha-1) and FAO 500 (7.74 t ha-1). Due to the longer vegetation period these hybrids were able to develop two ears in response to the 112.2 mm of rainfall during the first ten days of August. In Szarvas the highest yields were recorded for the FAO 300 hybrids (5.40 t ha-1), while the hybrids in FAO maturity groups 200 and 500 both had average yields of 4.81 t ha-1. The grain quality parameters (starch, protein and oil content) were evaluated for each FAO maturity group in both years (Table 1). In 2006 higher yields were recorded at both locations than in 2007. Consequently the starch content was higher in 2006 (averaging 72.42% in Martonvásár and 72.98% in Szarvas). Starch incorporation was lowest at both locations in the FAO 200 maturity group, dominated by flint and semident hybrids, which have smaller TKM than the later maturing dent types. The greatest</p><p id="Pg591">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1265 starch accumulation was recorded for the FAO 500 hybrids (Martonvásár: 73.74%, Szarvas: 73.87%). In 2007 the starch accumulation in the grains was significantly lower due to the drought (Martonvásár: 70.71%, Szarvas: 72.04%). In Martonvásár the starch content was lowest in the FAO 200 group (68.40%), which averaged 71.18% in Szarvas. Due to the smaller yield averages, both the FAO 200 and FAO 300 hybrids had low starch contents. The greatest quantities of starch were measured in the dent hybrids in the FAO 500 group (72.20% and 73.47% in Martonvásár and Szarvas, respectively).

Figure. 1. Yields of maize hybrids in different FAO maturity groups, locations and years, averaged over the varieties (t ha -1 ) The protein and oil contents exhibited an opposing tendency to the starch accumulation, the highest values being recorded in early maturing hybrids. Starch is accumulated in the endosperm, which also contains 80% of the total protein content, so one can only accumulate at the expense of the other. In 2006 the highest protein and oil contents were recorded in the drier Martonvásár location in the FAO 200 hybrids (8.46%, compared with 8.07% in Szarvas). Table 1.

Cereal Research Communications 1266 The grain oil content was closely correlated with the protein content, with maximum values of 3.78% and 3.87% in the FAO 200 hybrids at the two locations. As the vegetation period became longer, there was a decline in the protein and oil contents, with protein contents of 7.30% and 6.90% in the FAO 500 hybrids, and oil contents of 3.52% and 3.58% in Martonvásár and Szarvas, respectively. The oil is found chiefly in the embryo, and late-maturing hybrids with a large accumulation of starch in the endosperm generally have a smaller embryo. In the drier year of 2007 the protein and oil ratios were higher, with average protein contents of 9.89% and 9.03% and oil contents of 3.96% and 4.90% in the FAO 200 hybrids in Martonvásár and Szarvas, respectively. With an increase in the vegetation period there was a drop in protein and oil contents, with values of 7.58% and 7.35% for protein and 3.68% and 4.25% for oil in the FAO 500 hybrids in Martonvásár and Szarvas, respectively. Conclusions The grain quality parameters of 96 maize hybrids were analysed in two years, in close correlation with the grain yield. As previously reported by Sprague (1955) and Svecnjak et al. (2007), starch accumulation in the kernels was found to increase with a rise in the yield average, while the protein and oil content declined. The two latter parameters are more strongly influenced by genetic factors than the starch content. It was concluded from the results that the flint and semi-dent types in the early maturing FAO 200 group had higher protein and oil contents, but lower starch contents, while the dent hybrids in the FAO 500 group, which have larger endosperms, have greater starch contents and a lower ratio of protein and oil. In agreement with Gyenesné et al. (2007) and Josipovic et al. (2007) it was observed than in wet years, or as the result of irrigation, more starch was accumulated in the kernels than in dry years. In contrast to the opinion of Pásztor et al. (1998) it was thus found that the year played an important role in determining the grain quality parameters of maize. References Bálint A. 1977.

Nevena DJUKIC 1 Faculty of Natural Science, Department of Biology Kragujevac, Serbia, nevena@kg.ac.yu Abstract. Chlorophyll and carotenoid content in flag leaf of three wheat cultivars (KG-100, KG-56S and KG5) were studied. Investigation conducted in two development stage: booting and flowering. Cultivars were grown at the long term experiment under conditions of three fertilization variants: first- control variant (without fertilizers), second - variant with nitrogen aplication (two subvariants with diferent rate of N) N1 (80 kg N ha -1 ) and N2 (120 kg N ha -1 ) and third variant with NPK fertilizer with two different rate of N application: N1 (80-60-60 kg N ha -1 ) and N2 (120-60-60 kg N ha -1 ). The results indicate that chlorophyll content depends on the presence and ratio of mineral elements in the substrate. The content of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and total chlorophyll (a+b) was measured for each variant. In this investigation were established differences of grain yield among the cultivars and variant of applied fertilizer. On control plots was highest weed ness expressed the least grain yield for all analyzed wheat cultivars. In this investigation analyzed influence of weed and fertilizer to variation of grain yield in wheat. The highest grain yield on the fertilized plots were found in KG- 5 (3916 kg ha -1 ) KG-56S (3620 kg ha -1 ) and KG-100 in varinat of NPK fertilizer application by rate N2 (120-60-60 kg N ha -1 ). Key words: Chlorophyll content, wheat, cultivar, mineral nutrition, yield. Introduction Chlorophyll content indicating potential of cultivars photosynthesis and productivity of plants. Photosynthetic activity is very important for increasing grain yield and quality of wheat cultivars. Leaf chlorophyll content varies from 0.05 to 0.30% of fresh matter. The ratio of contents of chlorophylls a and b is 3:1. Differences in chlorophyll contents depends of genetic factors as well environmental factors (Nelson, 1988; Richards, 2000). Chlorphyll content varied in dependence of development phase and have importance in the process of organogenesis. The highest chlorophyll content expressed at the flowering phase (Simova et al., 2001). Usually chlorophyll content per unit of leaf surface is 4-5 mg. The chlorophyll synthesis depends from mineral nutrition Application of mineral fertilizers have influence to dynamics of leaf surface formation and the photosynthetic potential as well productivity of photosynthesis (Pepo, 2000; Agoston &amp; Pepo, 2005; Nemeth, 2006). The significant influence to wheat plants development and their leaf surface have nitrogen (Nemeth et al., 2000; Pepo, 2005), which effect could improve by phosphorus and by potassium. Among those elements, the nitrogen is the most important for plant growth which together with P and K have influence to chlorophyll and efficiency of photosynthesis process. N is related to chlorophyll content and green area duration of wheat plants. Optimization of N application requires knowledge of the response of crop growth processes to N. Variation in dry matter yield in response to N may arise from differences in the amount of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation by the canopy, the light use efficiency and harvest index. The aim of this paper is study of variability of chlorophyll content in flag leaf in thre wheat cultivars grown under different applied rate of nitrogen in booting and flowering stage of plant development.</p><p id="Pg594">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1268 Materials and methods Three genetically divergent wheat cultivars (KG-100, KG-56S and KG-5) grown under different regime of nitrogen nutrition were studied for content of chlorophyll a and b. Cultvars were grown on long term experimental field of Center for Small Grains in Kragujevac. For analysis flag leaves collected at the two developmental phase: booting phase and flowering phase. For analysis of chlorophyll content, samples were taken from three basic variants of soil fertilization (Table 1). At the each plots was added given the same amounts of potassium ammonium nitrate (27 %), superphosphate (18 or 45 % P2O5) and potassium chloride (60 % KCl). Unfertilized plots belonged to the smonitza type of soil in the process of degradation with pH of 6.03 to 6.10 in water and 4.76 to 4.84 in KC1. For analysis measured 0.5 g of plant leaves which macerated with the addition of 5-10 ml of 80 % acetone and small amount of MgCO3. This material was homogenized during 3 minutes and filtrated. Since the concentration of pigments was in most cases too great for reading to be performed on a spectrophotometer, the obtained extract was diluted by adding 9 ml of 80% acetone per ml of extract The extract used for reading at the spectrophotometer at 662, 644 and 440 nm. Chlorophyll content was computed according to Holm and Wetsttein. . Results and discussion The results of measuring chlorophyll content in flag leaf of wheat in booting phase of development presented in Table 1. The content of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b is higher at each cultivars grown under all fertilized variants than in control variants (unfertilized plots). Also content of chlorophyll a was higher than that of chlorophyll b at each analyzed cultivars in all variants of soil fertilization. The concentration of chlorophyll b is very similar at analyzed cultivars within same variants of fertilization. However, the concentration of chlorophyll a was different at the cultivars depending of variant of fertilization as well cultivars expressed differences according to content of chlorophyll a within the same variants of nitrogen application. The highest chlorophyll content (chlorophyll a and b) was found in variants N2 (120 kg N ha -1) at each analyzed cultivars The concentration of chlorophyll a at this variant of fertilization varied from 2.638 mg/g (KG-100) to 3.325 mg/g (KG-5), while concentration of chlorophyll b varied 1.284 mg/g (KG-5) to 1.380 mg/g at Kg 100 (Table 1). Within the other variants of fertilization, cultivar KG-56 expressed the highest concentration of chlorophyll a as well as chlorophyll b. The lowest amounts of chlorophyll in the flowering phase in all cultivars on all fertilization variants were found in the flag leaf (Table 2). Thus, the content of chlorophyll content and levels of other leaf biochemical constituents can be used as indicators of crop stress under conditions of nutritional or water deficiencies. The highest chlorophyll content (chlorophyll a and b) in flowering phase was found in variants N2 (120 kg N ha -1) at each analyzed cultivars The concentration of chlorophyll a varied from 1.451 mg/g (KG-5) to 2.052 mg/g (KG-100), while concentration of chlorophyll b varied 0.981 mg/g (KG-56) to 1.756 mg/g (KG-5) Table 2. Also high concentrations of chlorophyll a and b were found in variants N1(80 kg N ha -1). Decreasing of chlorophyll content in flowering phase in relation to booting phase of wheat development could be effected by unfavorable environmental factors.</p><p id="Pg595">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1269 The photosynthesis efficiency can enhanced by optimal nutrition. Among mineral elements, the nitrogen play the main role in wheat nutrition because of its importance in protein and nucleic acid synthesis as well plant productivity (Knezevic et al., 2007). On the base of dynamics N efficiency absorption and its introduction of organic synthesis are increasing speed of these processes and plant productivity. For this reason, wheat responds very positively to application of mineral fertilizers (Nemeth et al. 2000; Pepo, 2000; 2005; Balogh et al., 2006). Table 1.

Nitrogen is the most important mineral element in the process of chlorophyll biosynthesis, because breeders need make concept of creation new genotypes with high capacity of accumulation as well with high capacity of N uptake, utilization and translocation. The ideal crops for the breeders should come out by a balance between extension of photosynthetic activity in a single flag leaf or in the whole canopy, and drought tolerance during grain filling period.

Strossmayer in Osijek, Trg Sv. Trojstva 3, 31000 Osijek, Croatia, email: irapcan@pfos.hr 2 Agricultural Institute Osijek, Department of Forage Crops Breeding and Genetics, Osijek, Croatia Abstract : Field experiment was conducted to estimate grain yield and yield components of Czech field pea cultivar Zekon at two different soil types in two consecutive years (2004, 2005). The effect of seed age (seeds aged 9 and 21 months) was tested in the second year of experiment. Effects of soil type and soil x year interaction were significant for the field emergence. Year effect was significant for grain yield and 1000 seed weight. Nine months old seed revealed significantly higher emergence and number of grains per pod. Differences of number of pods per plant, grain yield and 1000 seed weight across soils in 2005 and ages were not significant. Keywords: pea, soil, yield, yield components Introduction Field pea is an important source of qualitative proteins in livestock feeding. According to Abera and Belissa (2005), it is also a valuable precursor crop and the most successful management option for sustainable wheat production. As is already pointed out by Andric et al. (2007) for soybean, the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen by a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria increases pea importance in sustainable agriculture. Nitrogen, as Kádár (2007) indicated for soils in Hungary, is considered to be the most important macronutritient. However, nitrogen loss from the mineral fertilisers in soils is high, and water might be contaminated by a high level of nitrogen compounds potentially harmful to human and animal health (Rutkoviene et al., 2007). For the sustainable production of protein-rich food, the suitability of pea was already checked (Linnemann and Dijkstra, 2002). The grain yield and yield components of field pea depend on genetic and a number of agro-ecological factors (Lecoeur and Sinclair, 2001; Poggio et al., 2005). The seed life potential is usually examined under term of seed vigour, which is related to all seed characteristics able to describe seed ability for fast emergence and development of normal seedlings in a different field conditions. Seed vigour depends on a range of factors; among these are seed age and storage time. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of different soil types and climatic conditions on field emergence, grain yield and yield components of field pea. The effect of seed age was tested in addition. Materials and methods Czech cultivar „Zekon“ selected for grain production was used in the experiment. Field experiments were carried out in 2004 and 2005 at two locations of Eastern Croatia (Osijek and Vinkovci). Soils were classified as eutric cambisols (Osijek) and semigleysols (Vinkovci). Chemical characteristics of soils are shown in Table 1. The experiments were set up as randomised blocks with four replications. Seed was sown manually in 5 cm deep rows (space between rows was 20 cm and space within row was 5 cm). The plot size was 25 m2. A seed production year of Zekon sown in 2004 was</p><p id="Pg598">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1272 2003 at both locations. In 2005, the seed of cultivar produced in 2003 (seeds aged 21 months) and in 2004 (seeds aged 9 months) was used as a material at both locations. Table 1.

Cereal Research Communications 1274 The values are in agreement with Saxena et al. (1987) who indicated that the increase of storage time of pea seed led to decrease of germination. Differences of a number of pods per plant, grain yield and 1000 seed weight across soils and ages in 2005 were not significant. This was probably due to similar weather conditions at locations. Andric et al. (2007) emphasised that seed deterioration during storage was more expressed in the adverse soil and weather conditions after planting. In sustainable crops production it is important to provide an acceptable future supply of biomaterials with minimal inputs of water, chemicals and fertilizers (Dobó et al., 2007). Obtained values for field emergence and yield and yield components of investigated field pea indicated that the low-input pea production might be successful at different types of soil. Conclusions The soil type significantly influenced on field emergence of pea. Year influenced on grain yield per plant and 1000 seed weight. Higher number of grains per pod and 1000 seed weight were found for younger seed. The results of this study indicated that the low-input pea production might be successful at different types of soils. References Abera, T.- Belissa, M.: 2005.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1275 ADAPTATION OF MAIZE HYBRIDS FROM DIFFERENT MATURITY GROUPS TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OF NORTH-WESTERN AND NORTH-EASTERN CROATIA Jerko GUNJAČA 1 – Zdravko KOZIĆ 2 – Antun VRAGOLOVIĆ 2 – Ivica BUHINIČEK 2 – Branko PALAVERŠIĆ 2 1 Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zagreb, Svetošimunska 25, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia, e-mail: jgunjaca@agr.hr 2 Bc Institute for Breeding and Production of Field Crops, Marulićev trg 5/I, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia Abstract: When tested in variety trials set in various environmental conditions, maize hybrids from different maturity groups can display different patterns of adaptation related to their differential response to dominant environmental factors, which could also be altered by applied agricultural practice. Sampling the data set from an actual breeding program, the aim of the present study was to investigate these patterns of adaptation. The results revealed that expected patterns adaptation were only partially expressed in only one of the trial years, indicating the existence of complex plant-soil-climate interrelationships, raising the demand for full understanding of all their components for succesfull prediction of the hybrid performance. Keywords: maize, maturity groups, adaptation Introduction The final stage of a maize breeding program involves variety trials carried out at different testing sites accross several growing seasons. The aim of multi-environment trials is to investigate possible general and specific adaptive capabilites of tested hybrids, by providing insight into mechanisms of their adaptation to different weather and soil conditions present at testing sites. Differential response of maize hybrids, manifested as hybrid x environment interaction, is mainly due to differential hybrid sensitivity to various environmental factors, among whom the most important ones are water and nutrient supply (Berényi et al., 2007; Dóka and Pepó, 2007). The influence of both factors on hybrid performance is equally dependant on genotypic (sensitivity and efficiency) and environmental properties (precipitation, soil fertility, etc.). Fluctuations in both water and nutrient availability throughout the growing season affect the hybrids from different maturity groups at different developmental stages, creating the similarity in within groups and dissimilarity in between groups patterns of adaptation. However, there are certain mechanisms of adaptation which are common for various maturity groups, as indicated by positive association between yield and some other traits (Hegyi et al, 2007). Furthermore, the effect of environmental factors can be substantially alterated by applying the different agricultural practices (Berzsenyi and Dang, 2006; Berzsenyi et al., 2007; Molnár and Sárvári, 2007). Bearing in mind all described similarities and differences, the aim of present study was to investigate the adaptation of maize hybrids from different maturity groups, using the data set sampled from one breeding program whose final testing stage was carried out on four locations representing the maize growing region of the continental part of Croatia. Materials and methods Source of data were variety trials carried out with maize hybrids within the framework of Bc Institute breeding programs. Trials used in the present study were those performed</p><p id="Pg602">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1276 at four sites (Rugvica, Bjelovar, Feričanci, and Osijek) in two consecutive years (200102). Sites were selected to represent the maize growing region in Croatia, from its most western (Rugvica) to the most eastern part (Osijek), differing in both soil types and climate conditions. Western part is characterized by heavier soils and more humid climate, and there is gradual transition over each site to lighter soils and drier climate of the eastern part. Overall, trials were set on three different types of soil: semigley (Rugvica), pseudogley (Bjelovar and Feričanci), and eutric cambisol (Osijek). Within each site, trials were performed separately for different maturity groups (FAO 300, FAO 400, FAO 500, and FAO 600), all of them including 16 maize hybrids – 2 standards and 14 new hybrids in both years (or 30 per group in total). The only exception was FAO 400, where two groups of 14 hybrids were tested per year (or 58 in total). Overall trial design was randomized complete blocks with 4 replicates. Hybrid yields were subjected to the statistical analysis within the mixed model framework. Basic modelling concept was to reserve fixed part of the model for maturity groups and environments, and include all remaining effects in the random part. There were two basic components of the random part: the effects of hybrids and replicates, both nested in effects from the fixed part of the model. Shifting the focus from the individual hybrids to maturity groups, hybrids were treated just as group sample, therefore random effect, nested both in maturity groups and trials. Fixed part of the model is used to obtain estimates for maturity group yields in different environments, adjusted for all random effects. The estimates are then compared and used to describe adaptation of hybrids from various maturity groups to different environmental conditions. All statistical analyses were carried out using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., 2007) procedure MIXED. Results and discussion Results of fitting of the described mixed model to maize hybrids yield data are given in the Table 1. All fixed effects were significant, indicating differential adaptation of hybrids from different maturity groups to various environmental conditions, with regards to spatial (sites) and/or seasonal differences (years). In the random part of the model, replicates effect was relatively smallest, indicated very low contribution of the blocking effect to the adjustment of the estimates for the fixed effects. Magnitude of the effect of hybrids was closer to residuals rather than replicates, either when accounting for differences between maturity groups, or for the differences in composition of maturity groups between years, indicating their substantial contribution to the adjustment of the fixed effects estimates.

General rule of higher yields for later maturity groups with some minor exceptions correspond well to the study carried out by Svecnjak et al. (2004) over similar growing conditions. The association between lower and higher yields and respective percipitations (Nagy, 2007) is not reflected in the present study. To the certain point, trend of lower yields observed eastwards in 2001 (compared to 2002), could be related to shift in rainfall incidences to later dates in 2002, but the sound explanation for the observed pattern could not be detected from the data on weather variables available from public services. With the respect to general adaptation of maturity groups to different testing sites, almost no differences were observed in first year, and the second year was favorable for all groups on two eastern sites. Expected favorization of later groups at eastern sites was fully realised in 2002, but analogue favorization of earlier groups at eastern sites did not occur (regardless of few exceptions). Highest discrepancy was found between observed and expected performances of earliest maturity group (FAO300), which performed almost completely opposite to the expected pattern.</p><p id="Pg604">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

This is the indication of the existence of complex plant-soil-climate interrelationships, demanding for full understanding of all their components for succesfull prediction of the hybrid performance.

Gaja 6, 31 000 Osijek, Croatia Abstract: Five maize hybrids were grown on two soils in eastern Croatia (Rakitovica gleysol and Bicko selo luvisol) in the growing season of year 2007. Significant differences in leaf K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn and Zn content (the ear-leaf at flowering stage) were established depending on specific agroecological conditions of the localities. For example, leaf K, Fe, Zn and proline contents were higher on the gleysol, probably due to lower soil pH, and more severe drought stress. Leaf K content was negatively related to Ca and Mg. Synergistic relation of K to proline in maize leaves could be the reaction of plant to environmental stress, whereas proline was negatively related to grain % in ear mass. Soil influence was not significant for evaluated yield components (grain ear -1 , ears plant -1 and grain dry mass plant -1 ). The obtained differences in yield components among hybrids imply the necessity of further evaluation of their ability for nutrient utilization from acid soils and grain production in different climate conditions. Keywords: acid soil, environmental stress, maize, leaf nutrient content, proline Introduction Soil complexity determines plant nutrients uptake through various chemical and biological processes which are in turn influenced by other environmental factors, such as moisture and temperature. As soil quality condition decreases, soil sensitivity to climatic extremes may increase (Birkás et al., 2006). In acid soils, which account for about 40% of the world’s arable land, high phosphorus fixation and aluminium poisoning drastically limit the expansion of agriculture (López-Bucio et al, 2000). Regarding nitrogen uptake on acid soils, the results of Pal'ove-Balang and Mistrik (2007) support the view that nitrate uptake and reduction might be the main processes responsible for Al induced growth retardation in Lotus plants grown in mineral acid soils. Soil acidity influences also availability of other plant nutrients. However, the adequate potassium and proline content in plant tissues both contribute to higher plant tolerance to osmotic stress. It was reported that the effect of potassium on proline accumulation in leaf was greater in leaf discs from plants grown at high level of potassium (Mukherjee, 1974). Maize harvest index was reduced when dry spells occurred during flowering and grain filling (de Barros et al., 2007). Based on the above, presented study aimed to explore the relations among K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, and Zn in maize ear-leaf at flowering, leaf proline content and some of the maize yield components, in the field conditions at two acid soils in eastern Croatia. Materials and methods The field experiment, sampling and chemical analysis Five maize hybrids (PR35P12, PR36B08, PR34F02, PR37M34, and PR36K67) were grown in 2007 on two localities in eastern Croatia as follows: luvisol at Rakitovica in Drava valley (Croatian Podravina) area and gleysol at Bicko Selo in Sava valley (Croatian Posavina) area. Localities were fertilized (kg ha-1) with 160 N : 110 P2O5 : 150 K2O and 202 N : 105 P2O5 : 135 K2O, for luvisol and gleysol, respectively. Soil</p><p id="Pg606">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1280 nutrient status (Table 1) and clay content were evaluated at the ear-leaf sampling term (middle of July). Ear-leaf (25 plants in mean sample) was dried at 70oC for 48 h and analyzed after wetdigestion procedure. At the same time, proline content was analyzed in middle section of ear-leaf after Bates et al. (1973). Total K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn and Zn in plant and soil samples were determined by AAS procedure. Grain samples were taken at full maturity stage from 25 ears per replicate, whereas the grain proportion in ear fresh mass (GPE, %) was determined imidiately, and mean dry mass of grain per plant (GPP, g) was determined after drying to 14% grain moisture content. The number of ears per plant (EPP) was determined using 25 randomly selected plants per replicate. The results of leaf analysis and yield components were statistically analyzed using ANOVA with Ftest for the evaluation of significance of locality and hybrids, as well as t-test for the evaluation of the established correlations (* P≤0.05; ** P≤0.01). The soil and weather characteristics The luvisol was characterized by more acid reaction, the lower level of clay and more exchangeable Fe and Zn, as well as considerably lower exchangeable Mn contents as compared to the gleysol (Table 1). The both soils are supplied well with phosphorus and potassium. The 2007 growing season was unfavorable for maize growth (Table 1). In general, low maize yields are in connection with drought and the higher airtemperatures, especially in July and August (Josipovic et al., 2005). Table 1.

The PR36K67 had the highest leaf K on both soils. The highest leaf Ca was accompanied with the lowest leaf K. This implies K-Ca antagonism, that was further demonstrated by highly significant negative correlation (Figure 1; y1, r = -0.611**). In the research of Iszáki (2006), no significant K-Ca antagonism was observed in maize leaves even in the dry year of 2003, by contrast, K-Mg antagonism was detected as higher leaf K was accompanied by a reduction in the Mg content. Leaf Mg was also negatively related to K (Figure 1; y2, r= -0.800**). Similar to K and Ca, Mg concentration in maize leaf was strongly dependent on the hybrid (P≤0.01). All three macronutrients were significantly related to PRO (K:PRO, Figure 2, y1, r = 0.650**; Ca:PRO, r = 0.425** ; Mg:PRO, r = -0.578**). Synergistic relation of K to PRO in maize leaves could be the reaction of plant to multiple environmental stresses. PRO was significantly related to GPE (Figure 2; y2, r= -0.465**), accordingly, PRO level in maize leaf could be considered as stress indicator in given experimental conditions.</p><p id="Pg607">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1281 The question that remains unanswered is, does K and PRO accumulation in maize leaf could be related to proline content in pollen and silk? As reported by Sato et al., (2006), even a moderately elevated temperature stress significantly decreased number of fruit set, pollen viability and the number of pollen grains released in tomato, due to disruption of sugar metabolism and proline translocation.

Considering mean temperatures (Table 1), that were approximately 1oC higher that 30year means, maize feasibly suffered from heat stress, especially in flowering stage, on</p><p id="Pg608">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1282 both localities. The vegetation period was also much dryer on luvisol than on gleysol. Mean PRO content was higher under more acid and drought conditions of the luvisol. Sipos et al., (2007) reported that maize leaf Mn content was slightly decreased on irrigated plots. Here, leaf Mn was strongly influenced by both locality and hybrid (P≤0.01) and their interaction had an influence as well (P≤0.05). Less Mn was obtained in maize leaves on luvisol, where drought was more severe and the exchangeable soil Mn content was lower (gleysol: 27.28 mg kg-1 EDTA-Mn vs. luvisol: 7.02 mg kg-1 EDTA-Mn). Leaf Fe and Zn were both much higher on the luvisol. Considering evaluated yield components, only hybrid influence was significant for GPE and EPP. Conclusions Significant differences in the nutrient content of maize ear-leaf at flowering stage were observed, depending on hybrid and locality influence. Synergistic relation of K to PRO in maize leaves indicates plant reaction to multiple environmental stresses. PRO level in maize leaf could be considered as stress indicator in given experimental conditions. Considering evaluated yield components, locality influence was not significant in the presented study, but this requires further research.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1283 COMPARISON OF QUANTITATIVE TRAITS IN OLD AND MODERN WHEAT VARIETIES Valentina SPANIC – Daniela HORVAT – Kresimir DVOJKOVIC Department for Cereal Breeding and Genetics, Agricultural Institute Osijek, Juzno predgradje 17, HR-31 000 Osijek, Croatia, e-mail: valentina.spanic@poljinos.hr Abstract: In this study the effects of variety and crop year on the quantitative traits in old and modern winter wheat were investigated. The timing and amount of rainfall during the season, the soil’s ability to hold water, and crop’s water requirements are all factors which influence quantitative traits. The highest yielding varieties during four years were Klara and Demetra. In contrast, varieties U1 and Sirban Prolifik had the lowest grain yield, but the highest protein content, wet gluten content and sedimentation value. The highest test weight had variety Super Zitarka. Year 2006 was the most favourable for grain yield and test weight, 2006 and 2005 for sedimentation value, while protein and wet gluten content were the highest in 2004. These results suggest that rainfall in growing season affected soil water which changed quantitative traits of winter wheat. Keywords: winter wheat, quantitative traits, crop year, rainfall Introduction The winter breeding program has been in existence in Croatia since the beginning of 20th century (Martincic et al., 1996). One of the first Croatian varieties was Sirban Prolifik. Till 1960 widely grown was variety U1, also known as Osjecka Sisulja. From 1956 Italian varieties were introduced in Croatia. According to Drezner et al. (2006) grain yield and quality traits are the most important quantitative traits of winter wheat and key objective of wheat breeders. In this study the effects of variety and crop year of the quantitative traits in old and modern winter wheat were investigated. This kind of experiments are keeping heritage varieties of wheat alive and also allowing researchers and farmers to assess the "value" of the old varieties in today’s growing conditions. It is not uncommon for some years to recive sufficient rainfall for good plant growth while other experience reduced yield or quality because of water stress from insufficient soil moisture which is consequences of climate changes (Walczak et al., 2002 and Pepó et al., 2007). The timing and amount of rainfall during the season, the soil’s ability to hold water, and crop’s water requirements are all factors which influence quantitative traits of wheat varieties. In order to establish the relationship between rainfall, soil water and quantitative traits of wheat varieties, information were collected over 4 years. Materials and methods The experiment was carried out at the test field of Agricultural Institute Osijek in Eastern part of Croatia (45°32“N, 18°44“E) during four years (2004 – 2007). Test was made on 23 genotypes in three replications in randomized blocks. Soil type was eutric cambisol (pHKCl=6.25; humus=2.20%; K2O 37.70 mg 100g -1; P2O5 39.70 mg 100g -1) with size of test plot 7.56 m2. Fertilization differ during the study (N:P:K 120-140:80100:120-150 kg ha-1). The climate conditions during growing season significantly differed in the amount of rainfall: 2004=578.7 mm; 2005=622.7 mm; 2006=496.1 mm; 2007=336.1 mm. Protein content, wet gluten content and sedimentation value were determined by Infratec 1241 Analyzer (ICC standard method No 105/2; No 155; No 116/1). Obtained data were statistically processed by GLM procedure of SAS 9.1. Stat Software with a level of significance set at α= 0.05.</p><p id="Pg610">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1284 Results and discussion In the combined ANOVA, effects of varieties, years and varieties*years interaction were highly significant for all analyzed traits (Table 1). As it well known the quantitative traits of winter wheat are influenced by biological (variety), ecological (weather, soil) and agrotechnical factors all together (Balogh et al., 2006). Table 1.

Concerning test weight, variety Super Zitarka had the highest (83.28 kg hl-1), while variety Sirban Prolifik (74.33 kg hl-1) had the lowest test value. Protein content ranged from 19.01% (U1) to 13.38% (Soissons). The same varieties had the highest and the lowest value for wet gluten content (47.38% and 32.16% respectively). The same rang was found for sedimentation value from variety U1 (63.89 cm3) to variety Soissons (41.81 cm3). During the years different effects can cause favourable and unfavourable results in the yield and quality characteristics of wheat varieties (Ágoston, T., 2006). The best yielding year (8.242 t ha-1) and year with highest test weight (83.73 kg hl-1) was 2006. The explanation is in uniform distribution of rainfall during growing season, especially during vegetative and reproductive stages of growth, which provided favourable effects for interaction between soil and water. Protein content (15.44%) and wet gluten content (40.60%) had the highest value in 2004. Years 2006 (58.21 cm3) and 2005 (57.35 cm3) were favourable for sedimentation value. Year 2007 was very warm with lower amounts of rainfall during the grain-filling period, which led to water stress and unfavourable interaction between soil and plant. Results of correlation analysis during four years (Fig. 1) indicated that grain yield and test weight were in positive strong correlation (r=0.640*) with a linear function y=0.118x+72.52. The results are in accordance with previous findings of Klupács et al., 2007. The negative dependence for grain yield and protein content is shown in Fig. 2 as the following regression equation of linear form y=-0.112x+22.90 with correlation coefficient r=-0.886**. Fig. 3 points to a very strong negative connection among grain yield and wet gluten content with a linear function y=-0.271x+59.96 and correlation coefficient r=-0.829**. A close negative correlation was observed between grain yield and sedimentation value, with regression equation y=-0.432x+83.68 and r=-0.713* (Fig. 4).</p><p id="Pg611">VII.

Statistical relationship between grain yield and wet gluten content during four years yield and sedimentation value during four years Conclusions The results of the performed experiment led to the conclusion that newly developed varieties had considerably higher grain yield compared with old one, while quality parameters (protein content, wet gluten content and sedimentation value) were lower in modern varieties. The highest yielding varieties during four years were Klara and Demetra. In contrast, varieties U1 and Sirban Prolifik had the lowest grain yield, but the highest protein content, wet gluten content and sedimentation value. The highest test weight had variety Super Zitarka. Successful crop production depends on careful management of soils, water and chemicals so that plant needs are met as they occur in the crop year. These results suggest that rainfall in growing season affected soil water which changed quantitative traits of winter wheat. Water regime determines soil productive ability so that is why it is important to monitor interaction water*soil which affects interaction soil*plant. This experiment also enables old varieties to be sought out for further breeding. References Ágoston, T. 2006. Evaluation of quantity and quality parameters in winter wheat varieties.

Coping with this complexity for practical purposes, at least – such as policy making and land management for sustainable land use – is impossible without some simplification of the complex relationships to manageable and understandable dimensions. Hence, the need for some model, in general, and for some symbolic model, in particular, which will express operationally the relationships of interest. The presented paper analyze different modeling approaches to define land use changes and plant-soil interrelations. Keywords: land use change, modeling, econometry, socio-economic change etc. Introduction Land is the stage on which all human activity is being conducted and the source of the materials needed for this conduct. Human use of land resources gives rise to "land use" which varies with the purposes it serves, whether they be food production, provision of shelter, recreation, extraction and processing of materials, and so on, as well as the biophysical characteristics of land itself. Hence, land use is being shaped under the influence of two broad sets of forces – human needs and environmental feature and processes. Neither one of these forces stays still; they are in a constant state of flux as change is the quintessence of life. Changes in the uses of land occurring at various spatial levels and within various time periods are the material expressions, among others, of environmental and human dynamics and of their interactions which are mediated by land. These changes have at times beneficial, at times detrimental impacts and effects, the latter being the chief causes of concern as they impinge variously on human well-being and welfare. Lay and scientific interest on land use change has a long history as there have been no instances in which people used land and its resources without causing any harm. Ancient writers, philosophers, scientists and the like but also lay people have left records of the unwanted consequences of changes in the uses of land in the form of pieces of literature, philosophy, science and folklore. Models of land use change can play an instrumental role in impact assessment of past or future activities in the environmental and/or the socio-economic spheres. This use has two facets; on the one hand, it may concern assessment of qualitative and/or quantitative changes of land use caused by autonomous or planned changes in one or more of its determinants; on the other, it may concern assessment of the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of changes in land use (such as land degradation, desertification, food security, health and safety hazards, unemployment, etc.). Models of land use change have been and are currently being used to prescribe "optimum" patterns of land use for sustainable use of land resources and development, in general. In this case, they rest usually on optimization techniques which are used to produce land use configurations which satisfy specified objectives as well as a variety</p><p id="Pg614">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1288 of environmental and socio-economic constraints. One of these constraints is the availability of land. Optimization models are commonly used in planning and management contexts. Statistical Models To Analyze Land Use Changes Statistical models whose direct object of analysis is land use change date since the 1960s at least and they are still employed in several related studies. Frequently, they constitute components of larger models employed for the analysis of land use change and its determinants. A distinction can be drawn between continuous models which treat land use as a continuous variable (area of land devoted to a land use type) and discrete models those which treat land use as a discrete variable (different land use types are distinguished). In a statistical model of land use change, the study area is usually subdivided into a number of zones (or, grid cells if a grid system is adopted) the size and shape of each cell depending on the level of aggregation chosen as well as the availability of data. (The case where the observation units are individual land parcels instead of zones or grid cells is discussed later.) In the continuous case, for each zone, the distribution of land use types (the dependent variables ) as well as the values of other environmental and socio-economic predictor variables (e.g. population, employment, soil conditions, slope, climate (temperature, rainfall, etc.) are given. A multiple regression equation for each land use type is fit to these data (usually referring to a given year). The general form of the equation is: (1) where: LUT: is the area of land occupied by land use type i (in each cell) and X1, X2, … Xn the predictor variables used. The term " " is the error term of the statistical model. This model form can be used to assess the changes in the area covered by a given land use type for specified changes in one or more of the predictor variables by substituting their values in the equation shown above. Early applications were made by Chapin and Weiss (1968) in the context of a broader "probabilistic model of residential growth" (known as the North Carolina model). The dependent variable in their model was the attractiveness of a zone of the study region for residential growth measured as (Chapin and Kaiser 1979):  absolute number of dwellings, or  increase of dwelling units in a zone (within a planning time period), or  number of dwellings per unit of available land, or  acreage of residential land or proportion of land use growth to be allocated to a zone An exploratory regression analysis was applied first to a larger set of candidate variables which the literature indicated that influenced land use to identify the variables which had a statistically significant relationship to the dependent variable. The independent which were included finally in the Chapin and Weiss version of the model were:</p><p id="Pg615">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1289  accessibility of a zone to work areas  availability of sewerage in a zone  accessibility of a zone to nearest major street  accessibility of a zone to a nearest elementary school. A similar statistical model is used in the CHANGE module of the CLUE model which is discussed below under the category of integrated models (Veldkamp and Fresco 1996). The CHANGE module uses linear regression models to estimate the changes in the area of given land use types which are caused by changes in the values of environmental and socio-economic driving factors projected from other modules of the CLUE model. Discrete statistical models (or, discrete choice models) are used to represent choice situations in general. In the case of land use modeling, each land use type is described as a function of a number of characteristics (which usually differ from one cell to another). For each cell, the utility of every land use type is assessed as a function of these characteristics. The probability of choosing a particular land use type in a given cell is calculated as a function of the utilities associated with the land use types considered. The most common mathematical forms used in discrete choice models are the logit and probit models. In the context of a larger modeling exercise for the analysis of land use change in Japan, Kitamura et al. (1997) use a multinomial logit model to assess changes in land use by type. The model assesses the probability of choice of a particular land use type in each of the cells in which the study area is subdivided as a function of the values of a set of predictor/ explanatory variables . These probabilities are interpreted as land use proportions for each of a specified number of land use types. The mathematical form of the model is as follows: (2) (3) where: Pij the land use proportion of land use type i in cell j Vij the utility of the ith land use type in cell j Xjk the kth explanatory variable in cell j ik the multiple regression coefficients of the explanatory variables Xjk The above formulation calculates first the utility of each land use type in each cell of the study area as a linear function of the values of a set of predictor variables (equation 3) and then uses this utility to estimate the probability of a particular land use type occurring in each cell. The predictor variables are shown below. As it was the case with</p><p id="Pg616">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1290 the previous multiple regression model, changes in the predictor variables calculated from other modules of the larger model are fed into equation (3) to estimate changes in the utility of each land use type. These changes are then used in equation (2) to estimate changes in the proportion of each land use type in each cell of the study region. Conclusions The statistical models of land use change presented are briefly discussed and evaluated. Their purpose is description, explanation and (conditional and unconditional) prediction of land use changes as functions of selected determinants. They are mostly crosssectional, static models operating on the basis of annual data. Usually they are national or regional level models based on a zonal system of spatial reference where the zones usually coincide with administrative districts (for which data is available). Exceptions are the recently built models employing parcel level data which can be considered local level models, they do not employ a zonal system, and they may incorporate lagged values of certain independent variables which makes them quasi-static models.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1291 MEASURING AGRICULTURAL CROP VULNERABILITY, SENSITIVITY AND ADAPTIVITY IN CEECS Erika DOBÓ1- Mahesh Kumar SINGH1- Tamás TÓTH2- József KAPOSZTA2- Maria FEKETE-FARKAS1 1 Institute of Economics, Szent István University, Hungary, erikadobo@yahoo.com 2 Institute of Reginal Economics and Rural Development, Szent István University, Hungary Abstract: The role of agriculture and its future development is a highlighted topic of CAP, which focuses on the sustainability. The key question of sustainable development is, how the agriculture can react to the external social, economic and environmental changes. Change of external conditions in an economic system influences the productivity and it has effect to individual and/or social welfare as well. The vulnerability assessment may help the future formulation of agricultural and rural policy meeting more public concern and less transition cost. This paper focuses on vulnerability indicators of farm sector and rural economy of CEECs. Keywords: sustainable development, vulnerability, agricultural sensitivity Introduction „The sustainable production of agriculture means a conscious work that integrates economic achievements and regeneration of natural resources methodical besides takes adaptation of polluted (manure, chemicals) environment into consideration.” (CseteLáng, 2005). Both budgetary consequences of previous agricultural policy and requirements of sustainable development force to reform agricultural policy in European Union and USA too. This process helps to discharge from normative subsidies to another determined and specificated system of subsidies. It based on an agroecosystem’s vulnerability- adaptive capacity assessment. (Fekete-Farkas et al, 2005). Many research programs began in this topic and the scientific literature summarized their results. Nevertheless, there’s no accepted measuring methods for assess vulnerability and adaptive capacity besides definitions have to clear. Subsidies in agriculture keeping with sustainability have to tend towards considerable vulnerable fileds because of their economical, ecological and social sensitivity and low adaptive capacity. Vulnerability, sensitivity and adaptive capacity Many international organizations recommend definitions of vulnerability and adaptive capacity. According to UNEP (2001), “Vulnerability is an aggregate measure of human welfare that integrates environmental, social, economic and political exposure to a range of harmful perturbations”. The other definition made by IPCC (2001), “The degree to which a system is susceptible to, or unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change, including variability extremes”. The main difference is that the UNEP conceptual framework shifts the exposure unit toward human and social systems in contrast to the IPCC framework that also includes natural systems. Both views of vulnerability incorporate the same essential concepts. Vulnerability is a function of the character that system unable to cope with damaging impact so becomes to vulnerable. If agroecosystem holds ability to adaptation it could moderate or prevent harmful perturbations (Czövek et al. 2006, Kassai et al. 2006, Márton, 2006, Tanács et al. 2006).</p><p id="Pg618">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1292 Adaptive capacity is an attribute that moderate damaging impacts and helps with expansion of system’s coping range with the new or modified adaptation. IPPC recognizes two type of adaptation:  Autonomous adaptation refers to farmer’s/individual decision making, moderate external impact’s consequences (through reorganization of activities, investments, resource allocation)  Planned (or societal) adaptation refers the intervention of society through policy Farmer/individual, region, agroecosystem, farming that unable to autonomous adaptation is vulnerable. Vulnerability=Sensitivity-Autonomous adaptation Vulnerability explained two definitions in relates length of time: Current vulnerability=Current impacts-Coping range Future vulnerability=Future impacts-Planned adaptation-Coping range Vulnerability and adaptivity in agriculture could concern ecological, economic and social systems too. Reducing agroecosystem’s vulnerability needs to assess and determinate the main cause of problem. Examining impact/change’s character, that influences adaptive capacity. (Iglesias, 2003). Measuring methods of vulnerability and adaptive capacity determinate indicators, and examines their connections. One part of indicators is quantitative measurable, other part is qualitative type and need description and explain. On the other view, one part of indicators could estimate exactly correctly, other part is not really and their determination is so uncertain (for example: in connection climate change). Qualification of Economic Systems Our classification ranks economic systems among four main types in relates adaptive capacity’s and vulnerability’s level. The table below (table 1) summarizes data’s in two times two matrix system. In first case economic system exposed high level external impact besides low level own autonomous adaptive capacity that results a vulnerable system that unable to sustain itself? In second case economic system exposed high level external impact besides high level own autonomous adaptive capacity noticed a system that capable to developed fast but exposed high level risk therefore becomes sensitive. In third case economic system exposed low level external impact besides low level own autonomous adaptive capacity results being backward and slow development opportunity besides low level risk. In last case economic system exposed low level</p><p id="Pg619">VII.

Cereal Research Communications 1294 present economic and agroecological systems. Besides climate long term change and evaluation of present situation is necessary to research in this topic within the framework alternative future scenarios. The climate change has a major impact both on economy and on ecosystems. EU is not homogenous, every country is vulnerable but in different sense and rate. Both because of climate change and socio-economic aspects, the CEECs and the Mediterranean countries are more vulnerable than the Northern European countries. In these areas there are great changes in agro-ecosystem, such as land use change, biodiversity loss parallel with the growing risk of natural disasters and the Southern parts of Europe require more irrigation. The rate of the probable catastrophes will increase maybe in every parts of Europe. Biodiversity will change too, for example the many species may be threaten. Because of the great differences on the rate of sensitivity and vulnerability, the regional analysis and regionally fit policy framework is required.

The results obtained suggest, that milling and baking quality of wheat grain is highly influenced by the production site, especially by the soil-climatic conditions of that. In particular, soil type of the given region proved to be a primary indicator for grain quality. Keywords: winter wheat, quality map, soil, interrelations Introduction Hungary is a land of high milling and baking quality in Europe. Wheat production in this area is done on more than one million hectares yearly. Quality is determined by three major factors; geographic location, agronomic practices and the biological bases have profound influence on milling and baking quality of wheat. Hungary is a country located in the Carpathian basin with a relatively high proportion of agricultural – and within that arable land. The total area of Hungary is 93.030 km2, from what 4.5 million ha is covered by field crops. Geographic location, soil-climatic conditions, hydrological properties give a chance for this land to produce large amounts and good quality crops. The annual precipitation is about 580 mm, the average temperature 11 oC. The heat amount regarding the vegetation period of annual crops ranges between 1465-1280 oC from which the latter represents the northest boundary of kernel maize production. In Hungary agriculture is a considerable branch of economics – it contributes 3.6 % to the national GDP (2006). Grain crops are produced on about two third of the total arable area. The major grain crops are as follows: winter wheat (1.1 mill.ha), corn - kernel maize (1.1 mill.ha), winter barley (0.36 mill.ha) and other grain crops, like rye, oats, spring barley, triticale, buckwheat etc (0.18 mill.ha). Some traditional crops like rice have been almost disappeared in recent years. Hungary has been a bread basket of Europe in the nineteenth century. The milling industry has soon become a high tech example for other countries. „Hard wheat, from the Danube basin, was ideally suited to the high-grinding system, and, when steam power became available, Hungary became the centre of milling industry” (Kent 1990). In 1885 Johann Treyer, a specialist of the one time Vienna Stock Exchange edited his wheat quality map for commercial purposes (Fig 1). The map indicates „quality regions” of the Carpathian basin with ranks from i. to xii. in descending order. The first six regions were considered of superb quality. Gradings of this map still correlate with todays’ wheat quality figures (protein, gluten and farinographic values). The total grain production varies between 13 to 17 million metric tons yearly from which amount the proportion of wheat and maize is about 8-14 million t. 3-5 million tons are exported in form of grain, and the rest is used and processed inland. The latter will contribute to food export as well in form of animals, meat, meat products, milk, milk products and other processed food. Hungary has an agricultural export of 2.5-3.0</p><p id="Pg622">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1296 billion EUR from which the share of grain, fodder and milling products is about 20 %. Market of grain and grain products is rather diverse. Regarding the new European member states, nowadays more than half of this export has a destination within EU (56.3 % EU; 24.5 % former SU states and 19.2 % to third countries in 2004).

One is the breeding for special quality features like high protein wheat varieties, wheat for gluten free diets etc. The other is the improvement in crop production techniques in favour of reducing climatic and crop year impacts on amount and quality of yield (Table1). Such fields are plant nutrition, plant protection, water and energy saving soil tillage methods, improvement in harvest and storage. The third direction attempts are made towards is related to „healthy food”. Extensive research is done to identify and detect contamination and discharge of pesticide residues in grain crops. Also, research on mycotoxins became a new issue since various popular organic farming activities representing a new risk factor have been increased recently.</p><p id="Pg623">VII.

Wheat production and quality data of the Concordia Gabona Control Inc under the auspicies of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Hungary were used in this study. Comparisons of seven geographic regions were made regarding six quality parametres. Results and discussion The results obtained suggest, that wheat grain quality manifestation is highly influenced by the production site, - in our study the region representing different soil-climatic conditions (Table 2). There were also considerable differences in the trends of quality parametres. Protein values were almost uniform having a variation less than 1 % in comparison between regions.

Cereal Research Communications 1298 while forest soils, sandy soils and other sites provided less chance for quality grain. The magnitude of grain quality figures correlate approximately with the historical rankings of Treyer. Conclusions Since 2004 Hungary has been a member state of the European Union. Europe is overproducing wheat, however a considerable amount of quality wheat is imported in large amounts from overseas. It is a point to ponder whether there is a chance to replace overseas’ wheat with a wheat of traditional European quality. However it can be concluded, that milling and baking quality of wheat grain is highly influenced by the production site, especially by the soil-climatic conditions of that. In particular, soil type of the given region proved to be a primary indicator for grain quality.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1299 EFFECT OF MINERAL FERTILIZERS ON CROP YIELDS AND N2O EMISSION FROM LOAMY SAND SPODOSOL OF NORTH - WESTERN RUSSIA Elena RIZHIYA – Elena OLENCHENKO – Sergey PAVLIK – Eugene BALASHOV – Natalya BUCHKINA Department of Soil Physics, Physical Chemistry and Soil Biophysics, Agrophysical Research Institute, Grazhdansky prospect, 14, St. Petersburg, 195220, Russia, e-mail: alen_rizh@mail.ru Abstract: High rates of farmyard manure (FYM) change chemical and physical properties of soil top layer. These changes can last for years and lead not only to yield increases but presumably to higher N2O emissions, especially if extra mineral N-fertilizers are used. The objective of our study was to find out how different rates of mineral fertilizers affect crop yields and N2O emission from a loamy sand Spodosol with (“FYM” plot) and without (“no FYM” plot) earlier amendment with a high rate of FYM. It was shown in field experiments that barley, cabbage and carrot yields were significantly higher on “FYM” plots, compared to the “no FYM” ones. The differences in the topsoil properties affected N2O emissions only in wet growing season of 2007, when “FYM” soils emitted more N2O than “no FYM” ones. In dry growing season of 2006 there was no difference in N2O emissions between “FYM” and “no FYM” plots. Application of mineral N-fertilizers into “FYM” and “no FYM” soils not always led to crop yield increase but, if the soil conditions were good for denitrification to occur, always increased cumulative N2O flux. In wet growing season of 2007 a lower N-input with mineral fertilisers to the FYM soil caused a higher N2O flux than a higher N-input to “no FYM” one. Keywords: light-textured soils, farmyard manure, mineral NPK, barley, cabbage, carrot yields, N2O emission Introduction Application of manures to light-textured soils, which is a widely spread practice in Russia and other countries (Rutkoviene et al., 2007), can substantially change chemical and physical properties of the soil top layer and thus can affect not only crop yields but also probably direct N2O fluxes which depend very much on soil physical properties as well as on amounts of soil available nitrogen and carbon (Dobbie and Smith, 2003, Meng et al., 2005). An attempt to increase crop yields even more by applying nitrogen with mineral fertilizers to the soil, which was previously “enriched” with manures, may affect N2O emission from these soils. The objective of our study was to find out how different rates of mineral fertilizers influence crop yields and N2O emission from a loamy sand Spodosol with and without earlier amendment with high rates of FYM. Materials and methods The field experiment was carried out in St. Petersburg region of Russia (59o34’N, 30o 08’E) in 2006 and 2007. The soil of the region was a loamy sand Spodosol. Two plots were included into the experiment. One was amended with FYM twice – in spring 2003 and 2004 – receiving 160 t ha-1 of FYM (656 kg N ha-1) each time (“FYM” plot). The other plot was left with no FYM (“no FYM” plot). In 2006 and 2007 both plots were split into two: one half of each plot received high rates of N, P and K with mineral fertilizers, while the other half did not receive any or, in case with carrot, only low rates of the nutrients (Table 1). Three crops were grown on the plots in the two growing seasons – barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and cabbage (Brassica oleracea L.) in 2006, and carrot (Daucus carota L.) in 2007.</p><p id="Pg626">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Gas samples were collected twothree times a week throughout the growing seasons. SOC content, soil total N content, amount of soil available nitrogen (Nmin), available P2O5 and K2O, soil bulk density (BD), soil water content (W) were measured with conventional methods. Crop yields were measured at the end of the growing seasons. Daily rainfall data were received from the Menkovo meteorological station of the Agrophysical Research Institute situated near the experimental fields. Results and discussion At the beginning of our experiment the topsoil of both “FYM” and “no FYM” plots was rich with phosphorus (Table 2) – 200 mg P kg-1 soil is enough for growing cereals and vegetables (Kadar, 2007) – but did not have enough mineral nitrogen. The “FYM” plot was rich while the “no FYM” plot was very poor with available potassium – cereals and vegetables need more than 600 mg K kg-1 soil (Gorodniy et al., 1985). Soil of the “FYM” plot contained more soil organic carbon (SOC) than that of the “no FYM” plot and thus had higher water contents at the beginning of the growing seasons – 25.4% versus 20.2% on barley plots, 24.3% versus 19.5% on cabbage plots, and 32.1% versus 22.5% on carrot plots, in “FYM” and “no FYM” treatments, respectively.

At the same time application of nutrients with mineral fertilizers to the soil of both “FYM” and “no FYM” plots resulted in a significant yield increase only for cabbage crop while barley and carrot yields increased insignificantly.</p><p id="Pg627">VII.

Crop yields grown on the loamy sandy Spodosol in 2006 (barley and cabbage) and in 2007 (carrot) with different treatments N2O cumulative fluxes were lower in the growing season of 2006 than of 2007 (Fig. 2), as growing season of 2006 was dry and soil conditions were not good for denitrification and N2O production (Buchkina at al., 2008). In 2006 differences in cumulative N2O fluxes were found only for the barley plots. The N2O fluxes were significantly affected by mineral N-fertilizer application but not by the differences in soil properties of “FYM” and no “FYM” plots. For the cabbage crop, neither mineral N application, nor the differences in soil properties significantly affected cumulative N2O fluxes. We assumed that topsoil of the cabbage plots, due to regular cultivation of the crop to stop weeds growing, was too dry to produce a lot of N2O, especially under the dry weather conditions of 2006. Figure 2. Cumulative N2O flux from the loamy sandy Spodosol with different treatments for the growing seasons of 2006 and 2007 N2O flux from the soil of both plots was higher in the wetter growing season of 2007 than of 2006. Topsoil properties affected this flux – soil of the “FYM” plot produced significantly more N2O than the soil of the “no FYM” plot. A lower N-input with mineral fertilizers produced higher or the same cumulative N2O fluxes in 2007 than a higher N-input in 2006. For the “no FYM” plots, application of 40 kg N ha-1 to the carrot plot in 2007 resulted in a significantly higher cumulative N2O flux from soil than application of 70 kg N ha-1 to the cabbage plot as well as in the same N2O flux from the barley plot receiving 60 kg N ha-1 in 2006. For “FYM” plots, application of 60 kg N ha-1 to the carrot plot in 2007 resulted in a higher N2O flux from soil than application of 110 kg N ha-1 to both barley and cabbage plots in 2006.

Besides, application of 60 kg N ha-1 to the “FYM” plot in 2007 resulted in a higher N2O cumulative flux than application of 110 kg N ha -1 to the “no FYM” plot. It was earlier shown by other researchers that usage of mineral Nfertilizers resulted in higher N2O fluxes from soils enriched with SOC than from relatively ”poor” soils (Velthof et al., 2003; Meng et al., 2005). We observed that only in wet growing season of 2007 while in dry growing season of 2006 N2O fluxes did not depend on how rich or poor with SOC the soil was. Conclusions High rates of FYM, applied to a loamy sand Spodosol in 2003 - 2004, changed topsoil properties of the “FYM” plot substantially that resulted in still significant increase of crop yields in 2006 and 2007. The differences in the topsoil properties affected N2O emissions only in wet growing season of 2007, when “FYM” soils emitted more N2O than “no FYM” ones. In dry growing season of 2006 there was no difference in N2O emissions between “FYM” and “no FYM” plots. Application of mineral N-fertilizers to “FYM” and “no FYM” plots not always led to crop yield increase but, if the soil conditions were favourable for denitrification to occur, always increased cumulative N2O fluxes. In wet growing season of 2007 a lower N-input with mineral fertilisers to the FYM soil caused a higher N2O flux than a higher N-input to “no FYM” one. Acknowledgements We thank Prof. V.A.

Grain yield and P, Ca and Mg concentration in leaves were analysed. Highly significant effects of the both, year and genotype for all traits were determined. Grain yield of maize genotypes ranged from 5.11 t ha -1 in dry year to 7.39 t ha -1 in more favourable year. Regardless of low soil P content, an adequate P status (3.17 g kg -1 ) in maize were found, while lower Ca (5.62 g kg -1 ) and Mg (2.36 g kg -1 ) mean concentrations in leaves are consequences of their low level in soil. However, considerable differences in P, and especially Ca and Mg status were found among parental lines, what was reflected on their progeny. The results indicated that origin of inbred line may have an important role for nutrient content inheritance. Keywords: maize, inbred lines, hybrids, acid soil, yield, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium Introduction Worldwide, acid soils limit crop production. The poor fertility of acid soils in Croatia is attributed mostly to inadequate level of available phosphorus, as well as Ca and Mg (Kovacevic et al., 1993). Development and growing maize genotypes that are capable to attain high yield under nutrient stress, or some other abiotic stress condition, recently receive greater attention. There is necessity for evaluation of different genotypes under suboptimal conditions, as yield and plant nutritional status is under great influences of environmental and genetic factors. Considerable role of genotype on nutritional status of maize genotypes grown on acid soil have been reported (Antunović et al., 2004). The present study aimed to evaluate five maize inbred lines and their hybrids for grain yield and to determine range of their genetic variability for P, Ca and Mg status at acid soil condition. Materials and methods Five maize inbred lines and their three widely spread commercial hybrids in Croatia (OsSK552, OsSK596 and OsSK602) were grown in the location of east Croatia (about 45°30' N, 18°40' E) from 2003 to 2005. Female parents of hybrids (L1, L2, and L3) belong to BSSS group, while male parents (L4 and L5) are of Lancaster origin. The field trial was conducted on a stagnic luvisol whose main characteristics are low pH and inadequate supply with available P, Ca and Mg (Table 1). The experiment was set up in a randomized complete block design in three replicates. The size of experimental plot was 8.4 m2. Usual crop management practice for maize was applied. Fertilization was uniform for all three years and experimental area received 175 kg N, 150 kg P2O5 and 225 kg K2O ha -1 per year. Maize was sown on the planned density of 57143 plant ha-1 at the end of April and harvested during October. Grain yields were calculated on the 14% moisture basis.</p><p id="Pg630">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1304 Table 1.

The samples of ear-leaves (20 leaves per plot) were taken at the beginning of silking stage. The concentrations of P, Ca and Mg in plant samples were measured by ICP technique following microwave digestion procedure with HNO3+H2O2. The statistical analyses were performed using factorial analysis of variance, considering year and genotype as a main factors. Table 2.

Highly significant interaction between genotype and year (GY) was not recorded only for P ear-leaf concentration (Table 3). Table 3.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1305 attained in 2005, mostly due to wet summer. Josipovic et al. (2005) reported that lower maize yields in Croatia are usually related to lack of precipitation and higher air temperatures during July and August. Hegyi et al. (2005) and Berzseny and Lap (2005) also emphasized the significant effect of year on maize grain yield. In the drought and heat stress conditions the grain filling period gets shorter and late-maturating hybrids can’t achieve their high yield potential (Marton et al., 2005). As expected, the hybrids alone yielded considerably higher than inbred lines, and female parents more than male lines did (Table 5). Table 4.

Particularly low Mg contents (below 2.0 g kg-1) were observed in the 2005 growing season. The highest P concentration in the same year is a result of better efficiency of added mineral fertilizers due to higher soil moisture content. On the contrary, the Ca and Mg ear-leaf concentration was the highest in the year with poor water supplies. The same results reported Izsáki (2006) and Kovacevic et al. (2004). Table 5.

The concentrations ranged from 2.88 to 3.79 g kg-1 for P, 5.09 to 6.23 g kg-1 for Ca, and from 1.83 to 2.77 g kg-1 for Mg (Table 5). The both male parents (L4 and L5) of Lancaster origin had higher P concentration, indicated better P uptake ability. Some previous investigations also pointed out the Os1-44 line as a high phosphorus accumulator (Brkic et al., 1996). Inbred parents varied markedly especially for Ca and Mg concentration, but those properties were differently inherited in their progeny. In the</p><p id="Pg632">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1306 most cases, concentrations of analysed elements in hybrids were at the level of parents mean or lower. The only exception is Mg concentration in OsSK602, which was higher compared to both parental lines. The higher Ca and Mg contents in parents L1 and L4 are related to higher content of these elements in their hybrid (OsSK552) as well. Also, the lowest Ca content in OsSK602 is obviously inherited from its parents (L3 and L5). Conclusions The results showed that the both, year and genotype significantly affected maize grain yield, and P, Ca and Mg ear-leaf concentration. On acid soil poor fertility grain yield of maize genotypes over three years ranged from 5.11 to 7.39 t ha-1. In spite of low soil P content, an adequate P status (3.17 g kg-1) in maize were determined, while somewhat lower Ca (5.62 g kg-1) and Mg (2.36 g kg-1) concentrations in leaves were related to their low availability in soil. Although the investigation was carried out on a few genotypes only, the notable genetic variability for P, Ca and Mg status was ascertained. The results indicated that origin of inbred lines, as parental component of hybrids, plays an important role in inheritance of nutrient contents, but that genetic impact is greatly affected by environmental factors. The Os1-44 line could be used as an adequate source and carrier for the investigated properties. References Antunović, M. – Rastija, M. – Kovacevic, V.: 2004.

Trojstva 3, Osijek, Croatia, spetrovic@pfos.hr 2 Agricultural Institute Osijek, Južno predgrađe 17, Osijek, Croatia Abstract: The objective of this paper was to examine influence of sowing rate, environmental conditions and genotype on yield and traits important for yield formation ( number of ears m -2 , number of spikelet’s per ear and 1000 kernel weight) of winter wheat. Research work was conducted on five winter wheat genotypes, sown with three different sowing rates (400, 500 and 600 germinable seeds m -2 ), during two vegetation years. Genotypes and sowing rates had different influence on examined traits. Significant differences in yield were found in both vegetation years among examined genotypes and in one vegetation year among sowing rates. Results have sown that even with lower sowing rate it is possible to achieve high winter wheat yield and that lower sowing rates can be recommended under optimal sowing conditions. Keywords: winter wheat, environmental conditions, sowing rates, yield, yield components Introduction Two main goals of winter wheat breeding are increase of grain yield (Guberac et al., 2005) and achieving high quality requirements (Szabó and Pepó, 2007). Winter wheat yield, as a complex trait, depends of various plant traits and it is influenced by genotype and agroecological conditions (Pepo, 2007, Drezner et al., 2007)) such as soil conditions (Birkás et al. 2006), quantity and dispersion of precipitation (Balogh et al., 2007) and temperature variations during vegetation (Balla et al. 2006). Main yield components are number of ears per unit area, number of kernels per ear and 1000 kernel weight. According to Bavec et al. (2002) ontogenetically ear number per unit area is the first yield component to be fixed and, thus, assumes particular importance. Ear number per unit area can be seen, also, as a relation between plant trait - tillering and sowing rates (Guberac et al., 2005). Influence of different sowing rates on winter wheat yield, various important wheat traits and growing conditions was examined by Olsen and Weiner (2007), Novoselović et al. (2007), Varga et al. (2000). According to some authors (Varga et al., 2001) high sowing rates reduce risk of lower yield caused by late sowing; freezing temperatures during winter and poor tillering during winter and early spring grow. On the other hand, in lower sowing rates intensive productive tillering, increased kernel number per ear and 1000 kernel weight can compensate for grain yield. Soil conditions - good drainage, water capacity and air regime – could also have important role in achieving higher yield with lower sowing rate. That is especially important in the years when the precipitations and temperatures significantly differ from average values. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate influence of genotype, environment and sowing rate on winter wheat yield and finding the best suitable sowing rate for continental climatic conditions in East Croatia. Materials and methods Research work was conducted in the eastern Croatia (field trials near Osijek; soil type - eutric cambisol, 6.3 pH in KCl) during two vegetation years. Research work included</p><p id="Pg634">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1308 five winter wheat genotypes: Ema, Marta, Martina, Osk 76 and Žitarka (as a standard). The experimental design was a randomised block design with five repetitions and basic plot of 7.56 m2. The examined genotypes were sowed with three sowing rates: 400, 500 and 600 germinable seeds m-2. In total, experiment was consisted of 75 experimental plots. In both vegetation years sowing was conducted in optimal sowing time and common agricultural practice for winter wheat in East Croatia was used. Number of ears was counted few days before harvesting. After that, 50 ears were taken randomly from each plot for further measurements (number of spikelets per ear, 1000 kernel weight). In total, in two vegetation years, 7.500 ears were examined. For experimental years separately, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) for grain yield, 1000 kernel weight, spikelet number per ear and ear number m-2 was conducted using SAS 9.1 (2002-2003 by SAS Institute Inc.). The LSD test was used to determine significant differences (at p≤0.05 and p≤0.01) between treatments. In the analysis of environmental conditions it should be stressed that precipitation during June and first decade of July 2001 were above average. Regarding temperatures, it should be stressed that air temperature in February 2001 and during the spring same year, were above average (in February even above 160C during some days). On the other hand winter 2001/02 was colder that average values. Results and discussion Mean values for the measured traits are shown in Table 1. ANOVA showed significant differences among tested genotypes and sowing rates for all traits (Table 2). Table 1. Average values of the measured traits for examined genotypes and sowing rates In both vegetation years genotypes had highly significant (p≤0.01) influence on 1000 kernel weight and yield. Differences among genotypes for examined traits were expected since they have different pedigree and genetic structure.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1309 accordance with the research of Guberac et al. (2005) and Bavec et al. (2002). Differences in yield of the same genotype in two vegetation years (genotype Marta, for example, had 844 kg lower yield in 2001/02 that in 2000/01) can be explained by environmental influences. In first vegetation year from February and during spring 2001 temperature was above average and that caused relatively fast crop growth and development. That, in combination with enough precipitation, probably caused higher yields. Environmental influence on genotypes was stressed also by Varga et al. 2000 and Guberac et al. (2000). Table 2.

Probably, in lower seeding rates plants compensated influence of higher sowing rate with higher productive tillering. In both vegetation years sowing rate had very significant influence on 1000 kernel weight. Higher sowing rate caused decreasing in 1000 kernel weight from 38.8 g to 38.5 g and from 40.7 g to 40.1. g. Similar results were reported by Bavec et al. (2002) and Varga et al. (2000), while Guberac et al. (2000) did not find statistically significant influence of sowing rate on 1000 kernel weight. In 2000/01 sowing rate did not have statistically significant influence on yield. In 2001/02 sowing rate had statistically very significant influence on yield. Highest yield was achieved with sowing rate of 500 germinable seeds (6842.8 kg ha-1) and it was significantly (p≤0.01) higher that the yield with sowing rate of 600 germinable seeds (6614.4 kg ha-1). Yield with the sowing rate of 400 germinable seeds was at the same level as yield of 500 germinable seeds. Reason for that are differences in 1000</p><p id="Pg636">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1310 kernel weight. Sowing rates of 400 and 500 germinable seeds had significantly (p≤0.01) higher 1000 kernel weight that sowing rate of 600 germinable seeds. Similar results were reported by Bavec et al. (2002) and Guberac et al. (2005). Regarding interaction between plant density, climatic conditions and soil it should be stressed that good results with lower sowing rates were achieved on soil with good physical and chemical conditions. First vegetation year was more humid, during June precipitations were more than twice above the average, but soil had a good drainage and satisfying air regime was preserved. In second year, during May, precipitations were above average, while during June they were half of the average amount. In spite of unsatisfactory distribution of precipitations, due to the good soil physical conditions, plants had enough water for growing and seed maturing. Conclusions Presented results have showed important influence of genotypes, environmental conditions, soil and sowing rates on winter wheat yield. Despite of the different environmental conditions during the years of investigation, on the soil with good physical and chemical conditions lower seeding rates achieved high yield. Based on the obtained results it can be concluded that sowing rate of 400 germinable seeds m-2 can be recommended for all investigated genotypes under optimal sowing conditions in East Croatia.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1311 OVERVIEW ON THE FLORA AND VEGETATION OF A BEREG-MIRE: A RELICT HABITAT IN A SPECIAL AREA OF CONSERVETION Daniel CSERHALMI – János NAGY Institute of Botany and Ecophysilology, Szent István University, Gödöllő, H-2103, Páter K. u. 1. Cserhalmi.Daniel@mkk.szie.hu Abstract: Designation of the Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) is ordered by the ’Habitat Directive’ for the protection of plants and animals (except birds) and their habitats. The Navad-patak mire which was previously known for its Oxycocco-Sphagnatea associations is situated in the Bereg-plain near to Csaroda, which is in the center of a SAC area. In spite of the surrounding arables it contains many protected and rare plant species and plant associations. To describe the vegetation we made coenological records with BraunBlanquet method using by permanent and temporary sampling plots and used Simon’s nature conservation ranks. Regarding to the arables the rate of weeds and disturbance tolerant native species were high, but the number of adventive species were low. Emerged floating fens are the main importance of the mire in the middle of the peaty bed, where Sphagnum species may reappear. Our research showed, that these valuable habitats have more importance in the agricultural zone and attracts attention to environmental friendly farm management. Keywords: Navad-patak, Bereg-plain, ecological indicator values Introduction The intensive farm management in the last few decades effected decay in many natural and seminatural habitats. Nature protection and environmental friendly farming came to the fore and all around in the EU designated areas, where farming is limited by the law, and the conservation of the nature is more important. The designation of these Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) is ordered by the ’Habitat Directive’ for the protection of plants and animals (except birds) and their habitats. They are combined with the ’Bird Directive’ and the NATURA2000 ecological network was formed (275/2004. Goverment Decree). SAC are described in the regulation number 45/2006 Ministry of Environment and Water. The Bereg-plain is situated in North-Eastern Hungary and it belongs to the SAC. The Bereg-plain together with the Bodrogköz (Tuba 1995) is part of the Samicum. Our study area is the Navad-patak-mire, which is near to Csaroda and Beregdaróc, and it is just in the middle in a SAC. The mire also belongs to the administrative territory of the Hortobágy National Park. For these reasons the importance of a natural habitat among the arable fields is much greater. Navad-patak was first mentioned by Simon (1953), who related the vegetation of the mire, and the presence of the presumably small extension of the Eriophoro vaginatiSphagnetum oxycoccetosum association. The botanical research was continued by Fintha (1994) and Tóth (1997), later Nagy and his colleagues started the regular monitoring of the mire (Nagy et al. 1999, 2007). Later Cserhalmi (2007) made digital photointerpretations to reconstruct a former vegetation of the mire. The purpose of the research was to describe the flora and vegetation of the Navad-patak mire, and to analyse the results with ecological indicator values and nature conservation attributes. We would like to draw attention to a highly protected habitat in the agricultural desert, where the environmental friendly farm management should obtain a greater share.</p><p id="Pg638">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1312 Materials and methods The study area (48° 10’ 32” N, 22° 30’ 45” E) is about 500 meters long and on average 80 meters wide (Szurdoki - Nagy 2002) peaty bed of Navad-brook. It belongs to the Samicum plant-geographical region on the North Eastern part of Pannonicum, that lies on the South Eastern part of the Holarcticum (Soó 1964). The mean annual sunshine hours are ca. 1950, annual mean temperature is 9.4 – 9.5 oC. Yearly precipitation is 630 – 660 mm, of which 370 – 380 falls during the vegetation period (Marosi and Somogyi 1990). The distribution and amount of precipitation and the ground water level can vary greatly in successive years. The mire belongs to the administration territory of the Hortobágy National Park. It gets artificial water supply from 1994. Until 2001 it was surrounded by arables, now it's belted with a young Quercus robur plantation. The coenological records were made by the method of Braun-Blanquet (1964) in permanent and temporary sampling plots. In the sample plots the cover value was estimated on a percentage scale. We used Borhidi’s relative Simon’s nature conservation ranks (Horváth et al. 1995) and calculated percentage pro rate for each category. Results and discussion The vegetation map (Figure 1.) was draw in 2005. On the marginal zone the dominant associations are Populetum tremulae, Rubo-Robinietum and Pruno spinosaeCrataegetum. The rate of weeds are very high with many cosmopolitan species. On the north side of the mire there are only remnains of the original Fraxino pannonicaeUlmetum, and the black locust and quaking-poplars displaced the oak trees. A little patch of Betula pendula also appears among the poplars in the south side of the mire, which can consider as the proof of the former cold and wet climate. Figure 1. The vegetation map of Navad-patak mire In the middle of the bed floating mire associations emerged above the water level. The dominant species are Salix cinerea, Typha latifolia and Thelypteris palustris in the</p><p id="Pg639">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1313 emerged level. Among the floating mires Lemnetea associations covers the water surface. The free floating level was dominated by Lemna minor, Spirodella polyrrhiza and Stratiotes aloides and the submerged free floating level was dominated by Riccia fluitans, Lemna trisulca and Utricularia vulgaris. The main importance of these floating mires that the peatmoss dominant Salici cinereae-Sphagnetum recurvi association can develop from the Thelypteridi-Typhetum latifoliae association (Nagy 2003.) on them, according to the the succession stages, previously described for the Bereg-plain. The plants collect the nutritients of the water, and paralelly – as the dead plants transfrom into peat – the avilable nutritients and the pH of the water decrease (Nagy – Tuba 2003). In 2007 we measured 5.91-6.22 pH on the surface. The floating plants forms skirt-mires (Nagy – Tuba 2003) which can described as a matted carpet. After the colonization of higher plants the skirts can fuse with other types of floating mires. It means, that the succession can run from floating Lemnetea- to Sphagnum dominated associations, if the human caused demages are minimal. In the north side of the mire a little patch of Carici elongatae-Alnetum denotes the former alder-carr, which belted the Oxycocco-sphagnatea associations (Simon 1960.) in the 1950’s. This association expanded in the last few years, and little floating islands appeared, which also a good substrate for the peat mosses. The rate of weed and disturbance tolerant species is very high according to the surrounding arables (Figure 2.) as we mentioned above.

Plants of mesothropic and moderately nutritent rich habitats are dominant. In 1960 there were many protected species in the mire, like Drosera rotundifolia, Salix pentandra and Sphagnum species (Simon 1960), but now all these plants extincted. Nowadays the protected Cicuta virosa can be found in large quantities. In the north side of the mire, close to the oaks we also found a few Epipactis tallosii. Among the protected species there are many important specialist, just like Thelypteris palustris, Dryopteris carthusiana, or Carex pseudocyperus. It seems that the rate of species</p><p id="Pg640">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1314 reflects to natural conditions decreased, and species indicates degree of degradation increased. Conclusions Our researches clearly showed, that the Navad-patak mire is a very important seminatural habitat. If the natural succession processes can proceed, Sphagnum can reappear on the mire surfaces. To faster these processes the maintenance of permanent water level is necessary. The Quercus robur plantation seems to be unattended, so regular spacing and nurturing would be desirable. Furthermore farmers should use environmental friendly farm management to protect the mire against deteriorative pesticids and chemical fertilizers.

J. Strossmayer, Faculty of Agriculture HR-31000 Osijek, Croatia Abstract: The field experiment was conducted (April 2004) on planosol (a = ordinary fertilization, b = a + P1, c = a + P2, d = a + P3 , e = a + P1, f = a + P2, g = a + P3 , h = a + P2K2). The amounts of added either/or phosphorus (P2O5) and potassium (K2O) were (kg ha -1 ) 500, 1000 and 1500, for the step 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Nitrogen amount was equilized for all treatments by adequate quatities of CAN (calcium ammonium nitrate: 27% N). In general, influences of P and K fertilization on mobile fraction (NH4-Acetate + EDTA; pH 4.65; determination using inductively coupled plasma) of 23 elements in soil (sampling in November 2005) were low. For example, non-significant differences among the treatments were found for 13 elements (Mg, S, Fe, Mn, Zn, Mo, Cr, Ni, Al, B, Ba, Co and Pb). Further, for three elements (Se, As and Hg) the concentrations were very low and under detectable ranges of the applied methods. P fertilization significantly influenced on soil P (+145%), Ca (+58%), Sr (+53%) and Cd (+12%), At the same time, K fertilization resulted by significant increases of soil K (+77%) and decreases of soil Cu (-17%), and Na (54%). However, the amounts of tested elements in soil were mainly low (the control treatment in mg kg -1 : 84 for P, 188 for K, 362 for Ca, 3.12 for Cu, 1.15 for Sr, 23.7 for Na and 0.084 for Cd). It is evidently that in our study low levels of harmful elements were found. Keywords: ameliorative fertilization, phosphorus, potassium, soil testing, planosol Introduction Acid soils have been considered less suitable for highly productive agriculture. Less than adequate soil and crop management practices have often contributed to aggravate the typical problems of acid soils, by promoting losses of bases, thus decreasing the pH and increasing aluminum saturation (Moniz et al., 1997). Low levels of plant available nutrients, especially phosphorus (P), are also in connection with low fertility of acid soils. Aim of this study was testing nutritional status of planosol under influences of ameliorative P and potassium (K) fertilization, while yields of maize and soybeans were given in the previous study (Kovačević et al., 2007). Material and methods General information about Bjelovar-Bilogora County Bjelovar-Bilogora County (BBC) is part of Western and Central Pannonian Subregion of Croatia. Total area of the county is 2651 km2 or 4.7% of state territory. Luvisol and planosol are dominant soil types in this part of Croatia. Acid or very acid reaction, high potential acidity, low cation exchange capacity and base saturation as well as low humus and available nutrient contents are main characteristics of luvisol. Planosol is similar chemical characteristics. Additionally, planosol is soil of very low natural fertility, with adverse physical properties due to the occurrence of a compacted impervious horizon (Kovačević and Bašić, 1997). According the data of State Bureau for Statistics, mean yields of wheat and maize in the BBC for the 1996-2003 period were 2.95 t ha-1 (16562 ha of wheat harvested area year-</p><p id="Pg642">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1316 1) and 4.94 t ha-1 (maize: 30870 ha year-1), and they were for 33% (wheat: 4.41 t ha-1; 125260 ha year-1) and 19% (maize: 6.08 t ha-1; 175150 ha year-1) lower than in eastern Croatia region. Specific soil characteristics are main reasons for wheat and maize yield differences between two compared areas. The field experiment The field experiment of P and K fertilization was conducted on Pavlovac planosol (municipality Veliki Grdjevac, Bjelovar-Bilogora County) in term April 23, 2004 (a = ordinary fertilization, b = a + P1, c = a + P2, d = a + P3 , e = a + P1, f = a + P2, g = a + P3 , h = a + P2K2). The amounts of added either/or phosphorus (P2O5) and potassium (K2O) were (kg ha -1) 500, 1000 and 1500, for the step 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The triplephoshate enriched with sulphur and zinc (45% P2O5 + 1. 2% S + 0.06% Zn) was used for P fertilization. Potassium salt (KCl containing 60% K2O) was source of K. Nitrogen amount was equilized for all treatments by adequate quatities of calcium ammonium nitrate: (27% N). The experiment was conducted in four replicates (gross of basic plot 77 m2). Acid reaction (pH in KCl =3.99) and moderate level of plant available P and adequate levels of available K ( 9.4 P2O5 and 17.8 mg K2O 100 g -1 of soil ) were found at starting of the experiment. Response of maize (2004) and soybean (2005) were shown in the previous study (Kovačević et al., 2007). Sampling and sample analysis Two soil samples were taken before starting the experiment from 0-30 cm of depth (April 3, 2004). The second soil sampling was made in term November 15, 2005. Mobile fraction of the individual elements (total 23) were extracted with NH4 Acetate + EDTA (pH 4.65) according Lakanen and Ervio (1971) and their concentrations were determined using inductively coupled plasma (ICP). Results and discussion In general, the results of soil testing of the control treatment are similar to preliminary investigation of the soil properties at starting of the experiment. Although, soil pH was independent of the applied fertilization, hydrolitical acidity had tendency for decreasing trend as affected both triplex and potassium salt application. Plant available P levels in soil were increased up to near 3-fold due to ameliorative P fertilization, while increasing of available K were considerably lower. Grain yields of maize were high and ameliorative fertilization moderately influenced on maize yield. Only applications of the highest K rate and PK combination resulted by significant yield increases, for 5% and 11%, respectively (Table 1). In the next year, soybeans responded considerably better because the yields were increased up to 21% (influences of P), 16% (influences of K) and 29 % (PK influences). The growing seasons 2004 and 2005 were favorable for maize and soybeans growing. Sum of precipitation in the 4-month (May-August) period were 255 and 427 mm and it was balanced distributed (Bjelovar Weather Bureau). In general, low yields of the spring crops are in connection with water deficit, especially during July and August (Josipović et al. 2005). Table 1.

Cereal Research Communications 1318 contrast to the chernozem soil, in our study plant available P level of planosol was considerably lower (15.6 and 8.4 mg P2O5100 g -1, respectively). In general, influences of P and K fertilization on mobile fraction of 23 elements in soil were low. For example, non-significant differences among the treatments were found for 13 elements (Mg, S, Fe, Mn, Zn, Mo, Cr, Ni, Al, B, Ba, Co and Pb). Further, for three elements (Se, Hg and As) the concentrations were under detectable ranges. P fertilization significantly influenced on soil P (+145%), Ca (+58%), Sr (+53%) and Cd (+12%) and K fertilization resulted by significant increases of soil K (+77%) and decreases of soil Cu (-17%), and Na (-54%). Their amounts were mainly low (the control in mg kg-1: 84 for P, 188 for K, 362 for Ca, 3.12 for Cu, 1.15 for Sr, 23.7 for Na and 0.084 for Cd). In our study low levels of harmful elements were found (Table 2). Also, Šeput (2007) found low influences of ameliorative P fertilization on status of mobile fractions of 23 elements in soil of Lika region. For example, significant influences of P fertilization only on P, Cr and Ba status were found. Also, status of harmful elements in soil was low and this phenomenon is an indication of sustainability of Lika region and applied fertilization as well. Some recent studies emphasized importance of soil nutrient levels and soil degradation as environmental problem (Mengel and Kirkby 2001; Várallyay, 2006; Kádár 2007). Conclusions In general, in our study, moderate effects of P and K fertilization on maize and soybean yields as well as status of mobile fraction of 23 elements were found. We presume that combination of liming and fertilization could be resulted by higher yields. References Josipović M., Kovačević V., Petošić D., Šostarić J.: 2005.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1319 ACCUMULATION OF MACRONUTRIENTS IN SOILS AND SOME HERB SPECIES OF SPRUCE ECOSYSTEMS Margita KUKLOVÁ - Ján KUKLA 1 1 Department of soil and plant ecology, Institute of forest ecology, Štúrova 2, 960 53 Zvolen, e-mail: kuklova@savzv.sk, kukla@savzv.sk Abstract: The content of releasable macronutrients in Dystric Cambisols and their relation to nutrition of some herb species was studied on locality Hliníky (East Slovakia). The highest amounts of nutrients were found in surface humus horizons – several times higher in comparison with mineral soil layers (Ca 10-64 times, Mg 2.7-22, K 1.4-4.4 and P 0.8-2.8). The most abundant nutrients in all herb species were nitrogen (control stand 14100-30100 mg kg -1 , damaged stand 12200-31500 mg kg -1 – maximum in Dryopteris dilatata and Rubus idaeus), and potassium (control stand 4935-25325 mg kg-1, damaged stand 5078-24440 mg kg-1 – maximum in Luzula luzuloides and Dryopteris dilatata). The optimum Mg and S ranges were exceeded in all herb species, K in Luzula luzuloides and Dryopteris dilatata, P in Luzula luzuloides and Vaccinium myrtillus, N in Dryopteris dilatata and Rubus idaeus. Mean contents of nutrients (mg kg-1 of dry matter) in herbs sampled in both spruce stands decreased as follows: N (19700-21780) &gt; K (13198-16257) &gt; Ca (3419-4066) &gt; Mg (2688-2798) &gt; S (2132-2190) &gt; P (1046-1211). The differences between the two spruce stands were not statistically significant. Keywords: spruce ecosystems, Dystric Cambisols, herb shoots, nutrient contents Introduction The region of Middle Spiš is for a long time loaded by atmospheric pollutants issuing primarily from the local sources. The acid precipitation causes damage to assimilation organs of plants, by leaching away excessive amounts of nutrients, which the plants are not able to compensate. The toxic elements are the principal growth inhibitors (Faheed, 2005). The result is the chronically bad health state of cultivated spruce stands that are disintegrated gradually due to synergic effect of the abiotic and biotic factors. The share of incidental felling increased, and at present it reaches 70%. From this reason is necessary intensively to study the impact of acidification on natural ecosystems (Kukla et al., 2003; Barna and Bublinec, 2002; Birkás et al., 2006; Németh, 2006; Bálint et al., 2007; Tasi, 2005; Puri and Tiwana, 2005; Lacová and Stekauerová, 2007). In this contribution are presented the results obtained in the protected zone of the National Park Slovenský raj. Materials and methods The investigation was pursued in two 80-year-old spruce stands – a control with stand canopy 70-80% and stand density 0.7 and damaged stand by acid atmospheric pollutants, bark beetles and fungi, with canopy 30-50% and density 0.3-0.5. The research plots were established in region of the Forests of Spišská Nová Ves city Ltd. on locality Hliníky at altitude 950-960 m (48º51’55”N, 20º31’13”E). The localities are situated in the cool climatic region, with the mean monthly temperature in July 12-16 °C. The mean annual temperature is 4 -5 °C, the average annual precipitation reaches 700-800 mm (Miklós, 2002). The spruce ecosystems belong to the 5th forest vegetation tier, hemi-oligotrohic order of geobiocoens and group of types of geobiocoens AbietiFageta inferiora. The research started in July 2003. Inside each monitoring plot we established an area of 400 m2 for sampling shoots of selected herb species. The plant material was dried</p><p id="Pg646">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1320 during 48 hours at a temperature of 85oC, and homogenised (&lt;0.001 mm) with a Fritsch planetary micro mill. The total content of N and S was determined with an analyser NCS-FLASH 1112; P, K, Mg and Ca using an analyser AES-ICP after microwave wetmineralisation of the herb samples in concentrated nitric acid. Differences in the element concentrations between the control and damaged plot were tested with nonparametric Mann-Whitney´s U test (Statgraphics software). The soil samples were air-dried and passed through a sieve with a mesh size of 2 x 2 mm. The total content of soil N and S was determined by means of NCS-FLASH 1112; releasable P, Ca, Mg and K in extract of 2 M HNO3 using AES ICP. The soils were classified according to ISSS-ISRIC-FAO (1994, in Collective, 2000). Results and discussion The values of soil reaction and content of releasable macronutrients in soils of the studied spruce ecosystems are presented in Table 1. Table 1.

The most releasable macronutrients – substantially higher in comparison with mineral soil layers (Ca 10-64, Mg 2.7-22, K 1.4-4.4 and P 0.8-2.8 – times), were found in surface humus horizons. Among releasable nutrients absolutely dominate Ca followed by K. The contents of Ca, Mg and partially K (control stand) decreased with depth, while the content of P and partially K (damaged stand) at first decreased, and in lower soil layers again increased. This fact may be connected with increasing pH values, because periodically occurring anoxic environment caused transformation of P-binding Fe-oxides and SO4-ions to Fesulphides. The values of carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C/N) point at low quality of humus in surface soil horizons and almost all mineral layers. The amounts of macronutrients accumulated in the studied herb species are shown in Fig. 1 and 2. In all herb samples dominated N and K. The surplus of nitrogen supports longitudinal growth of plant shoots that lose their resistance against early frosts. This may be one of the factors causing strong worsened health state of cultivated spruce stands in the Spiš region. The highest content of N was accumulated in Dryopteris dilatata (Hoffm.) A.

Dandy et Wilmott, and shoots of Solidago virgaurea L., substantially less content of N was in the Vaccinium myrtillus L. and fertile shoots of L. luzuloides species. The contents of K – one of indispensable nutrient for higher plants (Kant et al., 2005) in studied herb species ranged between 4935-25325 mg kg-1 (control stand) and 4986-24440 mg kg-1 (damaged stand). The highest K values were found in shoots of the L. luzuloides, D. dilatata and S. virgaurea, the lowest in R. idaeus and V. myrtillus species. The content of K in bilberry shoots is close to the lower limit of the range (5947-10280 mg kg-1) found by Uhlig and Junttila (2001) in leaves of this species sampled in Norway. The amounts of other macronutrients were substantially lower. The contents of Ca were between 20038663 mg kg-1 (control stand) and 1471-5757 mg kg-1 (damaged stand); the highest in V. myrtillus, the least in fertile shoots of L. luzuloides. Similar Ca values (5992-8749 mg Ca kg-1) were also found by Uhlig and Junttila (2001) in V. myrtillus samples taken from localities in north Norway. The optimum content of calcium in assimilatory plant organs is between 1500 and 6000 mg kg-1 by Maňkovská (1996). The content of magnesium ranged between 1764-3815 mg kg-1 (control stand) and 1638-3726 mg kg-1 (damaged stand). The most of Mg was found in D. dilatata, the least in V. myrtilluss. The Mg values in bilberry samples are close to the lower limit of the range 1466-2567 mg kg-1 found in leaves of this species by Uhlig and Junttila (2001). They are out of optimum range 600-1500 mg kg-1 reported by Stefan et al. (1997). The herbs sampled in the control spruce stand contained 1620-2640 mg S kg-1, these sampled in the damaged spruce stand 1160-3260 mg S kg-1. The highest quantity of S was found in D. dilatata. The least abundant macronutrient in herb species was phosphorus. The content of this element reached 726-2066 mg P kg-1 in case of control stand, and 550-2078 mg P kg-1 in case of damaged stand. The highest quantity of P was found in R. idaeus and D. dilatata species. The differences between mean content of nutrients found in herb species in the two spruce stands were not statistically significant (Table 2). Conclusions The investigations carried out in two spruce stands situated in the region Middle Spiš, locality Hliníky showed that the nutrient state of soils and main herb species was not very favourable either in the control or the damaged spruce stand. The content of some nutrients (N, K) was relatively height the other values (Ca, Mg, P, S) were low. The</p><p id="Pg648">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1322 mean content of macronutrients found in herb shoots sampled on both plots decreased in the following order: N &gt; K &gt; Ca &gt; Mg &gt; S &gt; P.

The main grouping factor was the index of plant water demand. Our study presents the results of the vegetation and chromium accumulation examinations performed in 1998 and 2007 in the units of a former secondary chromium contaminated sedimentation pond system of a Hungarian leather factory near town Kunszentmárton. The Cr concentration in the sediment samples was between 70-23,722 mgkg -1 ; the mean value was 5,893 mgkg -1 . The highest Cr concentratinon was 827 mgkg -1 in the stem of Oenanthe aquatica, and the lowest value was 6 mgkg -1 in the case of Senecio jacobea. The results of statistical analysis verified significantly the highest Cr accumulation capacity of wetland palnts. Keywords: heavy metal, chromium accumulation, wetland plants Introduction Heavy metals are released into aquatic and soil environments largely from various anthropogenic activities and pose a serious threat to plants, animals and even human beings because of their bioaccumulation, nonbiodegradable properties and toxicity even at low concentrations (Rabnecz et al., 2007). Recognition of the ecological and human health hazards of the metals has led to development of several technologies for remediation. Phytoremediation, the use of plant species to clean up soil and water, is gaining a lot of importance in recent times since it is a cost effective, promising and environmentally friendly technology (Bíró et al., 2007). Vascular plants developed strategies to obtain essential metal micronutrients from soils of varying compositions but they use a variety of mechanisms to assimilate metals while preventing toxicity, which involve the regulation of transport, chelation, and sequestration (Bíró and Takács, 2007). The success of any phytoremediation technique depends upon the identification of suitable plant species that accumulate heavy metals and produce large amount of biomass using established crop production and management practices. In many areas of the world the upper soil layer is contaminated with chromium by polluted discharges originated form leather and electroplating factories.The aim of this work was to screen several plant species for chromium accumulation by measuring the metal uptake capacity relation with ecophysiological functional types of plants. The main grouping factor was the index of plant water demand. Our study presents the results of the vegetation and chromium accumulation examinations performed in 1998 and 2007 in the units of a former secondary chromium contaminated sedimentation pond system of a Hungarian leather factory near town Kunszentmárton. Materials and methods The site of our investigation consists of three straight-line-connected sludge-settling pounds. The area of the investigated ponds is 1000m2. The soil sampling was performed</p><p id="Pg650">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1324 in accordance with the Austrian soil sampling procedure (Aichberger and Bäck, 2001). The sampling of vegetation was performed on four occasions (plant samples were collected on 18 March, 19 June, 14 August, and 16 October in each year). A random design was chosen to obtain a representative sample. From the spring sampling on, floristic measurements were made in order to identify the plant species existing in the pond units. From the sampling sites the whole plants and sediment from beneath the plants were collected for chemical analyses. The sampling depth was 0-20cm in the sediment. Sediment and plant samples were dried in a drying-oven at 105C. To determine the concentration of available or exchangeable Cr fractions in plants, sediment samples were extracted with Lakanen-Erviö solution. The elemental composition of the soil and the plant samples was determined by inductively coupled argon plasma emission spectrometry. We ranked the plants according to the index of relative groundwater or soil moisture (WB 1-10) (Borhidi, 1995). Results and discussion Analysis of the sediment The total concentration of Cr measured in the sedimentation pond-system of the leather factory far exceeds the concentrations in the control area, since the application of this element in the technology of leather making is of great importance. The Cr concentration in the sediment samples was between 70-23,722 mgkg-1; the mean value was 5,893 mgkg-1. The Cr-fraction available for plants was between 157 and 233 mgkg-1. Our results show that in the sediment of the settling ponds the Cr can be found mainly in the form of Cr(OH)3 and (CrxFe1-x)(OH)3 because of redox potential, pH values and high concentration of Fe and Ca in the sediment. Vegetation studies We identified 46 plant species in the pond system. Most of those plants belonged to the families Compositae and Graminae. The dominant plants were: Phragmites australis, Bolboschoenus maritimus, Echinochloa crus-galli, Typha angustifolia, Atriplex hastate, Aster sedifolius and Populus alba. Besides these dominant species mostly weeds with great water-demand were present. Plants of fresh soils and plants of frequently flooded soils were present in highest numbers in the area. Cr accumulation in plants We examined the Cr concentration in the aerial parts of different 30 plant species (Table 1.). The highest Cr concentratinon was 827 mgkg-1 in the stem of Oenanthe aquatica, and the lowest value was 6 mgkg-1 in the case of Senecio jacobea. The mean Cr concentration in the aerial parts of the examined plant species was 163 mgkg-1 (all the results of Cr concentration of tissues of different organs in the examined 30 plant species can be found in Keresztúri et al., 2006).</p><p id="Pg651">VII.

Cereal Research Communications 1326 Conclusions Through their action as “nutrient pumps”, active uptake of elements into plant tissue may promote immobilization in plant tissues. These plants can oxidize the sediments in the root zone through the movement of oxygen downwards through aerenchyma tissue, and this oxidation can remobilise the metal contaminants, thus increasing the otherwise low availability of metals in sediment. Metal remobilisation may also result from acidification of the rhizosphere by plant exudates. By oxidizing the soil in the immediate vicinity of the rhizosphere, plants can alter the distribution of metals in sediments. Consequently, those are the most suitable species that can be applied in phytoremediation of areas contaminated with Cr. Reference Aichberger, K. - Bäck, J. : 2001.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1327 INFLUENCE OF DIFFERENT SOIL TYPES AND RAINFALL CONDITIONS ON OIL CONTENT IN SUNFLOWER Anto MIJIĆ 1 – Miroslav KRIZMANIĆ 1 – Ivica LIOVIĆ 1 – Sonja MARIĆ2 – Tomislav DUVNJAK 1 1 The Agricultural Institute Osijek, Južno predgrađe 17, HR- 31000 Osijek, Croatia, anto.mijic@poljinos.hr 2 Faculty of Agriculture, University of Josip Juraj Strossmayer, Trg Sv. Trojstva 3, HR-31000 Osijek, Croatia Abstract: Seed oil content in sunflower is very important trait for seed production and breeding. Aim of this research was to estimate stability of oil content of seven single cross and seven three-way cross hybrids in different environments. The trials were set up on the three locations (Osijek- Eastern Slavonia County, Karanac- Baranja County and Feričanci- Western Slavonia County) during 2002 and 2003 growing seasons. Estimation of stability was conducted by regression coefficient and AMMI model. Oil content was lower in conditions of rainfall deficit and high temperatures in flowering time and during seed maturity process. Threeway cross hybrids had slightly higher oil content. According to regression coefficient, most of the hybrids were stable. According to AMMI model, the most stable hybrids were experimental hybrids OS-H-103 S, OSH-219 S, OS-H-259 S, OS-H-59 T and OS-H-189 T. Hybrid Apolon had the highest oil content and it was adapted to high yielding environments. Hybrid Fakir was according to, both regression coefficient and AMMI model, adapted to low yielding environments. Keywords: sunflower, hybrid, oil content, stability, regression coefficient, AMMI Introduction Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) is one of the most important oil crop in the world production and the area under the sunflower is in constant increase (Szabo, 2006). Same trend is in Europe where area under the sunflower was increased in the period 19952005 for 2.3 million ha (FAOSTAT Database, 2005). Major sunflower producers in Europe are: Russia, Ukraine, Romania, France, Bulgaria, Spain, Hungary and Moldova. Breeding programs of sunflower are mainly directed towards selection of cultivars with high seed yield and oil content. Seed oil content is of a major consideration in sunflower breeding because it is an important component of oil yield. This is a complex trait determined by the genotype and the environmental conditions (Leon et al., 2003). The numerous different hybrids react differently to the different factors (Liović et al., 2006; Borbelyne and Lesznyak, 2006; Szabo and Pepo, 2007; Mijić et al., 2007). Therefore, beside the oil content of plant, researchers are interested in its expression in different environments. With aim of establishing influence of different soil types and rainfall regimes on oil content, in the paper is presented stability analysis of its trait at six environments. Materials and methods The investigated material included seven single cross hybrids (SC) (1-7) and seven three-way cross hybrids (TWC) (8-14) developed by crossing elite inbreeds at the Agricultural Institute Osijek, Croatia. The trials were arranged according to a randomly complete block design (RCBD) in three replications on the three locations during 2002 and 2003 growing seasons. The trials at locations Osijek (Eastern Slavonia County) and Karanac (Baranja County) were set up on eutric cambisol (Osijek 6.3 and Karanac 7.1 pH in KCl), but at location Feričanci (Western Slavonia County) on pseudogley (4.0 pH</p><p id="Pg654">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1328 in KCl). The average temperature and rainfall during 2002 growing season were favorable for sunflower growing, unlike 2003 growing season where lack of rain was noted during vegetation at all locations. Stability estimation was performed using regression coefficient bi (Eberhart and Russell, 1966) and additive main effects and multiplicative interaction analysis (AMMI) model. Values of bi between 0.7-1.3 indicate stable, widely adaptable genotypes while values higher than 1.3 indicate genotypes adapted to high yielding environments. Values below 0.7 indicate genotypes adapted to low yielding environments (Lin and Binns, 1985). AMMI model was interpreted according to Gauch and Zobel (1996) and it identifies high yielding and widely adapted genotypes and specificity of the environments and genotypes. Results and discussion Combined analysis of variance (ANOVA) of oil content showed statistically significant differences between environments, genotypes and interaction genotype x environment (Table 1). That was the basis for stability analysis. Table 1 Combined ANOVA of oil content for all locations and growing seasons Source of variation Degrees of Freedom Variance Envirnment (E) 5 120.256** Genotype (G) 13 69.089** GE 65 1.992** Error 166 1.112 ** F test significant at P0.01 level Oil content in the second year of research (Table 2) was lower than in the first year, in average for 4.31% in Osijek, 2.72% in Karanac and 0.21% in Feričanci. That can be a consequence of the lack of water in soil and low air humidity. Another reason can be high temperatures, above 250C during flowering, filling and maturity of seeds. As a rule, high temperatures in these periods are causing lower oil content and oil yield. Filling period was shorter and it had impact on lower oil yield. Same results about the influence of agroecological factors on oil content were reported by Salera (1992), Seiler (1997), Szabo and Pepo (2007).

In the second year and unfavorable conditions locations Osijek (O3) and Karanac (K3) had lower oil content, but they were more stable than Feričanci (F3). IPCA 1 scores closer to zero indicate more stable hybrids across their testing environments.

Investigation includes 7 single cross and 7 three-way cross experimental and recognized sunflower hybrids of The Agricultural institute Osijek during two growing seasons. Single cross hybrids had a slightly higher plant height values in relation to three-way cross hybrids. The lowest plant height value in both years of investigation is obtained on location Feričanci, and the highest in Osijek. In the second year of investigation, in lack of precipitations, plants were lower 37 cm in average.

Keywords: sunflower, hybrid, plant height, stability, AMMI Introduction Breeding of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) on scientific basis have tradition over 100 years which aimed on more than 30 traits. However, number of breeding traits depends on market demands and agro-ecological conditions in specific area (soil type, soil fertility, amount and precipitation regime, soil and air temperatures, level of management, disease presence, ect.). Grain yield and its stability are the most interesting traits for breeders as well as producers (Liović et al., 2006, Goksoy and Turan, 2007, Mijić et al., 2007). However, other traits which are directly and indirectly connected with grain yield are also breeded. In many breeding programs one of these traits is plant height (Bognar et. al., 2007). Sunflower hybrids with high and strong stem are not suitable for high fertility areas, moisture and good management because they developing a ladge green mass, which result in lodgging, lower grain yield and yield quality. In drought conditions are more suitable genotypes which develop lower stem because they need less water for development, better fertilisation, and easier machinery application (Marinković et al., 2003; Krizmanić et al., 2004). Miller and Hammond (1991) emphasize that strong winds in combination with higher soil moisture and intensive precipitation lead to total destruction of crop production, and significant role have lodging as well. The aim of investigation was to analyze sunflower plant height regarding soil type and percipitation regime, as well as the stability of this trait. Materials and methods The material investigated included seven single cross hybrids (SC) and seven three-way cross hybrids (TWC) developed by crossing elite inbreeds at the Agricultural Institute Osijek, Croatia. The trials were arranged according to a randomly complete block design in three replications and three locations during 2002 and 2003 growing seasons. The trials at locations Osijek (45º32' N 18º44' E), and Karanac (45º45' N 18º37' E) were set up on eutric cambisol (Osijek 6.3 and Karanac 7.1 pH in KCl), but at Feričanci (45º31' N 17º58' E) on stagnosoil (4.0 pH in KCl). The average temperature and</p><p id="Pg658">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1332 precipitation during 2002 growing season were favourable for sunflower growing, unlike 2003 growing season, where lack of rain was noted during vegetation at all locations (Table 1). Plant height is measured in full flowering stage (R-5.5, according to Schneiter and Miller, 1981). The combined analysis of variance (ANOVA) and additive main effects and multiplicative interaction analysis (AMMI) model were done using the SAS software 9.1 (2003). The biplot was explain the genotype-environment interaction (GEI) and adaptation of sunflower hybrids to the environments. The AMMI model 1 biplot was used where the IPCA 1 scores were plotted against the mean height plants.

Significance of these interactions enables stability estimation. Average plant height were from 112 cm (Apolon, Feričanci 2003) to 207 cm (Fakir, Osijek 2002). The lowest values of plant height were recorded on Feričanci, no matter on year, which could be interpreted by soil type, low pH values, and low soil nutrient levels which is important characteristic of this soil according to Blamey et al. (1997). Generally, plants in 2003 were 50 cm lower in Osijek, 39 cm in Karanac and 21 cm in Feričanci (Table 2) which could be explained with lack of precipitation. Similar results regarding plant height reduction had Tan et al. (2000) and Goksoy et al. (2004). Different authors define differently optimum sunflower plant height. According to Fick and Miller (1997) sunflower breeders in USA and Europe attempt to create hybrid 1.5 do 2 m height, while according to Marinković et al. (2003) high-oil hybrids should have 1.5 do 1.8 m. The analysis of variance for AMMI model of sunflower height of 14 hybrids tested in 6 environments is given in Table 3. The estimation of variance components indicated that GEI interaction effects were middle (22.7%) relative to genotype main effects, supporting their investigation by analysis of</p><p id="Pg659">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1333 adaptation. The IPCA 1 and IPCA 2 axes explained 48.4% and 25.9% of the total GEI. They were both significant (P&lt;0.01 and P&lt;0.05) and this indicates that the AMMI model is the best fit for this data set. AMMI model was interpreted according to Gauch and Zobel (1996), which identify high-productive and widely adaptable genotypes, as well as the specificity of environments and genotypes. The closer the IPCA1 scores are to zero, the most stable the genotypes across environments. Considering IPCA1 values and average hybrid height (Figure 1) through environments, it is obvious that new hybrids OS-H-253 T, OS-H-101 S and OS-H-219 S have ideal and stable plant height, not variable regarding environment. OS-H-219 S is, beside desirable plant height achieve a satisfactory grain yield as well (data not show).

Abstract: A field experiment was conducted in an integrated apple orchard (Malus domestica Borkh.) established on a lowland chernozem soil in East-Hungary, to investigate if flower analysis could be used to diagnose the nutritional status of the trees. In April 2007, during full bloom, flowers and leaves were collected. Leaves were again collected in August, at the standard sampling time from the same trees. The concentrations of nitrogen, phosporous and potassium were measured in flowers and leaves. Correlation analyses were carried out to establish the relations between nutrient contents in same and different plant parts. The N and P content of leaves was higher than in flowers at full bloom. The opposite was true for K. For all sampling dates, the range of N, P and K contents were wider in leaves than that found in flowers. Significant correlation was found between flower P and leaf P and flower K and leaf K at full bloom. Within flowers, the strongest correlation was found between flower N and P content. Significant, positive correlation was also found between leaf K and P at full bloom. Keywords: floral analysis, fruit nutrition, apple, soil-flower-leaf nutrient interactions Introduction Urgent task of today’s plant nutritionists to adjust plant nutritional aspects to changing conditions of plant growing (Várallyay, 2006, 2007; Nagy , 2001; Dobos, 2005). To achieve adequate plant nutrition it’s essential for growers to diagnose the nutritional status of their crops. At present, it is mainly done by means of plant material (mostly leaf) analysis. Although leaf analysis has spread all over the world and provides useful information about nutritional status it has weakness and some disadvantages. It is true for fruit nutrition especially. The main limitation of leaf analysis is that the sampling date recommended for fruit trees is late in the growing season, generally very close to harvest (Sanz et al., 1995; Sanz and Montañés, 1995; Belkhodja et al., 1998). According the late sampling date there is no possibility to apply supplementing fertilization during the actual growing cycle. Therefore is necessary to apply an earlier diagnosis tool to solve nutritional disorders. Floral analysis could permit an early diagnosis or to prognose an abnormal nutritive situation, before symptoms are perceivable (Montañés Millán et al., 1997). Although floral analysis could be considered as an alternative versus leaf analysis to diagnose the nutritional status of fruit trees there is no information about its Hungarian application. In this paper, the possibility of carrying out an earlier nutritional diagnosis of eight apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) cultivars, based on floral analysis is discussed and compared to the results of traditional leaf analysis.</p><p id="Pg662">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1336 Materials and methods Our investigations were carried out in a apple orchard (Malus domestica Borkh.) of TEDEJ Rt., Hajdúnánás-Tedej, in Eastern Hungary. The orchard was set up on lowland chernozem soil. It was established in the autumn of 1999, using grafted on MM106 rootstocks at a spacing of 3.8 x 1.1 m. The orchard has been treated according to the Integrated Fruit Production guidelines. The orchard was irrigated. Soil samples were taken from three layers (0-20 cm; 20-40 cm and 40-60 cm) of each plot, at the middle of the section by using manual soil sampling equipment. For the characterisation of the soil the most important soil parameters were determined. Sampling was performed at the beginning of the vegetation period on April, in 2007. For plant analysis the following apple cultivars were selected: ‘Idared’; ‘Topaz’; ’Gála Must’; ’Summerred’; ’Jonagold’; ’Braeburn’; ’Golden Reinders’; ’Mutsu’. Flower samples were collected at full bloom on 22 April 2007. Leaf samples were collected at the same time and later, on 1 August 2007, from 50 trees according to Nagy (2006). Flowers were collected according to Sanz and Montañés, 1995. Laboratory examination of soil and plant samples was carried out described by Nagy (2006).

Hungary, e-mail: lakgyu@delfin.klte.hu Abstract: Phytoremediation, i.e. recovering the health of soils or sediments contaminated with heavy metals by using green vegetation has today been a stimulating challenge for research and solutions in environmental protection all over the world. Among the phytoremediation processes, it is the in-situ inactivation technique that has special significance, since it reduces the dangers caused by the potential toxic impacts of heavy metals. Due to the vegetation providing green surfaces, the phytoremediation processes are environmentally friendly and cost-effective (10-12% percent of traditional methods). This paper presents the results of the floristical and vegetation examinations performed in the units of a former secondary sedimentation pond system in Hungary. The outcome of analyses on the chromium content of the plants will also be discussed. Keywords: phytoremediation, sediment, floristical examination, chromium accumulation Introduction The application of the phytoremediation techniques in Hungary is currently in the post R+D phase, and in Europe, in the framework of COST, it forms the theme of a research task (Bíró, 2007). In the future, it will certainly have outstanding importance. It can be safely claimed that plants play an essential role in the absorption of the toxic, mobile, easily admitted heavy metals, eliminating the soil degradation processes (Várallyay, 2006). The outcome of the phytotechnical researches having been launched all over the world is very hopeful (Farmer et al. 2006). Green covers are a true alternative solution, the intensive form of which being the use of crops while the extensive one in former wastewater settling pond systems the utilization of the natural vegetation. The efficiency of phytotechnical approaches can be intensified by microbiological, chemical and physical processes, either by increasing the bioavailability or reducing the toxic effects of heavy metals (Bíró, 2007). The most novel and modern form of phytoremediation processes is the so-called induced phytoextraction, in the course of which the heavy metal uptake is enhanced by the addition of chelates (Robinson et al., 1999). For denoting the traditional procedure, the term continuous phytoextraction is used, which means that the ionic release of the bound metals, as well as the uptake and storage of the metal ions by the roots, and their transport take place in the stem and the leaves (Weis and Weis, 2004). The most widely touted advantage of phytoremediation is its cost; phytoremediation is generally believed to entail capital and operating costs far lower than those of many competing technologies. In addition to cost, phytoremediation offers a number of performance-based advantages. It can be a permanent treatment solution and as an in situ method it holds, several advantages, including the fast that remediation can take place without unduly disturbing the site. Because phytoremediation can generally remediate the fraction of the contamination that is most bioavailable, it is compatible with risk-based remediation approaches that allow the un-leachable fraction to remain in the soil or sediment. Finally, remadiating a hazardous waste site with plants is believed to be more aesthetically pleasing and possibly more acceptable to the public than other remadiation methods (Lakatos et al., 1999; Glass, 2000).</p><p id="Pg666">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1340 If cost is the greatest potential advantage of phytoremediation, time is the greatest disadvantage. The use of plants, like all biological methods, does not allow 100% removal or reduction of contaminants, because reaction rates decrease as concentrations of contaminant decrease. In addition, high levels of heavy-metal contaminants may be toxic to plants. Finally, soil and sediment phytoremediation is generally believed to be limited in applicability or surface soils, and would be limited by the solubility of the contaminant (Glass, 2000). This paper presents the results of the floristical and vegetation examinations performed in the units of a former secondary sedimentation pond system in Hungary. The outcome of analyses on the chromium content of the plants will also be discussed. Beside the chemical analyses, observations on the plants, the eco-physiological and stressbiological factors were also made and characterization of the ecological state of plant stands adapted to heavy metal load. The phytoremediation studies were performed in the chromium-rich sediment of Pannónia Co., a leather factory in Kunszentmárton (Hungary). Materials and methods The sampling sites were selected from dried units of the chromium-contaminated sedimentation pond system. In accordance with the vegetation period, sampling has been performing in summer from 1998 and floristical measurements were made in order to identify the plant species existing in the pond units. The biomass of the common reed (Phragmites australis), cattail (Typha angustifolia), sea club-rush (Bolboschoenus maritimus) were always measured from the above ground (stem) and underground (roots) sampling from a pre-defined sediment volume. From the sampling sites, sediment samples were also collected for further chemical and eco-toxicological analyses. For further observations, leaf and rhizome fractions were taken from the in-situ collected common reed, cattail, sea club-rush and aster samples, they were frozen into liquid nitrogen, and later the examinations were accomplished in laboratory. The heavy metal concentrations were performed with ICP-AES method. The S/R (shoot to root weight) ratio was calculated. Ecophysiological measurements (photosynthetic pigment composition and peroxidase activity) were carried out to characterize the vitality of dominant species.. Results and discussion According to the observations, the units of the pond system can be floristically characterized by a relative diversity of species (42 species). The common reed, sea clubrush, bulrush, orach (Atriplex ssp) and aster (Aster punctatus) can be considered as being existent in large masses, and the other weeds also need to be mentioned. The green plant covering varies from unit to unit, ranges between 85 and 100%, however, regarding the previous years there occurs an advantageous tendency of increasing green covering. The total chromium results of the sediment fall into the ten-thousand (12.000 – 43.000 ppm) range. This extremely high degree of the chromium concentration multiplies the time demand of the phytoremediation processes. Fortunately, it does not endanger the vegetation with lethal phytotoxicity, and the green plant covering is significant.</p><p id="Pg667">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1341 S/R ratios suggest that plants occurring in the study area tolerate even these extremely high Cr levels and form a green carpet over the sediment, decreasing erosion and preventing the transport of dust by wind, making another important aspect of the multifaceted role of vegetation. Considering the results of the chromium analyses, none of the plants composing the natural flora - in the present case of natural, extensive, continuous phytoextraction - can be described as hyperaccumulator plant species (Brooks et al., 1977).

However, results of investigations in phytotechnical operations are promising, and according to our knowledge processes can be intensified by applying induced phytoextraction procedures. Only by expedient investigations can significant reduction of contamination levels, especially of extremely high Cr concentrations such as in our case; by the time it is achieved beneficial processes associated with the presence of vegetation are preferred to other solutions being harmful to the environment (sensu stricto and lato as well) and very expensive. The results of the eco-physiological examinations on the plants indicate that the plants living in the high-chrome sediment have a special pigment composition that provides them with an effective mode of defense against the potentially appearing damages in the photosynthetic apparatus due to the heavy metal loading. No signs of pigment degradation and/or inhibition of pigment synthesis can be shown in any species. Conclusions Floristically, units of the pond system are characterized by a relative richness of species (42 species). Dominants are common reed (Phragmites australis), sea clubrush (Bolboschoenus maritimus), cattail (Typha angustifolia) and aster (Aster punctatus), but weeds are also considerable. Vegetation cover of the pond units is different varying between 85 and 100 %, though the trend for increase of the green carpet is advantageous. Results of the elemental analysis for heavy metals revealed that none of the plants constituting the natural vegetation can be treated as hyperaccumulator plant (Brooks et</p><p id="Pg668">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1342 al., 1977; Baker and Brooks, 1989). Nevertheless, classification of plants in question according to their "accumulating capacity" was both practical and necessary. For the proper qualification of leather industrial wastewater sediments a new category had to be introduced: sediments with extremely high (exceeding top levels in the literature) chromium concentration (Salt et al., 1995). Plants play a prominent role in the absorption of toxic, easily mobilized and available Cr(VI) and its enzymatic reduction to Cr(III). A green cover and the detoxification process of Cr(VI) by plants is suggested to be more important than the present extensive phytoextraction procedure. Based on our outline of the literature (Robinson et al., 1999), intensification of the processes is possible by applying the induced phytoextraction techniques. Results of ecophysiological studies on the plants indicate a specific pigment composition that provides an effective protection against potential damage by metal loads to the photosynthetic apparatus. Results of the culture pot experiment suggest that no signs of reduction in assimilation capacity of test plants grown in leather industrial sediments of extremely high chromium levels can be observed or measured.

A. Hlinku 2, 949 76 Nitra, Slovak Republic Abstract: The field trial was conducted over the period 2000-2005 at the RIPP in Piešťany in Western Slovakia. The purpose of the study was to investigate yield and yield components of spring barley undersown with red clover growing in ecological and low input systems. In the six year crop rotation pattern, incorporation of straw, crop residues, catch crops for green manure and farmyard manure was used. The effects of farming systems were assessed by evaluating the yield and yield components of spring barley. Grain yields, calculated from the mean values achieved in the six year study period, were significantly differed between ecological (4.8 t ha -1 ) and low input (5.02 t ha -1 ) systems. The influence of the cropping systems on grain yield of spring barley, number of kernels per spike, thousand of kernels weight and spike length was remarkable with the exception of straw yield, number of spikes per m -2 and weight of kernels per spike. Keywords: crop rotation, cropping system, spring cereal, yield, yield components Introduction The ecological, and low input farming systems are considered to be an alternative to conventional farming systems, to enhance agricultural sustainability and environmental quality (Poudel et al., 2002). The sustainability of ecological and low input systems depends on the development of effective management practicies in suitable growing conditions (Hanáčková 2000; Kovacevic et al., 2006; Lalic et al., 2007). Development of environmentally and economically sound agricultural production systems of cereals is an important aim in agricultural research (Hoffmann et al., 2007; Hornok et al., 2007; Takács – György 2007). Grain yield of barley can be expressed as a function of spikes per square meter, kernels per spike, and kernel weight, which together referred to as yield components (Sinebo 2002; Maich et al., 2006). Variation in yield components resulting from environmental, and management factors, affects variation in crop yield (Kozak and Mądry 2006). The purpose of this study was to investigate yield and yield components of spring barley growing in ecological and low input systems. This paper describes the results of the spring barley phase of the crop rotation for the 6 year period from 2000 to 2005. Materials and methods The field trial was carried out at the experimental station of the RIPP Piešťany in Western Slovakia (E 17°75’, N 48°58’). The location has a continental climate with an average annual temperature of 9.2°C (15.5°C during the growing season) and an average annual precipitation of 593 mm (358 mm during the growing season). The main</p><p id="Pg670">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1344 soil type is a Luvi-Haplic Chernozem with loamy to clay-loamy texture with a pH of 6.5-7.2 and a medium humus content of 1.8-2.0 %. The experimental design was a splitplot design with four replicates of a six-course crop rotation. Each crop of the rotation was grown each year in both ecological and low input system. The crop was designated to be the main plot factor and the cropping system was designated to be the subplot factor. The subplots were 3 m by 20 m in size. A six-crop rotation pattern was used as follows: (1) common pea, (2) winter wheat and catch crops, (3) early potato and catch crops, (4) spring barley undersown with red clover, (5) first year red clover, and (6) winter wheat and catch crops. In ecological system (ES), the cultural practices were performed in accordance with EC Regulation No 2092/91 and the national Act 415/2002 dealing with ecological farming. A top-dressing of 50 l ha-1 Vermisol was applied to the spring barley after 3-4 weeks of the emergence. Two weeks after harvest straw and crops residues were ploughed in by tillage and the catch crops phacelia and mustard were sown. The farmyard manure, composted well and inverted into the soil was applied under potato (30 t ha-1) and winter wheat (15 t ha-1). The low input system uses the same production practices as ecological farming but allows for the limited use of pesticides and mineral fertilization inputs. Dose of 30 kg N ha-1 and P, K mineral fertilizers calculated according to input-output balance were applied. At maturity, the total subplot area from each replication was harvested for measuring of the grain and straw yield and the thousand of kernels weight (TKW). In addition, 10 spikes from each replication were sampled to determine the kernels per spike, weight of the kernel per spike and the spike length. Number of the spikes per m2 was counting within the frames 0.5 m by 1 m from each replication. The data were statistically evaluated by an analysis of variance using the statgraphics plus version 5.0 and the F-test (Fisher`s protected LSD test). Results and discussion Yield of spring barley and all evaluated parameters of spring barley were significantly influenced by the year condition (Table 1). The influence of the cropping systems (LIS and ES) on grain yield of spring barley, number of kernels per spike, TKW and spike length was statistically significant with the exception of the straw yield, number of spikes per m-2 that occurred before the harvest and weight of kernels per spike.

Number of spikes per square meter, assessed as an important cereal grain yield component (Paunovic et al. 2007) was similar in our trials without significant influence oon the evaluated cropping systems. Partitioning of the variance showed (Table 2) that conditions prevailing during a specific year was the most important factor in determining grain yield of spring barley (62.43%) and other assessed traits from 27.79% (number of spikes per m-2) to 83.21% (kernels per spike) and it was followed by the type of the system.

For example topdressing of N fertilizers at the booting stage is commonly recommended for barley production, as it may increase kernels per spike (Wang et al. 2007). Kernels per spike and TKW can compensate somewhat for deficient spike population (Metho et al. 1997).

Grain yields averages (Table 3), calculated from the mean values achieved in the six year study period, were significantly differed between ecological (4.8 t ha-1) and low input (5.02 t ha-1) systems. This crop yield average is comparable with yield of spring barley growing in ES in the similar agro climatic condition stated by Klimeková (2007). Conclusions Assessment of variability of grain yield and yield components of the spring barley can partially be enlightined the capability of the crop rotation patterns and the sustainable farming systems. The results of the study may support the adoption of an less intensive farming practices that offer potential benefits for agricultural landscapes in Slovakia.

The trial involved five sowing density (30, 50, 70, 90 and 110 germinated seeds m -2 ) and crop treatment with fungicides (metconazole 60 g l -1 , preparation "Caramba") as well as no treatment. The hybrid Elvis served as trial crop. Yield and yield components were significantly influenced by the year and sowing density. In the three-year average, the significantly highest yields of seed (4.70 t ha -1 ) and oil (1.85 t ha -1 ) were achieved at the sowing density of 70 germinated seeds m -2 , i.e., plant density at harvest of 35 plants m -2 . Sowing density increase above 50 germinated seeds m -2 caused a significant decrease in the number of fertile branches per plant and the number of siliques per plant whereas the 1000 seed weight remained stable at all sowing densities. Fungicide application had no significant effect on rapeseed yield and yield components. Keywords: rapeseed, hybrid, sowing density, fungicide, yield, yield components Introduction Rapeseed hybrids are now grown in many Western and Central European countries. The hybrid effect was expected to render 20% higher seed yields. However, the results of Pinochet and Bertrand (2000) have shown that hybrid yields are close to those of the best pure-line varities. In the research done by Vamerali et al. (2000), Pospišil et al. (2005), seed yields of hybrids were by 15% and 13.6%, respectively, higher compared to varieties in favourable growing conditions. Many researchers maintain that rapeseed production technology should be adapted to new types of cultivars, i.e., hybrids. Although sowing density is a major technological problem of field crop production, investigated in many field crops (Sarvari et al. 2007, Josipović et al. 2007, Szabo and Pepo 2007, Paunovic et al. 2007), this problem has not been scientifically investigated in the case of rapeseed hybrids in this part of Central Europe. Recent investigations recommend for spring rapeseed grown under weedless conditions a target density of 2030 plants m-2 (McWilliam et al. 1995) or 25-30 plants m-2 (HGCA, 2000). Materials and methods Research was done in micro-trials set up at the experimental facility of the Faculty of Agriculture in Zagreb in the period 2005-2007. The trial involved five sowing densities (30, 50, 70, 90 and 110 germinated seeds m-2) and crop treatment with fungicides (metconazole 60 g l-1, preparation "Caramba") as well as no treatment (control). Trials were laid out according to the randomized block scheme with five replications. The main plot area was 6.6 m2. The hybrid cultivar Elvis served as trial crop. Rapeseed was sown in the optimal period (1-6 Sept.); plant spacing of 20 cm was applied and seed rates were 1.78; 2.97; 4.16; 5.35 and 6.53 kg ha-1 with the average 1000 seed weight of 5.61 g. Fungicide "Caramba" was applied in the autumn at a rate of 0.75 l ha-1 (at the 6-</p><p id="Pg674">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1348 leaf stage, BBCH 16-18) and in the spring at a rate of 1.25 l ha-1 (prior to flowering, BBCH 39-55). Intensive agrotechnical practices and weed and pest control appropriate for rapeseed hybrids were applied in the trial. Morphological analyses, as well as yield components analyses, were made on an average sample of 50 plants. Seed yield was expressed at 7% moisture level and 2% impurities. Seed oil content (on an average sample of five replicates) was determined in the n-hexane extract (ISO 659:1998). Seed oil content and oil yield were expressed as percent of dry matter. Trial results were statistically processed by the analysis of variance (Mstat-C program, 1990). Results and discussion Results of the analysis of variance showed that seed and oil yields, morphological traits studied (height to the first fertile branch, number of fertile branches per plant) and yield components (number of siliques per plant) were strongly influenced by the year and sowing density (Table 1). The 1000 seed weight was significantly affected only by the trial year. Interaction of the studied factors had no significant effect on any investigated trait. Table 1.

If sowing density was further increased, seed and oil yields remained at the same level or were significantly reduced. Fungicide application had no significant effect on seed and oil yields. Increase of sowing density from 30 to 70 germinated seeds m-2 led to a significant increase in height to the first fertile branch, and decrease in the number of fertile branches per plant (Table 3). It can be seen from the analysis of yield components that the number of siliques per plant, as the most important yield component, decreases significantly with sowing density above 50 germinated seeds m-2 (Table 4). The 1000 seed weight, as the second most important yield component, remains stable at all sowing densities. Similar results were obtained by Leah et al. 1999, Angadi et al. 2003. Thus, it is evident that rapeseed hybrids sown at a density of 30 to 50 germinated seeds m-2 can efficiently compensate for lower plant densities (by a larger number of lateral branches per plant and a larger number of siliques per plant). Differences between germinated seeds sown</p><p id="Pg675">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1349 and the number of plants at harvest are consequences of the weather conditions during emergence and of rapeseed winter survival. The number of seeds sown had no significant effect on field germination and emergence. Emergence was much more strongly affected by weather conditions during sowing. Thus, emergence in the inclement year 2004/05 ranged from 51.3 to 55.8%, and in the more favourable 2006/07 from 64.5% to 69.8%. This resulted in plant densities at the onset of winter from 15 plants m-2 (30 germinated seeds m-2 at sowing) to 63 plants m-2 (110 germinated seeds m-2) in 2004/05. In 2006/07, these plant densities ranged from 23 to 78 plants m-2. Table 2.

Cereal Research Communications 1350 achieved plant density of 78 plants m-2 (2006/07), winter survival of 62.4% was recorded and the number of plants at harvest varied from 19 to 37 plants m-2. Conclusions Results of the three-year investigations of the effects of sowing density (30-110 germinated seeds m-2) and fungicide application (metconazole) on rapeseed hybrids point to the following conclusions: In the three-year average, rapeseed seed and oil yields grew significantly with increasing sowing density up to 70 germinated seeds m-2, i.e., the average plant density at harvest of 35 plants m-2. Increase of sowing density above 50 germinated seeds m-2 led to a significant increase in height to the first fertile branch and to reduced number of fertile branches and the number of siliques per plant. Application of the fungicide metconazole had no significant influence on studied traits because the weather conditions were not favourable for the development of rapeseed diseases. For the agroecological conditions of north-western Croatia, sowing density of 70 germinated seeds m-2, resulting in a plant density at harvest of 29 to 48 plants m-2, is recommended for rapeseed hybrids.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1351 EFFICIENCY OF EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS FOR SOME QUANTITATIVE TRAITS IN MAIZE Zvonimir ZDUNIĆ – Domagoj ŠIMIĆ – Antun JAMBROVIĆ – Josip BRKIĆ – Tatjana LEDENČAN Department of Maize Breeding and Genetics, Agricultural Institute Osijek, Juzno predgradje 17, HR-31103 Osijek, e-mail: zvonimir.zdunic@poljinos.hr Abstract: The objective of the investigation was estimation and comparison of relative efficiency of the simple lattice experimental design vs. the randomized complete block design for grain yield, grain moisture content and starch content in dry matter of grain in maize. The trials were set up in Osijek and Karanac during two growing seasons. An appropriate plant-soil interrelation revealed gain in experimental precision of the simple lattice design for all investigated traits at both locations and growing seasons, especially for grain yield and Osijek location. The estimated results approve the efforts of researchers to involve, adjust and explore such quantitative traits into the simple lattice design more frequently instead of the randomized complete block design. This is all in purpose to achieve the highest possible estimation accuracy for targeted traits. Keywords: relative efficiency, quantitative traits, simple lattice design, randomized complete block design Introduction Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) is probably the most widespread experimental design in field testing of agricultural crops. Because of its simplicity and convenience many authors use it nowadays in their investigations of various species, such as maize, wheat, barley, sunflower, soybean, potato, etc. (Hoffman et al., 2007, Drezner et al., 2006, Lalić et al., 2007, Mijić et al., 2007, Jovanović et al., 2007, Spitko et al., 2006, Ábrahám et al., 2006, Sudarić et al., 2006). It is also widely used in official testing procedures for assessment of crop performances before registration (VCU test) as well as during preliminary test in breeding stations worldwide. However, certain limitations appear with respect to its efficiency when comparing performances of either a large entry number or variable entries, or when effect of soil heterogeneity enables reaching reliable inferences. In such cases, an application of incomplete block design such as lattice design (LD) can be helpful (Cochran and Cox, 1957). Lattice design is the most commonly used incomplete block design in agricultural research (Gomez and Gomez, 1984). Since breeding progress is usually long-term and takes slow steps, an accurate estimation of targeted quantitative traits in field experiments is crucial. The objective of this study was to compare relative efficiency (ER) of incomplete block design (simple lattice design, LD) relative to the complete block design (randomized complete block design, RCBD) for estimation of grain yield, grain moisture content, and starch content in dry matter of grain. Lacking of this type of investigation was an additional motive for carrying out this study. Materials and methods Two year investigation was carried out at Osijek and Karanac locations (eastern Croatia) which have different soil properties but similar climatic conditions because of their close allocation. In Osijek, there is an eutric cambisol (FAO, 1988) of great homogenity. Unlike Osijek, Karanac soil belongs to heterogeneous pseudogley. For comparison of the relative efficiency, thirteen corresponding single crosses were taken</p><p id="Pg678">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1352 into analysis. As described by Zdunić (2001), both simple and combined analyses of variance were calculated for every trait, growing season and location. Lattice - adjusted mean entries were used for those analyses as well as effective error mean squares. Estimation of the relative efficiency (ER) of the simple lattice design relative to the randomized complete block design was calculated according to formula given by Gomez and Gomez (1984): ER = 100×[Block(adjusted) SS + Intrablock error SS] / k(k 2 – 1) × (Effective error MS) k = block size Grain moisture content was determined from the sample taken from every entry and block using grain moisture analyzer (Dickey – john GAC 2000) and starch content in dry matter of grain by Ewers polarimetric method (Zdunić, 2001). Results and discussion In general, the estimated relative efficiency (ER) of the simple lattice design compared to the randomized block design was higher, or at least equal, for all investigated traits at both locations and growing seasons. For all the traits investigated, higher estimations of ER were obtained at Osijek location compared to Karanac in 1999 (Table 1). ER estimation for grain yield was the highest among investigated traits in Osijek, unlike Karanac where all ER estimations were quite similar. As presented in Table 1, more distinct results for all the traits were obtained at Osijek location compared to Karanac in 1999. The simple lattice design was 44.1% more efficient than randomized complete block design for grain yield in Osijek, but at the same time it was only 0.9% more precise in Karanac. For grain moisture content the estimated relative efficiency was rapidly lower than for grain yield. The obtained results varied from 6.2% in Osijek to only 1.3% in Karanac. Regarding starch content in dry matter of grain the estimated relative efficiency reached 13.2% in Osijek and only 0.4% in Karanac. Since estimated relative efficiency for all investigated traits was lower at Karanac in 1999 growing season (Table 1). This is probably due to increased soil heterogeneity (different soil type) relative to Osijek. Furthermore, the estimation of effective error MS was also lowest for grain yield, followed by grain moisture content and starch content in grain dry matter, as expected.

The estimated ER of the simple lattice design was also the highest for grain yield at both locations, 34.8% in Osijek and 10.3% in Karanac (Table 2). The ER estimation for grain moisture content in Osijek was almost at the same level as if it had been investigated under randomized complete block design (ER=0.2%). For the same trait the application of the simple lattice design in Karanac is estimated to have increased experimental precision by 2.8% over that which would have been obtained with the randomized complete block design (Table 2). For starch content in grain dry matter the estimated values reached 0.9% in Osijek and 1.8% in Karanac. The highest values of estimated relative efficiency (ER) were obtained for grain yield in both investigated growing seasons and sites, except at Karanac in 1999 (Table 1). Such pattern of ER estimations is most probably obtained due to different plant-soil interrelation for investigated traits when growing maize in different type of soil. As a consequence it revealed grain yield as especially valuable trait for reaching inferences regarding its estimations at locations of different edaphic characteristics. For the other two investigated traits, no such clear-cut interrelation was estimated. Estimation of effective error MS was again smallest for grain yield, except for grain moisture content in Osijek (Table 2). Its low estimations for grain yield in both growing seasons and locations imply this trait as very suitable for more accurate estimations if involved into simple lattice experimental design. Such results also determined grain yield as the most valuable investigated trait regarding its adjustment to estimation in simple lattice design. Since the gain in precision of a simple lattice design is obvious for all the investigated traits in this study, the results also might encourage researchers to „switch” to it, instead of exploit randomized complete block design by routine. This is all in purpose to achieve higher experimental precision for targeted trait(s) at locations characterized by different soil type. It especially refers to grain yield and Osijek location in this study. However, it is important to emphasize that technical procedure of arranging and setting up simple lattice design is more complex with respect to time and labour consumption compared to randomized complete block design. Conclusions The higher estimation of the relative efficiency of the simple lattice design compared to the randomized complete block design was obtained for all investigated traits at both locations and growing seasons. An plant-soil interrelation revealed the highest gain in</p><p id="Pg680">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1354 precision for grain yield at both locations and growing seasons (except at Karanac in 1999), which makes this trait suitable for the assessment under the simple lattice design. However, any recommendation given with respect to preference of one location over another would be uncertain for grain moisture content and starch content in dry matter of grain. This is due to inconsistent relative efficiency estimations across locations and growing seasons caused by different plant-soil interrelations. Therefore, an additional investigation is required.

The tested soils were acid and calcareous sandy soils as well as acid and calcareous loamy more heavy soils with different basic soil properties. Applied tannery sludge had high Cr content 5226 mg kg-1. The test plant was spring barley. The tannery sludge treatments heightened the soil Cr concentration in both pseudo total and mobilisable fractions. The investigated soil properties (pH, OM%) increased significantly on each soil as a result of sludge treatment. The increment of the soil Cr content did not have effect neither on the barley stem nor grain Cr concentration. The sludge application did not have any negative effect on the winter barley yield amount either. Keywords: sewage sludge, Cr uptake, barley Introduction The focus point of the interactions among atmosphere, hydrosphere, pedosphere, lithosphere and biosphere is vegetation. One of the most important part of this interactions is the transfer of elements from soil to plant. The soil-plant interrelations determine the plant element composition and yield (Várallyay, 2006; Blazenka et al. 2007; Kádár, 1995). In this work, the effect of tannery sewage sludge on different soil’s Cr fractions, pH and organic matter and plant uptake was investigated in pot experiment. The benefits of sewage sludge application to agricultural soils as a source of nutrients and soil ameliorant have been widely acknowledged. However, sewage sludge may contain high concentrations of potentially toxic elements. The contamination of soils with these elements continues to be a matter of great concern because of their persistence in soils and increased uptake by crop plants even many years after sludge applications. Materials and methods A pot experiment was set up in 1999 for examining the effect of sewage sludge loads on soils and plants. Four soils were tested: acid and calcareous sandy soils as well as acid and calcareous loamy more heavy soils with different basic soil properties. Applied tannery sludge had high Cr content 5226 mg kg-1. The pH of sludge was 7.38. Kádár and Morvai (2007) designed the experiment using four different soils (Table 1). Applied sewage sludge loads were the followings: 0, 5, 10, 20 g sludge D.M. kg-1 air-dry soil. Number of treatments were: 4 soil x 4 load level = 16, with 4 replications. Air-dry soil (&lt;5 mm particle size) and homogenized fresh sludge was mixed and filled into 10-liter pots (10 kg soil). After 1-month incubation, spring barley (April) and after its harvest (July) peas were sown. The barley had 3 months growing period. Soil sampling took place after pea harvest in October. Composite soil samples consisted of 10 cores/pot and all plant material (above-ground total plant mass/shoot) was used for analysis and yield assessment. Pots were irrigated with deionized water during the</p><p id="Pg682">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1356 experiment, according to the water demand of plants. Determination of plant element concentrations was carried out with ICP-AES method after cc. HNO3 + H2O2 digestion. From the soil samples the pseudo total (cc. HNO3 + H2O2 digestion), the “mobilisable” 0.5 M ammonium-acetate + 0.02 M EDTA extractable (Lakanen &amp; Erviö, 1971) element concentrations were measured. Determination of plant element concentrations was carried out with ICP-AES method. Table 1.

Because of the interaction between soil and sludge the mobilisable fraction of Cr had the less increment on the Gyöngyös soil with the highest clay+silt content and thus the highest CEC value. It is obvious that the Cr can be fixed on clay particles. The sludge had alkaline pH that is why the pH of two acid soils heightened significantly and the sandy soil reached slightly alkaline pH (Table 3). The amount of organic matter grew significantly on each soil, even on the Gyöngyös soil that had relatively high (3.1%) organic matter content. Table 2.

The barley yield increased on each soil, which may be caused by the nutrient content of sewage sludge (N 3.2%, P 2600 mg kg-1, K 875 mg kg-1).

The tannery sludge treatments heightened the soil Cr concentration in both pseudo total and mobilisable fractions. The investigated soil properties (pH, OM%) increased significantly on each soil as a result of sludge treatment. The acidic sandy soil became slightly alkaline. The interactions between treated soils and barley gave the following results. The increment of the soil Cr content did not have effect on the barley stem and grain Cr concentration. Thus in case of this element one can say that there is no direct connection between the soil and plant Cr content in the investigated concentration range. The amount of yield increased in function of sludge loads, which may be induced by the nutrient content of sewage sludge. This increment was the highest on acidic sandy soil (2-3 times). Transfer coefficients for Cr (plant concentration/soil concentration) decreased on each soil in function of sludge loads. References 50/2001. (IV. 3.) Gov. Order.

The content of five OAs (Ox, Cit, Mal, Suc and Fum) was measured in the leaves of barley seedlings hoping to identify them as parts of nickel detoxification mechanisms. Besides a 3 fold increase of Cit and Mal, the amount of Ox and Fum increased by 5-6 fold. It was found that Ox and Fum may also take part in complexation mechanisms. Keywords: heavy metal, cadmium, nickel, organic acid Abbreviations: Organic acid-OA, Cd-cadmium, Ni-nickel, Oxaloacetate-Ox, Citrate-Cit, Malate-Mal, Succinate—Suc, Fumarate-Fum Introduction Environmental conditions strongly affect plant production (Drezner et al., 2007), one of them is heavy metal poisoning, the detoxification of which is a highly complex process, with variable elements (Tuba and Csintalan, 1993), one of them is related to OAs. OAs, besides having an important role in many metabolic pathways (Popova and Pinheiro de Cavalho, 1998), also interact with metals in two ways: the first is root exudation of OAs, which enhances the bioavailability of either essential or toxic microelements (Várallyay, 2006) thus it can result toxicity and decreased yield (Mossor-Pietraszewska, 2001). The other way of OA-metal interaction is metal transport and detoxification in the plant tissues. Cit and Mal are supposed to be the main complexing agents in nickel detoxification (Brooks et al., 1981, Tatár et al., 2000). Although cadmium is mostly complexed by phytochelatins, cadmium also tends to coordinate with Mal (Ueno et al., 2005). Since there are relatively few information, in terms of the possible role of OAs in Ni and Cd detoxifications compared to that of Al and Zn (Várallyay, 2006) (Prasad, 2004), the changes of the amount of OAs were investigated in barley seedlings under these heavy metal stresses (Daood et al., 2006). Materials and methods Growth conditions: The growth conditions of barley (Hordeum vulgare L. „Triangel”) was according to Hegedűs et al., (2001). Ten days old seedlings were treated with halfHoagland solution containing 1mM NiSO4 or 300µMCdCl2 for 7 days. Seedlings were sampled for OA, Cd2+ and Ni2+ content determination. Each experiment was repeated three times, mean values and standard deviation are presented. OA content measurement: 0.5 g of leaves of barley seedlings were ground in liquid nitrogen and quartz sand in 1 ml distilled water, and after being centrifuged, samples</p><p id="Pg686">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1360 were filtered through a 45 µm nylon membrane of which 20 µl was used for the measurement of OAs (Ox, Cit, Mal, Suc and Fum) with RP HPLC (Waters). The peaks were quantified with a Breeze analytical chromatography data system (WATERS) using standards (Merck). Metal content measurement: 0.2 g of powdered dry material was dissolved in 2 cm3 of HNO3:H2O2 mixture (1:1 v/v). The nickel and cadmium content of the filtered solution was determined by an ICAP 61E Plasma Spectrometer (Horváth et al., 1996). Results and discussion The concentrations of cadmium (300 µM) and nickel (1mM) were chosen according their highly toxic but not lethal effects on plant metabolism. Barley roots accumulate an order of magnitude more Ni and Cd, regardless its type, compared to that of leaves (Table 1.). The accumulation of Cd was mostly in the roots, similarly to the data of Tuba and Csintalan (1993), whereas, in accordance with the findings of Yantiang and Marschner (1995), considerably more amount of Ni transported into the leaves.

Considering roots, after one week of cadmium exposure all five investigated OAs decreased to 32-84%. One of the possible reasons is that Cd is more competitive for ion channels than nutrients (eg.: K+, Ca2+) (Lindberg et al., 2004). Therefore in order to enhance the availability of essential nutrients (Tuba and Csintalan 1993) for their normal supply (Várallyay, 2006), plants need to lower the pH of the Figure 1. Changes of OA content under highly toxic, but not lethal 300 µM Cd (A) and 1 mM Ni (B) treatment respectively, in barley roots and leaves</p><p id="Pg687">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1361 media with root OA exudation. The amount of organic acids in roots of Ni treated plants increased variably, except for succinate. The OAs with low constitutive levels (Ox, Cit, Mal) showed an intensive increase even from the first day of Ni treatment and because relatively high proportion of nickel gets into the leaves there is an enhanced need for their transport carried out by OAs. Since cadmium mostly remains in the roots, its chelation and transportation, if needed, is realised with phytochelatins, not by OAs. This may be another reason, why none of the measured OA concentrations increased in Cd treated roots.

In case of both metals the absolute value of Ox and Fum was much lower than in case of Mal, Cit or Suc (table 2.), but they seemed to react the most rapidly to increased Ni and Cd availability, similarly to the roots. Generally, Ni caused more enhanced OA accumulation in leaves but interestingly enough, Ox and Fum increased even after 24 hours of both Cd and Ni treatment, which suggests that OAs may also have a role in Cd detoxification, too. Cd in vitro tends to form complex with Mal compared to other OAs (Ueno et al., 2005), thus Mal being the only free OA that decreased by Cd treatment is reasonable, all the rest however increased. This increase is most probably due to a secondary effect of cadmium toxicity, when the overall strain increases the energy requirement, so the ATP increases by 10-30% for active metal extrusion from cytoplasm. This leads to higher rate of respiration and turnover of OAs of Cit cycle (Lamoreaux and Chaney, 1978). Ni treatment though resulted in a more pronounced, continuous OA accumulation, and after 7 days, Ox and Fum increased by 546 and 462 % respectively. In the xylem sap of cucumber the presence of Cit, Mal and Fum, (Tatár et al., 2000) indicates their role in the transport mechanism of Ni. In our experiment, the amount of Ox and Suc also increased (by 546%; 263% respectively). In order to achieve the increased amount of Cit and Mal, which are the most abundant OAs in barley leaves; first, other intermediates (Ox, Fum) of the Cit cycle are synthesized in an enhanced level. Furthermore, mitochondrial electron leakage is enhanced by metals and produce free oxygen radicals the probable sites of which seem to be complex I and ubiquinonecytochrome b region (Lund et al. 1991). The alteration of electron transport could also be related to the rapid rise of Fum and Ox levels. Although Cit and Mal are considered as vaculoar chelators, there is no evidence for their exclusivity (Tatár et al 2000; Brooks</p><p id="Pg688">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1362 et al. 1998) and the rise of Ox and Fum designates a possible role, not in the transportation, but in the vacuolar chelation, where most of the OAs are present since in the vacuole, OAs chelate metals, regardless the type of metal and the type of molecule responsible for the transport into the vacuole. Conclusions We have found that besides citrate and malate are thought to be the heavy metal chelators, other OAs were accumulated with high extent during Ni and Cd stress. This finding suggests that these OAs, like Ox and Fum, also influence the processes of detoxification. Further investigations are needed to explain the role of rapid rise of Ox and Fum levels in the altered citric cycle within 24 hours after Cd and Ni treatments.

The objective is to employ more and more persons among working age population and have them participate in the operation of economy achieving the target set by the Lisbon Strategy. The Hungarian economy and the labour market have undergone many development phases. As regards employment the country ranks penultimate among the New Member States and it is an essential task to solve employment problems, reducing the regional differences. It is also important to study how regional conditions contribute to job creation in the case of a region of agricultural character. Keywords: regional competitiveness, employment rate, active population, job creation in agriculture, land use Introduction Regional competitiveness can not be expressed by only one emphasized indicator. According to Lengyel (2003) competitiveness means several factors closely related, it is a complex entirety of measurable economic categories among which employment rate is included as well. Employment depends on the numbers of active wage-earners, the demand of work places and its quantity, quality and structural indicators. The employment rate in the EU member states shows a significant lag behind the objective of 70% by 2010 (67% in 2005) set by the Lisbon Strategy. In 2005, the employment rate of people aged 15-64 years was 63.8% (ages 60-64: 26.7%, ages 6569: 8.2%). To be able to achieve the target of 70% the creation of about 20 million further jobs would be needed (7 million jobs in the New Member States). Materials and methods The information basis of the research comes from the annual reports of Hungarian agriculture, the National Development Plan and the Operational Programmes. We have used various statistical methods during the evaluation of the database. The data of regional sequences were evaluated with comparative ratio numbers, and the inner structure of various multitudes was evaluated with distribution numbers and used statistical tools to display the results. Results and discussion Regarding the employment rate in the EU Hungary is among the lasts (ages 15-64: 57%). The employment is more complex at regional level than national level. Only the fourth part of the population of EU-25 lives in regions where the employment rate of 70% has been already achieved, out of 254 regions 200 regions still leg behind the objectives set. About 15% of the population lives in regions where this figure is below 50%.</p><p id="Pg690">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1364 Since the change of regime the Hungarian economy and labour market have undergone many development phases (Bocz et al., 2007). In the 1990s a large number of people lost their jobs involving the appearance of large numbers of working age population who become economically inactive. This number of inactive population continued to grow by an increasing number of those who were out of the labour market long term or who could not enter it. A decrease of 26.7% (1990-1997) in the employed population was followed by favourable processes (1997-2003), the number of economically active people grew (average of 1.5%/year). The period of 1998-2001, showing rapid development, can be characterized by the stabilization of the number of active wageearners, retired people and rentiers (Stark, 2007). Last years show slowing economic dynamics and increasing imbalance. The employment rate of 50-55% seems to be stabilized. All things considered, during the one and a half decades since the change of regime the number of employed population has decreased by 20%. Regarding the number of employed population, similarly to the national tendencies, an increasing growth can be noticed in the North Great Plain Region (hereinafter the Region) between 1998 and 2003 and there was a fall in the period of 2003-2005. As regards the number of employed persons, the North Great Plain ranks high among the regions, however, studying this number compared to the population number of the region the situation is unfavourable. Regional employment rates show significant differences among the regions: in 2005, the difference was 13% between the employment rates of the region being in the best position (Central Hungary) and the region being in the worst position (North Hungary). One of the two most underdeveloped regions is the North Great Plain Region where together with North Hungary the employment figures decreased in 2004-2005 (Huisz et al., 2006). Between 1998 and 2005 county employment rate increased everywhere, except Vas County. In 1996, job creation was dynamic in Heves, Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg and Nógrád Counties bringing up the rear. Despite the growth, the country divided into two parts: job opportunities and willingness to find employment are much better in the counties of Central Hungary, West Transdanubia, Central Transdanubia than in the other counties. The change of the employment rate in the counties of the Region was 34% during the studied period that didn’t change the position of Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg County, in 1996 and in 2005 the employment situation was the worst in this county. The two other counties of the Region rank one place better in 2005. During the period after the change of regime the sectoral structure of employment has also changed. The sectoral structure of labour market generally changes in long term therefore a decrease of almost 13% in agriculture during the last one and a half decades can be considered marked (Zmaic et al., 2007). There was a less decrease in the proportion of people employed in industry and construction despite the increase noticed in construction. A less increase can be noticed in the share of trade, transport, and the share of other services increased considerably (Stark, 2007) (Figure 1). In 2005, 5% of the employed people worked in agriculture, about one third of them have jobs in companies in industry and construction and 62.3% of them work for the service sector.</p><p id="Pg691">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1365 Figure 1 Sectoral distribution of employed persons Source: Own compilation (based on the data from Stark (2007) When comparing the regions to each other, the sectoral distribution of employed persons in the Central Hungary Region is considerably different from the other regions: the proportion of people employed in services is high while production sectors are characterized by low proportion of employees. The composition of employees shows developed economic structure in the case of Central and West Transdanubia. In north and south regions of the Great Plain, agriculture has a traditionally outstanding role in employment, in these regions the ratio of the sector is nearly double of the national average.

With the optimal agricultural land use, as a consequence of differentiated development in agriculture, several employments of agricultural character can be discontinued in the future, which causes difficulties for the population living in rural areas. Wheat and maize growing is dominant in plant cultivation. We have to focus on the quality in case of wheat cultivation. Regarding national consumption and export, the goal is the so-called improving quality and the production of varieties by national breeding, meeting special requirements. Maize cultivation is competitive compared to EU, however, in addition to fodder corn, the cultivation of sweet corns and other eating varieties is also needed. It is important to emphasize that maize and wheat are so-called mass-production plants, their cultivation is the most economic in lands of good quality and in large scale. On this basis, it is highly recommended to grow them in lands where the required producing and factory scale conditions are available. For the creation of the optimal land use and its profitability, it is recommended to enlarge the cultivation area of oil and protein plants in accordance with the requirements of external markets and processing. During the last three decades the growing of protein plants has decreased, however their cultivation is suggested in lands with poorer conditions and their profitability is ensured when complying with the use of necessary cultivation technology. The development of horticultural sector is needed in the Region because of agroecomonic features and better utilization of plant-soil interrelation. Development of horticulture is the best opportunity for job creation in agriculture, in addition, it has positive influence on food industry as well. Conclusions It is an essential task to solve the employment problems in the Region. On one hand stimulation of job opportunity creations is significant, which influences the demand of the labour market, on the other hand it is also important to influence the supply market by means of the development of trainings, vocational trainings. The area should fit in with the EU economic division of labour and it is needed to set the new strategic sectors and human resources development in accordance with this. It is also a strategic objective to reduce regional differences in employment, provide the labour market actors with information, create partnerships, develop human resources by means of improving the qualification level of employees and unemployed people and developing their skills and work culture.

WITHIN NON-IRRIGATED CONDITIONS Adrienn VÁNYINÉ SZÉLES 1 University of Debrecen, Centre of Agricultural Sciences and Engineering, Institute for Land Utilisation, Technology and Regional Development, H-4032 Debrecen, Böszörményi street 138, szelesa@agr.unideb.hu Abstract: Fertilization reliably increased the SPAD values of maize hybrids in all three years of the striped long-term field experiments having three factors and four repetitions, adjusted on chernozem soil with lime deposits on the Látókép experiment site of the University of Debrecen, Centre of Agricultural Sciences and Engineering. The SPAD values reliably differed from each other in every year, that was indicated by the significant hybrid x fertilizer interaction. The biggest SPAD value was gained with a N150 kg/ha fertilizeractive ingredient treatment (56,2), nevertheless, the SPAD value gained with a fertilizer dose of N120 kg/ha is not significantly lower, therefore N120 kg/ha is also suitable to develop the maximum SPAD value. The R 2 value gained on the basis of linear regression was 0,605. Fertilization significantly modified the grain yield of maize in all three years. During the examination of the relationship between SPAD value and yield data, we concluded that there is a stochastic relationship between them (r=0,449). Considering the value of the determination coefficient (R 2 ), we stated that SPAD value determined the yield quantity to an extent of 20,2% in the average of the three years. Based on the values we got, we arrived at the conclusion that yield quantity increases with the increase of SPAD value. The biggest yield was reached above a SPAD value of 55 in the average of three years. Keywords: maize, fertilization, crop year, SPAD value Introduction Plants contain nitrogen in a large quantity, therefore the presence or absence basically affects the character of plants (Anda 1987). The chlorophyll content of the plants suffering from nitrogen loss decreases, the functioning of the meristems slows down, the cells generated will become old soon (Pethő 1993). In the case of nitrogen deficiency, pigment content also decreases significantly, and as a primary consequence, the utilization of solar energy will be reduces (Seeman et al. 1987). The dry matter accumulation is slower and has a smaller extent in maize plants with nitrogen deficiency (Győrffy 1965, Huzsvai és Nagy 2003, Nagy 2006a, 2006b). Applying excessive amounts of nitrogen causes additional costs and can also cause environmental pollution if it gets into ground water (Nagy 2007, Németh 2006). The determination of the optimal quantity of N is essential from the aspect of efficient fertilizer utilization and the avoidance of ground and underground water pollution. Even if we are completely aware of the processes going on within the ground and the factors influencing the nutrient supply of the ground, still, we will not get a comprehensive view of the plant’s nourishment conditions. The direct answer will be given by the plant itself. This is why we also have to analyse the plant. Soil Plant Analysis Development (SPAD) chlorophyll meter is considered to be an easy-to-use tool for environmental friendly N fertilization of maize. This tool is quick, reliable and does not damage plant tissues (Yadava 1986, Piekielek és Fox 1992, Feil et al. 1997, Berzsenyi és Lap 2006). Marquard és Tipton (1987) made measurements on twelve plant species to get to know the relationship between the SPAD values and the quantity of chlorophyll extracted by acetone, determined with spectrophotometer.</p><p id="Pg694">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1368 According to the results, there was a significant relationship between SPAD values and the quantity of chlorophyll to be extracted. Schepers et al. (1992) recorded the data of several experiment location, on which they examined numerous maize hybrids during flowering, comparing the nitrogen concentration of maize leaf with SPAD 502 readings. Their results showed a correlation between the chlorophyll meter and the N concentration of the leaf. Material and methods The examinations were carried out by means of multifactoral long-term field experiments adjusted on middle cohesive chernozem soils with lime deposits on the Látókép experiment site of the University of Debrecen, Centre of Agricultural Sciences and Engineering. The long-term field experiment is striped, it has three factors and four repetitions. We adjusted fertilizer active ingrediant treatment x hybrid treatment x irrigation within one repetition. The proportions of fertilizer active ingredients: 1 N:0,75 P2O5:0,88 K2O. These are constant NPK doses, where the basic dose is 80 kg/ha – of which N is 30 kg/ha – and we applied these doses multiplied by 1,2,3,4,5, under a control without fertilization. Plant number is set to 70 thousand plant/ha. In this current study – during the crop years unfavourable (2003) and favourable (2004, 2006) for maize – we examined the SPAD readings and SPAD chlorophyll concentration measured by SPAD-502, a portable chlorophyll meter at 50% stage of flowering in maize hybrids belonging to the same group of breeding season, within nonirrigated conditions. We also examined yield results and the relations among them. Fertilizer active ingredient treatments were the same in every year, but the number of maize hybrids changed in the examined period. SPAD measurements were carried out on the same leaf of every plant, on twenty plants per treatment. The yield results of maize were evaluated by a general linear model. Results and discussion We have examined the impact of and relationship between fertilization and crop year on the SPAD values of maize hybrids. Based on a variance analysis, the impact of the two factors (fertilizer, crop year) is significant. According to the SS values, fertilization had the largest significance within the conditions of the long-term experiment. The relationship of crop year x fertilization was significant in the joint analysis of the different years. This proves that the SPAD values of maize hybrids was mainly affected by nutriment supply, but this effect was also significantly influenced by crop year. Hybrid effect was also significant that showed the different SPAD values of maize hybrids. Crop year significantly influenced the SPAD values of maize hybrids, as we concluded to a significant crop year x hybrid relationship. We examined the relationshis between SPAD values and fertilizer by means of a Duncan test. The SPAD values of the non-fertilized and the first four fertilized stages significantly differ from each other. The fifth group was the SPAD value of N120 és N150 kg/ha fertilizer active ingredient treatments. The largest SPAD reading was gained under a fertilizer active ingredient treatment of N150 kg/ha (56,2), nevertheless, the SPAD value gained with a fertilizer dose of N120 kg/ha is not significantly lower, therefore N120 kg/ha is also suitable to develop the maximum SPAD value. The R2 value gained on the basis of linear regression was 0,605. Results were evaluated annually, too (Table 1).</p><p id="Pg695">VII.

Based on the Duncan test, treatments indicated with the same letter in one column do not differ from each other significantly We carried out a variance analysis to justify the different impacts of different fertilizer active ingredient treatments and crop years on yield. All of the main effects (NPK, hybrid, crop year) were significant. According to the SS values, the most significant effect belonged to fertilization, this is also proven by the value of R2 determination coefficient determined by linear regression (0,383). The relationship of crop year x fertilization is reliable, which shows that fertilizer had a different efficiency depending on the precipitation of each year. The relationship of crop year x hybrid pointed out that the yield of hybrids can be significantly modified by crop year effect. The relationship of hybrid x NPK also result in a reliable difference. Based on the significance analysis of yield results, we understood the relationship between the grain yield of maize hybrids and fertilizer active ingredient treatments. The fertilizer active ingredient treatment of N120 kg/ha proved to be the most efficient one. Results were also evaluated annually (Table 2).

The value of the determination coefficient (R2) is 0,972, that is the SPAD value influenced the yield quantity to an extent of 97,2%. Among the examined years it was 2006 when the SPAD value influenced yield to the smallest extent (18,8%). Conclusions We were able to characterize the N supply of maize using a SPAD-502 chlorophyll meter during the years examined. We concluded that fertilization increased the SPAD values of maize hybrids reliably in all three years and that this value was higher on average in 2004 and 2006 (when the precipitation supply was favourable), than it was in 2003 (when the weather was dry). Fertilization increased the SPAD values more strongly within less favourable water supply conditions (2003) than it did in 2006, when there was a good water supply. The SPAD values of maize hybrids reliably differed in every year, that was shown by the significant relationship of hybrid x fertilizer. During the analysis of the relationship between SPAD values and yield results, we concluded that there is a stochastic relationship between SPAD values and yield (r=0,449). Considering the value of the determination coefficient (R2), we stated that SPAD value determined the yield quantity to an extent of 20,2% in the average of the three years. Based on the results gained, we concluded that yield increases with the increase of SPAD value. The largest yield was reached above a SPAD value of 55 in the average of three years.

Consequently, with that aim field trials with seven cultivars of winter wheat (representing about 40% of production share in Croatia) were set up as RCB design with three repetitions and two seeding rates (600 kernels/m 2 -usual in production and 330 kernels/m 2 -reduced) at four different sites with specific environmental conditions. Precision information about grain yield, test weight and thousand kernel weight were obtained. Significant differences for all traits were found among cultivars (C), years (Y), environments (E) and seeding rates (SR) (except for test weight), as well as for interactions CxY, CxE, YxE and CxYxE, while interaction YxExSR significantly influenced test and thousand kernel weight. The highest average grain yields at 600 kernels/m2 seeding rate and test weights were realized at Osijek and Tovarnik, while Nova Gradiska was environment with the highest thousand kernel weight. The same trend among environments has been reached for all traits at 330 kernels/m 2 seeding rate, but at the lower grain yield and at the higher thousand kernel weight level. The best results were realized in 2006. The most yielding cultivars in both seeding rates were Alka, Srpanjka and Panonka.

For all traits the same trend has been reached at 330 kernels/m2 seeding rate, however, at the lower grain yield level (significant for environments Osijek and Tovarnik,) and at the higher thousand kernel weight level (significant for Nova Gradiska). For test weight, regarding seeding rates, significant differences were found only in two cases (cultivar Alka and environment Tovarnik), while overall comparison was not significant. At 600 kernels/m2 seeding rate higher grain yield (7.728 t ha-1), test weight (83.5 kg hl-1) and thousand kernel weight (41.40 g) were obtained in 2006. The lowest thousand kernel weight in comparison to 2006 and all three years in 330 kernels/m2 seeding rate were recorded in 2004 and 2005 at 600 kernels/m2 seeding rate (37.95 and 38.31 g, respectively). The most yielding cultivars at both seeding rates were Alka (8.120 t ha-1), Srpanjka (7.776 t ha-1) and Panonka (7.620 t ha-1). Super Zitarka and Janica showed the highest test weights (83.3 and 82.2 kg hl-1), while Panonka and Super Zitarka were cultivars with highest thousand kernel weights (42.98 and 42.80 g). Overall comparisons between higher seeding rate (usual in production in Croatia for majority of wheat cultivars) and reduced seeding rate (as important breeding goal) were confirmed that higher seeding rate had significant (although differently expressed for particular cultivar) influence on higher grain yield coupled with lower thousand kernel weight. Conclusions Obtained results about specific cultivar reaction, with emphasis on grain yield ability, over different years and environments, presents necessary and precise information for improvement of wheat breeding and production efforts. A higher (usual) seeding rate had significant influence on grain yield increase coupled with lower thousand kernel weight, although differently expressed for particular cultivar. Osijek and Tovarnik were environments with highest grain yields and best yielding potential. The high yielding cultivars in both seeding rates were Alka, Srpanjka and Panonka.

The area of analysis is Pannonian subregions of Croatia. Stochastic simulation model have been created. The results indicate low variability of yield and higher gross margins in the subregions P1 and P2, ones with more favourable soil quality. The paper also discuss limitations of the (non)existing soil and agro economic data bases as obstacles in decision making on micro (farm) and macro (agricultural policy) level. Keywords: soil, gross margin, risk analysis, grain and oil crops Introduction Croatia has good agro ecological potential (soil fertility, climate conditions and tradition) in arable crops’ production. In the structure of arable land, 1.09 million hectares are cultivated with grains, which is approximately 70 % out of total arable land area. In the structure of grain production, dominant culture is maize with the share of 58 %, wheat with 32 %, barley with 7 % and oats, rye and other grains with minor share. Wheat production steady declines in the terms of area and production. Maize and barley productions show slightly increasing trend. In the period 2000 – 2004 oil crops were cultivated on an approximately 6% of the total arable land (Soybeans with 50% share). In the last few years and especially between 2002 and 2003 land area under oil crops significantly increased, especially soybeans. Soil is the most important natural resources for agriculture and one of the key factors in production planning. The production value is heavily influenced by the soil fertility, which per se does not guarantee the production value (Franić et.al, 2007). Between soil fertility and the business results stand a number of factors, namely environmental conditions and farm management practices. Croatia has a range of different soils with different degrees if fertility. Pannonian region, which is in the focus of the paper, is divided on four subregions (Bašić et al., 2001). Eastern Pannonian subregion (P1) is known for most fertile types of soils (Chernozem, Cambiosol eutric and Regoslol on loess) and perfect conditions for crop production. In Central Pannonian subregion (P2) prevalent are hydromorphic types of soil. In Western Pannonian subregion (P3) the most common types of soils are Luviosl on loess and Stagnogley. Northwest Pannonian Subregion (P4) common soil types are Gleysols, widespread in numerous valleys that have been formed by rivers, rivulets, streams and brooks, follows by Leptosl on marl, Stagnosols and Humofluvisols (Cvetković, 2003). The business environment for agriculture is constantly changing with increasing number of uncertain variables. In the same time pressures for higher profits and intensity on the same area of land are the must! Soil quality with its significant influence on yields (Braimoh and Vlek, 2006; Erekul and Kohn, 2006) has clear economic importance (Kwansoo et al., 2001). Understanding of the soil resource and availability of soil information are important in decision making (Manderson and Palmer, 2006).</p><p id="Pg702">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1376 Unfortunately, limited information and research about soil and its influence on business results in Croatia, distort signals in decision making process either for farm managers or agricultural policy makers. In addition, statistical limitations in regard with land prices, crop production and prices statistics (Franić and Kumrić, 2007) additionally decrease reliability of data in the decision making process. Based on the available data, the objective of the paper is to compare business results in wheat, maize and soybean production in Pannonian subregions and evaluate role and influence of soil on business success by use of stochastic simulation model. Materials and methods The research encompassed analysis of business results of wheat, maize and soybeans production in Pannonnian subregions in the framework of decision analysis under risk and uncertainty. Business results were measured by gross margin per hectare which is difference between revenue and variable (or direct cost). Stochastic simulation model was designed. In stochastic simulation, selected variables incorporated random or stochastic components (by specifying probability distributions) to reflect important parts of the uncertainty of the real system (Hardaker et al., 2004). Purpose of stochastic simulation is to estimate the probability distribution function for key output variables (Richardson, 2007) - revenues and gross margin in our case. Simulation gains more information about the probability distribution for key variables than a simple average and risk analyst should always provide its input to the decision in the form of probability curves (Eđed and Horvat, 2007). Therefore results are presented and discussed based on the shape of probability and/or cumulative density function. Two variables in the model were set as stochastic: yields and prices. Both have been distributed according to normal distribution. To avoid consequences of overlooking any dependency between variables, a correlation matrix was specified. Coefficient of correlation price and yield is 0.13 for wheat, in the case of maize it is -0.38 and -0.08 for soybeans. The simulation settings included Monte Carlo sampling with 1000 iterations. Number of iterations was enough to ensure stable statistic and low error. Random generator was fixed to ensure the identical set of random samples for each treatment. @Risk software and Simetar software is used in simulation and analysis of results. Note that only factors of revenues (yield and price) are considered stochastic variables, costs are known with certainty. For this analysis we used the data on wheat, maize and soybeans production 1999-2006, provided by the Central Bureau of Statistics of Croatia (CBS). Information on cost is based on the Croatian Agricultural Extension Institute data (2004). Market Information System in Agriculture price data for the period 2001-2006 was used. Results and discussion In comparison with EU countries, yields of the selected crops in Croatia are lower. Having in mind good agro-ecological conditions, especially in P1 and P2 regions it should not be the case. Eastern Pannonian region, one with the highest quality of soils has the highest yields although not less variable. Yields in P2 subregion are the most stabile and second highest. Subregion P3, except in the case of soybeans, has lowest and in the same time the most risky yields. Labour and capital intensity in P4 region partly explains stabile yields. Having in mind relatively importance of maize production, its</p><p id="Pg703">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1377 yields are very uncertain which is in collision with production conditions, including soil quality. Yield and their distribution which served as input variables in the model are presented in table1. Table 1.

Prices have not been analysed by subregions. With the limited number of buyers on the Croatian market and under distorted conditions of competitive market it is acceptable. We already mentioned that costs are static and the level of cost was 4847 kn for wheat (for all subregions), 6815 in the case of maize and 4713 kn for soybean. In the situation of both low and variable yields we could not expect satisfying business results. Storing of products as risk management strategy and selling on the high prices could significantly improve business results. Simulation model resulted in quite low and even negative (maize and wheat in P3 and P4) gross margin per hectare. Gross margins in P1 subregion are positive, not high and relatively low risky. In the case of wheat production (Figure 1) there is 9% chance that gross margin will be negative in the P1 region, 27% in P2, 57% in P4 and 71% in P3 subregion. In the case of maize probability of loss is even higher: 20% in P1 subregion, about 30% in P2 and 54% in P3 and P4 subregion. Gross margins in soybeans production are low but positive with relatively equality spread deviations from the mean, although still with high. 0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1 -2000 -1000 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 gross margin kn/ha Pr ob ili ty P1 P2 P3 P4 Figure 1.

Cereal Research Communications 1378 according to the simulation model results. Nevertheless, we are aware of the fact that yields used in the model are near or below break even point. Due to many intervening variables to consider, role of soil is difficult to quantify. Model used is example how simulation could be used in order to bridge problem of data shortage. Model could be further be extend by use of expert advices and statistical justifications and, as such, could be used in investment analysis, feasibility studies or rural development plans. Conclusions Based on the statistically recorded yields and prices, gross margin indicators in the framework of stochastic simulation model were calculated. Simulation model resulted in quite low and even negative gross margin per hectare. Gross margins for wheat and maize in P3 and P4 subregions are negative, while in the P2 are quite low. Gross margins in P1 subregion are positive, not high and relatively low risky. Probability of loss is highest in the case of maize production in the P3 and P4 subregions. Gross margins in soybeans production are low but positive with relatively equality spread deviations from the mean, although still with high. Providing detailed nationwide soil information that is appropriate for farm decision making is feasible (achieved by several European countries and the USA). Despite limitations, theoretical background of the model could serve in creation of wider and more reliable data base about soils and economic indicators. As such, it will be able to warrant more quality base for business planning and, in the same time, help in the creation of policy measures regarding agricultural regionalisation and rural development.

Family farms that own approximately 80% of total Croatian agricultural land are the most prevailed part in production agricultural structure. More than 70% of those farms hold less than 3 ha of land which is still highly fragmented. Among the farms that own more than 3 ha of land, there is only a few of them that are solid and market orientated with capability to be competitive to import producers. Agricultural Census in 2003 encompassed 449,896 agricultural households and 1,364 legal entities that are engaged in agriculture. The size of utilized agricultural land area for all comprised units is 2.4 ha in average. Agricultural households use 1.9 ha of utilized agricultural area in average, while legal entities 159.2 ha in average. Competitiveness analysis of the major Croatian agricultural products has been conducted within the project „"Competitiveness in Agriculture and EU accession - A Strategy for Croatian Agriculture". It shows that Croatian agriculture is enough productive only in maize, oil rape seed, apple and eggs production. Keywords: Croatian Agriculture, Land Consolidation, Competitiveness Introduction Within the process of socio-economic transition in the 90-ties, Croatia agitates market economy which requires radical revalorization of agricultural production resources and total conversion of economic entities from socialist into the market based and orientated enterprises. According to the Strategy of Development of Croatian Agriculture (1995) the primary role in agricultural producers’ structure belongs to the family farms. Knowing existed agricultural structure, it seems that agricultural policy commitment is to the small land property (Štambuk, 2002). In ex socio-economic system, within the period 1956 to 1990 only 21.2% of Croatian agricultural area has been included in the process of land consolidation and reparcelling. It is important to notice that existed Law of land consolidation derives from ex socioeconomic system. It is unquestionable that new land consolidation legislation is one of the priority and prerequisites for higher competitiveness of Croatian agriculture. Today, land fragmentation emerges as the most significant limitation factor for the more productive and competitive agricultural production. Land consolidation becomes serious postulate of the modern agricultural production system introducing. Materials and methods In Croatia today exists different data sources about state and usage of agricultural land. There are three official statistic data sources. Two of them are from Croatian Central Bureau of Statistics (Agricultural Census 2003 and Annual book 2006) while third is Register of Family Farms (Ministry of Agriculture). Unfortunately, data collected from different sources are considerably unequal regarding the major indices of land usage and agricultural land plot size. The reason of discrepancies is different methodology and data collecting techniques. In this paper data from Agricultural Census 2003 are used</p><p id="Pg706">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1380 because it is compatible with statistic data collecting in EU. The focused land is used by private family farms and legal entities regardless if they own it or have contract law (concession, lease) on usage. Based on the production cost calculation, the ratios of domestic resources cost (DRC method) has been determined with 2-3 level of intensity. Results and discussion According to the concept of Multi-Functional Characteristic of Agriculture and Land (MFCAL), the soil is defined as a multi-functional natural resource, whose most fundamental role and importance lie in the crop cultivation. This role features the soil as the major component of the farmland, and a basic production resource in agriculture and forestry (Franić et al..,2007) Small fragmented plots are one of the basic features of agricultural structure in Croatia. The state since 40 years ago did not change considerably. According to statistic data (Agricultural Census 2003), the whole utilized land area (860,195 ha) is fragmented on 1,918,358 fragmented elements (parcels). Each family farm use land fragmented in 4.3 parcels which size is 0.45 ha in average. However, land fragmentation is different regarding the farm size groups. Usually, larger farms possess more separated parcels. Generally, farms that own more than 10 ha of utilized agricultural land use 12-13 fragmented land parcel with average parcel size of 1.3 ha. This is unfavorable regarding production productivity. Table 1 - Number of parcel and average parcel size in Croatia (Agricultural Census, 2003) Family farms Total utilized land area, ha Number of parcels 860,195 1,918,378 Number of households Average number of parcels Average parcel size (ha) 448,532 4.28 0.45 Legal entities Total utilized land area, ha Number of parcels 217,208 17,712 Number of households Average number of parcels Average parcel size, ha 1364 12.99 12.26 Source: Agricultural Census 2003, Crostat Databases 2006. Compare to the majority of EU farms, Croatian farms are very small, by six times smaller than average EU farm. Croatian agricultural households /Agricultural Census 2003) own 2.59 ha of agricultural land in average (EU-15, 16.6 ha in 1993). In the total household number only 4.65% own 19.53 ha in average. The size of available land is much favorable in segment of legal entities which posses 167 ha in average. During the Croatian transition period, the inherited land problem has been emerged. Some positive movements in land concentration (although still not enough) has been noticed within the fact that commercial farms use approximately 6 ha of arable land. There is ongoing process of land privatization. With acquired legislation, the particular condition of usage, protection and disposal of agricultural land owned by the Republic</p><p id="Pg707">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1381 of Croatia has been defined. Under the ownership of the Government there is still 1,034 million hectares of agricultural land or 32.99% of the total agricultural land in Croatia. The main methods of land reform have been restitution, compensation, privatization and distribution (Davidova, Buckwell, 1999). They can be classified into two groups. In the first one are land restitution and compensation. The second group of instruments for land reform comprises privatisation/distribution. The common feature of these two instruments is that the new ownership is not related to previous (pre-collectivization) ownership. Privatization is the process of offering back into private ownership assets which have been taken into public ownership. Distribution is when the State undertakes simple allocation of land to groups of people, e.g. land-less agricultural workers. Most of the countries used a combination of methods. During the last ten year, many studies with Croatian agriculture competitiveness analysis has been conducted. Table 2.

The most ratios are higher than 1 which indices that the costs of domestic resources used in production are higher than production value expressed in average world market prices. The former production structure has been conserved owing to the shortage of capital, the lack of expertise of different fields, and the absence of market orientation. It is a certain furtherance that the role of individual farms is gradually becoming stronger in the production of the so-called ”small products”.(Harsányi et al..,2007). Croatian agricultural land is under two factor groups affect. The first group make: heritable land problems (land-registry and proprietary list – recent and promptly, legal land heritable problems, and other), double agricultural land taxing (at substitution) in the consolidation activities, under arranged valuable agricultural land protection from substitution into construction land, but also financial assets deficiency and unskilled qualification at local self-government. The second group make numerous practical reasons. Associating land policy with social and political aspect, as well as supporting theory that agricultural land will become construction and that owners of this national</p><p id="Pg708">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1382 wealth will be strangers (so called “national wealth sale”) can have only 1 goal – keeping present situation as long as possible. (Par, 2004). Conclusions Rational agricultural land management is somewhat difficult because of some factors: heritable small private land problems (with less than 5 parcels per farm), permanent land loss because of urbanization, still undefined state land management, significant share of uncultivated and rusty land (especially uncultivated arable land). Agricultural land consolidation in the next period have to be directed toward increasing total agricultural land area used by one farm as result of additional purchase or lease; and/or decreasing small and sparse area of agricultural land cadastral plots used by one farm as result of cadastral plot substitution between two or more farms. Effective agricultural land market, meaning agricultural policy, can be only that one that have no development barriers and that is directed for improving agricultural land structure used by perspective farms. Consequences of small farms are affected at socialeconomic and productive farm structure. Because of all mentioned it is necessary to organize some, for agriculture suitable, production area through consolidation. For generating vital, economically sustainable and competitive family farm sector it is necessary to improve agricultural structure. It requires increasing average family farm size, what is not easily done when taking into account that change of family farm structure according to area of holding is very slow (Župančić, 2000). Currently there is a three-year project “Croatian agricultural land consolidation” at 5 pilot locations, according to contract between Croatian and Sweden government. The aim is to make model for agricultural land consolidation as prerequisites for improving Croatian agricultural production and strengthening Croatian agricultural competitiveness at unique EU market.

E-mail: mborbely@agr.unideb.hu 2 Plant Protection Department, Faculty of Agronomy, University of Debrecen Abstract: Allelopathy of several noxious weeds was identified, but real role of allelopathy is controversial in competition of plants and in non-herbicidal weed management methods. Influence of water supply on allelopathy of Xanthium italicum, Abutilon theophrasti and Datura stramonium was examined in this experiment. Draught stress increased inhibitory effects of shoot extracts of examined species, but it had less effect on activity of root extracts. Keywords: allelopathy, water supply, drought stress Introduction Allelopathy of several weeds was identified in biotests, and it was observed under natural conditions in agroecosystems in many cases. Allelopathy of noxious weeds, i. e. velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medik.), cocklebur (Xanthium italicum Mor.), jimsonweed (Datura stramonium L.) was proved for a long time, and it supposed to play determinant role in competitiveness of them. However, real role of allelopathy is controversial in competition of plants and in non-herbicidal weed management methods. One of the main reasons of conflicting estimation of allelopathy is its changeability: allelopathy of plants or microorganisms apparent in different degree and manner in several experimets. Rice (1964) called attention to several factors which can modify allelopathical relationship of plants and microorganisms. He found that the age of plant parts influence their allelophatic effects depending on species. He observed differences in allelopathy of plants falling within the same species depending on phenological stages, and found differences when there was no inequality in maturity. In these cases he supposed that environmental factors can modify allelopathy. According to Kazinczi et al. (1991) main factors which can influence effect of allelopathy are used plant parts (leaf, stem or root), maturity of plant parts, examined live process, plant species (perhaps cultivars). Dias and Dias (2000) examined effect of drought stress on expressing of allelopathy in case of jimsonweed as donor and cucumber as test plant. Differences were found among effect of plants grown under different water supply levels, furthermore age of plant parts proved to be determinant in amounts of several allelochemicals. Effects of stress factors were found by several authors (El-Tayeb, 2006; Farooq and Azam, 2007). Casini (2004) examined allelopathic effect of cocklebur extracts on maize hybrids, which react differently in the same treatments. Szabó (2000) proposed to unify experimental methods to decrease methodical differences and make better reproducibility of experiments. A uniform methodology may provide better reproducibility of experiments, but it must be based on knowledge of main factors which can effect on allelopathy.</p><p id="Pg710">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl.

Donor plants were grown in greenhouse in plots on sandy soil in August and September in 2007. Soil was kept on 70% ( treatment 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21), 50% (treatment 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22), 30% (treatment3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23) of minimum water capacity or dried until unavailable water content of soil in case of treatment 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 (table 1.). Shoots and roots were collected separatedly at 4 or 5 leaves stage of plants. Collected plant samples were stored frozen until drying at 40o C then samples were stored cooled until use. Extracts were made of 2,5g dried and ground shoot or root in 100 ml water. Extraction lasted 24 hours at 21o C in darkness. Biotests were conducted in Petri dishes (diameter 9cm) with cress (Lepidium campestre) (50 seeds in a dish) under 12 hours light (at 22o C)/12 hours dark (at 18o C) light regime. Root and shoot growth of test plants were measured after 3 and 6 day the establishment of biotests. Table 1.

Böszörményi street Debrecen Hungary 4032, e-mail: ungai@agr.unideb.hu Abstract: The objective for sugar beet production in Hungary is given nowadays, i. e. increasing the sugar yield per hectare, ensuring the stability, approaching the European standard and last but not least improving the quality. The quality of the yield primarily depends on ecological factors (soil, climate), variety and inner factors, which is the complexity of the genetics of a given plant culture (for e.g. the protein content of the grain, the sugar content of the sugar beet). However to a certain extent, some external factors can also modify it, such as agrotechnical procedures, especially nutrient supply. The results of the leaf analysis have been used to look for correlation between the element content and the quality parameters of sugar beet. Keywords: sugar beet, quality, foliar fertilization, leaf analysis Introduction Sugar beet has an outstanding place among the plants, rentability of sugar manufacture is determined by the stability of yield and the quality (saccharose content) of sugar beet. In common with most crops, climate and soils are the two main determinants of yield per unit Site. Both are outside the growers' control but next most important is the plant's nutrition, which can be manipulated to the advantage of producer and processor (Kulcsár and Jászberényi, 1999; Ruzsányi et al., 2001; Draycott and Ccristenson, 2003, Custic et al., 2007; Skalicky et al., 2007). My scholarship was provided for 2 and half years by the factory of the Eastern Sugar Zrt. in Kaba. Based on our results their objective was by reaching the appropriate product yield and appropriate sugar yield per hectare, to ensure uniform and good quality raw material, and to use the results in practice. We did not try to change an already working cultivation technology, we only tried to complement it. Accordingly, the usual agrotechnical practices have been supplemented by foliar treatment. Materials and methods The experiments have been conducted in Hajdúböszörmény on two cultivation Sites of the Béke Agricultural Cooperation (Site N1) and Hajdúböszörmény Agricultural Rt. (Site N2). The experiment has been conducted in two years, in 2005 and in 2006. The results of the soil analysis are in the Table 1. During the research years sugar beet roots and leaf samples have been taken. Beet root samples have been taken to the laboratory of Eastern Sugar Zrt. in Kaba. One part of the homogeneous beet samples have been stored frozen. These homogeneous pulps have been used similarly to leaf samples, as follows. After labelling them according to the research plot, the leaf samples and the pulp samples have been taken to the accredited laboratory of the University of Debrecen, Institute of Food Science, Quality Assurance and Microbiology. To determine the overall element content of the samples, wet charring was used according to the method of KOVÁCS et al. (1996, 2000). Optima 3300 DV, ICP-OES equipment was used.

Considering the high amount of data, the question arised whether it is worthwile to follow this method. Therefore, being aware from the literature that the petiole of sugar beet acts as a depot of mobile elements, during the statistical evaluation we looked for correlation between the element content of the leaf blade and petiole (Jones, 1967; Wilcox and Coffman, 1972). There was a weak – medium-strong correlation (R2=0,1-0,5 and R2=0,1-0,7) for the Nitrogen and the Potassium content between the leaf blade and the relating petiole, while for Phosphorus, this correlation was medium-strong – strong (R2=0,3-0,8). We found a weak-medium strong correlation (R2=0,1-0,7) for Calcium and medium strongstrong correlation for Strontium (R2=0,4-0,8). The reason for the strong correlation for the latter two elements might be the fact that the mineral composition of Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium fertilizers available for the plants and used in agricultural practice might be more diverse than we think. The composition of chemical fertilizers primarily depends on the place of origin, the processing circumstances, the by-products of production and last but not least the supporting elements given (Sárdy, 2003). Kádár (1991) found that Nitrogen fertilizers,</p><p id="Pg715">VII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Stara Lesna, Slovakia, 2008 1389 besides supplying Nitrogen, can supply Ca and Sr as well. Phosphorus fertilizers might contain Stroncium in percentals due to the high Strontium content of the raw material, raw phosphates. Some of the analysed Potassium fertilizers contained Ca in percentals, and even heavy metals have been detected in trace amounts. Concluding, besides the three major macroelements some others are also supplied, therefore their content in the petiole and the leaf blade is relatively stabil. Considering the correlation of the analysed factors, we concluded that separate sampling of the leaf blade and the petiole is suggested. The research work of the last decades revealed that it is not enough to analyse the soil, but also the soil-plant system has to be studied to satisfy the nutrient supply of a given plant culture. The results of the plant analysis have been compared to the data of the Institute of Plant Nutrition in Jena (Elek és Kádár, 1980), allowing for the evaluation of the nutritional state of a given plant culture. Their results refer to young leaf blade without the petiole, and the sampling period was the end of June, beginning of July, i. e. the period of row closure. The following table shows the calculated and estimated optimum level .These limit value has been compared to the element content of our samples from the same period, i. e. the leaf samples of the 1st sampling. We found that the measured values of plant analysis range in the satisfying intervall for almost every elements. There was no extremely low or high amount found for the analysed elements. Knowing the limit values of the plant analysis of samples from 2-2 Sites in a year, and the element content of the leaf blade, petiole and beet pulp, we looked for further correlations between the concentration of a given element or element group at a given time period and that of yield, harvesting quality (sugar content, Potassium, Natrium and alpha amino Nitrogen content) and the gross and net sugar yield per hectare. The statistical analysis was stepwise regression analysis, allowing for the examination of dependent variable caused by the independent variables. The dependent variable are root yield, sugar yield, and the quality parameters mentioned above, the independent variables are the parameters of the analyis of the petiole, leaf blade and sugar beet pulp. Considering the two research years and the two-two Sites, we could not draw an obvious conclusion regarding the sequence of the analysed variable. Thus, our assumption whether there is an element or a sequence of elements that would determine the major quality parameters already in the growing season, was not statistically proved. However, we have taken into consideration that the evaluation included all the six treatments with the replications. Thus, we concluded that the effects of the different treatments might bias the final results. Therefore, by means of the statistical method mentioned above, we examined the replications of the control plots as well. Again, we could not draw an obvious conclusion regarding the individual elements and the harvested yield, quality and quantity of sugar. Summarizing, we found that the knowledge of elements allows for the estimation of the limit values of plant analysis (similarly to the limit values of the Institute of Plant Nutrition in Jena) and evaluation of the culture already at the first sampling.

Cereal Research Communications 1390 Conclusions The results of the leaf analysis made possible the estimation of the nutrient supply of the plant, by comparing them to the limit values of the analysis. We did not find statistically proved answer for the question whether the concentration of leaf blead samples measured at a given time in the growing season can indicate the state of the main quality parameters at harvesting time (sugar content, Potassium, Natrium, alfa amino Nitrogen, and gross and net sugar content).The used statistical method did not show statistically proved correlation between the element content of beet pulp samples and the parameters determining the product yield and quality at harvesting time.

Research work was conducted on 14 winter wheat genotypes and four testing locations. On each location genotypes were sown in two sowing rates – 330 and 600 germinable seeds m -2 . Statistical analysis showed that genotypes, locations, sowing rates and genotype x environment interaction had highly significant (p≤0.01) influence on hectolitre weight. Two genotypes – Divana and Lucija – were identified as stabile genotypes with high hectolitre weight. Keywords: winter wheat, hectolitre weight, stability, testing environments, soil type Introduction Selection of stabile genotype with broad adaptation to various environments is one of the main goals in winter wheat breeding. Genotype x environment interaction (GEI) hinders selection of the best genotypes due to confounding results for the genetic differences between wheat genotypes. Therefore, much attention has been made to analysing GEI (Haile et al. 2007; Gunjača et al., 2007; Thomason and Philips, 2006; Mardeh et al., 2006; Hoffman et al., 2005; Pepo and Györi, 2005; Yan et al., 2002). Wheat breeders try to select genotypes responsive to favourable environments for grain yield and other important wheat traits (Fufa et al., 2005). Therefore, strategy for selection is that selection should be made on several locations and testing sites (Rodriguez-Perez et al., 2005). Locations should have variable agroecological conditions because wheat genotypes are influenced by the environmental (Drezner et al. 2007) and soil (Birkás et al., 2006) conditions. Beside yield, wheat quality is also very important trait influenced by environment (Bede et al., 2007; Szabó and Pepó, 2007). In breeding for quality, according to Yan et al. (2005), advanced lines are usually tested through multi-location trials to identify potential cultivars for production. The reason is that most quality traits are controlled by at least several genes and are heavily affected by the growing environment. One of the traits that can be used as an indicator of high yield and quality is hectolitre weight. Hectolitre weight is a quality parameter and high hectolitre weigh usually means good wheat quality. On the other hand, hectolitre weight is in a positive correlation with yield, and therefore high hectolitre weight is an indicator of possible high yield (De Vita et al., 2006; El-Khayat et al., 2006; Yan et al. 2005). Therefore the aim of this study was to examine influence of different testing environments and sowing rates on wheat hectolitre weight and to identify most stabile genotypes and locations. Materials and methods Research work was conducted during 2006/07 growing season on four test locations with four different soil types: Nova Gradiška – fluvisol; Osijek – eutric cambisol; Požega – pseudogley; Tovarnik – chernozem. Research work included 14 winter wheat</p><p id="Pg718">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1392 genotypes (Table 1) where genotype Žitarka was a standard. Genotypes were chosen due to their high yielding performance and good quality. The examined genotypes were sowed with two sowing rates: 330 and 600 germinable seeds m-2. The experimental design was a randomised block design with four repetitions for each genotype and sowing rate. Therefore, for each location experiment consisted of 112 plots with the basic plot of 7.56 m2. Common agricultural practice for winter wheat in east Croatia was used. Plots were harvested separately and hectolitre weight was estimated for each plot. Combined analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out for estimation of genotypes, locations and sowing rates effects on hectolitre weight using the SAS GLM procedure SAS software 9.1 (2003). Stability estimates for locations and genotypes were performed with Additive Main Effects and Multiplicative Interaction Analysis model (AMMI) using the CropStat software Ver. 7.2. To graphically explain GEI and stability of genotypes and locations AMMI model 1 biplot was used where the IPCA 1 scores were plotted against mean hectolitre weight (Figure 1). Results and discussion Mean values of hectolitre weight for examined genotypes over all locations, main values for the examined locations and IPCA scores are presented in Table 1. The highest hectolitre weight was achieved with genotype Lucija (82.31 kg), on the second place was Divana (81.56 kg). These results are expected since Divana and Lucija have very good quality combined with high kernel yield. Regarding locations the highest hectolitre weight was achieved at location Tovarnik with sowing rate 600 germinable seeds m-2. On the second place was also Tovarnik with lower sowing rate. This is also expected since location Tovarnik has the best soil type among tested locations. Environmental factors were relatively the same for all locations in vegetation year, characterised with above the average temperatures during winter (2006/07) and with drought during June and July 2007.

When looking at the environments high yielding environments were Tovarnik (D/R, D/G) and Osijek (B/R, B/G). Low yielding environment was Požega. This is expected due to the differences especially in soil type. Tovarnik (chernozem) and Osijek (eutric cambisol) have more fertile soils that Požega (pseudogley). Differences between tested locations were also reported by Yan et al. (2005), Thomason and Philips (2006) and Marić et al. (2007). Figure 1. AMMI 1 model biplot for hectolitre weight of 14 winter wheat genotypes in eight environments</p><p id="Pg720">Vol. 36, 2008, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 1394 Lower density showed more stability on more fertile soils (Tovarnik and Osijek); wile higher density were more stabile on less fertile soils (Požega and Nova Gradiška). Most stabile genotypes with the highest hectolitre weight were Divana and Lucija. Žitarka, Sana and OSK 63/05 were also stabile genotypes, but with lower hectolitre weight than Divana and Lucija. Most unstable genotype was OSK 67/05 adapted to lower yielding environments. Genotypes Alka and Aida are adapted to higher yielding environments. Conclusions Research results showed that selection for high quality and yield in winter wheat should be conducted through multi-location trials. Tested environments had high influence on hectolitre weight. They range from lower yielding to high yielding what is very good for selection of stabile wheat genotypes. High yielding environments were Tovarnik and Osijek. The most stabile genotypes with high hectolitre weight were Divana and Lucija. References Bede, M. – Petrovic, S. – Bede, Z. – Rukavina, I. 2007.
