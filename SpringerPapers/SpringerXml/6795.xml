As MIMS can distinguish between ions of very similar mass, such as <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N<sup>-</sup> and <sup>13</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup>, it enables the precise and reproducible measurement of isotope ratios, and thus of the levels of enrichment in specific isotopic labels, within volumes of less than a cubic micrometer. The sensitivity of MIMS is at least 1,000 times that of <sup>14</sup>C autoradiography. The depth resolution can be smaller than 1 nm because only a few atomic layers are needed to create an atomic mass image. We illustrate the use of MIMS to image unlabeled mammalian cultured cells and tissue sections; to analyze fatty-acid transport in adipocyte lipid droplets using <sup>13</sup>C-oleic acid; to examine nitrogen fixation in bacteria using <sup>15</sup>N gaseous nitrogen; to measure levels of protein renewal in the cochlea and in post-ischemic kidney cells using <sup>15</sup>N-leucine; to study DNA and RNA co-distribution and uridine incorporation in the nucleolus using <sup>15</sup>N-uridine and <sup>81</sup>Br of bromodeoxyuridine or <sup>14</sup>C-thymidine;

These seminal studies could not be pursued at the subcellular level because there was no methodology to simultaneously image and quantitate a stable isotope and because there is no meaningful radioactive isotope of nitrogen. Imaging of stable-isotope distribution has been possible, however, since the development of mass filtered emission ion microscopy using secondary ions by Castaing and Slodzian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], which is part of the technique later named secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). With this technique, a beam of ions (the primary-ion beam) is used as a probe to sputter the surface atomic layers of the sample into atoms or atomic clusters, a small fraction of which are ionized (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These secondary ions, which are characteristic of the composition of the region analyzed, can be manipulated with ion optics just as visible light can be with glass lenses and prisms. In a SIMS instrument, the secondary ions are separated according to mass and then used to measure a secondary-ion current or to create a quantitative atomic mass image of the analyzed surface. SIMS has become a major tool in semiconductor and surface-science studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], geochemistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], the characterization of organic material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and cosmochemistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The principle of secondary-ion mass spectrometry.

To make secondary-ion methodology practicable for locating and measuring isotope tags in subcellular volumes, four major issues need to be addressed. First, to produce quantitative ultrastructural images, the technique must have sufficiently high spatial resolution, and quantitation and imaging must be associated. Second, because the quantitation of label involves measuring the excess of an isotope tag above its natural occurrence, and this excess is calculated by the ratio of two isotopes, the data from the two isotopes should be recorded simultaneously, in parallel, and from exactly the same region of the sample (that is, in register). This is to ensure that changes in instrument or sample conditions do not lead to errors in the calculated isotope ratios. Third, because nitrogen has an electron affinity of zero, N<sup>-</sup> ions do not form; nitrogen must therefore be detected as cyanide ions (CN<sup>-</sup>). Consequently, in order to use the stable isotope <sup>15</sup>N as a label, the mass resolution of the instrument needs to be high enough to separate the ions <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N<sup>-</sup> and <sup>13</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup>, which have the same mass number of 27, but do not have exactly the same atomic mass weight: differing by 0.00632 mass unit, less than 1 part in 4,000. Finally, the high mass resolution should not be at the expense of the secondary-ion current; the transmission of secondary ions from sample to detector needs to be high enough to allow data collection from sub-cubic-micrometer volumes and in a reasonable amount of time.</p><p>These four requirements necessitate a previously unattainable combination of instrumental capabilities, with the ability to collect large numbers of secondary ions at high mass resolution, parallel detection of several secondary ions, high lateral resolution, and high precision of measurements. A new generation of secondary-ion mass spectrometer has now been developed that can measure several ion masses in parallel, has a high mass resolution (mass/change in mass ratio of approximately 10,000) at high secondary-ion relative transmission (70–80%), and has a high lateral resolution, down to 33 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In this paper we present some biological applications of this new technology. These extraordinary capabilities allow us, for example, to image and measure in parallel the intracellular distribution of molecules labeled with the stable isotopes <sup>15</sup>N or <sup>13</sup>C because we can separate the isobaric species (that is, the species with the same atomic masses): <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N<sup>-</sup> from <sup>13</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> or <sup>13</sup>C<sup>-</sup> from <sup>12</sup>C<sup>1</sup>H<sup>-</sup>. Because the images are produced in parallel from the same sputtered volume they are in exact register with each other and these characteristics are necessary for obtaining quantitative atomic mass images. A quantitative mass image contains at each pixel a number of counts, which are a measure of the selected atomic mass and are directly proportional to the selected atomic mass abundance in the sample, at a location corresponding to the pixel address. Counts from several atomic masses, originating from the same location in the sample, can be recorded in parallel at the same pixel address, which allows us to derive meaningful isotope ratios. Isotope ratios are at the core of the methodology. When the sample has been labeled with a given isotope, a ratio higher than its natural abundance indicates the presence of the marker isotope at a particular location as well as measuring its relative excess. In addition, the high stabilities of the primary beam, the ion optics, the mass spectrometer and the detectors contribute to very precise measurements.</p><p>We have developed the use of this new generation of SIMS, together with tracer methods and quantitative image-analysis software, for locating and measuring molecules labeled with stable isotopes in subcellular compartments, a development that we call multi-isotope imaging mass spectrometry (MIMS). In this paper we present a range of examples showing how MIMS can be used to provide atomic mass images of biological specimens, and how in combination with stable isotope labeling it provides qualitative and quantitative information that is not possible to obtain with other methods.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Imaging of unlabeled cells and tissue sections</title><p>One qualitative application of MIMS is high-resolution imaging. Detailed anatomical images can be obtained from unstained, unlabeled samples using the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> secondary ion, as shown by the analysis of a section through mouse cochlea (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a–c</xref>). A fixed, unstained section mounted on silicon was first examined using reflection differential interference contrast (RDIC) microscopy (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) to select regions of interest that can be retrieved after the sample is hidden inside the SIMS instrument. The mass image of the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> ions sputtered from a 80-μm field corresponding to the boxed area in Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> is shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, and the mass image of the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> ions sputtered from a 20-μm subfield of Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> is shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>. The contrast of these mass images provides a very detailed view of the cochlear structures. Only a few atomic layers of the surface of the sample are sputtered using the standard analytical conditions (see Discussion and [Additional data file 1]). Thus, although the method is nominally destructive, we can analyze the same field repetitively, up to a total of tens of hours or hundreds of scans, without observing gross morphological alterations (data not shown). A large area can be imaged relatively quickly in order to select regions of interest for quantitative analysis, as illustrated by the reconstruction of a mouse cochlea shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>. The mass image of <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> ions is made up of ten tiles, acquired over a total of 20 minutes, with each tile acquired over an area of 100 × 100 μm in 2 minutes. All the cochlear structures one would expect to see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] are visible, and are easy to identify by comparing them with conventional histological sections.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Imaging sections and whole cells with MIMS. <bold>(a-c)</bold> A 0.5-μm epon section of a mouse cochlea mounted on silicon.

The various intracellular structures are easy to identify by comparing the image with electron micrographs of the same structure. We estimate that a lateral resolution better than 33 nm can be achieved using a method derived from the 'knife-edge' technique (see [Additional data file 2]). Because the atomic mass image is formed using only a few atomic layers of the sample, the depth resolution (<italic>z</italic> resolution) can be smaller than 1 nm, much better than the resolution that would be provided by an exceptionally thin electron-microscopy section (10 nm). (In this paper, we define depth resolution as the minimum amount of material that needs to be sputtered to obtain an atomic mass image.) Studies of the same sections with both MIMS and electron microscopy – a technique developed for studying cosmic dust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] – may help provide complementary structural observations.</p><p>We do not know from first principles the mechanism of contrast formation in atomic mass images from unstained samples. A striking observation of intense contrast observed with MIMS at mass <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N, shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g–i</xref>, may guide inquiries in this field. We were analyzing a mouse kidney when we observed a brightly contrasted structure, a circular 'snake', along the lining of the lumen of an artery. It is likely that this region is the 'elastica interna' as described in histology texts, a tissue layer that is usually visible only after the arterial tissue has been specially stained (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). The MIMS images of the artery in Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g–i</xref> were obtained without this special staining. The images indicate that this structure produces a high yield of <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> ions in comparison with the other regions of the artery, and suggests a relationship between the image obtained and molecular composition and density.</p><p>MIMS can be used to visualize whole cells as well as sections. These images have a three-dimensional appearance, showing that MIMS can provide scanning atomic or molecular ion mass images of samples with relief, as does scanning electron microscopy. The lamellipodium of a well-spread endothelial cell imaged by MIMS at mass <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N is shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2j</xref>; it appears as a light, sheet-like structure with darker lines radiating from the cytoplasm to the external border of the lamellipodium. In contrast, if actin polymerization is blocked by cytochalasin D treatment, the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N mass image of an endothelial cell shows no lamellipodia but only thin, spike-like projections around the cell circumference, which are most probably retraction fibers (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2k</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, MIMS atomic mass images of CN<sup>-</sup> ions in biological samples are highly contrasted, even though they are obtained without any staining. The various structures are easy to identify down to a lateral resolution of approximately 33 nm, and the depth resolution can be as small as a few atomic layers. The largest single field that can be imaged is approximately 140 × 140 μm, but larger fields can be documented quickly by taking a series of images for 1–2 minutes each. There is no machine-specific requirement for the sample except that a vacuum must be sustained. Because MIMS is a surface-analysis method, one can use many kinds of samples: for example, tissue or cell sections embedded in a medium such as epon, or cells cultured directly on a support that can be brought into the analysis chamber and prepared with any usual histological technique. The thickness of the sample is not critical, provided that the electrical charges deposited can be dissipated. The surface analyzed does not have to be flat, and one can obtain SIMS images of three-dimensional samples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Quantitative labeling with stable isotopes</title><p>Having established that MIMS can be used to obtain atomic mass images of unstained biological objects, this led us to develop the unique feature of MIMS: the quantitative analysis of isotopes within subcellular compartments. We will now discuss how the technique can be used to measure the incorporation of isotopic tracers within compartments of sub-cubic-micrometer volume. To do this, the sample is labeled with stable isotopes such as <sup>15</sup>N or <sup>13</sup>C, which are present at much lower levels naturally than their counterpart <sup>14</sup>N and <sup>12</sup>C isotopes, and each isotope is then measured to determine whether it is present in an amount exceeding its natural abundance. Stable isotope labeling can be used, for example, to pursue the classic studies of Schoenheimer at the subcellular level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>The isotope abundance is measured by recording the secondary-ion currents (counts/time) obtained from a pair of isotopes, for example, <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>12</sup>C, calculating the ratio and then comparing it with their natural abundance ratio. In a control sample, which has not received an excess of the tracer isotope, the counts of each isotope are related to each other by their natural abundance. In other words, there will be a count of <sup>13</sup>C or of <sup>15</sup>N such that <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C = 1.12%, or <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>14</sup>N (measured as <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N/<sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N) = 0.367%, calculated from the values of their respective natural abundance. This means that when measured in parallel, all the analytical conditions being the same, the <sup>15</sup>N (<sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N) count rate will be 272 times lower than the <sup>14</sup>N (<sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N) count rate.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Quantitative labeling with <sup>15</sup>N</title><p>The goal of our first experiments was to ensure that we could measure <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>14</sup>N ratios equivalent to their natural abundance from tiny volumes of untreated control sample. Our first analyses were carried out using a stationary cesium (Cs<sup>+</sup>) primary ion beam. We counted in parallel the secondary ions <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> and <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N<sup>-</sup> emitted from various areas smaller than 1 square micrometer in control samples of mouse tissues. We measured <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N/<sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N isotope ratios in control mouse tissue of 0.366% (standard error (SE) = 0.002, <italic>n</italic> = 12) in the cochlea, 0.368% (SE = 0.001, <italic>n</italic> = 14) in the kidney, and 0.368% (SE = 0.001, <italic>n</italic> = 6) in the intestine. These values are not statistically significantly different from the natural terrestrial value of the <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>14</sup>N isotope ratio, 0.3673% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This proved the feasibility of using this method on biological samples.</p><p>We then showed that we could measure the incorporation of a stable isotope label in an ultra-minute volume of biological material, as done for bulk tissue 60 years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. We fed mice a diet slightly enriched with <sup>15</sup>N-L-leucine for a sufficient length of time (14 days) to result in total protein renewal in kidney and intestine. The <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>14</sup>N isotope ratios determined using a stationary primary ion beam at various areas over the samples were equivalent to the <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>14</sup>N ratio in the diet determined independently by combustion mass spectrometry analysis (intestine 4.45‰, SE = 0.05, <italic>n</italic> = 7; kidney 4.41‰, SE = 0.03, <italic>n</italic> = 12; diet 4.45‰, SE = 0.02, <italic>n</italic> = 7).</p><p>Using this method, only one location can be analyzed at a time and its precise position is difficult to ascertain in the absence of an image. With our instrument, we have developed a much more powerful but more complex method of isotope ratio imaging, where the isotope ratios are calculated from quantitative mass images obtained simultaneously from a set of isotopes. A quantitative mass image, as we call it, is the representation of an analyzed field in which each pixel is the address of a register at which the secondary-ion current of an isotope of interest has been recorded during analysis. Up to four secondary-ion currents, representative of four isotopes, can be recorded simultaneously at each pixel address with our instrument, for example <sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup>, <sup>13</sup>C<sup>-</sup>, <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> and <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N<sup>-</sup>. A quantitative image of 256 × 256 pixels thus represents a set of (256 × 256 × 4) or 262,144 numbers. We call a group of pixel addresses a 'region of interest', and the first step in quantitation is to extract the values of counts/time/isotope from groups of pixels or from individual pixels. This allows us to measure many more regions from a single analytical field than we could do using a stationary beam, and also to associate quantitation and localization among cells and subcellular domains. All the mass imaging in the rest of this paper will refer to quantitative mass imaging.</p><p>We illustrate quantitative mass imaging of <sup>15</sup>N with a study of <sup>15</sup>N-leucine incorporation in the mouse cochlea, a highly organized tissue with several different cell types, and in a subcellular structure of this tissue, the stereocilium, the mechanosensing organelle of hair cells. The secondary-ion mass images of a field of cochlear tissue from a mouse that has been on a <sup>15</sup>N-L-leucine diet for 9 days are shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a–f</xref>. Additional data file 3 describes how the quantitative data are extracted from these images. Mass images of <sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup>, <sup>13</sup>C<sup>-</sup>, <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> and <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N<sup>-</sup> ions were acquired in parallel. The mass image of the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> ion (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>) shows a strikingly detailed histology. <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> ions arise from nitrogen-containing molecules, the most abundant by far being proteins, which make up 18% of the total weight in most cell types, whereas RNA and DNA make up 1.1% and 0.25%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The mass image of the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N<sup>-</sup> ions (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>) is similar in form to the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> image (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>) but has much lower counts; the total number of counts of <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N<sup>-</sup> ions and of <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> ions are 2.02 × 10<sup>5</sup> and 4.52 × 10<sup>7</sup>, respectively (note that the subjective brightness of the images is not directly related to the count rate; see Additional data file 4). The pixel count of the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N<sup>-</sup> image is a measure of both natural <sup>15</sup>N and the supplementary <sup>15</sup>N arising from the metabolism of <sup>15</sup>N-L-leucine in the cochlea. This supplementary <sup>15</sup>N may vary from a minimum of zero to a maximum value equivalent to the <sup>15</sup>N added to the diet. The image of the internal control <sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup> (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>) has a relatively poor contrast compared with the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> image (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>) because a larger fraction of the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup> ions arise from the embedding medium, which has a high and uniform carbon content. The image of the <sup>13</sup>C<sup>-</sup> ions (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>) is similar to the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup> image, but with a much lower count rate; the total number of counts of <sup>13</sup>C<sup>-</sup> and of <sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup> are 2.56 × 10<sup>5</sup> and 2.33 × 10<sup>7</sup>, respectively. The pixel counts of the sample resulting in the <sup>13</sup>C<sup>-</sup> ion image contain a mean of 1.10% of the <sup>12</sup>C counts, corresponding to the natural ratio of <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>MIMS analysis of stereocilia from mice fed <sup>15</sup>N-L-leucine. <bold>(a-f)</bold> Quantitative MIMS images of cochlear hair cells from mice after 9 days on the <sup>15</sup>N-L-leucine diet.

The contrast observed in the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N<sup>-</sup>/<sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> image is due to the excess of <sup>15</sup>N in the area of the cochlea that has incorporated <sup>15</sup>N derived from the <sup>15</sup> N-L-leucine. The internal control <sup>13</sup>C<sup>-</sup>/<sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup> ratio image has no contrast because, in the absence of added <sup>13</sup>C, the value of the ratio is equivalent to the natural ratio in any part of the analyzed field.</p><p>Using the quantitative images and the derived ratio images, and guided by the hue saturation intensity (HSI) transformation (see Materials and methods), we can now calculate a value for <sup>15</sup>N incorporation into the main structures shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a–f</xref>. This can be expressed as percentage renewal by comparing the excess <sup>15</sup>N in the tissue with the excess <sup>15</sup>N in the diet (see Materials and methods). These values represent overall protein renewal among the different cochlear structures, as demonstrated for whole tissue in the classic work of Schoenheimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. After 9 days of a <sup>15</sup>N-L-leucine diet, the incorporation of <sup>15</sup>N is markedly different among specific cell types. The outer hair cells have a <sup>15</sup>N renewal of 52.5% ± 1.8 SD, not significantly different from that of the Deiter cells (47.2% ± 4.8 SD), or of the proximal part of the outer pillar cell above the basilar membrane (46.0% ± 5.7 SD), and of one population of tympanic border cells (48.3% ± 1.5 SD). The basilar membrane has a small <sup>15</sup>N renewal (overall 21.1% ± 6.0 SD), not statistically different from part of the outer pillar cells at the level of the Deiter cells (18.4% ± 3.7 SD). Overall, the reticular lamina has a <sup>15</sup>N renewal of 30.8% ± 8.9 SD, significantly higher than the basilar membrane and the distal outer pillar cells, and significantly lower than that of the outer hair cells. The lone outer hair-cell nucleus observed has a <sup>15</sup>N renewal of 35.5%. Finally, we measured a second population of tympanic border cells with a <sup>15</sup>N renewal significantly greater than in any other area (72.8% ± 2.5 SD). The internal control provided by the epon embedding medium had a <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N/<sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N isotope ratio of 0.365% ± 0.089 SD, equivalent to the natural abundance ratio and corresponding to a <sup>15</sup>N renewal of 0%.</p><p>The unique power of MIMS is demonstrated by the quantitative imaging of subcellular structures at high resolution, revealing sub-cubic-micrometer-sized zones with high <sup>15</sup>N renewal, and thus probably high protein renewal. In addition, the experiment showed that the same sample can be analyzed repetitively at a variety of spatial resolutions. We analyzed one of the bundles of stereocilia (Sb1, indicated by a white arrow in Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>) at high resolution; we used a field of 3 × 3 μm, a beam size of about 35 nm, and 256 × 256 pixels (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g–l</xref>). Mass images of the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup>, <sup>13</sup>C<sup>-</sup>, <sup>12</sup> C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> and <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N<sup>-</sup> ions were acquired in parallel. The <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> image (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>) shows one bundle of stereocilia and a fraction of the cuticular plate of one hair cell, barely visible in the lower-resolution image in Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>.</p><p>As in the cochlear analysis, but at a subcellular level, the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N<sup>-</sup> image (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3h</xref>) is similar in form to the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> image (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>) but has much lower counts; the total number of counts of <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N<sup>-</sup> and of <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> are 8.36 × 10<sup>4</sup> and 1.61 × 10<sup>7</sup>, respectively. The <sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup> image (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3j</xref>) has relatively poor contrast compared with the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> image (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>), as most of the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup> ions arise from the embedding medium. The <sup>13</sup>C<sup>-</sup> image (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3k</xref>) is similar to the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup> image, but with a much lower count; the total number of counts for <sup>13</sup>C<sup>-</sup> and <sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup> are 4.80 × 10<sup>5</sup> and 4.36 × 10<sup>7</sup>, respectively. The pixel counts from the <sup>13</sup>C<sup>-</sup> image include the fraction of <sup>13</sup>C related to the <sup>12</sup>C content by the natural ratio of <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C.

The contrast observed in the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N<sup>-</sup>/<sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> image is due to the excess of <sup>15</sup>N in the stereocilia, cuticular plate, and hair-cell areas that have incorporated <sup>15</sup>N derived from the <sup>15</sup>N-L-leucine. The internal control <sup>13</sup>C<sup>-</sup>/<sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup> ratio image (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3l</xref>) has no contrast, as in Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>.</p><p>An HSI transformation of the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N<sup>-</sup>/<sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> ratio image of the stereocilia bundle in Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3i</xref> is shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3m</xref>.

We measured high <sup>15</sup>N renewal in areas α to ζ (79.4% ± 12.7 SE, <italic>n</italic> = 5), whereas at 200 nm away the <sup>15</sup>N renewal in stereocilia was very low (4.6% ± 1.27 SE, <italic>n</italic> = 5). Finally, MIMS allowed us to estimate from the relative counting of mass <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N in areas α to ζ and in stereocilia that the above values may have been produced by objects about 5 nm wide (see also Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5k</xref> below in the section entitled 'Quantitative labeling of prokaryotic with gaseous <sup>15</sup>N). The overall mean values of <sup>15</sup>N renewal in structures between stereocilia, found with HSI, and in adjacent stereocilium cores are shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3n</xref>. After 9 days on the <sup>15</sup>N-L-leucine diet, the mean <sup>15</sup>N incorporation into the inter-stereocilia structures was 78.6% ± 10.1 SE (<italic>n</italic> = 7). In the adjacent stereocilium core (200 nm away), the <sup>15</sup>N incorporation was 7.1% ± 2.1 SE (<italic>n</italic> = 7). After 22 days on the <sup>15</sup>N-L-leucine diet, the incorporation of <sup>15</sup>N into the inter-stereocilia structures was 100% of its content in the diet, and in the adjacent stereocilium cores, <sup>15</sup>N incorporation was 20.9% ± 3.8 SE (<italic>n</italic> = 4).

Autoradiography cannot provide quantitative information on accumulation of FFAs in intracellular fat droplets, and fluorescently labeled FFAs may not accurately reflect the transport and metabolism of native FFAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. As a result, the mechanism that transports FFAs across a cell membrane remains uncertain (for recent reviews see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]). Using quantitative mass imaging with MIMS we have directly studied the accumulation of <sup>13</sup>C in cultured adipocytes incubated with <sup>13</sup>C-labeled oleic acid (<sup>13</sup>C-OA; see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] for further details). We measured a high level of <sup>13</sup>C accumulation in intracellular lipid droplets.

The relative excess of <sup>13</sup>C was measured at three different locations: outside the cell, inside the cell but outside the lipid droplets, and inside the lipid droplets.</p><p>The quantitative mass images of an adipocyte exposed to <sup>13</sup>C-OA for 20 minutes are shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a–i</xref>.

Images of the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup> and <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> ions (Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a,d</xref>) show the cell histology. The mass image of the <sup>13</sup>C<sup>-</sup> ion (Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>) is similar to the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup> ion image (Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>) in form, but has a lower count rate. The pixel counts of the <sup>13</sup>C<sup>-</sup> image include both the natural <sup>13</sup>C and the supplementary <sup>13</sup>C from the <sup>13</sup>C-OA transported into the cell. This supplementary <sup>13</sup>C is at a maximum at the intracellular lipid droplets, where FFAs accumulate. The mass image of the internal control <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N<sup>-</sup> ions (Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>) is similar to the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> mass image, yet with a much lower count rate. Each pixel of the sample resulting in the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N<sup>-</sup> image contains the fraction of <sup>15</sup>N related to the <sup>14</sup>N content by the natural ratio of <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>14</sup>N. The enhanced contrast observed in the <sup>13</sup>C<sup>-</sup>/<sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup> image (Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>) is due to the excess <sup>13</sup>C incorporated into the lipid droplets from the transported <sup>13</sup>C-OA. The internal control <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N<sup>-</sup>/<sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> ratio image (Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>) has no contrast because in the absence of added <sup>15</sup>N, the value of the ratio of <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>14</sup>N is equivalent to the natural ratio across the analyzed field.</p><p>The HSI image of the <sup>13</sup>C<sup>-</sup>/<sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup> ratio is shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>, and the same cell photographed by RDIC microscopy on the silicon chip before analysis with MIMS is shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h</xref>. The <sup>13</sup>C<sup>-</sup>/<sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup> ratio, indirectly measured as the cyanide ion, <sup>13</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup>/<sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup>, is shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4i</xref>; this also shows accumulation of <sup>13</sup>C<sup>-</sup> in the droplets. In contrast to the high <sup>13</sup>C<sup>-</sup>/<sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup> ratios found in cells that were incubated with <sup>13</sup>C-OA, cells washed with buffer solution after <sup>13</sup>C-OA incubation had low <sup>13</sup>C<sup>-</sup>/<sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup> ratios (images not shown). In cells not treated with <sup>13</sup>C-OA, the value of the <sup>13</sup>C<sup>-</sup>/<sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup> ratio measured under the same conditions was 1.15 ± 0.10%, not significantly different from the terrestrial <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C value of 1.12%. An indication of the accuracy of these values was obtained from measurements of the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N<sup>-</sup>/<sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> ratio, whose value was 0.36 ± 0.01% in both washed and unwashed cells, in excellent agreement with the natural abundance of 0.37%. The cumulative values obtained from quantitative MIMS atomic mass images and extracted from the isotope ratio images are shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4k</xref>.</p><p>We can remove material quickly from the sample surface in order to study a variety of depths within the cell. We refer to this as 'shaving' the sample. It is accomplished in conditions that give a high primary-ion beam current (such as by removing the objective diaphragm; see Figure 13 in the Discussion section). The results of such shaving are shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4j</xref>. The adipocyte analyzed in Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a–i</xref> was shaved using, for a few minutes, a primary beam current approximately 1,000-fold more intense than for the previous analysis. This uncovered a lipid droplet deeper in the cell with a very high <sup>13</sup>C<sup>-</sup>/<sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup> ratio, as shown in the HSI image (Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4j</xref>). Finally, MIMS allows us to acquire hundreds of atomic mass image planes successively from the same cell, opening the door to full three-dimensional volume rendering. We have begun using this capability to study the distribution of <sup>13</sup>C among the lipid droplets located within a single adipocyte after incubation with <sup>13</sup>C-OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In conclusion, MIMS can be used to investigate lipid metabolism with high spatial and quantitative resolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Unlike other techniques, MIMS allows us to trace and to measure the movement of native FFAs at specific subcellular locations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Quantitative labeling of prokaryotic cells with gaseous <sup>15</sup>N</title><p>The ability to image and measure stable isotopes makes it easy and safe to apply MIMS to samples labeled with a gaseous precursor.

Mass images of the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup>, <sup>13</sup>C<sup>-</sup>, <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> and <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N<sup>-</sup> ions were acquired in parallel. <italic>T. turnerae</italic> is barely visible at mass <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> (Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>) but is seen as intensely labeled at mass <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N<sup>-</sup> (Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>) because it has used gaseous <sup>15</sup>N to build its molecular constituents. By contrast, <italic>E. faecalis</italic> is visible at mass <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> (Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>) but not at mass <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N<sup>-</sup> (Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>) because it does not use gaseous nitrogen and therefore has not incorporated <sup>15</sup>N above the natural ratio. The HSI image of the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N<sup>-</sup>/<sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> ratio (Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>) shows <italic>E. faecalis</italic> with an isotope ratio equivalent to the natural isotope ratio (blue) and <italic>T. turnerae</italic>, which has incorporated an enormous quantity of <sup>15</sup>N, with an isotope ratio at least 100 times higher (magenta).</p><p>MIMS can also be used to study the distribution of isotope tag incorporation within a bacterial population. The heterogeneity of nitrogen fixation among a population of <italic>T. turnerae</italic> is shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>, where the same field cultured for 32 hours in a <sup>15</sup>N atmosphere is shown as a series of HSI <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N<sup>-</sup>/<sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> ratio images. The different HSI panels reveal the level of <sup>15</sup>N incorporation in bacteria using a compressed color scale as described in the legend to Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. This analysis reveals the location and the distribution of ratio values, in other words of nitrogen fixation, among the bacteria within the analyzed field. Large differences in the amounts of <sup>15</sup>N incorporation by <italic>T. turnerae</italic> cultured for 96 hours in a <sup>15</sup>N atmosphere are demonstrated by the HSI images of the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N<sup>-</sup>/<sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> ratio (Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e,f</xref>). Differences are visible among a few bacteria in contact with each other (Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>) and even within a single bacterium (Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>).</p><p>MIMS can detect and measure the function of intracellular bacteria within eukaryotic cells. This is shown by the quantitative imaging of the incorporation of <sup>15</sup>N in <italic>T. turnerae</italic> living in the gill bacteriocytes of a shipworm (<italic>Lyrodus pedicellatus</italic>) raised under a <sup>15</sup>N atmosphere, as shown in the HSI image of the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N<sup>-</sup>/<sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> ratio (Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5g</xref>). The bacteria in the bacteriocytes that have incorporated <sup>15</sup>N are shown in colors between yellow and magenta (the shipworm tissue is blue). An internal control is the isotope ratio <sup>13</sup>C<sup>-</sup>/<sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup> of the same field (Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5h</xref>), which shows a lack of contrast. The uniformity of the carbon ratio image eliminates the possibility of artifacts in the nitrogen ratio image as a result of morphologically or instrumentally induced isotope fractionation.</p><p>These quantitative images show that the MIMS method will be a powerful tool in the investigation of nitrogen fixation. It can also be used to study bacteria in natural environments and to explore the activity of diazotrophic symbionts in the tissues of plants and animals. It is worth noting that the size of an object can be estimated directly from the pixel signal intensity. This is illustrated with the flagellum visible on one <italic>T. turnerae</italic> cell (Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5i</xref>). For example, at mass <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N (Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5j</xref>), we have a mean of 1,473 counts per pixel on the bacterium (Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5k</xref>, inset, red box). A line profile of the counts per pixel across the flagellum of <italic>T. turnerae</italic> at mass <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N is shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5k</xref>. The pixel crossed by the flagellum registered 66 counts. All conditions being approximately the same, the number of counts is proportional to the surface area of the material sampled in one pixel. In this particular image of 60 × 60 μm, 256 × 256 pixels, one pixel is equivalent to 234 nm covering an area of 54,756 nm<sup>2</sup>. If the length of the flagellum crosses a pixel, 66 counts would represent a width of (54,756 nm<sup>2</sup>/1,473 counts) × (66 counts/234 nm) = 10.5 nm; using the count values for the same pixels at mass <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N, the estimate is 10.6 nm, which is approximately the diameter of a <italic>T. turnerae</italic> flagellum.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Use of double labeling with bromodeoxyuridine and <sup>15</sup>N-leucine to measure protein renewal</title><p>Because MIMS analysis sputters only a few atomic layers, a sample can be reanalyzed many times. This is illustrated by double-labeling studies of protein renewal and DNA replication in the mouse kidney after ischemia. We have previously shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] in the mouse that 30 minutes of bilateral renal ischemia, resulting in significant increases of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, leads to protection of the mouse kidney against a subsequent ischemic insult 8 or 15 days later, even when the second ischemic period is extended to 35 minutes. Graded levels of time of initial ischemia resulted in graded levels of protection 8 days later. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and <sup>15</sup>N-leucine were administered to mice subsequent to the first ischemia, in order to characterize the different response in cell proliferation in preconditioned and non-preconditioned kidneys exposed to ischemia on day 8 after the initial surgery. Quantitative MIMS images were recorded from thin sections of epon-embedded kidneys. The images were acquired in parallel at mass <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N to show a morphological overview, at mass <sup>31</sup>P to view the cell nuclei and at mass <sup>81</sup>Br to identify the nuclei undergoing DNA replication, as shown by BrdU incorporation. Protein renewal was calculated from parallel imaging at mass <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N and mass <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N.</p><p>A first MIMS analysis of a 100 × 100 μm field for 2 minutes, as shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a,b</xref>, reveals that one nucleus (in the <sup>81</sup>Br<sup>-</sup> image in Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>) has replicated its DNA, whereas the others have not. A second MIMS analysis at higher resolution of cells around this replicating nucleus is shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c–e</xref>. The replicating nucleus is seen in the <sup>81</sup>Br<sup>-</sup> mass image (Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>), and the <sup>31</sup>P<sup>-</sup> image (Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>) shows the presence of two other nuclei that did not replicate. A third MIMS analysis was performed on the same field at masses <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N (Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6f</xref>) and <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N (Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6g</xref>) to quantitate the protein renewal and compare renewal between replicating and non-replicating cells.

A lateral resolution that reaches 33 nm, in theory, and a high mass resolution (a mass/change in mass ratio of approximately 10,000) at high secondary-ion transmission (70–80%) allows us to image and quantitate molecules labeled with stable (or radioactive) isotopes within subcellular compartments. The high mass resolution allows us to distinguish the distribution of isobaric atomic species.

In the ejection process, some of them will be spontaneously ionized; these secondary ions are characteristic of the composition of the target area (see Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). After separating the secondary ions according to their masses, an image of the surface composition in respect of a selected mass can be recorded. We used a new generation of SIMS instrument that can detect several secondary ions at once; this and several other advances detailed below represent major improvements over previous generations of SIMS. The machine is the prototype of the NanoSims50 built at ONERA (Office National d'Études et de Recherches Aérospatiales) jointly with UPS (Université Paris-Sud) and upgraded by Cameca, Courbevoie, France, and is shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>.<fig id="Fig13"><label>Figure 13</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Diagram of the prototype NanoSims50 used in MIMS. The main components of the instrument include: the primary column (PC) with a cesium primary-ion source (IS) used to sputter the surface of the sample and to enhance the yield of negative secondary ions and a series of lenses (L0, L1, L2 and L3) to shape the primary beam; the objective column (OC), where the same ion optic is used in a coaxial manner both to focus the primary beam on the sample (S) and to collect the secondary ions (the primary-ion beam is focused on the sample with the objective lens (EOP) and aperture limited with the diaphragm (D1), the secondary ions are collected with the secondary-ion focusing lens (EOS)); the secondary column (SC) where the secondary-ion beam is shaped to match the acceptance of the spectrometer (the secondary column contains an entrance slit (ES), a corrector (CY) and deflectors (P2 and P3) to center the secondary-ion beam in the entrance slit); an aperture slit (AS) to reduce the angular aberration of the secondary-ion beam; and the mass spectrometer, made up of the association of an electrostatic prism (EP) and a magnetic prism (MP), which enables the focusing of the secondary ions as narrow lines along the focal plane (FP) of the magnet. Chromatic aberrations are minimized with the quadrupole (Q) and the slit lens (LF4). Energy aberration is reduced with the energy slit (WS). The transmission at high mass resolution is improved by correcting the main second-order aperture aberrations with the hexapole (HX) placed in front of the electrostatic prism, tilting the entry and exit faces of the magnetic prism, and focusing in the vertical section using additional lenses placed between the electrostatic and magnetic prisms. The deflectors (C4) help to center the masses in the detectors. In the multi-collection chamber (MC), four detectors can be moved along the focal plane. Each detector is made up of deflection plates (DP) followed by a selection slit (SS) and a miniature electron multiplier (EM). The deflection plates, which permit scanning of a small portion of the spectrum, greatly improve the final tuning of mass lines. This instrument provides both parallel detection and high mass resolution with little sacrifice in secondary-ion transmission from sample to detector. As a particularly striking example, in Figure 15, the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup> secondary ions were detected at 90% relative transmission with a mass resolution of 1 part in 11,825.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13061_2006_Article_79_Fig13_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>The objective column (OC) in the new SIMS instrument (see Figure <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>), where the primary ions and secondary ions share the same path but in opposite directions, is a big step forward. It allows for a very short focal length for the ion-beam focusing lens (EOP) and for the secondary ion extracting lens (EOS) leading to a significant reduction in various aberrations. In addition, the incidence of the coaxial primary-ion and secondary-ion beams normal to each other allows us to reduce the geometrical dimensions of the instrument, leading to a significant reduction in various aberrations. The improvement rests on using the same lens for focusing the primary-ion beam, and for collecting the secondary ions that are formed. Secondary ions are emitted at a wide range of angles and energies. To collect them efficiently a strong electrostatic accelerating field is needed near the sample surface to gather their trajectories close to the surface normal. The conjugate action of the immersion lens and other lenses in the secondary optical column gives the secondary ion beam springing from the primary ion probe impact area the appropriate shape for matching the acceptance of the mass spectrometer tuned for high mass resolution. It should be emphasized that getting high mass resolution and high collection efficiency together is possible because the impact area of the primary-ion beam is very small (less than 0.1 μm<sup>2</sup>). This allows us to keep the beam small during its transport from the sample to the entrance of the spectrometer. From the general laws of optics, however, we can do this only for one position of the beam on the surface. As soon as the primary-ion beam moves, the secondary-ion beam emitted from the impact area is displaced as a whole in front of the spectrometer and a variable fraction of the beam (or no beam at all), depending upon the amplitude of the motion, enters the spectrometer.</p><p>To solve this problem, the machine uses an operation mode called 'dynamic transfer' to keep the secondary-ion beam stationary at the entrance of the spectrometer while the probe scans the surface. Dynamic transfer is achieved by the set of deviation plates, which move in synchrony with the scanning primary-ion beam. Because of the coaxial layout, those plates move both secondary and primary beams, but whereas they act on the secondary beam to align it along the optical axis, they act on the primary beam to make it rotate about the center of the aperture stop (see D1, Figure <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>), which limits aperture aberrations on the probe. As a result, not only does the secondary beam stay stationary, which ensures a constant collection efficiency over the scanned area, but the intensity of the primary beam remains constant during the scanning; both of these avoid the 'vignetting', which is a gradual darkening of the corners of the ion images as the size of the field of view increases.</p><p>High mass resolution is obtained because the initial energy of ion spread has been cancelled at the level of the mass lines by coupling the electrostatic and magnetic prisms via a quadrupole lens. In addition, the elaborate ion optics allows the substantial reduction of second-order aperture aberrations, which improves the mass-resolving power (for example, at mass 27 the separation of <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N from <sup>13</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N). This results from both the suppression of second-order aperture aberrations of the magnetic prism by tilting the entrance face of the magnetic prism, and the reduction of second-order aberrations of the electrostatic prism by placing a hexapole in front of the electrostatic prism (see Figure <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>).</p><p>The mass spectrum of the secondary ions is displayed along the focal plane as a set of well-resolved mass lines. It is a discrete spectrum with wider spacing between ions separated by 1 mass unit and closer spacing when multiplets (isobaric species) occur. Because of the limited size of the magnet, however, the whole spectrum cannot be displayed at once. The ratio between the lower and the higher masses in the displayed range is about 20. By changing the strength of the magnetic field it is possible to choose the lower mass and, in consequence, the higher one. For instance, if 12 is the lower mass unit, the spectrum is displayed up to mass number 240.</p><p>Mass selection for discriminating the secondary ions is provided by individual detector 'trolleys' in the mass spectrometer, each containing a set of deflection plates followed by a selection slit and an electron multiplier (see Figure <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>), which are moved along the focal plane to the appropriate positions corresponding to the masses of interest. The positions depend on the kinetic energy of the secondary ions and the magnetic field strength of the mass spectrometer. For example, in the analytical run shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>, one trolley was positioned for detecting atomic mass 12, a second for mass 13, a third for mass 26, and a fourth for mass 27. As stated earlier, the ability to detect several masses simultaneously at high mass resolution is novel, and is essential to derive meaningful isotope ratios from a sub-cubic-micrometer sample volume. Thus, in the example shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>, it is necessary to distinguish at mass number 27 between <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N<sup>-</sup> and <sup>13</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup>. This last level of mass selection is conveniently obtained by operating the deflection plates in front of the selection slit.<fig id="Fig14"><label>Figure 14</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Parallel quantitative mass imaging with MIMS, using a cochlear field as an example.

By setting the voltages appropriately it is possible to scan finely the multiplet of the already highly resolved mass lines and to determine which voltage is suitable for isolating the mass of interest, practically eliminating any spillover from neighboring mass peaks. It should be noted that the width of the mass selection slit is larger than the mass line itself. This configuration allows us to make precise isotopic measurements because it allows for small drifts of the mass line that can result from uncontrolled instrumental factors. As a consequence, the mass line appears in the recordings as a peak with a flat top (Figure <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">15</xref>). Two adjacent mass lines can be completely separated and appear in the recording with no valley between them (Figure <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">15b–d</xref> and Additional data file 6). It can be seen from Figure <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">15b–d</xref> that different isobars with very similar masses can be distinguished, such as <sup>13</sup>C<sup>-</sup> and <sup>12</sup>C<sup>1</sup>H<sup>-</sup> (mass 13.003355 and mass 13.007825, respectively; Figure <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">15b</xref>); <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> and <sup>1</sup>H<sup>12</sup>C<sup>13</sup>C<sup>-</sup> (mass 26.003074 and mass 26.011180, respectively; Figure <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">15c</xref>); <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N<sup>-</sup>, <sup>13</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> and <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>1</sup>H<sup>-</sup> (mass 27.000109, mass 27.006429 and mass 27.010899, respectively; Figure <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">15d</xref>).<fig id="Fig15"><label>Figure 15</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>High-resolution mass spectra illustrate the resolving power of our prototype NanoSims instrument.

Pulse heights depend upon the ion-electron conversion yield on the first dynode and upon the voltages applied on other dynodes. Pulse heights have a distribution that can be stretched by changing the high voltage. The distribution is usually depleted on the low-amplitude side, where one must account for the superposition with low-amplitude pulses from the electronic noise. A pulse-height discriminator eliminates low-amplitude contributions so as to select only signal pulses. Of course, a fraction of the signal is suppressed in that process, but this fraction is quite small, for example a few percent for CN<sup>-</sup>. The secondary-ion detection efficiency is set to be equivalent among the detectors in part by adjusting the rejection threshold and in part by adjusting the high voltage. Measurement of samples of known isotopic composition can be used to correct for any remaining differences in efficiency between detectors. Using the adjustments and tuning described above, we can measure the isotope ratios of secondary ions, which is at the core of MIMS methodology, in a precise and reproducible manner.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Spatial resolution</title><p>The parallel detection of different ions, the small size of the primary-ion beam, and the high efficiency of secondary-ion collection all contribute to the highly effective spatial resolution of MIMS, reaching 33 nm, 30-fold better than in previous instruments. Smaller beams are possible and may be useful for locating and measuring highly concentrated tags in volumes of the order of (20 nm)<sup>3</sup>. Primary sources with higher brightness could give smaller probes with sufficient current for practical analysis: they could be provided by a brighter Cs<sup>+</sup> primary-ion source or by other types of sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Volume sputtered and detectability limit</title><p>The absolute sensitivity of SIMS is among the highest of current chemical analysis methods and the total amount of material needed for MIMS analysis is extremely small. Using MIMS, one can detect parts per billion of an isotope in a sub-cubic-micrometer volume of sample. Let us assume an analyzed field of 6 × 6 μm, a primary Cs<sup>+</sup> beam current intensity of about 0.4 pA, a dwell time per pixel of 20 msecs, 256 × 256 pixels, a sputtering efficiency of five target atoms per Cs<sup>+</sup> ion, an atomic layer thickness of 2.55 × 10<sup>-4</sup> μm, and an atomic density of 6 × 10<sup>10</sup> atoms per μm<sup>3</sup>: the total sputtered volume is then 0.27 μm<sup>3</sup>, and the sputtering rate is 0.4 nm/minute or 1.5 atomic layers/minute. For a probability of detection of 95%, three ions have to be emitted; assuming a useful ionization yield of 1 × 10<sup>-2</sup> ions/atom, then the minimum detectable amount is 1.85 × 10<sup>-8</sup> or approximately 20 parts per billion (see Additional data file 1).</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Contrast formation</title><p>There is no theory using first principles that allows us to predict what happens when the surface of the sample is hit by a primary ion. Which atoms are most likely to escape?</p><p>What is the sputtering rate (the rate of removal of target atoms)? When a given atomic species is sputtered, what is the ionization yield (the fraction of atoms that are ionized)? How will the composition of the matrix affect the number of atoms sputtered, the ionization yield, and the formation of polyatomic clusters such as CN or CNH? What is the breaking pattern of large and small molecules in atoms and atomic clusters? How interdependent are the parameters mentioned? All these questions are yet to be answered. In addition, the choice of primary ions, so important in practice, remains mostly empirical. Indeed, in order to achieve the high ion yields required for trace analysis down to the low parts per billion range, the sample needs to be bombarded with or exposed to chemically reactive species, and O<sup>-</sup> or Cs<sup>+</sup> are most commonly used. There is, however, a lack of detailed knowledge about the instantaneous surface composition, and all attempts to correlate observed ion yields with available ionization models should be considered highly questionable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>The contrast of a mass image is due to regional differences in secondary-ion currents emitted over the analyzed field. The main determinants of secondary-ion formation are the sputtering rate (the rate of removal of the target atom by the primary ions), the ionization yield (the fraction of sputtered atoms that are ionized) and the local concentration of atoms. These parameters cannot be derived directly from first principles, but we may safely assert the following. The sputtering rate in steady state is directly proportional to the primary beam current density at the sample surface and is dependent on the local atomic composition.</p><p>The ionization yield, in the negative secondary-ion emission mode, depends strongly on both the electron affinity of the elements or clusters under consideration and the concentration of the Cs<sup>+</sup> ions that are implanted by the beam into the superficial atomic layers of the sample. To a first approximation, implanted primary-ion concentrations vary as the inverse of sputtering rates; this makes the ionization yield somewhat a function of the sputtering rate. However, we do not know the form of the function that links implanted Cs<sup>+</sup> concentration to ionization yield.</p><p>Taking all these factors in consideration, we can predict the following. A low sputtering rate is generally associated with a higher concentration of implanted Cs<sup>+</sup>; lower sputtering rates should therefore lead to higher ionization yields. If ionization yields are strongly dependent on Cs<sup>+</sup> concentrations, low sputtering rates may paradoxically lead to higher secondary-ion currents. In a situation in which the sputtering rates of different areas over the field of analysis are not the same, a given area may appear brighter because the sputtering rate is lower (with a relatively higher concentration of implanted Cs<sup>+</sup>) and the ionization yield is still sensitive to the concentration of implanted Cs<sup>+</sup>. Moreover, the ionization yield is likely to depend on local sputtering rates because, once a steady state has been reached, these local rates control the local concentrations of the implanted primary ions. As a consequence, the brightness of an image area depends upon the local concentration of the element under consideration, the implanted Cs<sup>+</sup> concentration and the sputtering rate.</p><p>Without any contrast, images would not exist. Parallel mass images of different elements with different electron affinities convey a lot of information. For instance, a section of embedded cells bombarded with Cs<sup>+</sup> gives <sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup> images with low contrasts and, in parallel, <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> images showing strong contrasts related to known cell structures (for instance, Figure <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>, <sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup> and <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup>). Let us first consider <sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup> images. The local <sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup> intensity depends on both the sputtering rate and the ionization yield. When analyzed in parallel, one would expect (but it is not demonstrated) ionization yields of <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> ions, with their high electron affinity (3.6 eV), to saturate (to reach their maximum electron capture probability) more rapidly during Cs<sup>+</sup> implantation than <sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup> ions, whose electron affinity is much lower (1.2 eV). It follows that, if the ionization yield is strongly dependent on the concentration of implanted Cs<sup>+</sup>, at low concentrations of implanted Cs<sup>+</sup> the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup> ion emission should be more sensitive to small changes in the implanted Cs<sup>+</sup> and may be more sensitive than <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> ions to local differences or fluctuations in sputtering rate.</p><p>The low contrast that we observe in <sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup> images of epon-embedded samples probably indicates that sputtering rates are evenly distributed across the field analyzed and that implanted Cs<sup>+</sup> concentrations are approximately equivalent throughout the sample. The remaining contrasts are probably due to a slightly lower concentration of carbon in the biological tissue than in the embedding epon and to the formation of <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N atomic clusters that reduce the total number of <sup>12</sup>C atoms available to form <sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup> ions. If high contrasts were observed it would alert us to differences in sputtering rates or unexpected differences in atomic concentrations of carbon.</p><p>Because <sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup> images indicate a homogeneity in the sputtering rate and a steady state of the implanted Cs<sup>+</sup> concentration, the contrast observed on the CN<sup>-</sup> images acquired in parallel must reflect differences in local nitrogen concentration over the analyzed field and cannot be due to emission artifacts. The fact that, in many instances, interpretation of <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> images is straightforward and allows us to recognize easily details of features in tissue or cell sections is a boon.</p><p>Finally, we wish to emphasize the strength of the quantitative information derived from the ratio of mass images acquired in parallel. All parameters being the same, atoms or clusters such as <sup>26</sup>CN and <sup>27</sup>CN are affected identically at a level of precision well beyond what is needed for our experiments, and the quantitative ratio images contain the true isotope ratio values, cancelling out sputtering, ionization and other effects that affect the emission of a single ion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>The relationship between contrast formation, lateral resolution and counting statistics</title><p>The lateral resolution is essentially a function of the size of the primary ion beam. The smaller the beam diameter, the higher the resolution; to be visually appreciated, however, the image has to have enough contrast; that is, the image has to contain enough counts. Higher counting rates will be obtained with a brighter primary ion beam, all other conditions being the same. The count rate does not affect the intrinsic resolution, but it is a main determinant of the counting statistics. For example, in a parallel set of <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N<sup>-</sup> and <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> images, although a <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N<sup>-</sup> region in general contains far fewer counts than its <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> homolog, it has the same lateral resolution. The variance of the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N<sup>-</sup>/<sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> isotope ratio, however, is essentially determined by the number of counts in the <sup>12</sup> C<sup>15</sup>N<sup>-</sup> region.</p><p>If the sample surface being studied is not flat but shows relief, we observe a three-dimensional appearance in the sample image. Here, the contrast may be due either to a differential implantation or to a differential sputtering that occurs because the primary beam attacks the sample surface at a variety of angles. It should be emphasized, however, that these phenomenon affect in the same proportion – at least to a first approximation – isotopes separated by 1 atomic mass unit. Thus, the variations in count rates cancel out (note that all relief effects disappear in the ratio images; see for example the adipocyte in Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d,f</xref>), and the value of the isotope ratio still represents the local abundance of the individual isotopes with a precision of a few percent, which is entirely satisfactory for biological purposes. SIMS had previously been used for quantitation in the absence of imaging, and for imaging in the absence of quantitation. The advantage of MIMS is to combine high spatial resolution (that is, analyzing a much smaller amount of material than previously), with simultaneous (parallel) acquisition of information from several atomic masses, and with isobar separation at mass 27.</p><p>The ability to provide quantitative information is a unique attribute of MIMS. Imaging is a guide for exploiting the massive amount of unique quantitative information, which is based on the mining of the counts of secondary ions per pixel.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Isotope ratios</title><p>The isotope ratio values are the essential data needed to interpret the results, and the derivation of isotope ratios is an integral part of MIMS methodology. The absolute number of counts for a given atomic mass do not convey any information about the presence of an isotope excess. For example, the counts of <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N by themselves do not allow us to conclude anything about the presence of a <sup>15</sup>N tag in the analyzed region. Only the ratio <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>14</sup>N compared with the natural abundance of <sup>15</sup>N is informative. The visual observation of contrast and/or brightness is no more informative, and may be misleading. In a given field, contrast is due to variations of the number of counts per pixel, which may have multiple undocumented causes. As discussed under 'Contrast formation' earlier, in addition to the local abundance of the isotope under consideration, the secondary-ion intensity depends on other parameters such as the number of atoms of Cs implanted and the quality of the matrix into which the isotope is introduced. Thus, the fact that a given area emits more than a neighboring one does not mean that it contains more of the isotope tag. High counts in <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N do not mean that there is an excess of <sup>15</sup>N until they are normalized with respect of the counts of <sup>14</sup>N by calculating the isotope ratio<sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N/<sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N. A region of high secondary-ion yield at mass <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N may have little incorporation of <sup>15</sup>N (see, for example, the cochlear outer pillar cells (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), which have a high secondary <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N yield and very low incorporation of <sup>15</sup>N (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> and Additional data file 3). Conversely, a region with high <sup>15</sup>N on the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N mass image compared with the neighboring pixels may simply reflect a region with overall high yield of both <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N and <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N, even though their proportion is equivalent to the natural ratio. The isotope ratio values for regions of interest are the only information that may be used for evaluating where and how much a label such as <sup>15</sup>N has been incorporated.</p><p>The power of the isotope ratio method is that all analytical parameters being the same (field analyzed, instrumental conditions, Cs<sup>+</sup> implantation, matrix effect), one may assume that they affect two isotopes of the same atomic number – that is, isotopes that differ in general by 2 atomic mass units at most – in an identical fractional manner, so that any unknown effect will cancel out and that isotope ratio values will uniquely represent the relative abundance of one isotope with respect to the other.</p><p>Ensuring 'flatness' of the field, such that the isotope ratio values among regions of interest are equivalent regardless of their location in a control image field, is very important. It demonstrates that there is no differential fractionation among isobars: that is, that differences in isotope ratio among various areas are not the consequence of changes in transmission between a set of isotopes that are related to location within the field. This is why the <sup>12</sup>C and <sup>13</sup>C quantitative atomic mass images used to generate the <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C ratio image (in Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, for example) are an essential internal control. Because there is no <sup>13</sup>C added, they control for the flatness of the field, which means: first, equivalence of the <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C ratio at any location over the field analyzed; second, an absence of instrumental drift during analysis; third, the lack of some topographical effect; and fourth, the lack of a differential matrix effect. With all conditions being the same and because the secondary ions are detected in parallel from the same analyzed area, this ensures that measured high values of <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>14</sup>N ratios do show an excess of <sup>15</sup>N and cannot be an artifact.</p><p>We have developed several kinds of controls. Two essential controls in our quantitative imaging allow us to validate the analytical conditions. This validation is individual to the field being analyzed. The first control is to make sure that if no isotope has been added, the isotope ratio measured is equivalent to the natural abundance in a region of the field where no excess isotope is expected. When the sample is an epon-embedded section, this is measured on the epon, in a region of the analyzed field that does not contain tissue or cells.</p><p>The second essential control is to make sure that, for every field analyzed in quantitative imaging mode, a calculated excess of an isotope above its natural abundance is independent from its location in the analyzed field. This could happen if there was some instrumental fractionation of one isotope with respect to another, meaning that depending upon the location over the field, the transmission for one of the isotopes is somewhat different from another one. Control for the lack of fractionation is provided by the image derived from isotope ratios from quantitative mass images of a set of isotopes expected to be present at their natural abundance values and recorded over the same field, in the same instrumental condition and in parallel, simultaneously, with the isotope from which one expects an excess above its natural abundance at some location within the field. This is best performed by recording together in parallel the quantitative image of the experimental isotope and of an isotope that is expected to be present at the natural abundance level. The beauty of the <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C ratio (as in the cochlear sample labeled with <sup>15</sup>N, Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) or of the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N/<sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N compared with <sup>13</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N/<sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N (as in an adipocyte labeled with <sup>13</sup>C, Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) is that they control for the very same field that is being analyzed, and in the same conditions. 'Normally' one is not fortunate enough to develop and use internal controls of such high power. These controls are ideal internal controls and are immensely more important than finding natural abundance value ratios in separate control samples where all conditions are different from the experimental measures.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have developed MIMS, combining the use of a new SIMS instrument that simultaneously detects multiple isotopes with stable isotope labeling and quantitative image analysis. Using MIMS, it is possible to localize and measure precisely stable or radioactive isotopic tags in subcellular compartments in sub-cubic-micrometer volumes. Stable isotopes can be localized simultaneously at high resolution and measured with high precision, a unique combination. Studies with MIMS can use conventional tissue – and cell-preparation methods. The molecular tags can be any isotopes, stable or radioactive.

Quantitative images acquired with MIMS generate far more information than can be displayed using grayscale methods. To show high dynamic-range ratio images and to de-emphasize values resulting from data with few counts, we developed a method based on a hue saturation intensity transformation (HSI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] of the ratio image; HSI is derived from a calcium ratio imaging procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Think of the pixels in a MIMS image as equivalent to test tubes. A 256 × 256 pixel MIMS image would be an array of 65,536 test tubes from which we simultaneously count several isotopes (for example, the abundance of <sup>12</sup>C, <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>14</sup>N and <sup>15</sup>N). The HSI method allows us to identify among the 65,536 pixel test tubes (corresponding to areas of sub-micrometer size) those that contain significantly higher label counts. The main advantage of HSI is to color code the value of the ratios following a scale that can be extended or compressed, as well as taking full advantage of the fact that humans perceive many more differences in color than differences in shades of gray. For example, HSI enables us to identify regions of interest with significant excess of the <sup>15</sup>N label by a means independent of visual recognition of expected histological structures. The use of HSI allows us to greatly simplify the first step of data analysis.</p><p>Another powerful piece of software automates the data analysis of sequences of raw images. After creating stacks of images from analyzed fields and drawing regions of interest, statistics for each of the regions in each of the images are automatically tabulated and exported to the Prophet software for statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Isotope ratios</title><p>Regions of interest were selected using HSI ratio images; secondary-ion counts for the same regions of interest were extracted from the corresponding unsmoothed images of <sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup>, <sup>13</sup>C<sup>-</sup>, <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N<sup>-</sup> and <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> and the isotope ratio values from the derived images <sup>13</sup>C<sup>-</sup>/<sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup> and <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N<sup>-</sup>/<sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup>. The <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>14</sup>N ratios (or <sup>13</sup>C<sup>-</sup>/<sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup>) for each region of interest were also determined by dividing the total counts of <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N<sup>-</sup> (or <sup>13</sup>C<sup>-</sup>) over all pixels in that region by the total corresponding counts of <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> (or <sup>12</sup>C<sup>-</sup>).

RDIC allows us to dispense with preparing and staining alternate sections for microscopy. The sample is placed in the analysis chamber under a vacuum of approximately 3 × 10<sup>-10</sup> torr. A primary-ion beam of Cs<sup>+</sup>, after being shaped by the primary-ion column, is focused with the immersion lens and strikes the sample with an energy of 16 keV (see Figure <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>). The primary-ion beam scans the region of interest on the stationary sample step-by-step in a raster pattern, generally of 256 × 256 pixels but the number of pixels can vary in practice from 32 × 32 to 1,024 × 1,024. The secondary ions emitted from the sample are focused with the immersion lens, shaped by the optics of the secondary-ion column, and sent through a hexapole in the double-sector mass spectrometer made up of an electrostatic prism followed by a magnetic prism. This permits first-order focusing of the secondary ions as narrow lines along the focal plane of the magnet. Four detector units are located at the focal plane and can be moved independently along it so as to select specific atomic masses. Four electron multipliers in the detector units detect the signals from the selected secondary ions simultaneously. The current and diameter of the primary-ion beam, the time the beam is directed at each pixel (the dwell time), and the size of the pixels can be adjusted according to the size of the area being analyzed.</p><p>For each analysis, we need to ensure first that we have implanted enough Cs atoms into the sample to maximize the secondary-ion counting statistics; second, we maximize the secondary-ion transmission; third, we have perfect mass spectra at all masses; and fourth, in control fields we obtain equivalent values of the isotope ratio over the entire image field. Tuning is first done in ion-counting mode, in which the secondary-ion count rate recorded by each detector is displayed numerically. No images are acquired. We ensure that the responses of the electron multiplier detectors (EM; see Figure <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>) are equivalent. The primary Cs<sup>+</sup> beam is defocused and kept stationary on a standard silicon sample. The secondary-ion current at mass <sup>28</sup>Si is measured successively with each of the four EM detectors; the radius of the secondary-ion beam is set to enter the appropriate EM by changing the magnetic field strength of the magnetic prism. We adjust two parameters for each EM: the EM high voltage is set so that the pulse height distribution (PHD, the graphical representation of the distribution of the amplitude of the pulses generated by an EM at a particular voltage) of the EM output is similar for all four detectors; and the EM threshold voltage is set so that, in the absence of secondary-ion current, the noise of the counting system is smaller than 1 count per minute. When these conditions are fulfilled, the count rate for the same sample is the same among the four detectors, within ± 2.5%.</p><p>To begin tuning, we implant Cs atoms into the biological sample over a relatively large field (100–150 μm) at high primary-ion current (obtained by removing the diaphragm (D1, Figure <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>) used to define the primary-beam aperture in the objective column (OC). After a period of several minutes, Cs atoms implanted into the sample enhance the secondary-ion yield so that the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N<sup>-</sup> secondary-ion count rate reaches a steady state. Next, we ensure that the EM detectors are located in the correct position along the focal plane of the magnet (FP, Figure <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>) for each mass. We maximize the count rate of each EM by moving the detector along the focal plane so as to maximize the secondary-ion count rate for the selected atomic mass.</p><p>We follow with the alignment of the secondary-ion beam so that the isobars <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N and <sup>13</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N, and <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>12</sup>C<sup>1</sup>H, are well discriminated, indicating high mass resolution, while maintaining a high secondary-ion transmission (approximately 70–80%). An entrance slit (ES, Figure <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>), whose width is a main determinant of the mass resolving power (MRP), is placed in the path of the secondary-ion beam. We maximize the count rate for a given mass by iteratively focusing the secondary-ion lens located in the objective column (E0S) and by adjusting the voltages of the deflection plates P2, P3, and CY within the secondary column. We then set an aperture slit (AS) and an energy slit (WS) to reduce angular and energy aberrations and thus to maximize the MRP. To evaluate the MRP, we scan the secondary-ion beam through the detectors selection slit (SS) using a set of deflection plates (DP) and we record a small portion of the mass spectrum by plotting the secondary-ion current versus the deflection voltage (Figure <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">15</xref>). The quadrupole and slit lens (LF4) are used to maximize the MRP. Then, for each detector, using the mass spectra plots, we set the voltage of the deflection plates (DP, Figure <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>) so that the mass line of interest is centered in the selection slit (SS) of the EM (see Figure <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>). This practically eliminates any spillover from neighboring isobars.</p><p>We then switch to imaging mode, which displays 'live' scanning ion images from two selected masses. After adjusting the size of the analyzed field, the last steps aim to balance the tuning and to focus the primary-ion beam. We ensure that the analyzed field is balanced, that is, that the secondary-ion intensity emitted by a small fraction of the field is equivalent over the entire field, with iterative small voltage adjustments of the secondary-ion objective lens (EOS), and of a series of deflection plates (P2, P3 and CY) within the secondary column. We optimize the focus by adjusting the voltage of the primary-ion objective lens (EOP, Figure <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>). To analyze at the highest possible spatial resolution (approximately 35 nm), we increase the demagnification of the primary-ion source by increasing the voltage of the lens L1 (see Figure <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>) in the primary column. We may then have to slightly readjust the tuning of the secondary-ion beam. Finally, before starting analysis, we adjust the number of pixels in the image (256 × 256 up to 2,048 × 2,048) such that the beam diameter is approximately twice the pixel size, and we ensure that the acquisition time is long enough to obtain sufficient counting statistics for masses with low count rates (for example <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>12</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N).</p><p>After a sample is introduced into the MIMS analysis chamber, we can set the instrument to acquire qualitative MIMS images – in general at mass <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N, which gives a good anatomical view – within 30 minutes. Significantly more time is required, however, for the optimization of the many instrumental parameters (tuning) that is needed to record quantitative mass images suitable for extracting meaningful quantitative data. For new types of samples it may take hours to a day. Yet the physics is robust, and further tuning on an identical type of sample does not take more than 1 to 2 hours.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Additional data files</title><p>The following files are available: Additional data file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>, containing an explanation of how the volume sputtered, the useful yield, and the detectability limit are calculated; Additional data file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>, containing an explanation of how the lateral resolution is calculated; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>, describing data reduction from labeled and control mouse cochlear sections; Additional data file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>, describing the relationship between the brightness of an image and the number of counts; Additional data file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM5">5</xref>, comparing MIMS with autoradiography; Additional data file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM6">6</xref>, containing an explanation of the shape of mass line peaks in MIMS; and Additional data file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM7">7</xref>, containing more details on Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Development of the new SIMS instrument was supported by ONERA, CNRS, Université Paris Sud and Cameca (France).
