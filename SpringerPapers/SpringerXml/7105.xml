In this paper, we conduct index decomposition analyses to show the effects of both policies and autonomous developments driving the changes of primary energy consumption for the European Union (EU28) and its Member States for the time period of 2000 to 2014, with a comparative analysis of Germany and Poland. These analyses are based on the logarithmic mean Divisia index methodology and primarily on data compiled by Eurostat. They are carried out on two levels, i.e. on the level of total primary energy consumption as well as on the level of primary energy consumption related to electricity generation. The first level examines the influences of changes in final energy consumption and changes within the energy conversion sector on primary energy consumption. With the second level, we provide insights into the effects of changes in electricity consumption and production. According to our first-level analysis, the consumption of primary energy in the EU28 is primarily influenced by an increased share of electrical energy and the counteracting effect of rising efficiency in electricity generation, induced by an increasing share of renewable energies. Furthermore, the reduction of final energy consumption had a significant decreasing influence on primary energy consumption in the European Union. The second level of our analysis regarding electricity generation shows that the increasing effect on primary energy consumption due to the rising consumption of electricity was mainly compensated by substituting nuclear and thermal power plants by renewable energy technologies.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Energy efficiency targets</kwd><kwd>Primary

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">As part of the so-called 20-20-20 targets (European Council <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2009</xref>), the European Union has set itself the target to reduce energy consumption by 20% compared to a baseline. The other two goals are a share of 20% renewables in final energy consumption by 2020 and a 20% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 compared to 1990. This target “triad” has recently been extended until 2030 and it now includes (European Council <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2014</xref>) at least 40% cuts in greenhouse gas emissions (from 1990 levels), a share of at least 27% renewable energy and at least 27% improvement in energy efficiency. The proposal for an amendment of the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) sets a 30% binding energy efficiency target for 2030 at EU level (European Commission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2016b</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">These targets are not independent of each other: for example, the penetration of renewables in the power generation sector has impacts on primary energy consumption, hence on the fulfilment of the energy efficiency target. This is due to the following effect: While the physical energy efficiency of renewable energy technologies is below 100% (e.g. up to around 20% for multicrystalline photovoltaic cells and up to around 50% for wind energy), international energy balances as published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) apply the so-called physical energy content method (IEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2016</xref>). According to this method, the first energy form used downstream in the conversion process is defined as primary energy (in contrast to both the “substitution method” and the “direct equivalent method”; see Edenhofer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2012</xref>, p. 180). Renewable energy technologies like wind, solar (photovoltaic) and hydropower are hence accounted for with an efficiency of 100% regarding the conversion of primary energy to final energy in the form of electricity. They therefore increase the total efficiency of the conversion sector and thus lower the primary energy consumption for a given electricity production.</p><p id="Par4">Against this background, two important questions arise, i.e. (i) whether the European Union is on track to reach the energy efficiency target and (ii) which factors have been contributing or impeding target achievement. In this article, we focus on the achievement of the EU’s primary energy target which should not exceed 1483 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref>) by 2020 (European Commission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2013</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref>.</p><p id="Par7">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the development of primary energy consumption in the EU28 for the period 2000–2014, as well as the abovementioned primary energy targets for 2020 and 2030. The graph also shows the reference evolution of primary energy projected by Capros et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2016</xref>) and Capros et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2008</xref>), based on which the 20% (2020) and 27% respectively 30% (2030) energy efficiency targets were defined.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Development of primary energy consumption (gross inland energy consumption excluding non-energy use.) in the EU27 for the period 2000–2014 compared to the reference scenarios developed in 2007 and in 2016 and to the energy efficiency targets for 2020 and 2030 (these energy efficiency targets refer to the reference scenario developed in 2007; Capros et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2016</xref>; Eurostat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2016b</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/12053_2017_9527_Fig1_HTML.gif" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par8">Primary energy consumption in the European Union grew rapidly in the first years of the new millennium (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), but it levels off between 2004 and 2006. The economic crisis in the years 2008/2009 led to a clear drop, and, although there was a small recovery in energy consumption in 2010, primary energy consumption has been decreasing since then. In the last few years, progression towards the target of 1483 Mtoe for 2020 in the EU28 has been gaining pace.</p><p id="Par9">Factors that may have influenced the achievement of the primary energy target include changes in activity levels (notably the impact of the economic development), structural changes, renewable energy policies, changes in the conversion sector, energy efficiency policies, autonomous energy savings and behavioural changes.</p><p id="Par10">To identify the key determining factors for primary energy use and their impact, we conducted an index decomposition analysis (IDA) for primary energy consumption (PEC) of all Member States of the EU28. We focused on 2000 to 2014, as this period is relevant for policies like the European Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) 2012/27/EU (European Commission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2012</xref>) and statistical data are readily available. In this paper, we examine developments of primary energy consumption in the European Union and its Member States while we consider factors which had a strong impact on final energy consumption in an aggregated manner (i.e. we do not decompose energy use on the demand side by sectors and subsectors). The reason for this focus on primary energy lies in the fact that primary energy consumption plays a very important role in the set of targets of European energy policy, as outlined above.</p><p id="Par11">In the past, studies applying IDA mostly focused on the comparison of countries or regions (within a country) regarding solely final energy consumption or CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (e.g. Fernández González et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2013</xref>; IEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2008</xref>; ODYSSEE-MURE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2015</xref>). The value added of the work performed for this article lies in the uniform definition of the different factors impacting primary energy consumption in the EU28 and its Member States, next to the alignment to EU policy goals expressed in primary energy terms. To our knowledge, no comparable studies are available.</p><p id="Par12">We first describe the scope of our analysis of changes in primary energy consumption in the EU28 (“<xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Methodology for the analysis of factors impacting primary energy consumption</xref>” section), then explain the data base and procedures to fill data gaps and the methods used (“<xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">Decomposition method and data</xref>” section).</p><p id="Par13">In the next step (“<xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">Results</xref>” section), we present the results for the EU28 as well as for two rather different EU Member States: first, for Germany which can be described as a state where the demand for energy consumption has reached a certain saturation level and where the transformation of the energy system towards long-term sustainability targets is strongly changing the composition of the conversion sector, as a consequence of the decision to phase out nuclear energy by 2020 and due to strong support for renewables, and second, for Poland, where further economic growth is expected and for which the conversion sector is characterised by large shares of fossil fuels, notably coal.</p><p id="Par14">Finally, we discuss the results (“<xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec">Discussion</xref>” section) and draw conclusions from the analysis (“<xref rid="Sec14" ref-type="sec">Outlook and conclusion</xref>” section).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methodology for the analysis of factors impacting primary energy consumption</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Definition of primary energy consumption</title><p id="Par15">Primary energy consumption for energy purposes, as displayed in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, is defined in the EED (European Commission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2012</xref>) as the difference between “gross inland consumption” and “final non-energy consumption”. Final non-energy consumption represents the use of primary fossil fuels as lubricants and feedstock for material production (predominantly in manufacturing of chemicals).</p><p id="Par16">Renewable energy technologies, which do not directly consume any fuels for generating electricity (i.e. wind, PV and waterpower), are accounted for with a primary energy efficiency of 100% by convention.

Instead, one could have set up only one model with the electricity sector being split up immediately. However, some effects such as the penetration of electricity in the transformation sector would not have been clearly traceable.</p><p id="Par27">First, the energy conversion sector is analysed as a whole by distinguishing three subsectors: electricity generation, heat generation and other transformations (which comprise the production of solid fuels, petroleum products, gas, renewable energy and wastes not used for electricity or heat generation) (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Co-generation of electricity and heat is divided between the subsectors electricity and heat, according to the methodology developed by Eurostat for their energy balances for their data collection on combined heat and power generation as based on the implementation guidelines as defined in Commission Decision 2008/952/EC (European Commission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2008</xref>). The third subsector “other sectors” bundles transformation activities where the changes were more limited than in the electricity and heat generation branches, or which present smaller activities, such as the production of solid fuels, petroleum products and gas. The level 1 analysis includes the own consumption of the conversion sector, distribution losses and the final energy consumption.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Structure for the level 1 analysis of changes in primary energy consumption</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/12053_2017_9527_Fig2_HTML.gif" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par28">The second level (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) takes into account that changes in the electricity subsector may strongly impact primary energy consumption, hence the need to analyse changes in electricity generation and transmission/distribution more carefully.

Different methods were used over time and have certain properties, which can be seen as advantages or disadvantages. Ang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2004</xref>) examines several methods used for IDA in the past regarding theoretical foundation, adaptability, ease of use and ease of interpreting results.</p><p id="Par38">Ang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2015</xref>) gives an overview of IDAs conducted in the time frame 2005 to 2014 and Ang and Zhang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2000</xref>) for studies up to 1999. In the most common designs of IDAs, the impacts of variations in overall activity level (e.g. gross value added), activity structure and energy intensity on the difference in total energy consumption in a specific sector—most of the time industry—and a specific period are quantified. This approach is also extended to more sectors of a country’s economy with a focus on the evaluation of specific energy policies in current studies (e.g. Colinet Carmona and Román Collado <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2016</xref>). Recently, studies applying IDA also focused more on the decomposition of greenhouse gas emissions (e.g. Moutinho et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2016</xref>). In the past few years, analyses of <italic>ex ante</italic> (model) projections were conducted with regards to energy targets and policies (e.g. Smit et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2014</xref>). In our study, we apply IDA to primary energy consumption to evaluate the progress made in energy efficiency with regard to targets and policies for the European Union and its Member States. This multilevel analysis should provide further insight into the impact of policies linked to the reduction of primary energy consumption in the EU. As those energy efficiency changes cannot be divided into autonomous, policy-driven and economy-driven improvements, we especially consider policies focused on renewable energy.</p><p id="Par39">The Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) was introduced by Ang and Liu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2001</xref>) and is widely used today. The approach has two different versions, namely LMDI I and LMDI II, which differ mainly in the weighting function used and the ensuing properties.</p><p id="Par40">In this study, we use LMDI I, which uses the logarithmic mean as the weighting function. The differences between LMDI I and LMDI II are explained in more detail by Ang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2009</xref>.</p><p id="Par41">The method was adopted as the preferred method by the International Energy Agency (IEA) substituting methods based on Laspeyres indices (IEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2012</xref>). The main advantages of this method—besides other index-theoretical properties—lie in the fact that it produces no residual term (not attributed to any specific factor) and that it provides a linkage between additive and multiplicative decomposition (Ang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2009</xref>). Disadvantages of the method are that the results might be difficult to communicate to non-experts and that the method is not defined for zeros or negative numbers in the data set due to logarithmic terms in the LMDI formulae. Two main strategies exist to handle this issue, namely the so-called analytic limit (AL) strategy as described by Wood and Lenzen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2006</xref>) and the small value strategy (SV) as introduced by Ang and Choi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1997</xref>). Although the AL approach would be theoretically superior to the latter, we use the SV strategy (with values smaller than 10<sup>−20</sup>) as recommended by Ang and Liu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2007</xref>) as a substitute for zero values, as the share of zero values in our data base is very limited.</p><p id="Par42">The additive form of the LMDI approach follows these general equations:<disp-formula id="Equ3"><label>3</label><alternatives><mml:math display="block" id="Equ3_Math"><mml:mtable columnalign="left"><mml:mtr columnalign="left"><mml:mtd columnalign="left"><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mi>tot</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:mo>…</mml:mo><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr columnalign="left"><mml:mtd columnalign="left"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mi>tot</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:msup><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mo>⋯</mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr columnalign="left"><mml:mtd columnalign="left"><mml:mtext>where</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="0.5em"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mfenced close=")" open="(" separators=","><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msubsup></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>ln</mml:mo><mml:mfenced close=")" open="(" separators=","><mml:mfrac><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msubsup></mml:mfrac></mml:mfenced><mml:mspace width="0.5em"/><mml:mtext>with</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="0.5em"/><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mfenced close=")" open="(" separators=","><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfenced close=")" open="(" separators=","><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo stretchy="false">/</mml:mo><mml:mfenced close=")" open="(" separators=","><mml:mrow><mml:mo>ln</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mo>ln</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:math><tex-math id="Equ3_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Germany represents a state where the demand for energy consumption has reached a certain saturation level (variation of ±6% within the last 15 years) and where the transformation of the energy system towards long-term sustainability targets has strongly changed the composition of the transformation sector, in preparation for the country’s phase-out of nuclear energy by 2020. At the same time, Germany’s conversion sector is dominated to a certain degree by fossil fuels with a share of coal in gross electricity generation of almost 42% (AGEB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2016</xref>). On the other hand, Poland represents a state which is still expected to enjoy economic growth and for which the transformation system is still characterised by fossil fuels and a remarkably low share of electricity generation from renewable sources of 12.4% in 2014 (Eurostat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2016a</xref>).</p><p id="Par59">The total decrease in primary energy consumption by about 110 Mtoe in the European Union in the period 2000 to 2014 was mainly achieved by three countries (explaining a total of 84 Mtoe), namely the UK, Germany and Italy (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Annex).

This effect is strongly compensated by structural changes in the structure of the energy conversion sector, leading to an increase of about 41 Mtoe, in particular due to a shift towards higher shares of electricity. The underlying reason is the lower overall conversion efficiency of electricity generation compared to the production of heat and other types of final energy. While the changes in the structure of electricity generation alone would have resulted in a decrease by about 53 Mtoe, the changes in other subsectors of the conversion sector (solid fuels, petroleum products, gas and renewable energies/wastes) reduced this effect to approximately 48 Mtoe.

While Poland has stayed below its targeted primary energy consumption, Germany was still facing a gap of about 5% in 2014. The 2030 energy efficiency target of at least 27% is only set for the European Union as a whole, compared to the PRIMES 2007 baseline by Capros et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2008</xref>) (European Commission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2014</xref>). Assuming a uniform target of 27% for all Member States based on the 2030 target of the European Union, Poland has to reduce its primary energy consumption by about 2.4% from 2014 until 2030 to reach an assumed target of 87 Mtoe, while Germany faces a gap of almost 26% to a hypothetical 2030 target of 217 Mtoe, based on the reference projections according to PRIMES 2007. The assumption of a uniform energy efficiency target for all Member States may be challenged as, with respect to greenhouse gas emissions, there is an effort-sharing existing for 2020 (European Parliament <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2009</xref>) and proposed for 2030 (European Commission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2016a</xref>), at least for the sectors not concerned with emission trading. However, two arguments can be brought forward for a uniform target: First, in the energy efficiency field, only an overall EU target exists and no effort-sharing is proposed at the political level, neither for 2020 nor for 2030. Second, Fraunhofer-ISI et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2014</xref>) have shown that there are comparable energy efficiency potentials across all EU Member States.

In contrast to the developments in Germany, the changes in the structure of the conversion sector had a decreasing effect on the primary energy consumption in Poland, as the consumption of electricity is growing, but the share of electricity declined slightly due to the more rapidly growing consumption of energy carriers like solid fuels, petroleum products, gas and waste. While the total energy provided by the conversion sector grew by around 17.5%, the structure within the sector changed only slightly, with primarily lower heat production resulting in a negative effect of 1.5 Mtoe. Changes in the efficiency of the conversion sector in Poland also had a reducing effect of about 1.2 Mtoe.

These effects were counteracted mainly by changes in the structure of the conversion sector due to increased shares of electricity. However, this development is not necessarily apparent for the interim years. While we observe a reduction of PEC by almost 7% for the period from 2000 to 2014, some interim years show an increase, with a maximum of 6% in 2006 compared to 2000. An overall decreasing trend is only visible in the most recent years. Although these changing developments can be partially attributed to weather effects, economic activity also influenced this development.</p><p id="Par83">Our analyses show that the drivers for primary energy consumption in the various states differ, depending on the changes in the energy system and macroeconomic developments (see the tables in the annex). Many countries, which are not part of the EU15 (i.e. entered the European Union after April 2004), show rising final energy demand over the time period considered, which is primarily due to increasing consumption in electricity and “other energy sectors” rather than heat consumption. In the EU15 Member States, this increase in final energy consumption is not observed, with a few exceptions like Finland and Austria. While almost all countries show structural effects resulting in increasing energy use, these are far more significant in EU15 states, due to the increased importance of electricity. In these countries, the structural effect driving energy use upwards is counteracted in most cases by increasing overall energy efficiency in the conversion sector.</p><p id="Par84">Most of the changes at European level are caused by only a few states, namely the UK, Germany and Italy. However, the individual contribution of the different factors can vary considerably: In UK, for example, the change was mostly driven by reduction of final energy consumption, while in Germany increasing efficiency in the energy conversion sector was a major contributor to the overall reduction. In Italy, both the reduction in final consumption and improved efficiency in the conversion sector, combined with a more moderate penetration of electricity, strongly drove down primary energy consumption.</p><p id="Par85">We estimated or interpolated as few data points as possible. In the case of larger data gaps, other national data were used to close those gaps (e.g. for Germany).</p><p id="Par86">Furthermore, the unrealistic representation of CHP in Eurostat’s energy balances called for the use of other data published by Eurostat (i.e. table “tsdcc350”), based on a different methodology. In order to ensure consistency of the dataset, the differences related to the changed accounting of CHP generation were incorporated in other related subaggregates (in particular into the transformation input for thermal power plants, as it can be supposed that an overestimation of the CHP share leads to an underestimation of fuel input for thermal power plants).</p><p id="Par87">Also, a country’s PEC is influenced by weather and climate, mainly through space heating-related final energy consumption of households and services as well as—to a much lesser extent—primary energy consumption of (heat-controlled) CHP. To assess this impact, further analysis including climate-adjusted energy consumption would be required. For the moment, this influence is included in the aggregate factor representing all demand-side changes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Outlook and conclusion</title><p id="Par88">With a PEC of 1507 Mtoe in the EU28 in 2014, there is currently a gap of 1.6% to the intended PEC target of 1483 Mtoe in 2020. Germany faces a difference of 5% to its target while Poland has been below its targeted PEC level since the year 2000. The Member State targets proposed by each country for 2020 (European Commission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2015b</xref>) do not add up to the overall 20% energy efficiency target of the EU. Almost all non-EU15 countries (except Bulgaria, Malta and Estonia) already reached their 2020 targets in 2014 or remained below the targeted primary energy consumption so far. But only a third of the old Member States (EU15) already reached their 2020 goal in 2014, while others show a gap ranging from 1% (FR) to 14% (EL) in 2014 (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref> in Annex).</p><p id="Par89">In the EU15 countries, the increasing effects on level 1 were mostly due to structural effects attributable to rising shares of electricity, which were counteracted mainly by increasing efficiency in electricity generation and drops in final energy consumption. Non-EU15 countries as a group show a more mixed development. Here, the strongest drivers towards increased energy use were the rising final energy consumption or structural effects of the conversion sector (i.e. switch to electricity), which were counteracted by rising efficiencies, dropping energy consumption in the conversion sector and lower losses in transmission and distribution. On the second level of our analysis, i.e. the change in primary energy consumption due to changes in the electricity sector, the main driver for increased primary energy demand in the EU28 was the higher electricity generation, of which Germany and Spain contributed about a third. This effect was mainly counteracted by changes in the structure of the electricity sector, especially due to the decreasing share of thermal and nuclear power plants and their substitution by RES100 and CHP. The decline in the share of nuclear power is mainly driven by Germany’s nuclear phase-out.</p><p id="Par90">Overall, changes in the structure and efficiency of the conversion sector and its electricity generation drove down the EU’s primary energy consumption (from 2000 to 2014?) towards the 2020 target. These dynamics were mainly linked to the penetration of renewable energy sources and the substitution of other technologies in the conversion sector. This implies that the decrease in primary energy consumption in the EU may be closely related to policies encouraging renewable energy and CHP and their penetration in the conversion sector. The effects of policies targeting demand-side energy efficiency are not visible directly in our analysis, as they are included in the changes in final energy consumption which is also influenced by many other drivers in the various sectors, in particular, economic development and weather effects or behavioural influences. An econometric modelling approach as applied by ICF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2016</xref>) to measure the impacts of certain policies might be useful to separate these different effects.</p><p id="Par91">As a next step, an in-depth analysis of the development of final energy consumption and the influencing effects should be conducted, as this is one of the most important drivers of primary energy consumption, besides changes in structure and efficiency in the conversion sector. Furthermore, the application of such a decomposition analysis to relevant <italic>ex ante</italic> model data (e.g. PRIMES) at the level of primary and also final energy could help in evaluating the effects of policies and targets achievement. To identify impacts of energy policies more clearly and to deal with the non-causality of standard IDA, also a comparative decomposition of different <italic>ex ante</italic> scenarios could be conducted to link developments to specific policies, similar to the study by Agnolucci et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2009</xref>) on the reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p><p id="Par92">While the reduction of primary energy consumption in the EU as a whole seems to be quite in line with both the 20% reduction target by 2020 as well as the 27% target (respectively the 30% target) by 2030, the energy conversion sector (especially the transition to renewable energy) has contributed a relatively small share, while lower energy demand has been the key determining factor in the period 2000–2014. Our analysis does not distinguish to which extent lower energy demand is caused by higher energy efficiency or by lower demand for energy services (e.g. due to the economic crisis). If the latter is substantial, compliance with the EU energy efficiency targets as they are defined by the EED, which does not exclude the target achievement by reduction of economic activity, will be questionable in the case of economic recovery. Thus, other methods measuring the progress towards target achievement as they are postulated in the Energy Service Directive (ESD) (European Parliament <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2006</xref>) could be considered to eliminate this issue. A comprehensive harmonised system of evaluation methods for several energy efficiency technologies and measures was proposed by Thomas and Schüle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2009</xref>).</p><p id="Par93">From our analyses, we can derive general policy implications for some Member States showing certain apparent developments. Poland, which shows strongly increasing final energy consumption, has not yet exceeded its 2020 target regarding final energy consumption, but the observed trend could be counteracted by the implementation of additional energy efficiency policies. This is applicable for several other Member States, such as Austria, Finland and to a lesser degree Ireland. Among these countries, Austria and Ireland show an increase in GHG emission compared to 2000. In spite of its high share of renewables in electricity generation, Ireland still faces a gap of over 7% to its 2020 target regarding the share of renewables in total final consumption. This implies the need for stronger policies promoting the use of renewable energy technologies in Ireland.</p><p id="Par94">Monitoring the progress of the European Union and its Member States towards the EU’s energy efficiency target is a crucial part of the mandatory process as defined in the Energy Efficiency Directive. Analysing the underlying developments of this progress thoroughly, as done in this paper, offers insights which help to steer and to accelerate the process of target achievement.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="ethics-statement"><title>Compliance with ethical standards</title><sec id="FPar1" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p id="Par95">The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.</p></sec></sec><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><mixed-citation publication-type="other">AGEB (2015).
