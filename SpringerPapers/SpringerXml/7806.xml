Currently, there is a lot of unused waste heat from moulding and cooling in the casting cell. This represents the source of waste heat utilization in this paper. A preheating furnace act as a proper and large enough heat sink. Hence waste heat supply and demand not always coincide a latent thermal energy storage is used to close this gap, utilizing the melting and crystallization enthalpy of the storage medium, the phase change material (PCM). For waste heat recovery and continuous preheating, we designed a system consisting of PCM storage and preheating furnace. At the laboratory at the Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT) there is a PCM storage unit, where experiments can be carried out. As a first step a simulation model was developed using Modelica/Dymola, where thermal oil is used to utilize the waste heat from die casting to preheat aluminum ingots. Simulation results showed that with this system energy savings of 10 to 15% can be achieved and even be surpassed by further optimization. With higher waste heat temperatures (up to 300 ℃) and therefor higher preheating temperatures, and an optimally interconnected system of larger PCM storages, energy savings up to 30% seem possible.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Aluminum die casting</kwd><kwd>waste heat recovery</kwd><kwd>preheating</kwd><kwd>energy efficiency</kwd><kwd>simulation</kwd><kwd>latent heat storage</kwd><kwd>phase change material</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="springer-nature-chemical-annotations"><compound-kwd><compound-kwd-part content-type="InchiKey">CURLTUGMZLYLDI-UHFFFAOYSA-N</compound-kwd-part><compound-kwd-part content-type="Inchi">InChI=1S/CO2/c2-1-3</compound-kwd-part><compound-kwd-part content-type="synonyms"><named-content content-type="preferred-chemical-synonym">carbon dioxide</named-content><named-content content-type="chemical-synonym">CO2</named-content></compound-kwd-part></compound-kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>chapter-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>conf-reference</meta-name><meta-value>ires2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>chapter-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/978-94-6463-156-2_Chapter_22.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></book-part-meta><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Energy storage systems can compensate the divergence between fluctuating energy sources (e.g. waste heat, renewables) and discontinuous demand (e.g. batch processes). This enables an increased integration of renewable energies and a strengthening in energy security<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">Besides that, industrial processes face a similar problem, where waste heat supply and demand do not always coincide. Therefor thermal energy storages can be used to match the demands, resulting in increasing overall efficiencies and a reduction in energy consumption. Laia Miro et al. investigated various industrial use cases for thermal energy storages in combination with waste heat recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">Thermal energy storages (TES) can be divided in three major categories. Thermochemical heat storages use the principle of heat due to composition and decomposition of molecules. These storages have high capacities, but a poor controllability. Sensible heat storages are directly proportional to the temperature change and therefor mainly depending on the sensible heat capacity of the storage medium. Latent heat storages are using the enthalpies during a phase transition and therefor capacities are higher compared to sensible storages in most cases. The materials in these storages are called phase change materials (PCM). Due to the isothermal phase change, this type of storage has the advantage of delivering heat at a constant temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Metal production and processing in 2019 had a share of 15% of Austria’s industrial energy consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] Light metals have advantages in weight, mechanical strength, malleability, corrosion resistance and durability. The most important light metal is aluminum. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] It is the most produced non-ferrous metal and is increasingly replacing steel components.

This leads to a mismatch between surplus heat and heat demand for heat treatment. For preheating of raw material, the situation is different. Such furnaces have the capability to utilize high amounts of waste heat, because the mass flow of aluminum ingots is large enough to serve as a proper heat sink.

For this purpose, the model consists of the validated PCM storage sub-model with closed thermal oil circuit connected via heat exchangers to a closed air circuit within the furnace for continuous heating of the aluminum ingots. The ingots move through the furnace in discrete steps, changing position at time intervals. The furnace and thus the heat transfers are divided into 3 zones. Depending on the position of the individual ingot, it receives the heat flux from the respective furnace zone. The closed thermal oil circuit transfers the heat to the air via a fin-tube heat exchanger. The heat transfer was modelled using thermal resistances with heat transfer coefficients and heat transfer areas as input. This heat transfer was also divided into 3 zones to keep the temperature difference of the thermal oil between the zones low. The mass flow of thermal oil in the circuit is kept constant and cools down while in counter-flow heating up the air which itself in counter-flow heats up the ingots. The cooled thermal oil is then returned to the PCM storage inlet. The implemented fan in the model is used to define the direction of the air flow and should ensure the turbulences for proper heat transfer.

The aluminum ingots have a length of 60 cm and a width of 12 cm. The furnace has a length of 9 m to ensure sufficient heat transfer. The length of the ingots results in a furnace width of 80 cm. The mass flow of the aluminum ingots is 7.5 kg/min, which leads to a conveying velocity of the furnace of 0.2 m/min for a given furnace length. This results in a residence time of 45 min for the ingots inside the furnace. From the Stefan Boltzmann law it follows that the temperature enters the heat flux to the 4<sup>th</sup> power. Due to the fact that the considered temperatures for this use case are low and below 200 ℃, radiation is negligible and the dominant heat transfer is convection. The convective heat transfer coefficients are sufficiently high to ensure a reasonable geometry. They are in the magnitude of about 50 W/m<sup>2</sup>K for the convective transfer to the air and of about 250 W/m<sup>2</sup>K for the heat transfer of the thermal oil to the tubes of the heat exchanger.

A simulation model that utilizes this heat source with thermal oil for preheating of aluminum ingots was presented. Additionally, a PCM storage to match waste heat supply and demand was integrated, to ensure an uninterrupted preheating. The proof-of-concept showed that the proposed waste heat recovery system with a PCM storage can save 10 to 15% energy but can still be further optimized. The model utilizes thermal oil from the die casting process (waste heat from the tool) at 200 ℃ and heats aluminum ingots up to 160 ℃. Future foundries are expected to utilize higher waste heat temperatures of about 300 ℃ due to an improved casting tool insulation and optimized cooling channels. A first estimation showed that this can result in energy savings of up to 30%. Furthermore, larger storages, optimized interconnection between several storages and auxiliary heating with excess electricity may generate higher and more uniform preheating temperatures.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by the ongoing project ‘envIoTcast’, which is part of the energy model region NEFI - New Energy for Industry and is funded by the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund (FFG, No. 880767).
