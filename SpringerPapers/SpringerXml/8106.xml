To reduce the cell temperature, there exists a cooling duct in the bottom of the PVT-TEG unit. Type of fluid within the duct and structure of duct can change the performance of the system. So, hybrid nanofluid (mixture of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and MWCNT with water) has been replaced instead of pure water and three various configurations of cross section [STR1 (circular), STR2 (rhombus), STR3 (elliptic)] have been implemented. Through the tube incompressible laminar flow of hybrid nanofluid has been solved while in solid layers of panel, pure conduction equation has been simulated involving heat sources resulting from optical analysis. According to simulations, the third structure (elliptic) has the best performance and rise of inlet velocity causes overall performance to enhance about 6.29%. The values of thermal and electrical performances for elliptic design with equal fractions of nanoparticles are 14.56% and 55.42%, respectively.

This energy can take various forms, such as electricity, chemicals, heat, and others. Traditionally, fossil fuels have been used to fulfill these energy demands, but they are finite resources that cannot be easily replenished. The rate at which humans consume fossil fuels far exceeds the rate at which they are naturally substituted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Therefore, finding sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels is essential for meeting our long-term energy needs. Sustainable energy is a pivotal issue that has the potential to bring about positive change in the present situation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Fossil fuels not only contribute to environmental pollution, but also face the challenge of depletion. So, to decrease the environmental impact of such sources, the request for renewable energy is increasing to meet the growing energy needs. As the cost of solar energy drops below that of fossil fuels, the demand for fossil fuels tends to decrease. Solar energy can be harnessed through various systems, including Photovoltaic Thermal (PVT) units for producing both heat and electricity from solar energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. PV units are applied to convert incident radiation into electricity and only 20% of the whole energy of sunlight can be converted and remaining is wasted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, elevated operating temperatures can lead to a reduction in the conversion rate and this temperature increase can result in damage to the structural integrity of the solar panels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Efforts to augment the electrical performance (<italic>η</italic><sub><italic>el</italic></sub>) of PV panels involve reducing their operating temperature, which can be reached through the employ of a thermal absorber unit. Researchers have explored a method called PVT unit, to lower cell temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The PVT system enables simultaneous generation of electricity and heat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Elqady et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> investigated a research to optimize the dimensions of a heat sink for improving cooling performance of solar panels. Their findings identified a duct with optimal design points then they employed in a 3D model to assess the effectiveness of a PVT. The greatest electricity performance achieved was 17.45%, which demonstrated a significant improvement of nearly 40% compared to a typical CPV/T system. Raza et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> have presented a computational methodology for designing a high-performance composite material to be used as the backside of a concentrated PV (CPV) unit. The proposed composite shows promising potential and results in a 4.3% enhancement in electrical output and improved module durability. Li et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> presented a novel and versatile approach for cooling photovoltaic panels. They found that performance of PV enhances about 19% with employing the proposed system.</p><p id="Par3">Through ongoing research on fluid properties, water can be modified to enhance its heat removal capabilities for photovoltaic (PV) cells. This can be achieved by incorporating nanoparticles into water to increase its thermal conductivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Nanofluid, which is a type of heat transfer medium composed of nanometer-sized engineering materials mixed with a base fluid, has garnered significant attention from researchers due to its performance in various usages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Nanofluids have gained attention as promising cooling techniques for PVT. Researchers have experimented with different nanofluids in different structures of PVT systems to optimize their efficiency and establish an effective system with improved overall performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. A research managed by Bassam et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> examined the efficiency of a hybrid PVT in existence of micro fins and turbulator. The reported <italic>η</italic><sub><italic>el</italic></sub> of the unit was 10.8% and the maximum thermal performance of the unit was 83.3%. The optimal operating conditions for a PVT system with CuO nanofluid were scrutinized by Madas et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The outputs showed that increasing the nanofluid fraction resulted in a 1.11% and 3.3% increase in electrical and thermal performances. Abadeh et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> studied the economic analysis of solar system in the existence of various types of nanofluid as coolants. Their findings revealed that the addition of nanofluids significantly improved the payback period. Moreover, from an environmental perspective, outputs demonstrated that the proposed unit decreased emission production about 17% compared to a PV unit. Nasrin et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> tested an indoor experiment on a PV and they applied MWCNT-water as testing fluid. They reported the overall efficiency can reach 87.65%. Khan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> evaluated the beahvior of PVT system utilizing a serpentine pipe. Their study revealed that PVT systems utilizing hybrid nanofluids exhibited 10.5% higher thermal performance compared to Iron oxide–water. Alktranee et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> employed a research to scrutinize the impact of using nanofluid on efficiency of PVT system. They utilized tungsten trioxide and showed that cell temperature reduces about 21.4%. Tembhare et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> reported a review of nanomaterial and their properties for solar thermal applications. They analyzed various studies on solar thermal systems that use nanofluids. The researchers found that nanofluids, due to their superior heat transfer properties, offer significant potential for solar applications. Nanofluids, with dispersed nanoparticles that exhibit high thermal conductivity, have the capability to transport heat efficiently. Du et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> incorporated a filter containing plasmonic nanofluids into their PVT system to make use of the entire solar spectrum. Additionally, they employed aerogel glazing and observed a 13.3% increase in exergy performance compared to the previous system.</p><p id="Par4">To enhance the performance of solar energy utilization, there are significant researches on PVT, which are efficient and cost-effective technologies. Furthermore, there has been a growing interest in hybrid systems combining photovoltaic with thermoelectric generators (PV-TEG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Attempts have been made to combine PV and TE technologies. Despite the benefits of thermoelectric generators (TEG) in converting waste heat into electricity. TE modules offer several advantages, such as being environmentally friendly, simple, silent, and durable. However, their efficiency is relatively low. While PV cells cover the visible and ultraviolet ranges of the solar irradiation, TEG modules can utilize the infrared part, resulting in a more comprehensive energy harvesting from whole sunlight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. By utilizing the Seebeck effect, a thermoelectric generator (TEG) module is able to generate electrical power by harnessing temperature differences. In a PV/TEG hybrid unit, the PV-temperature increases as solar radiation intensifies. Subsequently, the TEG converts the temperature gradient into electrical energy, following the principles of the Seebeck impact<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In a simulation conducted by Rejeb et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, a comparison was made between a CPVT unit and a CPVT/TE unit. They proved that the CPVT/TE system with nanofluid generated 11.15% more overall electrical power in summer compared to the CPVT unit. Chen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> scrutinized a combination of TEG, PV and solar selective absorber (SSA). Their output exhibited a 9.89% increase in energy efficiency. Lekbir et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> scrutinized a CPVT-TE unit that utilized a nanofluid cooling channel. The outcomes revealed that <italic>η</italic><sub><italic>el</italic></sub> of this unit was 8.4% greater compared to CPVT-TE with water cooling. Shittu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> scrutinized a simulation research on a PVT-TEG unit in existence of heat pipe (HP). The outcomes revealed that the suggested system's performance was 1.47 times greater than that of the system without HP. A prototype of a CPVT/TE unit was evaluated by Indira et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> under outdoor conditions. They found that the highest electrical performance of 4.86% was achieved.</p><p id="Par5">According to previous study, changing the layers of PV modules and utilizing cooling systems can change the efficiency. Some researchers suggested using TEG to employ the waste heat resulting from wavelengths of sunlight which cannot convert to electricity via silicon layer. In current paper, a PV module was joined with TEG layer and cooling duct with various configurations have been applied for managing the cell temperature. The hybrid nanoparticles (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>—MWCNT) were dispersed within water. The influences of fraction ratio of components of hybrid nanofluid as well as inlet velocity of testing fluid have been examined via numerical modeling. Three geometries for cooling ducts have been incorporated to find the best design. Also, the influence of the amount of solar irradiation has been analyzed. The governing equations and utilized assumptions have been summarized in section "<xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">The description of PVT-TEG system and governing equations</xref>". The outputs of simulations have been classified in section "<xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">Results and discussion</xref>" to find the case with best performance.

Firstly, such unit can provide both heat and electricity while converting waste heat into additional electricity through TEG, resulting in increased efficiency and energy output. Secondly, incorporating hybrid nanofluid cooling in the bottom cooling duct improves thermal management, dissipates heat effectively, and reduces thermal stress on the system. This results in enhanced system reliability and lifespan. Additionally, nanofluid cooling improves heat transfer coefficients, and provides further efficiency gains. In summary, combining PVT, TEG, and nanofluid cooling significantly improves energy efficiency, thermal management, and system reliability. The working fluid consists of H<sub>2</sub>O and combination of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and MWCNT as hybrid nano-powders. The geometry of the duct at the bottom of a PV system is essential for effective cooling and heat dissipation. Properly designed duct geometry can enhance the flow of the cooling fluid and improve heat transfer, resulting in lower operating temperatures and better system performance. The shape and size of the duct can also affect the pressure drop and flow rate, which are critical factors for maintaining the system's optimal performance. Additionally, the duct's shape can influence the distribution of the fluid, which ultimately determines the cooling performance of the system. Therefore, proper consideration of the geometry of the duct at the bottom of a PV system is crucial for ensuring efficient operation and maximizing the system's lifespan. According to this fact, three various geometries for cooling duct have been suggested in present work with considering the same hydraulic diameter (STR1 (circular), STR2 (rhombus), STR3 (elliptic)). The influences of various fractions of components of hybrid nanofluid and inlet velocity (V<sub>in</sub> = 0.065 to 0.17 m/s) have been scrutinized.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Selection of best grid</title><p id="Par16">Achieving mesh independence is a critical step in numerical simulations as it ensures precise and trustworthy results. The process involves modifying the mesh density to determine the minimum resolution necessary for accuracy. The accuracy of the simulation output is heavily influenced by the mesh density, and using a mesh that is too coarse or fine may lead to unreliable results. Thus, obtaining mesh independence is crucial in producing accurate simulations, which helps engineers make informed design decisions, enhance system performance, and ensure reliability. A structured grid is a mesh system where the cells are arranged in a regular pattern and can be identified by their indices. It has advantages such as better accuracy and stability in numerical simulations, faster convergence rates, and ease of implementation for structured geometries. So, structured mesh has been applied in present modeling as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>.

To use the waste heat, TEG layer has been combined with other layers of PV leading to increment of electrical performance. The negative impact of pumping power has been involved in measuring the overall electrical performance. Three different geometries (STR1 (circular), STR2 (rhombus), STR3 (elliptic)) have been tested to find the best design. All geometries have the same inlet Reynolds number and laminar flow has been considered through the tube. With improvement of cooling rate and temperature uniformity with loading nanoparticles and selecting the best design, the thermal stress over the panel decreases leading to higher lifespan. The impacts of inlet velocity (V<sub>in</sub> = 0.065 to 0.17) and different fractions of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and MWCNT have been examined. The optical features have been involved in modeling by incorporating the heat generation terms for layers. Due to the negligible value of heat source in layers at the beneath of second EVA, the pure conduction mode without heat source has been considered for them. The properties of new working fluid have been estimated according to single phase approach.
