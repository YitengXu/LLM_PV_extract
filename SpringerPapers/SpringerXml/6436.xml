This scheme requires the use of sensitizers in a multicomponent solution that are essential for capturing, delivering and converting solar energy and later storing it in the form of chemical bonds in a high-energy density fuel, such as hydrogen, with the aid of catalytically active sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The development of such an artificially intermolecular system requires a fundamental understanding of electron-transfer reactions between the individually constructed components for interesting catalytic reactions. In recent years, considerable progress has been achieved in developing highly absorbing photosensitizers (PSs) and noble-metal-free water reduction catalysts (WRCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The use of iridium PSs with transition metal-based WRCs, such as cobalt or iron complexes, has been shown to be preferable because such systems typically possess remarkable activity with a limited operational lifetime for the formation of hydrogen from water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The existence of metal-carbon sigma bonds in cyclometalated Ir(III) emissive species improves their photostability compared to Ru(II) diimines under illumination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. However, for these artificial systems, the photodecomposition of both the sensitizer and catalyst remains a problem that terminates the practical water-splitting reaction in the production of clean fuel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. For solar fuel conversion, the stability under catalytic functional conditions is a critical issue that has led to the search for long-term sustainable artificial systems in which PSs and WRCs are capable of withstanding degradation, which continues to be a central challenge in the development of solar fuels.</p><p>To address this issue, many approaches have been employed to improve the durability of iridium PSs, such as placing bulky pendant groups on the backbone of the cationic iridium complexes due to their steric protection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> or using neutral tris-cyclometalated iridium complexes due to their intrinsic high stability to photolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In addition to the rhodium, palladium or platinum WRCs, molecular catalysts based on cobalt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, iron<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and nickel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> have been suggested as cheaper alternatives, but there is still abundant room for improvement of the catalysts' stability. In the search for stable photocatalytic systems, we are interested in highly dispersed inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) as working catalysts that can reduce water to hydrogen in the solution phase. Such nanomaterials with superior photostability are particularly attractive for performing this reaction because redox catalysis can be independently optimized by varying the size, shape or surface ligands of the NPs. Molybdenum disulfide appeared to be a promising candidate because it is active for the evolution of H<sub>2</sub> at low electrochemical overpotentials for water reduction, which has been identified as an electrocatalyst and a semiconducting photocatalyst for the heterogeneous hydrogen evolution reactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Few investigations have investigated the reduction of water in multicomponent photochemical molecular systems involving the utilization of inorganic catalysts composed of earth-abundant elements because NPs in a stable colloidal form are needed for such applications in aqueous media. Early studies have shown that colloidal MoS<sub>2</sub> is active as a WRC replacement for traditional Pt group metal catalysts for hydrogen photoproduction. However, colloidal MoS<sub>2</sub> exhibited rather undesirable photocatalytic lifetimes and approached a turnover number (TON) of only 75 with cationic [Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) chromophores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. For further progress with this interesting catalyst, higher conversion efficiencies are required for solar fuel conversion. In addition, a better understanding of the interaction between the new sensitizers and the dispersed MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs in the photocatalytic fuel-forming reaction is essential.</p><p>To this end, we developed multicomponent hydrogen production systems based on a series of Ir(III) PSs (as shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) in combination with the colloidal MoS<sub>2</sub> WRC. This series allows for the evaluation of the photohydrogen-evolution activity as a function of structure. Due to the functional groups on the PSs, different potential interactions may exist between the PSs and the MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs, which may directly interfere with the overall efficiency of the solar energy conversion. In particular, iridium PSs that were functionalized with pendant carboxylic acids as anchoring groups might allow for binding of the molecule chemisorbed onto the surface of the colloidal catalyst to promote electron transfer, which appears to be important for catalytic activity. By controlling the size of the colloidal MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs, the selected systems have the ability to produce remarkably high amounts of H<sub>2</sub> with an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of up to 12.4%. Further investigation reveals that colloidal MoS<sub>2</sub> exhibits desirable activity and long-term stability, which holds great promise for continuing progress in the clean and sustainable production of hydrogen with novel photocatalytically active materials.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Formulas of the Ir(III) photosensitizers investigated in this work (3: R = H; 4: R = CF<sub>3</sub>; 5: R = <italic>t</italic>-Bu).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep04045_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Characterization of colloidal MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles and Ir(III) complexes</title><p>The transparent colloidal MoS<sub>2</sub> suspensions were obtained according to a previously published protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. The poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) was used as a surface ligand to stabilize the NPs in a fine colloidal state in the aqueous solution. The colloidal suspension of MoS<sub>2</sub> clearly displayed a typical Tyndall effect, suggesting the formation of stable MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>) and the colloidal suspension was notably stable (no deposition) for several weeks under an air atmosphere. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was utilized to characterize the chemical states of Mo and S in the colloidal NPs. The binding energies of Mo 3d<sub>3/2</sub>, Mo 3d<sub>5/2</sub>, S 2p<sub>1/2</sub> and S 2p<sub>3/2</sub> were determined to be 232.1, 228.8, 162.8 and 161.7 eV, respectively, indicating the presence of a tetravalent molybdenum ion (Mo<sup>4+</sup>) and a divalent sulfur ion (S<sup>2−</sup>) in the resulting colloidal solution. Quantification by XPS indicated a Mo to S ratio of approximately 1:2, which showed that the NPs were present in the form of MoS<sub>2</sub>. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs were well-dispersed and appeared to be spherical (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a–e</xref>). As revealed by the TEM, the dispersion and size distribution of the colloidal MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs was controlled by adjusting the ratio of the stabilizer of PVP to MoS<sub>2</sub>. When a ratio of 40 or 80 was used, the majority of the colloids were less than 10 nm in diameter with better dispersion. When less PVP was added, a small fraction of particles unavoidably agglomerated into large ones. When the colloid preparation was conducted without PVP or in an aqueous solution with PVP, a MoS<sub>2</sub> colloid failed to form and the particle size of the prepared MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs was greater than 20 nm, as shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2e and 2f</xref>, respectively. Due to the relatively low contrast, the TEM micrographs do not provide an unambiguous NP diameter. However, the difference is clear and is expected to lead to a significant impact on their catalytic performance. The diffuse absorption spectrum of colloidal MoS<sub>2</sub> in methanol is rather featureless (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S3</xref>), which is consistent with that of the MoS<sub>2</sub> colloids reported in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>TEM images of MoS<sub>2</sub> prepared in methanol with ratio of PVP (monomeric units) to MoS<sub>2</sub> of 2.5 (a), 10 (b), 40 (c), 80 (d), 0 (e) and SEM image of MoS<sub>2</sub> particles prepared in aqueous solution with ratio of PVP to MoS<sub>2</sub> at 40 (f).</p><p>The diameter and dispersion of the NPs improves as the ratio of PVP to MoS<sub>2</sub> increases, as shown by the curved arrow.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep04045_Fig2_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>All of the iridium complexes were successfully synthesized according to standard procedures and fully characterized. Various cyclometalating and ancillary ligands helped modulate the photophysical and electrochemical properties of the target light-harvesting complexes and provided further insight into the potential relationship between the substituents and the PS performance. In particular, the use of the COOH group in the ancillary ligand of 2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylate (H<sub>2</sub>bpdc) was expected to control the funneling of excitation energy toward the photochemical reaction center. Among these iridium PSs, complexes <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> appear to be electrically neutral, with one of the carboxyl group losing its proton to become a negatively charged carboxylate group (–COO<sup>−</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, while the other Ir(III) compounds were isolated as their hexafluorophosphate (PF<sub>6</sub><sup>−</sup>) salts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Photophysical and electrochemical properties</title><p>The absorption and emission spectra of all of the Ir(III) complexes measured in a methanol solution at 278 K are shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and the data are summarized in <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. All of the complexes exhibit intense absorption bands in the UV region, which corresponds to the spin-allowed singlet ligand-centered (<sup>1</sup>LC) π → π* transitions of both the C<sup>∧</sup>N and N<sup>∧</sup>N ligands. The less intense absorption features are observed in the visible region and are primarily attributed to metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT), which may also include some ligand-to-ligand charge transfer (<sup>1</sup>LLCT). Upon excitation at 350 nm, all of the complexes exhibit intense orange to green luminescence with decay lifetimes between 0.20 and 0.68 μs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S4</xref>). To further elucidate the nature of the excited states, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed on all of the Ir(III) complexes. The contour plot of the frontier molecular orbitals is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Table S1</xref>. For all of the complexes, the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) are distributed between the Ir(III) center and the π orbitals of the cyclometalated ligands.

Therefore, the particle size and dispersion of the MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs play a key role in its catalytic activity. In the present study, this factor was adjusted by varying the initial ratio of PVP to MoS<sub>2</sub> toward the target. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref> shows the effect of the colloidal MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs with various ratios of PVP to MoS<sub>2</sub> on the hydrogen evolution efficiency using complex <bold>1</bold> (20 μM) as the PS and H<sub>2</sub>A as the electron donor under visible light irradiation (λ &gt; 420 nm). When the ratio of PVP/MoS<sub>2</sub> changes from 2.5 to 40, the hydrogen evolution efficiency in the homogeneous-like system increased as the particle size of MoS<sub>2</sub> decreased, which may be due to the presence of much more active sites due to the smaller size and better dispersion of the MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs. In addition, the existence of PVP allows for the enhancement of energy transfer in the solar-fuel converison<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.

Although a smaller diameter of MoS<sub>2</sub> particles was observed for a PVP/MoS<sub>2</sub> ratio of 80, a lower photocatalytic activity was observed, which may be due to the disruption of electron transfer between the PS and WRC affecting the photocatalytic reactions when a large number of PVP surround MoS<sub>2</sub> in the reaction solution. When MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs in the bulk powder form were used as a WRC in an heterogeneous system of Ir(III)-MoS<sub>2</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>A, no H<sub>2</sub> was detected suggesting that it is quite different from the NPs.

In addition, the TON increased from 82 to 731 based on MoS<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Therefore, the concentration of both the WRC and PS are critical parameters that affect the catalytic production of hydrogen from water.</p><p>The performance of colloidal MoS<sub>2</sub> as a WRC for hydrogen photoproduction was evaluated in comparison to other WRCs, such as colloidal platinum generated in situ from K<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>4</sub>, [Co(bpy)<sub>3</sub>]Cl<sub>2</sub>, [Co(dmgH)<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>] (dmgH<sub>2</sub> = dimethylglyoxime) or [Rh(dtb-bpy)<sub>3</sub>](PF<sub>6</sub>)<sub>3</sub> (dtb-bpy = 4,4′-di-tert-butyl-2,2′-bipyridine), in association with <bold>1</bold> under irradiation for 20 h and the same experimental conditions. As shown in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>, the TONs based on these species are quite low. The Rh WRC is more active with 30 TON obtained after a 20 h of irradiation. With colloidal MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs, a more than ten-fold enhancement compared to the Pt catalyst was observed and hydrogen production slowed down but still retained some activity after the cessation of the reaction (after 20 h), which observed in the kinetics plots in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4a–c</xref>. With the other WRCs due to their poor stability, the reactions lasted approximately 8–12 h. In particular, colloidal platinum easily agglomerates in the presence of methanol as demonstrated by the observation of the formation of Pt particles as a black particulate matter during irradiation. Therefore, the dispersed MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs exhibited considerable durability and significantly greater catalytic activity than commonly utilized WRCs for hydrogen production, which may be due to more efficient charge transfer occurring within the cooperative components of the photochemical reactions.</p><p>After approximately 20 h of irradiation, the hydrogen-evolution activity decreased sharply due to the decomposition of at least one component of the Ir(III) PS and MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs in the presence of a large excess of H<sub>2</sub>A. To confirm this decomposition, the PS or catalyst were re-added when the H<sub>2</sub> evolution ceased. When the MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs were re-added to the reaction solution, only 16.5 μmol H<sub>2</sub> was regenerated after another 20 h of irradiation, whereas the parallel experiment showed that the re-addition of Ir(III) PS resulted in substantial recovery of catalytic activity, as shown in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>.

A much higher TON of 1421 based on the catalyst (20 μM MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs) was obtained after 12 h of irradiation compared to that of H<sub>2</sub>A, which had a H<sub>2</sub> TON of 731 after 20 h of irradiation under the same conditions. In addition, the turnover number frequency (TOF) with TEOA was as high as 118 h<sup>−1</sup>, which is higher than that of H<sub>2</sub>A (i.e., TOF of H<sub>2</sub>A was 37 h<sup>−1</sup>). It should be noted that the lifetime of the H<sub>2</sub> evolution system with TEOA was relatively short where 87% of the total hydrogen was evolved during the first four hours. Under the same conditions using TEOA during the course of a 12 h experiment, the TON reached a maximum value of approximately 3124 at concentrations of MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs down to 1 μM. While H<sub>2</sub>A quenched the excited state of <bold>1</bold> more efficiently than TEOA, H<sub>2</sub>A was more readily oxidized than TEOA and less effective than TEOA in performing the reaction. This result is most likely due to the pH of the reaction with TEOA under optimized reaction conditions. The photocatalytic performance is closely related to the pH value of the reaction system. The effect of pH on the production of H<sub>2</sub> was investigated in the <bold>1</bold>-MoS<sub>2</sub>-TEOA systems, as shown in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>.

The size and dispersion of the MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs has an obvious effect on the improvement of the catalytic performance in photocatalytic H<sub>2</sub> production. The amount of unsaturated sulfur atoms, which reside on the MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs edges and are responsible for the high catalytic activity, increases as the particle size decreases, resulting in better dispersion and increased catalytic activity. In addition, the ability to perform as an active site is controlled by the value of the band gap in the nanoscale MoS<sub>2</sub> due to quantum size effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">supplementary Fig. S8</xref>. The reduction potential of the MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs shifts to more negative values as the size of the MoS<sub>2</sub> particle decreases, which offers the potential for proton reduction at an appreciable rate. However, the conduction band value of bulk MoS<sub>2</sub> is more positive than the proton reduction potential <italic>E</italic>(H<sup>+</sup>/H<sub>2</sub>) making bulk MoS<sub>2</sub> inactive for the formation of hydrogen.</p><p>The photocatalytic reaction in the multicomponent system involves electron transfer, which proceeds either by oxidative or reductive quenching. To determine which quenching is operative in the reaction described here, fluorescence quenching within the PS, the WRC and SR agent must be investigated. In this study, the excited state (PS*) of complex <bold>1</bold> was substantially quenched by both H<sub>2</sub>A and TEOA. However, the contribution of the WRC of MoS<sub>2</sub> to the quenching processes was difficult to estimate due to the optical properties of MoS<sub>2</sub>. In these MoS<sub>2</sub>-based systems, the amount of the SR agent is more than 1000 times that of the catalyst. The predominant pathway for electron transfer was proposed to proceed via reductive quenching derived from the rapid oxidation of H<sub>2</sub>A or TEOA combined with the strong oxidizing nature of the excited state of the PS. Previous studies have shown that the excited state of a neutral iridium complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> (i.e., Ir(ppy)<sub>3</sub> (ppy = 2-phenylpyridine)) cannot be quenched reductively by TEOA but can be oxidatively quenched by [Co(bpy)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>. Under conditions identical to those used for hydrogen production by <bold>1</bold>, hydrogen was not produced by the Ir(ppy)<sub>3</sub>-MoS<sub>2</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>A system under 12 h of visible light irradiation, which indicated that the electron was not transferred from the PS* to the catalyst, resulting in suppression in the production of hydrogen. Therefore, the reductive quenching pathway appears to be consistent with the results reported here for the photochemical system catalyzed by MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs. In the hydrogen formation process, sensitizer <bold>1</bold> harvests visible light and the excited state of the sensitizer is reductively quenched by the SR agent (H<sub>2</sub>A) to generate the activated reduced iridium species that directly delivers reducing equivalents to the MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs WRC where hydrogen is evolved.</p><p>Using adsorbing moieties, the sensitizer might be localized on the semiconductor nanoparticles to improve the electron transfer efficiency, which has been extensively employed in dye-sensitized solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. The Fourier transform IR (FT-IR) spectroscopy was used for extracting information of the binding of PS <bold>1</bold> on the MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs surface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S9</xref>). Two strong bands in the FT-IR spectrum of <bold>1</bold> appeared at approximately 1608 cm<sup>−1</sup> and 1373 cm<sup>−1</sup> corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric stretch modes of the carboxylate group, respectively. For comparison of the characteristic peaks associated with the carboxylate group, the <bold>1</bold>-sensitized MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs as a powder with diameters up to 20 nm was investigated; in the case of the colloidal MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs, the IR bands involving the PVP were superimposed over the relevant peaks. Due to the interaction between PS <bold>1</bold> and the MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs, the corresponding peaks in the adsorbed state occurred at 1602 cm<sup>−1</sup> and 1402 cm<sup>−1</sup>. Based on spectral changes and the difference between the symmetric and asymmetric bands of the carboxylate group, the binding of the carboxylate groups of PS <bold>1</bold> on the MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs surface was probably via a bridging bidentate mode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. The emission spectrum of PS <bold>1</bold> adsorbed on MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs was similar with that of <bold>1</bold> in CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> solution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S10</xref>); however, the Ir-based emissions were not detected when using other Ir(III) complexes with other substituents such as <bold>3</bold> or <bold>6</bold> as a PS for sensitizing the MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs. The photoluminescence studies provide a supplementary evidence of chemical interaction between <bold>1</bold> and the MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs. Inspired by this possibility, the use of carboxylate groups on iridium sensitizer <bold>1</bold> was expected to promote charge transfer to the catalyst resulting in improved performance of the hydrogen evolution systems. After the successful application of complex <bold>1</bold>, complex <bold>2</bold> bearing a H<sub>2</sub>bpdc ligand with structure similar to <bold>1</bold> was evaluated. As expected, when H<sub>2</sub>A was used as the SR agent, complex <bold>2</bold> also exhibited efficient activity with a 426 H<sub>2</sub> TON based on MoS<sub>2</sub> for hydrogen production, which was lower than that observed for complex <bold>1</bold> (Entry 5 in <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This result is due to a smaller quenching rate constant for H<sub>2</sub>A and a shorter excited-state lifetime of <bold>2</bold> relative to <bold>1</bold>. To further address the relationship between the performance of the photocatalytic reaction and the structure of the sensitizer, other Ir(III) complexes (<bold>3</bold>–<bold>6</bold>) with other substituents, such as –CH<sub>2</sub>OH or –NH<sub>2</sub> (see <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), which allow for structural analogues of complexes <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>, were examined as PSs for hydrogen evolution under the same conditions. Only 4, 3, 3 and 8 TON based on MoS<sub>2</sub> were observed after 20 h of irradiation for systems based on complexes <bold>3</bold>, <bold>4</bold>, <bold>5</bold> and <bold>6</bold> (Entries 6, 7, 8 and 9 in <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), respectively. In addition, the parent chromophore [Ir(ppy)<sub>2</sub>(bpy)]<sup>+</sup> was also used as a reference PS. The unbound chromophore [Ir(ppy)<sub>2</sub>(bpy)]<sup>+</sup> does not possess a moiety in the pendent groups eliminating the possibility of direct interaction between the PS and the WRC similar to complexes <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> and 48 TON based on MoS<sub>2</sub> was observed (Entries 10 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Table 2</xref>). A “standard” PS of [Ru(dmphen)<sub>3</sub>](PF<sub>6</sub>)<sub>2</sub> (dmphen = 4,7-dimethy-1,10- phenanthroline) was used under the same conditions (Entry 11 in <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) and only 92 μmol of H<sub>2</sub> with respect to MoS<sub>2</sub> was observed, which is comparable to the reported data using [Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>. The performance of these iridium PSs were also investigated using TEOA as a SR agent and TONs of 12, 15, 9 and 10 were observed after 12 h of irradiation for system based on complexes <bold>2</bold>, <bold>3</bold>, <bold>4</bold>, <bold>5</bold> and <bold>6</bold>, respectively, which are much less than those of complexes <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>.</p><p>Hydrogen is formed by photoinduced electron transfer. However, the contribution of this process to the reaction is not completely understood. In this study, the photophysical properties and the electrochemical behaviors of PSs are similar but result in completely different catalytic properties. It has been proposed that the electron transfer rates between the molecular PS and the WRC play an important role in determining the overall hydrogen evolution efficiency. In previous reports, the weak adsorption effects between iridium PSs and platinum from the vinyl or pendant pyridyl functionalities can not only facilitate fast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, directional electron transfer from the PS to the WRC but also effectively suppress the probability of bipyridyl photodissociation resulting in highly efficient activities for light-driven water reduction systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Studies on dye-sensitized MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs with improved photoelectrochemical property are rare. However, a previous study has suggested that electron injection can occur when Ru(4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine)<sub>2</sub><italic>cis</italic>(NCS)<sub>2</sub> is adsorbed on the MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoclusters via the carboxylate groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. In this study, the photocatalytic results confirmed the existence of carboxylate groups by which electron can easily transfer from the adsorbing PS to the MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs, as shown in <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>. Ease of electron transfer is extremely important in determining the enhancement of the PS performance for hydrogen production. For complexes <bold>1</bold> and 2, the DFT results indicated that the electron resides on the side of the COOH moiety upon excitation. The electron might be easier to transfer to the MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs via COOH, which may provide the active electron transfer channel. In contrast, the non-adsorbing PS may exhibit little or no attachment to the same catalyst in the colloidal MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs leading to a lower photocatalytic activity.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic representation of the electron transfer from PS 1 to the MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep04045_Fig7_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>In summary, molybdenum disulfide is an interesting hydrogen evolution catalyst because it is composed of more abundant and economical materials than are Pt-based catalysts. The utility of colloidal MoS<sub>2</sub> as a catalyst coupled with iridium sensitizers for efficient photoinduced hydrogen production was developed using a three-component systems. The combined system exhibited much better catalytic activity than that observed for the K<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>4</sub>, [Co(bpy)<sub>3</sub>]Cl<sub>2</sub>, [Rh(dtb-bpy)<sub>3</sub>](PF<sub>6</sub>)<sub>3</sub> and [Co(dmgH)<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>] catalysts under identical conditions. Due to cooperative effects, the conversion efficiency reached 12.4% at 400 nm in the Ir(III)-MoS<sub>2</sub>-TEOA system. For Ir(III) sensitizers, the substituent groups in the ancillary ligand were determined to influence their catalytic performance. The use of carboxylate groups leads to the formation of electron transfer channels promoting an increase in the electron transfer from the sensitizers to the colloidal MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs, which positively affects the activity of the catalytic system. We anticipate that this study will provide new insights into producing a robust photochemical system with an improved conversion efficiency and we believe that the promising MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs-supported catalysts has the potential for use in a hybrid energy conversion system without the use of noble-metal complexes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Syntheses</title><p>All of the iridium complexes (<bold>1</bold>–<bold>6</bold>) were prepared via the known two-step bridge-splitting procedure.
