Cyanobacteria have attracted much interest as hosts for photosynthetic chemical production due to the simplicity of culture conditions, ease of genetic manipulation and relatively fast cell growth compared to higher plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Several cyanobacterial strains have been engineered for photosynthetic chemical production. However, despite progress in metabolic manipulation and analysis, titres and productivities from cyanobacteria are still far below industrial feasibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Dependency on continuous lighting and the slow process of carbon fixation are particularly limiting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">We have previously engineered the model cyanobacterium <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> PCC 7942 to produce 2,3-butanediol (23BD) from CO<sub>2</sub> and glucose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Under natural light, chemical production from an engineered photosynthetic organism would be confined to a limited window of optimal sunlight exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, in order to achieve industrial feasibility, chemical production under both light and dark conditions is essential. As demonstrated in our previous work, concurrent expression of heterologous sugar importers and the 23BD biosynthetic pathway genes allows for chemical production and growth from both CO<sub>2</sub> and glucose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The oxidation of sugars provides an increased supply of metabolites and energy independent of photosynthesis, allowing for faster cell growth and continuous chemical production throughout diurnal conditions (12 h light/12 h dark).</p><p id="Par5">Carbon yield is one of the most important factors for economic feasibility and is calculated based on the theoretical maximum yield (TMY). In this study, two substrates, CO<sub>2</sub> and glucose, are utilized simultaneously. Owing to their concurrent use and culturing conditions that allow for gas exchange with the environment, it is impossible to directly measure TMY from both substrates. Therefore, we evaluate photomixotrophic production by calculating TMY possible from glucose alone (0.5 g<sub>23BD</sub>/<italic>g</italic><sub>glucose</sub>). TMY values above 100% indicate 23BD production beyond what is possible from glucose alone, and we assume that these yields reflect the incorporation of CO<sub>2</sub> in addition to glucose. It is important to note that glucose utilization is not 100% efficient. The value of the TMY minus the maximum contribution from glucose (100%) represents only the minimum value for CO<sub>2</sub> incorporation, and the true contribution is likely higher.</p><p id="Par6">The carbon yield achieved in our previous study was 40% of TMY<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, with great potential for improvement. Thus, the goal of this study is to optimize glucose and CO<sub>2</sub> utilization and to improve 23BD production and yield. To accomplish this, we identify and relieve bottlenecks in glucose catabolism, deregulate and enhance CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, combine successful modifications and characterize the resulting strain in a variety of production conditions.</p><p id="Par7">Carbon flux in cyanobacteria is often limited by the carbon fixation step in the Calvin Benson (CB) cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. To overcome this, much work has been done to improve the catalytic activity of the key carbon fixation enzyme, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO), but with very limited success<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Several studies have shown that the catalytic efficiency of RuBisCO is already naturally optimized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">Rather than focusing on improving RuBisCO, we examine carbon metabolism as a whole. Enzyme and metabolite pools of the regenerative phase of the CB cycle are proposed to play a role in determining the overall carbon fixation rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Modifications of other steps in the CB cycle, such as those catalysed by sedoheptulose 1,7-bisphosphatase and transketolase, have been utilized to improve carbon fixation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Therefore, we hypothesize that the supplementary carbon source glucose would increase availability of the substrate for carbon fixation, <sc>D</sc>-ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (R15P), and enhance efficiency of the reaction catalysed by RuBisCO.</p><p id="Par9">Here we propose a strategy to increase carbon fixation and chemical production in cyanobacterial grown under light and dark conditions. First, glucose metabolism is rewired through the oxidative pentose phosphate (OPP) pathway to overproduce ribulose-5-phosphate (Ru5P), a precursor of the CO<sub>2</sub> fixation pathway. Next, because carbon metabolism in cyanobacteria is precisely controlled in response to environmental changes such as light and carbon availability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, <italic>cp12</italic>, a regulatory gene of the CB cycle, is deleted to amplify conversion of Ru5P to R15P (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). This integrated approach of essential gene overexpression and deletion of <italic>cp12</italic> allows for enhanced CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, a remarkable increase of 23BD production in both light and dark conditions through light-independent supply of glucose carbons (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a,b</xref>), and could be applied as a general strategy for improving the efficiency of other photosynthetic organisms.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Rewiring of carbon metabolism in cyanobacteria.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Photoautotrophic conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to 23BD and biomass.

Three main pathways for glucose catabolism in cyanobacteria were investigated: the OPP pathway, the EMP pathway and the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Genes encoding the following enzymes were chosen as deletion targets in order to assess the metabolic contribution of each pathway: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (encoded by <italic>zwf</italic>, <bold>Strain 4</bold>) and 6-phosphogluconate (6PG) dehydrogenase (<italic>gnd</italic>, <bold>Strain 5</bold>) of the OPP pathway, phosphoglucose isomerase (<italic>pgi</italic>, <bold>Strain 6</bold>) and phosphofructokinase (<italic>pfk</italic>, <bold>Strain 7</bold>) of the EMP pathway, and 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate 6-phosphate aldolase (<italic>eda</italic>, <bold>Strain 8</bold>) of the ED pathway (<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Gene replacement with an antibiotic resistance gene and complete segregation of <bold>Strains 4</bold> (Δ<italic>zwf</italic>) and <bold>7</bold> (Δ<italic>pfk</italic>) were verified by PCR and sequencing. However, despite repeated trials, complete deletion of <italic>gnd, pgi</italic> and <italic>eda</italic> from the genome could not be achieved, indicating that these genes were essential in our culture conditions.

However, other mutants showed no significant changes in growth or 23BD production compared to <bold>Strain 3</bold> (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). Impairment of growth and 23BD production of <bold>Strain 4</bold> suggested that glucose is metabolized through the OPP pathway, but if that were the case, then we would expect <bold>Strain 5</bold> to also display defects. That <bold>Strain 5</bold> (or <bold>Strains 6–8</bold>) did not show growth or 23BD production defects makes it uncertain which of the three pathways was primarily responsible for metabolizing fed glucose. Also, it is possible that pathway disruption was compensated for by upregulation of other glucose metabolism pathways. Therefore, we decided to individually overexpress genes of all three pathways in order to test their influence on 23BD production.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Guiding glucose flux in central carbon metabolism</title><p id="Par13">To determine which pathway is responsible for glucose metabolism, and to explore the benefits of directed glucose flux, we overexpressed the key genes of each pathway (<bold>Strains 9</bold>, <italic>galP-zwf-edd</italic> (ED); <bold>10</bold>, <italic>galP-pgi</italic> (EMP); <bold>11</bold>, <italic>galP-zwf-gnd</italic> (OPP), <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2544">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> enzyme assays confirmed the functional expression of each genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2544">Supplementary Table 4</xref>).

Therefore, <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments were conducted to test the effects of these overexpressed genes on growth and 23BD production. Strains were grown with the addition of glucose under continuous light for 72 h (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c–e</xref>). We expected an increase in growth, 23BD production and/or increased glucose consumption to be correlated with overexpression of an active glucose metabolism pathway. <bold>Strain 9</bold> (<italic>galP-zwf-edd</italic>) showed similar growth and glucose consumption rates compared to <bold>Strain 3</bold> (<italic>galP</italic>), but decreased 23BD production (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c–e</xref>). By contrast, the growth rates of <bold>Strains 10</bold> (<italic>galP-pgi</italic>) and <bold>11</bold> (<italic>galP-zwf-gnd</italic>) were enhanced by 87% and 82%, respectively (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>), and the glucose consumption rates of these strains increased by 118% and 129%, respectively, compared to <bold>Strain 3</bold> (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). This provides strong evidence that glucose is metabolized through both the EMP and the OPP pathways. However, the 23BD production of <bold>Strains 10</bold> and <bold>11</bold> was reduced compared to that of <bold>Strain 3</bold> (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>), suggesting that a larger portion of carbon flux from glucose was utilized for biomass formation rather than 23BD production in <bold>Strains 10</bold> and <bold>11</bold>. To improve glucose consumption by the ED pathway, we modified <bold>Strain 9</bold> by additionally expressing the downstream gene, <italic>eda</italic>, resulting in <bold>Strain 9–2</bold>. Similarly, we expressed <italic>pfkA</italic> from the EMP pathway, resulting in <bold>Strain 10-2</bold> (<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

Because glucose metabolism was improved in <bold>Strains 10</bold> and <bold>11</bold> (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>), we next focused on redirecting carbon flux towards 23BD production rather than biomass formation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Redirection of carbon flux towards 23BD biosynthesis</title><p id="Par14">We also wanted to explore whether modification to the CB cycle and its regulation would be beneficial for our production strain. Specifically, we sought to direct more carbon flux through the CB cycle by overexpressing crucial genes of the pathway and removing native regulation of the cycle. CP12 is a small regulatory protein that represses two important enzymes of the CB cycle, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and phosphoribulokinase (PRK). We hypothesized that the deletion of <italic>cp12</italic> could be effective for redirecting the carbon flux through the CB cycle towards 23BD production. CP12 is activated in response to an elevated NAD(H)/NADP(H) ratio, a condition that was previously observed in photomixotrophic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> and dark<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> conditions. Once activated, CP12 inhibits GAPDH, which controls the carbon flux towards the lower EMP pathway in cyanobacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. CP12 also inhibits PRK, which is responsible for the conversion of Ru5P to R15P, the substrate for the CO<sub>2</sub> fixation by RuBisCO (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Thus, the deletion of <italic>cp12</italic> should increase carbon flux to the CB cycle, and may increase the rate of CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, both of which should increase the intracellular pool of pyruvate and lead to an improvement in 23BD production.</p><p id="Par15">To test whether changing regulation of carbon metabolism could increase carbon flow to 23BD biosynthesis, we constructed three strains.

We used glucose supplementation to boost R15P supply (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>), and deleted <italic>cp12</italic> to increase PRK-catalysed conversion of Ru5P into R15P. As expected, R15P content was the highest in <bold>Strain 15</bold> grown with glucose in both light and dark conditions (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e,f</xref>), suggesting that carbon flux in the CO<sub>2</sub> fixation pathway was significantly improved. These results also demonstrate the synergistic effects of deregulating carbon fixation and enhancing glucose catabolism for biomass and chemical production.</p><p id="Par29">Improved carbon fixation in <bold>Strain 15</bold> was also beneficial for long-term production under continuous and diurnal light conditions. With continuous lighting, we demonstrated a 23BD production titre of 12.6 g l<sup>−1</sup> from 18.5 g l<sup>−1</sup> glucose in 12 days. This yield (136%) greatly exceeded the TMY, indicating simultaneous use of glucose and CO<sub>2</sub>. Unexpectedly, yield from diurnal light conditions was even more efficient: 5.7 g l<sup>−1</sup> 23BD produced from 6.1 g l<sup>−1</sup> glucose in 8 days, which is 195% of TMY. This suggests that CO<sub>2</sub> fixation and recycling were key to improving carbon yield, even during dark phases, and can be partially explained by changes in the carbon flux through the CB cycle during darkness (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2544">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). Furthermore, cell growth in diurnal conditions was decreased compared to constant light conditions (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), suggesting that yield was improved by partitioning carbon to 23BD production rather than biomass formation.</p><p id="Par30">An alternative strategy to photomixotrophic production has been previously demonstrated: a CO<sub>2</sub> fixation pathway consisting of PRK and RuBisCO was introduced into the heterotrophic organism, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, to improve ethanol yield<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.

However, carboxylation exclusive to a particular biosynthetic pathway is limited in applicability. By contrast, RuBisCO carboxylation is connected to central carbon metabolism, and thus to a range of chemical production pathways. Indeed, our method for improvement of carboxylation could be applied to increase photosynthetic production of a wide range of chemicals.</p><p id="Par31">The strategy utilized in our study improved the productivity, titre and yield of 23BD production (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Although cyanobacteria have been engineered to produce a number of compounds, the productivities and titres are much too low (most on the order of mg l<sup>−1</sup>) to commercialize these technologies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2544">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). In addition, strains developed for photoautotrophic production are restricted by light availability, even though dense cultures (OD<sub>730</sub>&gt;5) are often required for efficient production. This presents a challenge since light penetrance is hindered by mutual cell shading, resulting in decreased light availability per cell, and arrested cell growth and chemical production. In addition, in natural lighting conditions the active growth and production period falls to 8–14 h per day. Our approach overcomes these obstacles, providing significant improvements to chemical production in a variety of industrially relevant lighting and growth conditions. Economic analysis of 23BD production in diurnal light conditions using a semi-open pond illuminated by natural sunlight showed that operation profit could be increased fivefold in photomixotrophic conditions compared to photoautotrophic conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2544">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2544">Supplementary Note 2</xref>). This is despite the additional production costs required for photomixotrophic cultures, such as feedstock cost and steam sterilization of production media. In light conditions, it is advantageous to maximize cell density for chemical production. Sugar supplementation in these conditions may prove useful for overcoming density-dependent light deficiencies in phototrophic cultures. The described approach allows the engineered strains to produce and grow without light, capitalizing on night time hours. Glucose supplementation would also avoid issues with sunlight variability. In addition, the engineered strain’s high titre and productivity provide groundwork for production in smaller surface area bioreactors relative to outdoor photoautotrophic production. The recent development of less expensive light-emitting diode (LED) can provide optimal light intensity and wavelength for an energy-efficient production system. (Stored electricity generated from a renewable source, such as a solar panel or wind turbine, would be utilized to power the light-emitting diode.) Faster growth in a smaller surface area system may reduce the risk of contamination compared to current outdoor systems. Hence, this study demonstrates the many advantages of a next-generation scheme of cyanobacterial chemical production with potential for broad applicability in industrial production systems.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Reagents</title><p id="Par32">The following reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich: glucose, 1,3-propanediol, phenylboronic acid, cycloheximide, 23BD, acetoin, pyruvate, PEP, 6PG, G6P, F6P, Ru5P, R15P, ATP, dithiothreitol (DTT), NADH, NADPH, NADP<sup>+</sup>, phosphocreatine, RuBisCO, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, G6P dehydrogenase, 3PGA kinase, GAPDH and creatine kinase.
