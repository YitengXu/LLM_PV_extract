Biopolymers are chain-like molecules composed of repeated chemical blocks derived from renewable resources that may decay in the environment. The usage of biomaterials is becoming more popular as a means of reducing the use of non-renewable resources and reducing environmental pollution produced by synthetic materials. Biopolymers' biodegradability and non-toxic nature help to maintain our environment clean and safe. This study discusses how to improve the mechanical and physical characteristics of biopolymers, particularly in the realm of bioengineering. The paper begins with a fundamental introduction and progresses to a detailed examination of synthesis and a unique investigation of several recent focused biopolymers with mechanical, physical, and biological characterization. Biopolymers' unique non-toxicity, biodegradability, biocompatibility, and eco-friendly features are boosting their applications, especially in bioengineering fields, including agriculture, pharmaceuticals, biomedical, ecological, industrial, aqua treatment, and food packaging, among others, at the end of this paper. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the relevance of biopolymers in smart and novel bioengineering applications.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Graphical abstract</title><p id="Par2"><fig id="Figa" position="anchor"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/289_2022_4443_Figa_HTML.png" position="anchor" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par3">The Graphical abstract represents the biological sources and applications of biopolymers.

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par92">Monomers are simple building blocks. A polymer is a substance made up of a large number of molecules with a high molecular mass. A polymer is created by the repeating unit of a monomer chain, which can occur naturally (natural polymer) or be created artificially (manmade polymer or synthetically derived polymer). Biopolymers are natural polymers found in living organisms. A biopolymer is a long chain molecule made up of monomeric components that are covalently bound together to produce a biodegradable molecule. Plants, trees, microbes, and other natural sources are the primary sources of biopolymers. Synthetic polymers are simpler and more arbitrary than biopolymers, which are complex molecules with well-defined three-dimensional structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Renewable resources are used to create a wide range of biopolymeric materials with various physical and chemical characteristics. Nature contains lignin, starch, cellulose, hemicelluloses, and a variety of other biopolymers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Biopolymer's future demands on manufacturers for novel materials are enormous. However, because the materials are being given expressly for sustainable development, their cost-effectiveness must improve. The qualities of these polymers should be used in applications that utilize novel materials, and products should be produced based on those features. They are beginning to appear as a result of this for being more responsible in caring for the planet we live in. New biodegradable polymers with good skeletal and mechanical characteristics have been the focus of recent study. Biopolymers originating from natural organisms have been manufactured in enormous quantities. The biodegradability of biopolymers has been linked to the presence of certain microorganisms and enzymes with distinct degradable characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The biodegradability of biopolymers is facile, because the biopolymers are bearing the oxygen and nitrogen atom in their skeletal backbone. Biopolymer is converted to CO<sub>2</sub>, water, biomass, humid water, and other natural components during biodegradation. Biodegradable polymers offer a wide range of applications in bioengineering, including tissue engineering, drug delivery systems, and wound dressing, among others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Biopolymers have a distinctive helical structure, stiffness, charge-free chains, and a strong resistance to salt and cold; thus, they thicken and stabilize better under harsh pool conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>General conversion of monomer to polymer</title><p id="Par93">Monomers are small molecules, most of which are organic, that may combine with other monomers to produce larger molecules, known as polymers. Every monomer molecule has the ability to make chemical connections with at least two other monomers. Polymers are a type of synthetic material made up of several smaller pieces known as monomers. Polymers are chains of monomeric units with an undetermined number of them. Polymerization is a chemical reaction in which a large number of monomer molecules combine to produce a polymer (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). A polymerization can yield macromolecules with a linear or branching structure. They can also take the form of a three-dimensional complicated network. The basic approach for converting monomer to polymer is shown in the diagram depicted below.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Polymerization of monomer to polymer</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/289_2022_4443_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Biopolymer and classification of biopolymers</title><p id="Par94">Biopolymers are naturally occurring polymer found in living organisms such as plants, animals, microbes and other natural sources. Biopolymers are basically classified according to their origins, into two groups, i.e., natural and synthetic biopolymer and classified in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Classification of biopolymers</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/289_2022_4443_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO3"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Natural biopolymer</title><p id="Par95">Natural biopolymer is a biopolymer that formed organically from living organisms. Proteins and polysaccharides are biopolymers that fall under the category of natural biopolymers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Protein</title><p id="Par96">Proteins are big, complex molecules that serve a number of important functions in the human body. Proteins are made up of hundreds or thousands of smaller components known as amino acids that are linked in lengthy chains. They perform the majority of the work in cells and are essential for the construction, function, and control of the body's tissues and organs. A protein is made up of 20 distinct types of amino acids that may be combined in different ways. Plant proteins, such as those found in foods like wheat, corn, and soybeans, are more immunogenic than animal proteins. Plant proteins have a low molecular weight and a large net negative charge, which makes them ideal for effective medication delivery. Proteins are hydrophilic in nature because they include polar amino acids, which attract cells sympathetically. Natural biopolymers such as collagen, silk, and fibrinogens are accessible; commercially available collagens are utilized as injections for skin sensitization and antibody responses, as well as immunological uses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Proteins' main structure is made up of peptide bonds and disulfide bonds. A peptide bond is produced when the carboxyl group of one molecule combines with the amino group of the other molecule, releasing a molecule of water in the process (H<sub>2</sub>O). This is a condensation process (also known as a dehydration synthesis reaction) that happens between amino acids. The mechanism of a peptide bond is seen in the diagram below (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Peptide bond formation in protein biomolecules</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/289_2022_4443_Fig3_HTML.png" id="MO4"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Polysaccharide</title><p id="Par97">Polysaccharides are lengthy chains of monosaccharides connected by glycosidic linkages that our bodies normally employ for energy or to aid cellular structure. Chitosan, chitin, alginic acid, starch, cellulose, konjac, and gums (guar gum, gum Arabic, gum karaya, etc.) are examples of naturally occurring polysaccharides. Chitosan is a natural polysaccharide with a wide range of uses in medication administration and tissue engineering. In the food business, alginic acid is used extensively in food processing and manufacturing. Starch is a typical natural polysaccharide that is used as a coating and adhesive because it is water-insoluble [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Synthetic biopolymer</title><p id="Par98">Synthetic biopolymers are polymers that have been modified from natural polymers or chemically produced from synthetic monomers such that they can degrade naturally without leaving residues that are hazardous to living things and the ecosystem. Synthetic biopolymers have received a lot of interest in recent years due to their significant advantages over natural polymers in terms of stability and flexibility to fit a wide range of applications. Synthetic biopolymers, on the other hand, are preferred over synthetic polymers due to their biodegradable qualities and environmental safety. Synthetic biopolymer synthesis may now be tuned to match specific applications thanks to breakthroughs in new molecular designing tools and polymer chemistry. Because of some of its unique qualities, including as stability, controlled release, no immunogenicity, and removal from the body, synthetic biopolymers have found one of their most important uses in the medical industry, which matches their application in human bodies. In comparison with ceramic and metal particles, synthetic biopolymers are easier to produce in many shapes and sizes. They are used in industry and have cheap production costs, and they play a vital part in our daily lives. Enzymes and live cells generally carry out biopolymer synthesis to the target biopolymer molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Synthetic biopolymers are generally classified into two categories, i.e., non-biodegradable biopolymers and degradable biopolymers.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Non-biodegradable biopolymer</title><p id="Par99">Non-biodegradable polymers are those that are resistant to environmental breakdown and hence end up in the form of garbage. Non-biodegradable biopolymers are resistant to the environment and are often used in non-biomedical applications. Some common examples are PA, PVC, PP, PE, PMMA, polycarbonate, PU, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Biodegradable biopolymer</title><p id="Par100">Biodegradable polymers are those that breakdown when exposed to the elements. Biopolymer's biodegradability makes it a viable alternative for replacing petrochemical-based packaging materials. Synthetically biodegradable polymers are made in a controlled environment and have consistent skeletal and mechanical characteristics, such as rigidity and accomplished modulus. When compared to biological scaffolds, they are less expensive to make and promote contact with endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Artificially generated biodegradable synthetic polymers serve an important role in tissue engineering and other biological fields. The decomposition of synthetic polymers is accomplished by simple hydrolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. PGA, PLA, PCL, PHB, PPF, PDS, etc., which are the synthetically biodegradable polymers have been used in medicine and pharmaceuticals process.

Esterification is a chemical reaction that produces an ester (RCOOR) and water by combining alcohol (ROH) with an organic acid (RCOOH). Through an esterification reaction between a carboxylic acid and an alcohol, this chemical reaction produces at least one ester product. The esterification of following biopolymer starch, cellulose, and hemicelluloses is given below.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Esterification of cellulose</title><p id="Par109">Esterification of cellulose occurs either in throughout polymeric chain or occurs at outer cellulose thread to design cellulose ester. When enormous amounts of cellulose are generated by a homogeneous or heterogeneous process, the surface is altered. Cellulose nitrate (CN) is the most widely used inorganic cellulose ester, with huge volumes generated in industry. It's commonly found in plastics, coatings, explosives, and propellants, among other things. In heterogeneous equilibrium, the esterification of cellulose nitrate is carried out by cellulose and a combination of nitric acid and sulfuric acid with a degree of substitution (1.8–2.8). The heterogeneous direct reaction between cellulose and sulfuric acid is known as CS esterification. Synthetic CS is formed through the displacement of an ether or ester group in cellulose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Esterification of starch</title><p id="Par110">As an esterification reagent, acetic acid and acetic anhydride are used to make starch acetate. The pH, time interval, and the presence of a catalytic agent all influence the incorporation of acetyl groups into starch molecules. For low (0.01–0.2), medium (0.2–1.5), and high (1.5–3) acetyl starch, the degree of substation (DS) ranges from 0.01 to 0.2. The alkenyl succinic anhydride DDSA is a unique alkenyl succinic anhydride. The esterification of DDSA starch in an aqueous solution produces a water-resistant product that is widely utilized in the film and paper industries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Esterification of hemicellulose</title><p id="Par111">Hemicellulose is a polymer present in plant dell cells and cell walls. Hemicelluloses, a biopolymer used to make films and hydrogels, has been employed in biomedical applications such as medication delivery and tissue engineering. Chemical synthesis of hemicellulose yields furfural, xylitol, ethanol, and lactic acid. The eco-friendliness, low hydrophobicity, higher electrochemical and thermal balance, and faster reaction rate of biomaterials such as cationic hemicelluloses, carboxymethyl hemicelluloses, lauroylated hemicelluloses, and acylated hemicelluloses are the homogenous upgradation of hemicellulose. The esterification of xylan-rich hemicelluloses with maleic anhydride in the presence of a catalyst, LiOH, in an ionic liquid medium under homogeneous conditions with a degree of substation (DS) of (0.095–0.75) has a wide range of applications in agriculture, food, waste water treatment, and pharmaceutical industries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Dehydration of biopolymers</title><p id="Par112">Trehalose's exceptional performance as a cryo- and dehydroprotectant of fluctuating systems is the dehydration of biopolymer. Cyclodextrins (CDs) have been employed as a dehydrating agent to increase the mechanical potentiality of proteins using the dehydration technique. Chemical conjugation between enzymes and CD derivatives in aqueous medium leads in enhanced thermal stability of the enzymes due to supramolecular superior reciprocal action on the enzyme surface. The bimolecular of biopolymer is well protected by dehydration of the biopolymer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Glass transition features are seen in the biopolymer polysaccharide. The glass transition affects the thermal characteristics of native dehydrate biopolymers in a significant way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

Many biological uses of CMC and NaCMC have been investigated because of their excellent gelation ability and pH-sensitive swelling capabilities, notably the development of smart stimuli responsive hydrogels for controlled drug administration. This new study shows how to make hydrogels with redox and pH-responsive behavior, better mechanical characteristics and swellability by cross-linking CMC/quaternized chitosan (HACC) hydrogels. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), a broad-spectrum anticancer drug, was included into the composite hydrogels. Under physiological settings (pH 7.4), the model drug's release was maintained, but it was accelerated in an acidic or reducing environment. Because of its cheap cost, biodegradability, biocompatibility, non-toxicity, and minor immunogenicity, CMC has been extensively employed in tissue engineering applications. Biomimetic CMC/dopamine tissue adhesive hydrogels were inspired by mussel sticky proteins.

Konjac glucomannan has been shown in biomedical studies to improve health by limiting cholesterol in the blood and striving to improve carbohydrate metabolic activity, bowel movement, and colonic ecosystems. KGM is a staple ingredient that is commonly used to thicken and bind gravies, curries, sauces, animal fat, and livestock. In an alkaline medium or when coupled with certain other hydrocolloids like as xanthan gum or k-carrageenan, KGM can form hydro gel. These gels are essential building blocks in a variety of food implementations, including jelly, noodles, tofu, and snacks. Collagen and KGM have been used to transport drugs in living organisms. The combined emulsion effect of collagen and konjac glucomannan can improve collagen dissolution in aqueous. The physical properties of collagen, KGM, polyphenols, and ginsenoside Rb1 with polyphenols and ginsenoside Rb1 may influence the ability to control release of drug.

KGM is extensively used in pharmaceutical and food applications due to its high viscosity, extremely good water retention capabilities, gelling potency, non-toxicity, biocompatibility and biodegradability. Recently, a KGM-based superabsorbent polymer (KSAP) was created by grafting acrylic acid (AA) onto a KGM template and irradiating it with 60Co-g at room temperature. FTIR spectroscopy and SEM imaging data analysis were used to characterize KSAP. The transplant of AA onto KGM was revealed by the large effect in bands in the FTIR spectra of KSAP, KGM, and AA. XRD patterns revealed that crystalline structure in KSAP was lower than in native KGM. SEM images revealed a rough surface in the case of KGM and a micro porosity in the case of KSAP. The relatively hydrophilic nature of KSAP resulted in greater velocity and abilities for water absorption. Graft copolymers compiled with an amount of radiation of 5.0 kGy and a monomer to KGM ratio of 5 could accumulate 625 times their dry weight in water. Ions, especially multivalent positively charged ions, considerably lowered KSAP's water permeability power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. In comparison with many other thermoreversible gels, KGM forms a thermally balance gel after the addition of an alkaline agglomeration, and the gelation of KGM is aided by heating. Gelation happen as a consequence of the arrangement of a network structure of crossing zones that are thought to be established by hydrogen bonding. The green pharmaceutical characteristics of KGM that contribute for its behavior in nanotechnology based drug delivery mechanism include its elevated concentrations of mannose, which effectually enables the communication of KGM with biotic surfaces that really are extremely lucrative in mannose synapses, such as M-cells enveloping Peyer's fragments and phagocytosis.

By solubilizing phosphorylated KGM in the nanoparticle rescinding medium, it was possible to incorporate it onto the nanoparticle configuration. Intra—molecular hydrogen bonds, as well as electrostatic interactions among oppositely charged groups in phosphorylated KGM derivative and free – NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> in chitosan, are responsible for the heterotypic relationship in this co-gelled system. As the chitosan/konjac glucomannan ratio changes from 6/6 to 6/24, the nanoparticles' hydrodynamic diameter decreases from 800 to 400 nm. Regardless of the CS/ KGM ratio, the zeta potential of these nanoparticles was close to the expected neutral value, ranging from − 0.4 to − 2.3 mV for about the same content. This has been explained as a result of the plant polysaccharide shielding the chitosan charges. The addition of KGM fiber to a diet may enhance metabolic functional capacity in humans, and rats with low levels of KGM have lower plasma cholesterol. KGM can also be fabricated into films or formed into blend film for coating and packaging implementations, and KGM gels have considerable potential applications in a controlled release matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Lignin</title><p id="Par145">Lignin is the second most prevalent biomaterial in plant species after cellulose and is a fundamental natural biopolymer found in the cell walls of woody materials.

Lignin, the second most prevalent renewable bio-resource after cellulose, is regarded as a solid waste in a variety of industrial processes. Attempts to valorize lignin have been posted in a large number of articles and reports in recent years. The significant characteristics of lignin, such as its abundance, inexpensive, and biodegradability, increasing carbon content, aromaticity, and reinforcing abilities, make it an excellent candidate as a potential component for bio-composites. Over 50 million tons of lignin are produced as a by-product of bio refineries each year, with 98 percent of it being burned to generate energy. Only 2% of the lignin has been used for other purposes, primarily as dispersants, adhesives, and fillers. Commercial lignin consists primarily of lignosulfonates from sulfite pulp mills (approximately 1 mill. ton/year) and less than 100,000 tons/year of Kraft lignin (KL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>].</p><p id="Par147">Depending on the application, lignin can be used as a factor in biocomposites with or without modification. Acetylated KL was used to optimize its affinity with PLA. The incarnation of Kraft lignin, on the other hand, diminished the tensile ultimate strength of the PLA with rising lignin loadings of 10% and 20%. Additionally, when acetylated lignin was combined with a thermoplastic, the tensile strength was increased. Lignin can be integrated directly into a polymeric matrix without reconfiguration, such as a UV-light stabilizer, antioxidant, flame retardant, plasticizer, and flow enhancer, to reduce the cost of manufacture, plastic, and potentially enhance mechanical characteristics. Lignin can also be used as a coupling agent in bio composites made from natural fibers. Lignin can act as a cross-linking agent between hydrophilic fibers and hydrophobic matrix polymers, thereby reinforcing the fiber matrix interface. Lignin therapies of hemp and flax fibers have been shown to improve the compatibility of the fibers with the thermoset matrix, thereby enhancing the mechanical strength of the biocomposites. When compression-molded PLA-cotton composites were treated with lignin, the tensile properties improved.

However, the eliminated soil that has been cross-linked by synthetic polymers is not biodegradable. To address the aforementioned issue, an attempt was made to use lignin polyol to stabilize sand.

It can be easily processed into molded pieces, film, or fibers using ordinary plastic processing equipment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>]. PLA is one of the most promising biopolymers as a bioabsorbable polymer since the monomers may be made from non-toxic renewable feedstock and because it is a naturally occurring organic acid. PLA has stereoisomers such as poly(L-lactide) (PLLA), poly(D-lactide) (PDLA), and poly(DL-lactide) (PDLLA). Lactic acid (2-hydroxypropionic acid, LA), a PLA component unit, occurs as two enantiomers, L- and D-lactic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>].

As a result, PLA is a more environmentally friendly substance with greater properties for usage in the human body (non-toxicity). PLA is the first commercial polymer made from renewable resources that are harvested once a year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>].</p><p id="Par170">Poly(lactic acid) is made through a polycondensation process that starts with lactic acid. L-lactide polymerization gives PLLA, whereas D-lactide polymerization yields PDLA. Except for stereochemistry, PLLA and PDLA exhibit identical characteristics. PLA may also be made with different proportions of L and D lactide. After the polymerization process, the un-reacted monomer must be removed by washing with ethanol, since the remaining monomer in the polymeric matrix might function as a plasticizer, lowering the mechanical strength and thermal stability of PLA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>].

In vivo tests show that PLA strength is sufficient for 8–12 weeks after implantation. PLA may be useful for internal bone fixation, according to these data. PLA has also been shown to retain a high level of infertility, which aids in infection prevention. To promote cell proliferation, orthopedic implantables made of PLA can be injected with osteogenic or anabolic bioactive. Biodegradable fixation devices can help prevent osteopenia from occurring as a result of stress shielding caused by metallic implants. PLA produced with a L-LA/D-LA ratio of 85/15 was effectively employed to make screws and fixing plates for fracture fixation. The findings demonstrated that the plates may be used to mend fractures without the requirement for extra support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>].</p><p id="Par172">PLA has the potential to play a substantial role in tissue regeneration. PLA scaffolds may carry bioactive medicines that aid wound healing, similar to drug delivery systems targeting carcinomas. Drug-loaded PLA scaffolds, on the other hand, may be limited owing to unanticipated changes in the scaffold's and/or pharmaceuticals' characteristics during the synthesis method. The PLA/PEG-based porous matrix films for the delivery of gentamicin sulfate or metronidazole for wound dressing treatment have been described in recent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>]. PLA-based drug delivery systems have showed potential in cancer therapy therapeutic methods. PLA scaffolds offer a particularly desirable property for drug delivery systems: long-term drug release, thanks to their adjustable breakdown rate. In cervical cancer mice models and in vitro studies, PLA stereo complexes demonstrated drug transport potential. Improved tumor cell absorption of anti-tumor drugs is aided by sustained doxorubicin release. As a consequence, as compared to non-loaded drug performance, tumor cell activity was reduced using the drug delivery mechanism. Doxorubicin-loaded stereocomplex micelles also showed increased tumor prevention rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>].

The procedure used will be determined by the qualities of the film as well as the microorganism to be utilized. The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute standards for macrodilution and microdilution in broth might be used to test antimicrobial activity. Employing bigger volumes and, as a result, more samples, macrodilution is used. In both situations, the microorganism was put in varied quantities to the tubes (macrodilution) or 96 microplate wells (microdilution), and the films were added in proportion. There were both positive and negative controls. Using pure medium as a control, the final concentration was determined as the minimum concentration that resulted in no observable bacterium development after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, depending on the studied microorganism. The biostatic level was evaluated by plating a 100 L solution from the test tubes onto agar plates without obvious bacteria growth and incubated for further 24 h at 37 °C.
