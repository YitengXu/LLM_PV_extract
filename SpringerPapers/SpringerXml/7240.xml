Nutrients, chiefly nitrogen and phosphorus, are a key cost for growing microalgae, but these nutrients are present in abundance in municipal wastewater where they pose environmental problems if not removed. This is not a traditional review article; rather, it is a fact-based set of suggestions that will have to be investigated by scientists and engineers. It is suggested that if microalgae were grown as biofilms rather than as planktonic cells, and if internal illumination rather than external illumination were employed, then the use of microalgae may provide useful improvements to the wastewater treatment process. The use of microalgae to remove nutrients from wastewater has been demonstrated, but has not yet been widely implemented due to cost, and because microalgae derived from wastewater treatment has not yet been demonstrated as a commercial source for value-added products. Future facilities are likely to be called Municipal Resource Recovery Facilities as wastewater will increasingly be viewed as a resource for water, biofuels, fertilizer, monitoring public health and value-added products. Advances in photonics will accelerate this transition.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Wastewater</kwd><kwd>Microalgae</kwd><kwd>Anaerobic digestion</kwd><kwd>Photodecarboxylase</kwd><kwd>Nutrient recycling</kwd><kwd>Biofilms</kwd><kwd>Internal illumination</kwd><kwd>Photobiology</kwd><kwd>Optical fibers</kwd><kwd>LED</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>none</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>90</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>King Fahd University of Petroleum &amp;

Not only is it costly to provide chemical nutrients to support microalgal growth, but the availability of phosphorus in particular could well become a limiting factor in the foreseeable future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. By using microalgae to treat wastewater, the cost of growing microalgae can be reduced as the nutrients in wastewater, chiefly nitrogen and phosphorus, can be recycled and used by microalgae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The application of microalgae to treat wastewater has primarily focused on polishing wastewater to remove nitrogen and phosphorus after the majority of organic contaminants have been removed, but some studies have demonstrated that microalgae can be used instead of the activated sludge process as the main treatment for the removal of organic and inorganic contaminants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

While the utilization of nutrients present in wastewater can reduce the cost of growing microalgae, the avoidance of environmental problems due to nutrients in wastewater effluent provides an even more important reason to consider the use of microalgae to improve wastewater treatment.</p><p id="Par17">Wastewater treatment challenges include land availability, cost and effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Growing microalgae as biofilms, rather than as planktonic cells in solution, can facilitate the growth and harvesting of algal biomass and advances in photobiology can decrease the cost of growing microalgae, particularly as biofilms. The objective of this manuscript is to describe how photobiology can benefit wastewater treatment and lead to the development of a mature technology for the production of renewable energy and multiple biorefinery products from microalgae. The specific contribution to the literature made by this manuscript is to discuss how the diverse topics of wastewater treatment, microalgae, biofilms, internal illumination of photobioreactors, renewable energy, LEDs, photobiology, photoenzymes, materials science, artificial intelligence, robotics and engineering can all contribute to the development of future processes for the treatment of wastewater, recycling of nutrients and the production of bioproducts. Interdisciplinary research will be required to develop less expensive LEDs, inexpensive material suitable for the internal illumination of photobioreactors, the maximization of illuminated surface area for the growth of biofilm, the integration of microalgae into wastewater treatment, nutrient recycling and the production of value-added products. Researchers in these areas may be unaware of the collaborative opportunities in the use of microalgae in wastewater treatment and increased communication to stimulate research is the goal. The use of microalgae to treat wastewater, the growth of microalgae as biofilms and the use of internal illumination in microalgae photobioreactors are not new concepts, but what is new is increased awareness regarding recycling nutrients from wastewater, rapid innovation with a variety of renewable energy technologies, new discoveries in photobiology, decreasing costs for LEDs, an increased use of robotic devices to automate processes and increased interest in developing circular economies. This field is ripe for innovation and cross-discipline collaboration, and a goal of this manuscript to promote an awareness of the challenges and opportunities. Wastewater should be viewed as a resource rather than as an expense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Wastewater Treatment Overview</title><p id="Par18">Municipal wastewater treatment plants currently employ a two- or a three-step process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] as described in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The first step, primary treatment, consists of removing large particles of organic and inorganic material that can be removed by physical and mechanical processes such as gravity in settling tanks and by coarse filtration/screening. Secondary treatment most commonly employs aeration to promote the biodegradation of organic contaminants by microorganisms, principally bacteria, but also microalgae and fungi. The biomass of microorganisms produced as a consequence of the biodegradation of contaminants in wastewater is removed by gravity in settling tanks resulting in waste activated sludge and water of improved quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The water that has benefitted from primary and secondary treatment will still usually contain residual amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus in sufficiently high concentrations to result in ecological damage when discharged to the environment, so tertiary wastewater treatment is required to produce clean water that will not cause the eutrophication of rivers, lakes and oceans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Wastewater treatment and associated processes</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Process step</p></th><th align="left"><p>Description</p></th><th align="left"><p>Products</p></th><th align="left"><p>Volume</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Primary treatment</p></td><td align="left"><p>Physical and mechanical removal of solids</p></td><td align="left"><p>Cleaner wastewater</p></td><td align="left"><p>100%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Secondary treatment</p></td><td align="left"><p>Aerobic biodegradation of organics creating biomass (waste activated sludge)</p></td><td align="left"><p>Cleaner water, biomass</p></td><td align="left"><p>100%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Tertiary treatment</p></td><td align="left"><p>Trace contaminant and nutrient removal through creating biomass</p></td><td align="left"><p>Clean water, biomass, CO<sub>2</sub> fixation</p></td><td align="left"><p>99%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Anaerobic digestion</p></td><td align="left"><p>Solids from primary and secondary treatments are microbiologically converted to biogas and residual solids</p></td><td align="left"><p>Biogas energy, cleaner wastewater, residual solids</p></td><td align="left"><p>1%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Composting</p></td><td align="left"><p>Residual solids from anaerobic digestion and/or biomass are aerobically composted to produce fertilizer</p></td><td align="left"><p>Fertilizer</p></td><td align="left"><p> &lt; 1%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Biomass utilization</p></td><td align="left"><p>Multiple products</p></td><td align="left"><p>Animal feed, nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, lipids for biodiesel, carbohydrates for ethanol, biogas production, fertilizer</p></td><td align="left"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par19">Eutrophication is the consequence of an excess supply of nutrients needed for the growth of microalgae and other microorganisms. The abundant nutrients result in the rapid and prolific growth of microbial biomass and the consequent depletion of oxygen due to the aerobic metabolism of microbes and the aerobic biodegradation of dead biomass. The concentration of oxygen is especially depleted in coastal areas adjacent to cities due primarily to the discharge of nutrients in wastewater and agricultural runoff such that more than 500 oxygen minimum zones have been identified worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This has resulted in serious reductions in fish populations, often impacting populations dependent on subsistence fishing. Increased CO<sub>2</sub>, temperature and nutrients have altered the ocean productivity, biodiversity and biogeochemistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Moreover, changes in ocean temperature and pH are mechanistically linked to oxygen concentrations, and modeling has shown that even if anthropogenic sources of pollution were completely stopped a further fourfold decrease in the oxygen concentration in the world’s oceans will occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">The International Water Association estimates that 80% of wastewater worldwide is discharged untreated into the environment [<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.iwa-network.org" ext-link-type="uri">www.iwa-network.org</ext-link>] and the United Nations estimates that 55% of the world population is without safely managed sanitation [<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.unwater.org" ext-link-type="uri">www.unwater.org</ext-link>]. Other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] estimate that 52% of global wastewater is treated to some degree, while 48% of wastewater is released, untreated, to the environment. It is not only the developing countries that need improved wastewater treatment, as the American Society of Civil Engineers gave the US wastewater infrastructure a grade of D + in 2017 [<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org" ext-link-type="uri">www.infrastructurereportcard.org</ext-link>], and about 66% of the energy content in wastewater is destroyed/wasted by current wastewater treatment technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Therefore, there is a huge opportunity for new technology that can treat wastewater more effectively and inexpensively, and use of microalgae and photobiology may provide appropriate new technologies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Current Status of Microalgae use for Wastewater Treatment</title><p id="Par21">A limitation of the activated sludge process is that while it removes the vast majority of organic contaminants, inorganic contaminants such as phosphorus and nitrogen are frequently present in the effluent at concentrations high enough to cause environmental damage/eutrophocation in downstream rivers, lakes and oceans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Where microalgae are intentionally used to treat water today, it is almost exclusively as a polishing step to remove phosphorus and nitrogen, despite the fact that microalgae are capable of removing both organic and inorganic contaminants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The use of microalgae to remove nutrients is not widespread and the resulting biomass is generally not harvested for beneficial use; thus, the use of microalgae to treat the entirety of wastewater and recycle nutrients for agricultural use is in its infancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Wastewater treatment plants currently are focused on treating waste rather than on making a product and the nutrients present in wastewater-derived biomass are not always recycled. Future wastewater treatment plants will be aware of the need for more energy efficient processes that not only remove contaminants, but also recycles nutrients to support agriculture, recovers energy in the form of biofuels and may also produce value-added chemicals derived from microalgae. Microalgae biomass produced at wastewater treatment facilities will most likely be processed offsite to obtain specialty chemicals, but the facilities of the future will be designed and operated to maximize nutrient and biomass recovery and recycling.</p><p id="Par22">The reason that the microalgae industry is interested in combining wastewater treatment with the growth of microalgae is to reduce the cost of microalgae-derived products. The cost of growing, harvesting and processing microalgae currently prevents the use of microalgae to produce large volumes of low-cost products such as biofuels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. An understanding of what factors contribute most to these costs can suggest ways of mitigating them. The overwhelming majority of facilities, bioreactors and research for the growth of microalgae focus on the growth of planktonic cells (individual cells in liquid solution) rather than the growth of microalgae as biofilms. However, many microalgae species readily form biofilms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], and growing microalgae as biofilms can potentially improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of microalgae production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The potential advantages of growing microalgae as biofilm on internally illuminated surfaces rather than as planktonic cells include: increased biomass production, more efficient use of light energy, decreased cost of harvesting, ability to be used with turbid solutions, decreased footprint for photobioreactors, increased flexibility in the design of photobioreactors and decreased process cost.</p><p id="Par23">Providing an even distribution of light in a given volume of water must deal with the fact that the intensity of light decreases with the square of the distance from the light source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. It is even more challenging to achieve efficient light distribution in a turbid solution of microalgae where cells closer to the light source shade cells that are below [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. This has resulted in shallow reactors being favored for the growth of microalgae, which directly limits the volume of water used in bioreactors and raceway ponds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. However, if microalgae were instead grown as biofilm, combined with internal illumination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], then light of an appropriate wavelength and intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] could be evenly delivered to the biofilm, even when turbid solutions such as wastewater are used. If microalgae bioreactors were intentionally designed to grow biofilm, they would seek to maximize the surface area for the growth of biofilm and to achieve equal light distribution to all surfaces. If light energy is supplied through illuminated surfaces, the efficiency of biofilm growth can be maximized and the design of photobioreactors can be expanded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">While sunlight can be used to grow microalgae, the use of electrically generated light has key advantages. Most of the energy in sunlight is not available for the growth of microalgae, as only 43% is within wavelengths that can be used in photosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], and sunlight is not always available. Moreover, within those light wavelengths that can be used by photosynthetic microalgae, some wavelengths are better than others, and there is variation in which wavelengths are preferred by different species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. This means that supplying light energy of selected wavelengths can achieve the growth of microalgae more efficiently than using sunlight directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and this approach has applications for growing microalgae in space as direct sunlight, especially in space, can be too intense to allow the growth of microalgae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. If the full spectrum of energy in sunlight were converted into electricity using solar, thermal or an equivalent technology, the resulting energy could be used to power light-emitting diode (LED) illumination 24 h per day to produce light of only selected wavelengths and at the minimum intensity required to achieve the robust growth of biofilm on surfaces that are internally illuminated.

The most common type of publication in the voluminous literature concerning the use of microalgae to produce biofuels involves descriptions of individual species of microalgae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], the effects of nutrients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], temperature, pH, salinity, light intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], light wavelength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], lipid content, lipid composition, carbohydrate concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], protein concentration, biodiesel/ethanol/methane/hydrogen yield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], CO<sub>2</sub> consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], harvesting methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], etc. Collectively the literature demonstrates that there are myriad microalgae species/strains that are capable of growth under a wide range of environmental conditions, and each species has unique capabilities. While microalgae can be grown as pure cultures, when the application of microalgae is for the treatment of wastewater, the use of pure cultures has little relevance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The complex and changing composition/concentration/volume of wastewater in most wastewater treatment facilities coupled with the goal of removing all organic and inorganic contaminants as quickly and economically as possible requires that the microbial community in wastewater treatment plants should adapt to the received wastewater, rather than trying to modify the design of the wastewater treatment facility to obtain optimized growth conditions for any pure microalgae culture. Just as municipal wastewater treatment facilities now must endure a start-up phase to obtain a stable microbial community capable of treating wastewater under local conditions, it will be appropriate to select for microalgae species capable of surviving under local conditions rather than trying to get specific microalgae species to grow at a given location. By adjusting the wavelength and/or the intensity of internal illumination, the growth of different microalgae species can be encouraged to enable the selective cultivation of more than one type of microalgae community that can allow for maximum contaminant removal and for the production of different bioproducts derived from microalgae. Once microalgae and bacterial cultures are identified that grow well in a given wastewater stream, it may be helpful to genetically modify some of these cultures to improve their ability to function in low oxygen environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], utilize light more efficiently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] or make an alternative product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">While microalgae are best known for their photosynthetic capabilities to grow using light energy, many microalgae species have been shown to be capable of growing heterotrophically using organic carbon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] so that within a wastewater treatment scenario where light is supplied, microalgae can simultaneously use organic carbon and/or light energy for growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].

If microalgae are grown as biofilms attached to internally illuminated surfaces, then light of the appropriate intensity and wavelength can be supplied directly to microalgae cells without any risk of photoinhibition while the light supplied to the underside of the biofilm allows for continuous growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">Rotating microalgae/bacterial biofilms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] are described in the literature, but these examples focus on frequently removing the biofilm from the wastewater so that it can more readily be illuminated in the open air. Employing fully submerged biofilms, as suggested here, could be more efficient.

When the goal of photobioreactors is to grow microalgae as planktonic cells dispersed in suspension, this creates unnecessary constraints on reactor design and operation, as providing optimum illumination to all cells is challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].

Future wastewater treatment plants that employ microalgae must accommodate the growth of both bacteria and microalgae. If microalgae are used to update the treatment of wastewater, then the growth of microalgae can produce oxygen needed by bacteria for the aerobic biodegradation of contaminants in wastewater [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], and the bacterial removal of microalgae-produced oxygen will allow for maximum rates of oxygen production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Therefore, the most rapid and complete biodegradation of contaminants in wastewater will be because of the combined action of bacteria and microalgae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Microalgae can be used to improve rather than replace the activated sludge process for the treatment of wastewater. This could avoid/minimize the need for aeration that is a significant operating cost for wastewater treatment facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], and finding ways to decrease the energy cost of operating wastewater treatment can be a good approach to developing more sustainable processes for wastewater treatment. While it may be possible to avoid/reduce the need for external aeration through the in situ production of oxygen by microalgae, there will be increasingly strong regulatory and financial incentives to maximize CO<sub>2</sub> fixation within the wastewater treatment process to decrease the emission of greenhouse gases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">Research is needed to determine the best ways to maximize the biodegradation of organic contaminants in wastewater while minimizing external aeration in an environment where microalgae and internal illumination are used.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Why are Biofilms Better than Planktonic Cells (a More Detailed Discussion)?</title><p id="Par32">Providing light to microalgae has been an enduring challenge both technically and economically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Using microalgae to enhance the performance of wastewater treatment will face the same challenges of supplying light energy that currently limit the economical use of microalgae to produce biodiesel, ethanol, biogas or other products. Microalgae are most commonly grown as planktonic cells in open ponds (raceways) or in photobioreactors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These planktonic cells are harvested by flocculation, filtration and centrifugation, and the resulting microalgae cell suspension is then dewatered to produce a more concentrated cell paste that is subsequently processed/extracted to make products. The cost of growing, harvesting and extracting microalgae currently prevents the use of microalgae to produce large volumes of low-cost products such as biofuels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The cost of harvesting, concentrating and extracting lipids from microalgae biomass has been estimated to be 40–60% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>] of the cost of biodiesel, so that harvesting microalgae as biofilm can significantly decrease process cost.</p><p id="Par33">If light energy is supplied to microalgae growing as biofilms attached to optical surfaces immersed in wastewater, then the design of reactors used for wastewater treatment will not be constrained by the difficulty of supplying external illumination, and the need to periodically shut down the system to remove biofilm that is considered as unwanted when the goal is to grow planktonic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. As mentioned above, reactors currently used for the growth of microalgae for the tertiary treatment of wastewater or for the production of biofuels often employ shallow reactors/ponds that require large areas to accommodate the volume of wastewater to be treated or the mass of biofuel desired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. But if light is supplied via internally illuminated surfaces and not by external illumination, then the reactors can be of any depth/dimensions so a much smaller footprint/land area is required. Wastewater treatment facilities are typically located near population centers where the cost and availability of land can be a concern. Furthermore, if wastewater treatment plants in the future will produce an array of products derived from microalgae, then additional space may be required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Accordingly, the use of shallow algae ponds for the treatment of wastewater will be difficult to implement at many facilities, and the most economical use of space of the wastewater treatment plant should be considered.</p><p id="Par34">The treatment of large volumes of water such as in wastewater treatment plants should be rapid because the treatment time determines how large the facility should be [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. If microalgae biofilms improve the treatment efficiency, then smaller, less expensive treatment facilities can be constructed. By using internal illumination to supply light to microalgae the surface area of the biofilm is whatever it is designed to be and the limitation is the cost of optical surfaces, cost of electricity, harvesting and processing biomass. Biofilms are well documented to be more resistant to environmental contaminants, and antibiotics, than planktonic microbial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Accordingly, maintaining a diverse microalgae/bacterial population, growing as biofilm, will improve the stability of the wastewater treatment process. Biofilms are retained in photobioreactors until harvested and so are best suited to enable rapid treatment of the maximum volume of wastewater since they allow survival of even microbial species with generation times longer than the hydraulic retention time of the reactor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. The composition of the biofilm communities in microalgae–bacteria biofilm wastewater treatment facilities will not be limited to only rapidly growing species; rather, a more complex microbial communities will form, each adapted to local conditions. Moreover, the mass of biofilm that can be retained within the facility can be controlled to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of the removal of contaminants at the fastest possible flow rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Real-time monitoring of the concentrations of contaminants and the health of biofilms will be enabled by increasingly sophisticated and inexpensive analytical techniques such as single-cell multi-isotope nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>], photo-respirometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] and in situ metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>] and the application of growth/process modeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and artificial intelligence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">The goal of using internally illuminated surfaces to grow microalgae biofilm requires that the surface area of the light-emitting regions should be maximized; the subsequent harvest of biofilm from these surfaces is also an important consideration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>].

The harvesting of microalgae biomass from biofilm growing on internally illuminated surfaces could be accomplished using a robotic device that is equipped with cameras/optical sensors to locate biofilm and determine its readiness for harvest, and with multiple appendages that allow the robot to move about the wastewater treatment reactor, grasp biofilm-containing structures and mechanically collect the biofilm. When the biofilm storage capacity of the robot is reached, the biofilm/biomass can then be deposited in an appropriate location for further processing and the robot can return to harvest more biofilm. The harvesting of microalgae biomass is a major component in the cost of using microalgae, and by switching from harvesting planktonic cells to harvesting biofilm (that is already as concentrated as planktonic cells after dewatering), the harvesting process can be less complex and less costly.

It will be important to determine the most energy efficient ways of using solar/renewable energy to support the growth of microalgae, and not simply add additional energy demand to the operation of wastewater treatment plants employing microalgae.

The volume of sludge sent to the anaerobic digester is variable depending upon the concentration of organics in wastewater, but is typically only about 1% of the volume of the wastewater [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

Wastewater is increasingly viewed as a resource and photobiology can help. Methane and other hydrocarbon gases can be obtained from the anaerobic digestion of organic waste, nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphate can be removed from wastewater as biomass and recycled for agricultural use as compost, and clean fresh water can be derived from wastewater. The use of microalgae in wastewater treatment is not common, but is currently used in wastewater treatment as a polishing step to remove nutrients. Nutrient removal depends, however, upon the growth of microalgae (and microbial) biomass, and the complete removal of nutrients is difficult to accomplish on the scale needed by the wastewater treatment industry. The easiest application of microalgae in wastewater treatment is to improve the anaerobic digestion process. Then, as photobiology technology matures, the widespread use of microalgae to treat the entirety of wastewater will become increasingly economical. A new class of light-powered enzymes has been found that can convert organic acids to alkanes: fatty acid photodecarboxylase from algae. This photoenzyme only requires light energy to convert organic acids such as acetic, propionic and butyric acid to the gas phase hydrocarbons methane, ethane and propane, respectively. Fiber optic strands can be modified by attaching the photoenzyme to its surfaces, after which the fiber optic strands can be placed inside an anaerobic digester and provided with a constant light source. This will increase the amount of hydrocarbon gases beneficially recovered and will likely result in an increased rate of waste degradation.</p><p id="Par49">If microalgae are to be used to treat the entirety of wastewater, microalgal biomass can be grown as biofilm attached to optical fibers/surfaces. In this way, better microalgae growth and nutrient removal can be achieved, and the biomass can be harvested more economically as a biofilm than as planktonic microalgae cells. The future applications of photobiology to the wastewater treatment industry are as vast as our imaginations.
