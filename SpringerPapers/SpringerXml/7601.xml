Different equipment and technologies have been integrated into those subsystems, such as fuel cell, energy storage, gas capture system, alternative fuel, multi-energy management methods, and cold-ironing facilities, which give birth to the maritime grids. A typical maritime grid consists of generation, storage, and critical loads, and can operate either in grid-connected or in islanded modes, and operate under both the constraints of energy system and maritime transportation system, and formulates as a “maritime multi-energy system”. The energy management of this special system will shape the energy efficiency of the future maritime transportation system. In this chapter, the background and motivation of maritime grids are illustrated with a comprehensive literature survey. After that, some relevant promising technologies are described, then the typical topologies and frameworks of the next-generation maritime grids are shown. At last, the contributions of this book are summarized.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en" specific-use="web-only"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Maritime transportation</kwd><kwd>Maritime grids</kwd><kwd>Energy management</kwd><kwd>Energy efficiency</kwd><kwd>Maritime multi-energy system</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>chapter-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>chapter-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/978-981-33-6734-0_Chapter_1.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></book-part-meta><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background and Motivation</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Economy Growth and the Demand for Maritime Transport</title><p id="Par2">After achieving a 3.1% growth in 2017, the growth rate of global economy declines to 3.0% in 2018 and further declines to 2.3% in 2019 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In 2020 and afterward, a range of downside risks may further intensify the economy growth, such as the tariff between US–China, the decision by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union (“Brexit”), and the global New Coronavirus spread. In this background, a new normal is about to take hold, reflecting a continuous moderate growth of the global economy. This trend will significantly influence all the attached subsystems or sectors in the maritime transportation system, including infrastructure requirements, ship carrying capacity needs, ship design and technology, port developments and performance, and so on.</p><p id="Par3">The primary impact of the slowing-down economy puts on the demand of maritime transport.

The generators and battery deliver power via the energy network to meet the propulsion and service loads. The propulsion load is used to drive the ship. The service load supplies electricity to various onboard equipment, including the onboard radar, navigation system, air conditioning, as well as the gas capture system in Sect. <xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec">1.2.2.5</xref>. In the future, fuel cells may further replace the generators to act as the main power sources. To further improve the energy efficiency of AES, renewable energy can be integrated, like the photovoltaic modules in Fig. <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">1.15</xref>. As for the communication network, the shipboard energy management system (EMS) can optimally calculate the generators and battery outputs and then send the dispatch signals to each component by it.</p><p id="Par84">A special case is the cruise ship since the large scale of thermal load demand onboard. In fact, the shipboard microgrid of cruise ship can be viewed as an MES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>], shown as Fig. <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">1.16</xref>.<fig id="Fig16"><label>Fig. 1.16</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Topology of a multi-energy cruise ship, reprinted from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>], with permission from IEEE</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/500329_1_En_1_Fig16_HTML.png" id="MO16"/></fig></p><p id="Par85">The main differences between Figs. <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">1.15</xref> and <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">1.16</xref> are the involvement of heat flow. In a cruise ship, the combined cooling/heating power generator (CCHP) and power to cooling/heating (PTC) equipment are installed to act as the heating sources, and the electrical flow and heating flow should be coordinated to achieve a better economic and environmental behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Seaport Microgrid</title><p id="Par86">Seaport microgrid is a newly proposed concept for seaport management, which is depicted by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The incentive of the seaport microgrid is to make it as an energy district to improve renewable energy penetration and enhance the grid storage capacity by selling the electricity to the market through the main grid. There are already many practical cases around the world of seaport microgrid. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>], the author advocated the harbor area as a unique territory that should have new business models with its energy plan. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>], two practical projects of seaport microgrids in Hamburg (German) and Genoa (Italy), are manifested in detail, and the operating data proves the validity of seaport microgrid.</p><p id="Par87">A typical seaport microgrid is illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">1.17</xref>. Generally, the seaport is connected with the main grid and various renewable energy are integrated, i.e., seaport wind farms and PV farms. All the port-side equipment, including the quay cranes, gantry cranes, transferring trunks, are electrical-driven.<fig id="Fig17"><label>Fig. 1.17</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Typical topology of future port microgrid</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/500329_1_En_1_Fig17_HTML.png" id="MO17"/></fig></p><p id="Par88">The seaport provides four types of services to the berthed-in ships: (1) logistic service. The berth allocation and quay crane scheduling for loading/unloading cargo; (2) fuel transportation. Unloading or refilling fuel for the berthed-in ships; (3) cold-ironing. Providing electricity to the berthed-in ships; and (4) refrigeration reefer for the cold-chain supply. With the above multiple energy flows involved, the future seaport microgrid is a “<bold>maritime multi-energy system</bold>” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and the port central control should give both the energy and logistic control signals to each sub-system in the seaport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Coordination Between Shipboard and Seaport Microgrids</title><p id="Par89">In the future, the connection between the ship and the port is no longer limited in the logistic-side, and will be also expanded to the electrical-side. Figure <xref rid="Fig18" ref-type="fig">1.18</xref> shows the coordination between the ships and ports. When the ship berthed in, the seaport will allocate a berth position and some corresponding port cranes for loading/unloading onboard cargos. In the electric-side, the berthed-in ship is directly connected to the seaport by the AC/DC converters, and all the load demands are met by the on-shore side. The seaport becomes a coordinated electric-logistic multi-microgrid system.<fig id="Fig18"><label>Fig. 1.18</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Coordination between the seaport microgrid and shipboard microgrid, reprinted from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], with permission from IEEE</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/500329_1_En_1_Fig18_HTML.png" id="MO18"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Summary</title><p id="Par90">In this chapter, we have concluded that the maritime grids are those local energy networks installed in harbor ports, ships, ferries, or vessels, which consists of generation, storage and critical loads, and are able to operate either in grid-connected or in islanded modes and operate under both the constraints of power system and maritime transportation system. After the illustration of various promising technologies which are about to integrate, the implementation of next-generation maritime grids is suggested to be a promising approach to resolve the energy efficiency problem of the maritime transportation system, and may have the ability to re-shape the future relationship between the ocean and inland.</p><p id="Par91">Using full-electrification as the backbone, the future maritime grids, i.e., all-electric ships, seaport microgrids, and various electrified ocean platforms, become the “<bold>maritime multi-energy system</bold>”, which requires an advanced energy management system to achieve the economic and environmental targets. From the aspect of electrical engineering, the future maritime grids are a special type of power systems. In land-based applications, the optimization-based power system operation has been extensively studied and should be expanded to the maritime grids for future usages. This is also the main goal of this book, i.e., the optimization-based energy management for the next-generation maritime grids.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTD): Review of Maritime Transport 2019, UNCTAD/RMT/2019/Corr.1</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Ng, A.K.Y., Monios, J., Jiang, C.: Maritime Transport and Regional Sustainability.
