It can be seen as a simplified life cycle assessment (LCA) that focuses on the energy consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions only for the fuel being consumed, ignoring other stages of a vehicle’s life cycle. WTW results are therefore different from LCA results. In order to close this gap, the authors propose a hybrid WTW+LCA methodology useful to assess the greenhouse gas (GHG) profiles of road vehicles.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The proposed method (hybrid WTW+LCA) keeps the main hypotheses of the WTW methodology, but integrates them with LCA data restricted to the global warming potential (GWP) occurring during the manufacturing of the battery pack. WTW data are used for the GHG intensity of the EU electric mix, after a consistency check with the main life cycle impact (LCI) sources available in literature.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Results and discussion</title><p id="Par3">A numerical example is provided, comparing GHG emissions due to the use of a battery electric vehicle (BEV) with emissions from an internal combustion engine vehicle. This comparison is done both according to the WTW approach (namely the JEC WTW version 4) and the proposed hybrid WTW+LCA method. The GHG savings due to the use of BEVs calculated with the WTW-4 range between 44 and 56 %, while according to the hybrid method the savings are lower (31–46 %). This difference is due to the GWP which arises as a result of the manufacturing of the battery pack for the electric vehicles.</p></sec><sec id="ASec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">The WTW methodology used in policy support to quantify energy content and GHG emissions of fuels and powertrains can produce results closer to the LCA methodology by adopting a hybrid WTW+LCA approach. While evaluating GHG savings due to the use of BEVs, it is important that this method considers the GWP due to the manufacturing of the battery pack.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Background</title><p id="Par5">Political interest in decarbonizing the world economy is growing. On December 2015, Paris will host the UN international summit aiming at replacing the Kyoto protocol with a new binding agreement on climate change. Meanwhile, China (APEC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2014</xref>), the European Union (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2014</xref>) and the USA (USA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2010</xref>; APEC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2014</xref>) agreed to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by year 2030, and the environmental strategies of many governments around the world are converging towards this target. A particular promising policy that can reduce GHG emissions in the transportation sector is supporting the replacement of conventional vehicles, based on internal combustion engines (ICE), with electric vehicles (EV). According to the German Advisory Council on Global Change, the majority of final energy consumption in the transport sector across the EU-27 will be saved by 2050 as a result of the widespread introduction of electric vehicles (WBGU <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2011</xref>). In order to assess the impact of GHG and energy saving policies, policy makers need to consider sound and shared scientific methodologies allowing comparisons among “green” and conventional technologies. Since electric energy and fossil fuel pathways are very different, they need to be compared from the perspective of a life cycle assessment (LCA). At the regulatory level, well-to-wheel (WTW) analysis is the dominant LCA methodology used to assess GHG and energy savings in transport. WTW methodology is used for example by the European Union for the Fuel Quality Directive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2009a</xref>) and for the Renewable Energy Directive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2009b</xref>), in the USA, the Environmental Protection Agency bases its regulatory actions on the WTW approach (EPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2007</xref>) of the GREET model (ANL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2014</xref>), and also in China, WTW is used to assess policy options (Huo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2012</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">WTW methodology can be seen as a quite simplified LCA, designed to assess only the energy consumption and the GHG emissions of road transport fuels without considering, for example, the impacts of manufacturing and decommissioning of the vehicles themselves. This limited set of considerations makes the WTW particularly suitable to policy support, even if it can give figures different to those obtained from a rigorous LCA as carried out according to the ISO 14040 standard series (ISO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2006</xref>). Environmental policies designed on a simplified data set, as it is the WTW now, can overlook relevant elements, particularly in a future perspective, when a larger share of renewable energy sources will be integrated into the EU electric grid, and the impact of the GHG emissions due to the production of EVs will be more important than today, compared to the GHG emissions from the production of electric energy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Purpose</title><p id="Par7">In this paper, the advantages and drawbacks of the WTW methodology when compared with the LCA approach are summarised. The authors will analyse in depth the data set presented in the well-to-tank (WTT) study produced by the JEC (JRC-EUCAR-CONCAWE)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> research collaboration (JEC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2014a</xref>), detailing the EU27 electricity mix pathway and comparing the results with the equivalent LCA figures. The authors evaluate GHG savings due to the use of EVs instead of ICE vehicles, both with the WTW methodology and with an LCA approach, and try to understand how wide the differences are and possible steps to reduce them. Reducing the gap between the two methodologies can assist data intercomparison from different geographical regions and sources, allowing policy makers to rely on wider, more reliable databases while maintaining a comparatively simple and useful assessment method. An important purpose of this article is also to bridge cultures, trying to reduce the methodological distance between the LCA and the WTW scientific communities. To this scope, the authors have chosen a popularising approach, maybe indulging in explanations that can seem too long to the expert of one field, but that are maybe useful to the experts of the other field to better understand the pros and cons of the two methods and, consequently, to better appreciate the potential applications of the hybrid WTW+LCA method proposed in this paper.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Comparison of WTW and LCA</title><p id="Par9">The well-to-wheel (WTW) methodology considered in this paper is the WTW version 4 (WTW-4) developed within the JEC (JEC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2014b</xref>). This method allows to quantify the energy required for and the GHG emissions resulting from the production, transport and distribution of conventional and alternative road transportation fuels (well-to-tank or WTT), and also to quantify the efficiency of different powertrains (tank-to-wheel or TTW). Compared to a comprehensive attributional life cycle assessment (LCA) approach, WTW considers only parts of the LCA impact categories “energy consumption” and “GHG emissions” necessary for the production of a functional unit (i.e., one MJ of fuel or a kilometer driven by a vehicle). For example, in the WTW approach, the material consumptions for the fuel production process are not taken into account, neither are the water requirement, acidification or emissions of pollutants if these do not affect the GHG equivalent emissions. Moreover, in WTW there is no calculation of the energy and GHG which occur during the construction or decommissioning of plants and vehicles.</p><p id="Par10">In Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, a simplified scheme of the different boundaries of LCA and WTW studies when quantifying the energy cost of fuel use are presented. Whereas WTW mainly focuses on the midstream (“in operation”) phase, the LCA considers more activities in the upstream chain and, with the end-of-life management, also downstream (non midstream is also called background data). One of the main differences between WTW and LCA calculations that cannot be easily displayed in a scheme like Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, is the implementation of time scales in LCA, at least for the main product (here: a vehicle). All flows under LCA will be standardised for certain product lifetimes or at least a lifetime under which different LCA results may be compared. For a vehicle, LCA calculations reported are usually based on 100,000 to 200,000 km of driven distance, ecoinvent database suggests 150,000 km (Del Duce et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2014</xref>) and in exceptional cases, this can reach 240,000 km (Nordelöf et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2014</xref>). Accordingly, WTW-4 (JEC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2014b</xref>) defines a “lifetime of at least 160,000 km” for an electric vehicle. In WTW, the term “lifetime” is used to specify the period in which the vehicle is expected to operate under specific efficiency parameters. The inventory analysis inside an LCA, however, also contains periods before and after the practical use or the operational life of a product.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic representation of WTW boundaries while assessing the “energy content” of a fuel associated with CO<sub>2</sub>eq-expenses, and completed by possible additional elements of an LCA system describing a vehicle</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11367_2015_954_Fig1_HTML.gif" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par11">Within the timeframe of an LCA, the biggest challenge is to comprehensively collect all material and energy expenditures as well as distances covered through transportation (the life cycle inventory) once the goal and scope (the boundaries) have been defined. The WTW methodology differs from the LCA in the sense that WTW focuses on the operational phase of the vehicle in as strict a sense as possible (in WTW-4: see JEC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2014b</xref>).</p><p id="Par12">There are some criticisms to this approach. Nordelöf et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2014</xref>), for example, argue that in WTW, a BEV charged with renewable electricity seems to have “almost no environmental impact.” While setting environmental policy targets, the main interest is, often, on energy consumption and GHG emissions only. With this aim WTW makes it easier in general to compare different fuels and powertrains while sacrificing a small loss in precision when compared to a full LCA. This is quite intuitive in the case of biofuels: if we want to assess the GHG savings of vehicles using biofuels instead of fossil fuels it is necessary to compare their GHG emissions. Since the infrastructures for using fossil fuels and biofuels are similar (e.g., road infrastructures are the same) and the vehicles burning fossil fuel can burn also the biofuel blends (from 7 to 10 % today in Europe)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> it is possible to say that, while comparing the carbon footprint of biofuels with that of fossil fuels, the WTW methodology is a good approximation of the LCA.</p><p id="Par14">Another difference between WTW and LCA scope is that WTW provides an “open, universal” attempt to quantify the global warming potential (GWP) of driving e.g., an electric car. This concept must provide a single average GWP for Europe’s electricity production, while, as it is correctly noted by e.g., Ma et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2012</xref>) and Nordelöf et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2014</xref>), in European countries with an electricity production based on fossil resources, electric driving can be related to (much) higher GHG emissions during the operation phase (when compared to using fossil fuels). However, LCA modelling results often have a particular regional validity (e.g., Goedkoop et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2009</xref>). Even with this consideration, the authors wish to keep the open character of WTW, because for topics such as, for example, the condition of electricity charging local peculiarities may occur for which specific life cycle impact (LCI) data might not be available. For example: electricity produced in the northern states of Germany is already mostly of renewable origin, because of the dominance of windmills in that region, although Germany’s overall electricity carbon impact shows only average performance; or a BEV driven in a country with &gt;90 % coal-fired power plants in electricity production, may nevertheless be charged from a local photovoltaic device.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>GHG emissions from the EU electric energy mix</title><p id="Par15">The focus of this article is to compare LCA results with WTW results describing the Global Warming Potential (or GHG emissions) due to the use of electric vehicles.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3">3</xref> The JEC WTT-4 report presents figures detailing the GHG intensity of the average kilowatt hour of electric energy supplied in the European Union (JEC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2014a</xref>). Unfortunately, not all the boundary conditions and working hypotheses were provided in the JEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2014a</xref>) report. In order to allow LCA experts to better compare WTW data and boundary conditions with their own work, the authors summarise here the main data presented in the WTW-4 report, and integrate them with additional explanations on the hypotheses and boundary conditions adopted.

This has been done for every kind of fuel or energy used for producing electric energy, both for conventional electric and CHP plants.</p><p id="Par24">CHP plants do not use all the primary energy input for electricity production, but part of this energy goes for heating applications; so the authors considered a GHG credit for the heat produced in output from CHPs according to the “substitution” allocation method adopted in WTW. The heat produced from the CHPs (statistical data from IEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2011c</xref>) has been considered as replacing a thermal heating system with average heating efficiencies of 85 % for coal, lignite, coke, peat, biomass and waste, and 90 % for natural gas, biogas, LPG and oil products, respectively. Data quality problems can cause the substitution approach to underestimate the carbon intensity of electric CHP plants (IEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par25">For nuclear power plants and renewable energy sources, there is a different form of energy input compared to fossil fuel primary energy input.

The hybrid WTW+LCA method</title><p id="Par47">The proposed method aims at adopting the main hypotheses of the WTW methodology, in order to keep the relatively simple WTW approach, but integrating them with specific LCA data. In this section, the specific LCA data to be merged with the WTW-4 data set (JEC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2014b</xref>) will be discussed, while considering also universally valid LCA findings on GWP associated with the electric car’s life cycle. This approach will be called “the hybrid WTW+LCA method.”</p><p id="Par48">It is considered that the well-to-tank results give, for the electric energy mix, values comparable to the main LCA datasets (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Therefore, according to the simplified hybrid WTW+LCA method, it is suggested that the GHG emissions due to the use of a BEV is simply the sum of its WTW emissions with specific LCA emissions for the manufacturing of the vehicle, expressed in the same measuring unit (g CO<sub>2</sub>eq/km).</p><p id="Par49">The end-of-life (EOL) aspects of vehicles are considered according to the following notes. Firstly, the ISO 14,044 standard recommends an LCA system expansion/substitution to quantify the effects of the recycling processes. This would be better than a simple “cut-off-method” which does not quantify the impacts of recycling processes (Althaus and Bauer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2012</xref>). At the same time, cut-off- and system extension/substitution-attempts seem to deliver comparable results in the life cycle modelling of electric cars (Habermacher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2011</xref>; Althaus and Bauer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2012</xref>). Usually, during LCA modelling of electric cars, EOL is simulated by alternatively both quantifying system extension/substitution and cut-off, so reported impacts of, e.g., battery production includes EOL (Notter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2010</xref>; Habermacher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2011</xref>). Habermacher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2011</xref>) separately quantified the disposal of the electric car as an EOL scenario, resulting in a cost of up to 4 g CO<sub>2</sub>eq/km (calculated from Habermacher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2011</xref>), which is, however, less then 5 % of the overall GWP of a compact BEV. Faria et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2013</xref>) confirmed this finding. Recycling the car (substitution assumption) instead of disposal can result in a positive GWP credit (Habermacher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2011</xref>).</p><p id="Par50">The highest footprints caused in the manufacturing process of a BEV are (in this order) caused by the glider,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn4">4</xref> the battery and the drivetrain (Habermacher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2011</xref>).</p><p id="Par52">Should the impact of the glider manufacturing be considered here, as it is usual in LCA? Not necessarily: First, gliders of BEVs and ICE vehicles (ICEVs) are very similar as shown in almost all LCA publications, as long as identical vehicles are compared in a combustion engine and electric version each (Helmers and Marx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2012</xref>). Implementation of the glider therefore would not significantly change the comparison of BEVs and ICEVs. Moreover, a glider does not necessarily have to be produced to allow electric driving. In a technical conversion, a used ICEV can be electrified keeping the glider and allowing electrical driving for a “second” vehicle’s life offering minimal lifetime carbon footprints (Helmers and Marx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2012</xref>).</p><p id="Par53">An apparent inconsistency with LCA literature that can be identified in the WTW-4 assumptions of Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> is that the standard BEV outlined has only little excess curb weight compared to the ICEV. Actually, BEVs are usually heavier than ICEVs. In a project converting an ICEV-type SMART from combustion engine to electric, the electric engine almost equaled the weight of the replaced combustion engine (Helmers and Marx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2012</xref>). In a later project, this was confirmed by converting a GOLF-type car from combustion engine to electric. This indicates that the weight of the battery is an additional mass. According to Habermacher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2011</xref>), the error caused by underestimating a glider weight is in the order of 3 g CO<sub>2</sub>eq/km or 3 %, respectively, over the life cycle. Considering this low number, and in order to keep the model as simple as possible, the authors have decided to keep the WTW-4-assumptions and to neglect this error.</p><p id="Par54">Carbon footprints of drivetrain production are contradictory as reflected in literature: Habermacher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2011</xref>) reported higher drivetrain carbon footprints for ICEVs compared to BEVs, while Held and Baumann (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2011</xref>) showed a negligible GWP excess for the electric drivetrain production. Notter et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2010</xref>) quantified an almost identical GWP for both the ICEV and BEV drivetrains. Hawkins et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2012</xref>) found a higher carbon footprint due to the electric powertrain production in the order of 7–11 % of the whole BEV compared to an ICEV. Considering the inconsistent nature of these datasets, it was decided to neglect the additional footprint of BEV drivetrain production.</p><p id="Par55">The emissions impact of battery production, however, comes in addition. The WTW-4 suggests a battery of 200 kg weight (Table 5–2 in JEC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2014b</xref>), which is not too big realising that even a SMART needs a battery of 160 kg size to enable an electric range of 100 km (Helmers and Marx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2012</xref>). In contrast, it is noted that in several LCA studies, the sizes of batteries presumed were bigger than necessary causing a higher GWP (Helmers and Marx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2012</xref>). A number of papers have been published quantifying the carbon footprint of battery production and revealing a wide range in results. The data of six studies were reviewed by Helmers and Marx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2012</xref>) resulting in a range of emissions of 52–291 kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq/kWh of a Li-ion battery (mean: 151 kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq/kWh). These varieties were not mainly due to different Li-ion chemistries but due to different modelling approaches (top down vs. bottom up). In a more recent and comprehensive study, Ellingsen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2014</xref>) reviewed results between 38 and 338 kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq/kWh for the production of the battery, and added 172–487 kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq/kWh from their own study.

Using the hybrid WTW+LCA method the GHG savings are reduced to 46 % (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par60">The authors wish to point out that the two methods (i.e., life cycle assessment and WTW) need to be blended carefully. LCA offers impact quantification over a life cycle (a defined lifespan), attributed with strict context-specific aspects. WTW instead quantifies the carbon impact and energy consumption due to the process of driving a vehicle, and this is carried out using EU averaged data. While driving a vehicle, energy is continuously consumed, not the vehicle itself, which can have a lifetime of up to 563,000 km (Nordelöf et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2014</xref>) or be converted to another fossil fuel or to electric driving. In this context, while adding LCA data of battery manufacturing to the WTW, it is like the battery of a BEV was part of its fuel, because the battery is “consumed” to an extent after a certain number of recharging cycles. Summarising, the “life cycle” suggested here possesses narrower boundaries compared to usual LCA studies of electric cars. Also, it is restricted to carbon footprint quantification. The quantification of other impact categories like e.g. the mineral resource depletion (Helmers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2015</xref>) can lead to adverse results. An electric car contains more high-quality metals like copper (Cu) compared to an ICEV; however, the Cu content of BEV and ICE is within the same order of magnitude (Angerer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2009</xref>). In addition, the rapidly increasing electronic complexity of ICEV is believed to double the Cu content of new ICEV between 2006 and 2026 (Angerer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2009</xref>). This is also true for other precious metals. Concerning lithium, it will be an essential battery component until 2030 but not necessarily beyond (Helmers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2015</xref>). In addition, metal production is responsible for less than roughly 15 % of the carbon footprint within the whole life cycle of an electric SMART (Helmers and Marx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2012</xref>) including production expenses even under the assumption of energy production by wind mills.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par61">The well-to-wheel (WTW) methodology is a simplified LCA based approach useful for quantifying the energy content and GHG emissions, described as global warming potential (GWP), of fuels and powertrains in operation.</p><p id="Par62">This can be considered a narrow point of view in an LCA perspective, but often, policy makers need to take decisions using only this specific subset of impact categories and limited life cycle stages. Therefore, in this article, an attempt was made to try to identify and assess the differences between WTW and LCA, and propose a way to reduce the numerical gap between LCA and WTW results.</p><p id="Par63">Firstly, the GHG content of the electrical energy was analysed, giving the main contribution to the carbon intensity due to the use of a battery electric vehicle (BEV). In order to allow a better comparison between WTW and LCA results, the method for calculating the GHG intensity of the EU27 electricity mix for year 2009 in JEC WTW-4 (JEC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2014b</xref>) was described. By comparing the GHG intensity of the EU27 electricity mix by using both the WTW and the LCA methodologies, it is possible to see that these methodologies produce almost the same numerical results. Consequently, it is possible to state that for the specific application of the EU electricity mix in year 2009, the WTW method is a very good approximation of the LCA approach.</p><p id="Par64">Secondly, it was described how in the WTW-4 study (JEC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">c</xref>), the GHG intensity of the electric mix is combined with the electric consumption of a BEV to calculate the GHG emissions of an electric car (in CO<sub>2</sub>eq/km), and the level of GHG saving was shown, according to WTW, while comparing the use of a BEV with a conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle burning fossil fuel.</p><p id="Par65">Next, the scientific literature was investigated in order to find similar LCA data describing the GWP of electric vehicles, identifying in the manufacturing phase of the BEV the main contribution to the differences between WTW-4 and LCA studies. Specifically, the main and the most definite source of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions arises during the manufacturing of the battery pack.</p><p id="Par66">In order to reduce the gap between WTW-4 and LCA studies on electric vehicles, while still allowing WTW users to keep the main advantages of the WTW method, but also having datasets more comparable with LCA results, a simple hybrid WTW+LCA methodology was proposed, keeping the main WTW assumptions but adding to the WTW emission-specific LCA data. The most relevant LCA data was identified as those which described the emissions occurring during the production stage of the battery pack of the BEVs.</p><p id="Par67">According to this new hybrid method, the GHG savings associated with the use of BEVs instead of ICE vehicles are 13–10 % lower. According to the “pure” WTW-4 data set, a 44–56 % GHG saving during BEV operation was found; however with the hybrid WTW+LCA method, the savings are reduced to values ranging from 31 to 46 %.</p><p id="Par68">Relying on similar viewpoints and homogenous data sets is important both for policy makers, using mainly WTW methodology, and for the scientific community, who are more focused on LCA methodology (Jungmeier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2014</xref>). The authors hope this paper can help reduce the gap between the WTW and LCA approaches, stimulating the debate and contributing to the creation of a consistent and modular WTW-LCA data set.</p><p id="Par69">This bridging action will be more and more necessary in the future, when a larger share of renewable energy sources feeding the electric grid will make the impact of the GHG emissions due to the production of EVs not negligible, compared to the GHG emissions of the electric energy mix, as it is now.</p><p id="Par70">Finally, the authors would like to propose this methodology for an extension of the established WTW method also for other drivetrain technologies, such as fuel cells, which are intrinsically different from the ICE vehicles.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are grateful to Johannes Dietz for modelling the carbon footprints of the electricity modules in ecoinvent, to Adrian O’Connel and Laura Lonza for their support in the final editing and to the reviewers of IJLCA, for supplying numerous helpful suggestions.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><mixed-citation publication-type="other">AEEG (Italian Agency for Electric Energy and Gas), (2012) “Deliberazione 29 dicembre 2011 - ARG/elt 196/11”.
