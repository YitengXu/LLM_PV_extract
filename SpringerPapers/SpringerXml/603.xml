However, because the content of the feed wastewater fluctuates in a large range and the operation condition of the system needs to be controlled accurately, it is very important to find an efficient way to constantly monitor the nodes of the system, and adjust the operation parameters, including the quantities used in the chemical treatment. Therefore, it is necessary to use Internet of things technology (IOT) sensing and control equipment to realize the dynamic monitoring of sewage treatment process parameters, so as to serve the drug delivery and equipment online control. This study introduces an application case based on IOT sensor control and supporting maintenance business. Through the practical application of this technology in an environmental protection sewage treatment enterprise in Wuxi, this study introduces a method of bringing the IOT into the MBR system of industrial wastewater treatment which can continuously and accurately monitoring the nodes of the system. Based on this study, an analysis and decision-making system based on real-time monitoring data can be realized to adjust operation parameters in time. In this method, the IOT is introduced into the MBR system of industrial wastewater treatment. The results show that with the support of IOT, the sewage treatment system runs stably and the treatment efficiency is significantly improved.</p></abstract><kwd-group

pressure on emission reduction and pollution control.</p><p id="Par3">In AO (anoxic–oxic) process, the ‘A’ (anaerobic) is the anaerobic section, which is used to remove nitrogen and phosphorus and the ‘O’ (oxic) is the aerobic section, which is used to remove organic matter in wastewater. The advantage from AO is that in addition to the degradation of organic pollutants, it also has a certain function of nitrogen and phosphorus removal. It is the pretreatment of activated sludge with anaerobic hydrolysis technology. Membrane bioreactor (MBR) is a classical wastewater treatment process (Meng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2021</xref>) combining membrane technology with biological method for its solid–liquid separation efficiency is significantly higher than that of conventional activated sludge (CAS) process (Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2010</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">For the extensive use of HF and HNO3 acids during the silicon wafers production process (Belkada et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2018</xref>), the electrodialysis application to remove these ions is affected by several operational factors in the treatment performance such as current intensity, initial pollutants concentration and pH in minutes. A delay of the nitrate ions delivery in the solution will significantly affect the fluoride removal efficiency (Belkada et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2018</xref>) in the photovoltaic industry wastewater. Now the real-time monitoring data of ions concentration in water now can be sampled by different kinds of sensors and controllers deployed on the Internet of things platform. In fact, IOT facilities are widely used in wastewater treatment. A set of Internet of Things (IoT) applications was used on a 1000-pig farm to a smart wastewater treatment system which had a removal efficiency of biochemical oxygen (BOD), chemical oxygen (COD), and suspended solids (SS) to 93%, 89% and 97%, and 94%, 86% and 96% (Su et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">As a kind of wireless sensor networks using a promising technology for water quality monitoring and management, the use of wireless sensor on IOT networks facilities improves the current centralized systems and traditional manual methods, which makes the distributed intelligent water quality monitoring system adapt to the urban dynamic heterogeneous water distribution infrastructures (Martinez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">Just like in the Middle East and North Africa region, the use of wastewater is treated to an advancement by using IoT technologies and it can offer obvious benefits of freshwater without the problems of supply and cost (Rashid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2020</xref>). With these digital Internet of Things (IoT), well-designed systems may incorporate any or a combination of membrane bioreactor solutions supported by the right chemistry, delivered in the right quantity at the right spot under approach (Rashid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2020</xref>). And the Internet of Things (IoT) is an important technological innovation that can enhance industrial competitiveness and sustainability. In several districts, the applicability for promoting industrial sustainability of IoTs in smart manufacturing industry (including wastewater treatment) was verified by an empirical study (Kao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2019</xref>). Further, as an important part of wastewater treatment plants, IOT can provide important on-line monitoring data for the preparation of facility maintenance plan which is known as an electrical preventive maintenance (EPM) programs and prevent unnecessary damage and/or replacement due to neglect (Malhotra et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">With increasing effluent discharge standards, wastewater treatment plays a more important role in the social development (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2020</xref>). Multi-mode aerobic membrane bioreactor (AO + MBR) process has been applied in industrial wastewater treatment due to its merits such as high efficiency, good-quality permeate and easy operation (Al-Bayari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">Dedicated digital signal processor (DSP) is usually employed as control center of the wastewater treatment system. Windows control center (WinCC) platform connects the control nodes in the wastewater treatment process with IoT control equipment on the plant's dedicated network to achieve the best performance, and it can realize a kind of real-time control of the overall process. This mode has series of characters, which include low overall network latency, stable signal sampling, less communication traffic consumption, flexible adaptation to different working conditions, overall technology, and so on. Each equipment status based on WinCC platform is reliable, which presented excellent in dedicated control performance. The daily equipment maintenance and process status changes, mainly relying on manual, ledger and video inspection (Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2010</xref>). While facing with city-level wastewater treatment system operation, maintenance management and water quality intelligent dynamic supervision business model, this model will face many deficiencies, such as complex liquid-phase working condition equipment working condition monitoring, environmental dynamic monitoring, manual daily inspection, the import and export of water quality monitoring, alarm valve, and so on. It is difficult to use the configuration platform as easy and convenient services such as pre-determining value strategies, predicting emergency situations and replacing assets in wearable equipment. Long-term robust operation of the wastewater treatment system at the city level also will bring predictable to the user. In this paper, a sewage treatment project in an economic development zone of Wuxi, China, was investigated as an example, the industrial wastewater treatment process based on AO + MBR membrane technology was discussed, and the key technology for the construction of a city-level wastewater treatment based on IoT control system platform was analyzed (dos Santos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">The Integrated Circuit Materials Industrial Park of Wuxi is serving the large silicon chip production, which mainly produces chemical mechanical polishing materials, high-purity chemical reagents, electronic gases, photoresists, mask plates, compound semiconductor materials, advanced packaging materials, and so on. By 2025, the scale of integrated circuit (IC) material industry will exceed 30 billion Yuan, and the park will become the largest integrated circuit material industry cluster in East China. Meanwhile more and more key enterprises are gathering in the industrial park. According to expectations, there will gather more than 50 key integrated circuit material enterprises.</p><p id="Par10">The wastewater treatment project discussed in this paper mainly serves the newly built large silicon chip and components supporting enterprises, and it is an independent supporting sewage treatment plant for the area and is also a necessary condition for the smooth operation of the large silicon industrial park. The daily processing capacity is 50,000 tons. The park consists of three areas, which are chemical industry area (electronic chemicals area, 5.5 km<sup>2</sup>), large silicon wafer supporting area (800 acres) and components supporting area (700 acres). According to the implementation plan of water environment comprehensive treatment in Taihu Lake Basin, the over allowable discharge of COD<sub>Cr</sub>, ammonia nitrogen, total nitrogen and total phosphorus is reduced by 50% (2005 is the base year) from 2012. The water quality target of hemp section of the canal is lower than 2.0, reaching class V standard, total phosphorus reaching class IV and permanganate index reaching class III (Niaei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2021</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Current characteristics of municipal-scale industrial effluents</title><p id="Par11"><list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par12">More special equipment.

These will result in the equipment facing a lot of routine maintenance work.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Multi-mode AO + MBR process</title><p id="Par18">The multi-mode AO + MBR process performs a function of degradation resistance, but bioreactors alone or membrane filtration alone cannot perform. Organic pollutants and suspended solids have a certain treatment effect. The conventional process of sludge separation is achieved by sedimentation tank, while the multi-mode AO + MBR process applies membrane separation technology. It replaces the conventional activated sludge process with secondary sedimentation tanks and deep treatment processes, and has the effect of removing the microorganisms on which the biological treatment process depends on the biological treatment process. The separation of the microorganisms from the culture medium (mixture) allows the microorganisms to be retained in the biochemical reaction tank, while ensuring that the effluent contains fewer microorganisms and other suspended solids. The multi-mode AO + MBR process is characterized by a complete separation of hydraulic retention time and sludge age in the bioreactor. The high sludge age with low residence time allows for a better and richer microbial population in the sludge, which not only increases the ability of resisting shock loads but also more stable effluent. The process provides an opportunity for organic pollutants, nitrogen and other pollutants to be discharged. The degradation of contaminants creates favorable conditions.</p><p id="Par19">The multi-mode AO + MBR process is characterized by the immersion of a dedicated membrane module in a mixed solution, either pumped by an integrated membrane pump. Driven by the different water level, the water (through the microporous membrane) is drained out of the biochemical reaction cell, where microorganisms, cells and other particles are intercepted within the biochemical reaction cell. The most important feature of the submerged MBR is the exceptionally low operating pressure with transmembrane resistance typically not exceeding 50 kPa. The process adopts low differential pressure and permeate flux, which has weak differential polarization on the membrane surface and can be achieved by applying certain perturbations on the membrane surface. It is common practice to inflate the membrane surface, thereby subjecting it to violent perturbations of the gas–liquid phases to retard this process effectively.</p><p id="Par20">The multi-mode AO + MBR process owns the properties of small footprint, high treatment efficiency and stabilities. In the multi-mode AO + MBR process, the shortcomings of unstable water quality and easy expansion of the sludge in traditional process can be overcome by replacing the conventional activated sludge process with a membrane module instead of a secondary clarifier.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par21">High quality produced water flow</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par22">After being treated with membrane bioreactor technology, the wastewater in general (where domestic wastewater accounts for a large proportion) has a COD up to 30 mg/L, BOD up to 5 mg/L, the content of NH<sub>3</sub>-N near to 0. It can be directly recycled for cooling circulating water, domestic miscellaneous water and other fields, which is generally difficult to achieve in traditional processes. This high-quality water can be directly reused and may effectively reduce the subsequent treatment process and lower investment or operating costs.</p><p id="Par23">All the activated sludge in the tank can be intercepted by the membrane separation (membrane pore size of 0.1 μm). The biological co-metabolism is achieved, thus greatly increasing the removal rate of indestructible organic matter. The separation of mud age and hydraulic retention time is limited (Feng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2021</xref>). As a result, nitrifying bacteria with a long generation cycle can be effectively multiplied, which greatly increases the concentration of NH<sub>3</sub>-N in wastewater and obtain clear and high-quality reuse water. The turbidity of the effluent after treating by the membrane bioreactor can reach below 0.1 NTU and SDI value less than 3%. It can be used directly as feed water for sodium filtration or reverse osmosis, which provides the possibility for wastewater resource utilization and economic sustainability.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par24">Strong impact load resistance</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par25">Due to the high concentration of activated sludge in the membrane bioreactor, which is two to five times that of the traditional process, the microbial population is rich and the biological chain is complete, so it has a strong ability to resist impact loading.</p><p id="Par26">As a result of membrane separation, the sludge age and hydraulic retention time can be separated.

AOT was characterized by the generation of hydroxyl radicals (-OH) with strong oxidation capacity under high temperature and pressure, electric, acoustic, optical, and other conditions. Under suitable reaction conditions such as irradiation and catalysts, the oxidation of large molecules in refractory organic matter will be decomposed into small molecules of low or non-toxic substances (Rashid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2020</xref>).

Furthermore, the treated tail water can be used as water supply source for road landscape. Obviously, the project has a significant effect on improving regional water environment quality, and its environmental benefits are huge. The estimated pollutants can be reduced each year as follows (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>):<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>System inlet and outlet water quality (mg/L)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Project</p></th><th align="left"><p>BOD5</p></th><th align="left"><p>CODCr</p></th><th align="left"><p>SS</p></th><th align="left"><p>TN</p></th><th align="left"><p>NH<sub>3</sub>-N</p></th><th align="left"><p>TP</p></th><th align="left"><p>Thloride</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Inflow water</p></td><td align="left"><p>180</p></td><td align="left"><p>350</p></td><td align="left"><p>300</p></td><td align="left"><p>55</p></td><td align="left"><p>40</p></td><td align="left"><p>4.5</p></td><td align="left"><p>10</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Designed effluent</p></td><td align="left"><p>≤6</p></td><td align="left"><p>≤40</p></td><td align="left"><p>≤10</p></td><td align="left"><p>≤10</p></td><td align="left"><p>≤5</p></td><td align="left"><p>≤0.3</p></td><td align="left"><p>≤1.5</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par79">The indirect economic benefits of the project are mainly reflected by reducing the economic losses caused by water pollution to the society. It can reduce the investment and running cost to the enterprises in the park obviously while compare to decentralized sewage treatment method. The sewage contains nutrients such as BOD<sub>5</sub>, N, P and K, which can be transformed into mud cake after sewage treatment, and they can be used as garden fertilizer. While the plant is finished, the water quality of Taihu Lake will be significantly improved also.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by National Key Research and Development Project of China (2017YFB0403504).</p></ack><sec><title>Funding</title><p>The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement"><title>Compliance with ethical standards</title><sec id="FPar1" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p id="Par80">The authors declared that we have no conflict of interest.</p></sec></sec><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Al-Bayari</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>Sadoun</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Shatnawi</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">An Internet and wireless networking-based water pipes web application for fault reporting</article-title><source>Int J Commun Syst</source><year>2020</year><volume>33</volume><fpage>12</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1002/dac.4363</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Asthana N, Bahl R, IEEE (2019) IoT device for sewage gas monitoring and alert system.
