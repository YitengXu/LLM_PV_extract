Ever-increasing population, rapid urbanization, and industrial advancement are some of the key driving factors for creating critical man-made problems that eventually threaten the existence of living beings on this earth. With the industrial scale adoption of synthetic polymer in the 1940s, a new era of materials and manufacturing technologies was unlocked. Plastic has been a ubiquitous commodity for more than 50 years in every aspect of our lives, covering households, construction, packaging, health care, automotive, etc. It is mainly a petroleum-derived non-biodegradable with a unique polymeric structure that offers low specific weight, low thermal and electrical conductivity, and high durability (plastic bags-20 years, plastic bottles-450 years, fishing line-600 years), excellent mechanical properties, reasonable pricing, etc. (Eagle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2016</xref>; Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR186">2016</xref>; Landon-Lane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2018</xref>; Mazhandu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">b</xref>). Plastics are mainly of two types—thermosetting and thermoplastics. Thermosetting plastics or engineered polymers, like polyurethanes, phenolic resins, and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, have a crosslinked structure that ensures high mechanical strength, thermal stability and resistance to corrosion. On the other hand, plastic materials like polyethene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinylchloride (PVC), and polyethene terephthalate (PET) contain linear chains and flexible structures to offer an easy modification to any shape by applying heat (Mourshed et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2017</xref>; Horodytska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2019</xref>).
</p><p id="Par27">However, pure plastics need additives (plasticisers, stabilisers) to attain certain desired properties as they have higher degradability with lower thermal, mechanical, and physical properties (Murphy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">2001</xref>). This development of plastics not only eases human life in a convenient way but also generates a large volume of waste which is hazardous and poses threats to all living beings and to the environment. Plastics, in the form of bottles, bags, containers, cups, accessories, packaging materials, etc., make a significant portion (about 10–13%) of the total inorganic content in MSW (Moharir and Kumar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">2019</xref>). At present, plastics, metals, glass, papers and many other organic and inorganic contents from MSW and megacities around the world are suffering badly to handle this increasing volume of MSW (2 billion tonnes (BT) per year) (Mourshed et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2017</xref>; Masud et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">2022</xref>; Moharir and Kumar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">2019</xref>; Mazhandu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">b</xref>). It is estimated that single used plastic products (polybags, food utensils, packaging materials, etc.) contribute about 50% of that plastic waste and end up their journey in landfill sites or in the marine environment (Duru et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2019</xref>). An extensive research focus should be given to the post-consumer of plastic products, even for thermoplastics (polypropylene, polyethene, high-density polyethene), to tackle the environmental challenges. As every individual polymer group has their identical physical and chemical composition, understanding the characteristics properties are essential to estimate about the recycling and energy recovery potential from these polymer groups. However, sustainable waste management planning, sharing technical know-how among developed and undeveloped countries, conducting campaigns to make aware mass people about the adverse effect of plastic pollution as well as their role as global citizen to minimise  this impact are the primary considerations to enjoy the full advantages of plastic.</p><p id="Par28">This high amount of waste plastics consequently affects the ecosystem through soil pollution by landfilling, marine pollution by ocean dumping, and air pollution by open dumping (Mourshed et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2019</xref>; Paletta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">2019</xref>). Moreover, these problems will be added in a cumulative manner throughout the entire life cycle of plastic and threatens to ecological balance. In the first scenario, it is a complicated process (mainly for the undeveloped countries) to collect and sort plastic waste from other solid waste and arrange special recycling or dumping process. Secondly, due to lack of space or dumping sites, small and underdeveloped countries prefer incineration or open burring to reduce the mass and volume of plastics, and these processes emit a significant amount of greenhouse gas (GHG), COx, NOx, and different types of poisonous gases into the environment. However, open dumping has the same issue with spreading odour and infectious diseases. Thirdly, while dumping on the land, it turns soil infertile and contaminates groundwater; for sea dumping, marine life is heavily disturbed as plastic floating and sustains for hundreds of years. Lack of infrastructure, incorrect dumping techniques, inadequate legislation, and mismanagement are the key factors for this plastic pollution. it is estimated that about 80% of those wastes end at their disposal in land (Landon-Lane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2018</xref>; Paletta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">2019</xref>). Moreover, clogging of drainage system, flooding and natural disasters, infertility of soils, and contamination of water are the common results of improper plastic waste management systems (Carpenter and Wolverton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2017</xref>; Mourshed et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par29">On the other hand, plastics are used accross almost every sectors (i.e., dometic, food packaging, industry, etc.) resulting in generating a great deal of plastic waste  that ultimately affects the ecosystem. According to World Bank group report, plastics comprise about 5–12% of the world’s total waste generation (20–30% by weight) (Awasthi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2017</xref>; Kaza et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2018</xref>) and about 60% of plastics enter into environment as plastic waste (PW) (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR193">2021</xref>). From 0.35 million tonne (MT) annual production in 1950 (8.4% annual growth rate), PW generation reached more than 360 MT in 2018 (Horodytska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2019</xref>; Paletta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">2019</xref>; Ayeleru et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2020</xref>; Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR193">2021</xref>). China holds the first position in producing plastic materials and accommodates about 29.4% of the world’s total demand, followed by another two giant regions, Europe and North America, with 18.5% and 17.7%, respectively (Horodytska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2019</xref>). In Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, a global snapshot of plastic production and disposal techniques has been illustrated from 1980 to 2015. Geyer et al. reported that out of 381 Mt of plastic production in 2015, only 19.5% got recycled, 25.5% treated in incineration plants, and about 55% left as discarded. Moreover, about 80% of PW dumping ended up inland as a final destination (Landon-Lane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2018</xref>; Paletta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">2019</xref>) and clogging of a drainage system, flooding and natural disasters, infertility of soils, and contamination of water are the common causes of improper plastic waste management system (Carpenter and Wolverton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2017</xref>; Mourshed et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2017</xref>). It is interesting to note that, although China is the largest plastic producer, it consumes almost one-fourth compared to North America or Europe (PlasticsEurope <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">2016</xref>). In 2015, USA recycled 9%, waste to energy (WtE) conversion 15%, and disposed of 76% of their total 34.56 MT of PW (EPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2015</xref>), whereas, in 2016, the first EU countries (including Norway and Switzerland) did higher recycling (31.1%) than landfilling (27.3%) out of their total 27.1 Mt of PW (Horodytska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2019</xref>). However, for poor and developing countries, it becomes challenging to arrange proper collection (as a significant portion of PW remains unattained and mixed with MSW) and transfer to landfill sites as they still have scarcity of living and agricultural land space (Ayeleru et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2020</xref>). Though there are also limitations in proper waste data management systems in developing countries, it is estimated that only Indonesia, India, Thailand, Malaysia, Iran, and Bangladesh from the Asian region produce around 1 Mt of PW (Dhokhikah et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2012</xref>), whereas only seven cities of India is responsible for generating 500 kT of PW every year (Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2017</xref>). Moreover, PW generation rate varies with income level as follows: high income (USD 12, 476 or more): 13%, upper middle income (USD 4036 to USD 12,475): 11%, lower-middle (USD 1026 to USD 4035): 11%, low income (USD 1,025 or less): 6.4% (Kaza et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2018</xref>). From the per capita PW generation pattern shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Europe, United States of America (USA), Canada is at the top in the ladder, and their level of income, the standard of living, lack of consumer awareness, etc. plays a key role for this case (Mourshed et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2017</xref>; Horodytska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2019</xref>; Masud et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2019</xref>). This high amount of waste plastics consequently affects the eco-system through soil pollution by land filling, marine pollution by ocean dumping, air pollution by open dumping as they are not a part of our food chain (Mourshed et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2017</xref>; Paletta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">2019</xref>). Lack of infrastructure, improper and unplanned dumping, inadequate legislation and mismanagement are the key factors for this plastic pollution.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>A global snapshot of plastic generation, consumption and disposal (NAFTA-Canada, Mexico, United States region, CIS-Commonwealth of Independent States) (Jambeck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2015</xref>; Geyer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2017a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">b</xref>; Horodytska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2019</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41742_2023_507_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par30">In line with plastic pollution inland, nowadays, marine pollution from PW is becoming a great concern for living beings, and it is estimated that about 60–80% of marine derbies contain plastic (Paletta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">2019</xref>; Peng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">b</xref>). However, plastic pollution in marine environment was firstly introduced in early 1970, and not that much large-scale investigation has been covered for the past 40 years (Jambeck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2015</xref>). About 80% of marine debris has its origin from land sources, while the discharge from ocean vessels (commercial, military, public transport) or ship casualties are also significant. Although most of the PW data and resources mainly cover land-based PW, however, by considering the population density, income level, and solid waste generation rate, Jambeck et al. calculated that only in 2010, about 4.8–12.7 Mt of total 275 MT of PW generation entered into ocean from 192 coastal countries while in 1975 the total solid waste portion was about 6.4 Mt (Jambeck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2015</xref>). By the year 2050, it is estimated that cumulative plastic production will reach 34 Bt, and at pace with the current consumption rate, around 12 Bt of PW will find their final destination either in landfills or marine areas (Geyer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2017a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">b</xref>; Silva et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">2020</xref>). Waste patches  in the Atlantic and Pacific reached approximate 100 Mt, and around 80% of that contains plastics (Sevigné-Itoiz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">2015</xref>). According to United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), plastic pollution is one of the most emerging environmental problems in oceans and the estimated value for its annual damage is USD 13 billion (Peng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">b</xref>). It is estimated that between 2015 and 2017, the plastic accumulated in the ocean increases more than 33-times, alarming for taking actions for PW management (Peng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">b</xref>), whereas their consequence on marine life can be articulated from the garbage patch in Pacific, North Atlantic, Indian oceans as well as at sea surface and seafloor of Arctic sea ice (Obbard et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">2014</xref>; Peng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">b</xref>). Human activities, such as industrial dumping, leaching of chemicals (transported either by rainfall or  though rivers and canals), dumping of hazards solids from populated islands, and transportations (ships and fishing boats)  are causing serious hamful to the survivability of arctic ecosystem (Monteiro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">2018</xref>; Varotsos and Krapivin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180">2018</xref>; Paletta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">2019</xref>). Weather conditions (temperature, humidity content, pressure, etc.) and long durability of plastic debris also form micro fragments of plastics or microplastics, which is extremely challenging to clean up from the ocean, and the condition gets worst when these microplastics accidentally get ingested by marine invertebrates (Goldstein and Goodwin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2013</xref>). Moreover, roughly 51 trillion microplastics from different plastic materials are floating in sea, which is consumed as sea food by marine animals and human being (also in the form of salt) (Mazhandu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">b</xref>). According to a statics in 2015, 35% of these microplastics have been contributed by synthetic textiles, followed by 28% from car tires, 24% from city dust and the rest of the portion from road markings, marine coatings, personal care products, and plastic pellets, etc. (Statista <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">2015</xref>). In addition, toxic elements from pesticides or other chemicals like polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) get absorbed in plastics and ingested by living species inland and marine life directly or indirectly (through food chain) (Mazhandu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">b</xref>). Recently, ocean ecosystems and terrestrial ecosystems are getting much affected by tons of plastic in beach areas thrown by visitors and inhabitants (Chiba et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2018</xref>; Ng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par31">The outcome of this plastic pollution in both land and marine environment will become much more severe to total ecosystem due to unsustainable production, utilization or consumption pattern, disposal after utilization, collection and post-processing operations. Plastic waste mainly litters enter into environment due to the lack of proper collection (limited workers and supporting arrangements to proceed collection) or from mismanagement after collection (open burning, unwise dumping, poorly managed dumping sites). From the plastic production stage to processing and disposal, about 1781 Mt equivalent of CO<sub>2</sub> was emitted into environment in 2015, and it is predicted to reach up to 6500 Mt by 2050 (Mazhandu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">b</xref>). On the other hand, as the materials are not fully contained, leaking and transportation to the land and marine environment can also  happen by waterways (drains, canals, rivers), winds, etc. From Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, it can be seen that in the East and Asia Pacific region, mismanaged rate of waste plastic is higher, and it is about 60%. Although the waste generation and collection rate depend on income level, developed and rich countries have better waste management technologies, dumping areasand waste collection facilities, which helps to minimise the mismanaged plastic volume, and North America had the lowest share (about 0.9%) in 2010. However, if we look at the country-wise estimated mismanaged plastic share in 2025, it is also obvious that Asian countries are in the leading position, and China holds the first position by covering 25.79% of total global production, which is definitely alarming and urges for immediate action. According to the report of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change of India, out of 15,000 tons/day of plastics, only 9000 tons are collected and processed, whereas the rest 6000 tons are dumped in landfill sites or drained into the sea (Moharir and Kumar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">2019</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The scenario of global mismanaged plastics waste (Jambeck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2015</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41742_2023_507_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par32">Therefore, it is high time to tackle the mismanaged plastics rather than them being tangled in the environment and, at the same time, ensure possible waste to energy (WtE) and waste to products (WtP) conversion. Therefore, sustainable plastic waste management should be ensured by the simultaneous action of non-technical/non-instrumental and technical/instrumental approaches. Non-technical/non-instrumental approach mainly comprises the increasing public awareness, strengthening existing laws by the government and facilitating ease of PW collection or developing collection rate and strategies. Whereas post-collection treatments of PW involves the conversion of PW into WtP and WtE by the evolvement of most modern technologies and involving all stakeholders in society (such as manufacturers, consumers, and waste collection staff) for the successful implementation of PW control plans and strategies. However, improving existing waste management skills and introducing modern techniques along with the implementation of sustainable and less production and consumption strategies are significant contributors to the minimisation of plastic waste generation as well as to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)-2030 agenda set by UN (Varotsos and Cracknell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179">2020</xref>). Making these actions happen in reality needs the active participation of policymakers, all the stakeholders, including consumers, manufacturers, waste management workers (formal and informal) and above all, awareness among the mass people.</p><p id="Par33">In this review, we provide an overview of the main sources of plastic waste generation and their impact on environmental pollution.

But still, they require proper guidelines and regulations for the dumping and recycling process to ensure maximum utilization with minimum damage to environment. However, MSW is heterogeneous as they are a mixture of recyclable, degradable and hazardous materials. Repalletization and remoulding are easy and effective for treating homogenous plastic wastes instead of dumping or burning them with general MSW.

Thus, millions of SUPs related to the pandemic have been released into the environment, posing major environmental risks (Benson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2021</xref>). If every person in the world used and discarded just one mask each day, only six nations—India, the United States, Brazil, Nigeria, and the United Kingdom—would produce at least 702, 386, 219, 140, 75, and 45 million facemasks made of polypropylene plastic each day. These facemasks could take more than 450 years to decompose and could release micro plastic as they break down (Benson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2021</xref>). Thus, it is estimated that 22.4–53.6 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> gas emission takes place from facemask production, waste treatment plants and transportations of the above mentioned six countries  have been produced approximately 1.6 Mt facemasks in a daily basis (Graulich et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par40">The situation regarding the use of corona-related plastics in Bangladesh is also a matter of headache. About 14,500 tons of plastic waste (PW) were disposed of in a single month (March–April, 2020), according to data provided by ESDO, with 3076 tons of the total being disposed of by Dhaka City alone. A total of 5877 tons from 1216 million discarded hand gloves, of which 3039 tons are comprised of plastic, were the main source of PW. 1592 tons came from used medical masks, and 900 tons came from hand sanitizer bottles (Graulich et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2021</xref>). Aquatic environments are open to the ocean and around 1.56 billion facemasks landed into the ocean. Community scientists stated that the number of PPE that were discarded was around 107,212 pieces from waterway and beaches. Different facemask in the ocean, was seen in the nest of birds, some birds died falling a victim to this waste (Ammendolia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2022</xref>). The number of medical masks used by USA escalated to 89 million in the COVID situation and UK used near about 24.37 billion masks per year. There is also a threat of carbon dioxide emission due to increasing plastic waste. The number of facemasks used by China and Japan per day is near around 14.8 million (Dey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2023</xref>). Disposal face mask is alarming for the biodiversity, which can harm the digestive system and cause internal blockage. The micro particle that is released due to the use of masks escalated to 1246.62 items which urges thereby to take necessary some steps; such as, introducing  bio-degradable masks, raising awareness for the reuse of facemask after decontamination, reclaimable masks to minimise the spread of micro particles (Jiang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2022</xref>). The use of a footprint calculator allowed researchers to examine temporal changes, shopper behaviours, and trends of plastic consumption. During the epidemic, there were restrictions against leaving the house that reduced single-use plastic. Bottle usage increased threefold, while food wrapper consumption increased by twofold. The customer's decision to use plastics may be influenced by government-led guidelines (Winton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR188">2022</xref>). In Sri Lanka the waste management was not adequate to deal with the plastic waste before the start of pandemic. Due to COVID, the burning of plastic increases to avoid contamination. Burning the plastic in an improper way impacts the environment. Awareness program can be useful for the people of Sri-Lanka (Jayasinghe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2022</xref>). Pandemic has created a new plastic problem which has a huge impact on human health because of the chemical additives. The healthcare waste has increased up to 6 times and 30% of the beaches surveyed had PPE pollution. To solve the problem sufficient fund should be collected, and incentive should be taken to regulate the waste management policies (Rivas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">2022</xref>). There are some waste management policies like collecting the waste separately and disinfecting it. The COVID waste should be stored for 24 hours; then it should be taken to the biomedical waste treatment plant (Chowdhury et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2022</xref>). However, some of the most common  wastes management conversion technologies those can be used for managing COVID wastes as well are  pyrolysis, incineration, carbonization and gasification and the useful outputs can be listed as  solid fuel, liquid fuel, heat and electricity (Al-Omran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2021</xref>). An innovative solution includes the disposal of nitrile gloves to enhance the mechanical properties that the clay possess which shows an  increase in close porosity (Zhu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR195">2022</xref>).</p><p id="Par41">As most of the PPEs are made with plastic polymers, they turn out to be a huge provider of micro plastics in agricultural soil and rivers and are suspected to harm ecosystem health. Moreover, in Bangladesh, the lack of well-developed waste management facilities indirectly gives access to those MW from the hospitals and residential areas to farmland. So, it is important to focus on MW management without delay; otherwise, crop-growing soil health will be damaged.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Effects of Plastic Wastes</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Soil</title><p id="Par42">After collecting from households, offices, business centres, and industries, plastics are usually transferred to some secondary transfer station where the necessary sorting has been carried out. After then, recycling or reuse of plastics is conducted depending on the available infrastructure arrangement and technologies; otherwise, the PW are dumped in open space or landfill sites or burning in open space. Once plastics are integrated with the soil matrix, they can change the soil porosity and soil binding properties by affecting soil aggregation and water dynamics of soil. Plastic wastes, especially microplastics (MPs), can interact with multiple soil properties shown, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. MPs contain toxic additives and hazardous contaminants such as polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE), perfluorochemicals (PFOS), heavy metals like copper, zinc, lead, etc., and the high dispersion capabilities of MPs allowed them to mix up with soil and degrade soil fertility (Gaylor et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2013</xref>; Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR184">2015</xref>; Brennecke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2016</xref>; Hodson et al. <xref rid="CR75" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Moreover, plastic also hinders the growth of earthworms and other useful microorganisms, which consequently lead to the infertility of soil. The appearance of plastics as ecosystem stressors affects soil health and changes soil biophysical properties, which creates a complex variation in the environmental behaviour of other pollutants in soil (Alimi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2018</xref>; Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185">2018</xref>). Stimulation of soil enzymes can be happened by the addition of microplastics to soil.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Influence of plastic wastes on soil as well as corresponding effects on plant growth and ion adsorption (Guo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2020</xref>) (with permission to reuse)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41742_2023_507_Fig4_HTML.png" id="MO4"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Living Beings and Environments</title><p id="Par43">While dumping plastic on open landfills, MPs get formed with the surrounding environmental factors (pressure, humidity, temperature, etc.) MPs can easily be passed and mixed with the environment (soil, water, storm) and get accumulated in human body by various exposures like consumption of food, dust inhalation, water contamination, etc. As MP's pollution in soil results in health and ecological risk, it is became a serious concern and needs to be addressed properly.

Also, many sea species ingest microplastics, such as crab, oyster, mussel, sea cucumber, etc., which are used as human food afterwards. MPs in these seafood damage not only the taste of the foods but also make it more toxic as all of these plastic merchandises contain compounds like formaldehyde, benzene, and dioxins. Some also contain some additives such as ultraviolet stabilisers and artificial pigments responsible for serious health issues like weight gain, endocrine disruption, insulin resistance, cancer, etc., which also pose serious health hazards for human beings (trash MAY 28, 2019).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Marine Environment</title><p id="Par45">In addition to the existing 150 MT of plastic litter in marine environment, about 8 MT of plastic waste is added every year; however, UNEP predicts this rate of plastic entering into sea is close to 10–20 MT (Mazhandu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">b</xref>). This huge pile of plastic waste threatens marine life and consequently damage marine ecosystem. As microorganisms (like copepods and zooplanktons) in oceans take up 30% of CO<sub>2</sub> from environment and help to mitigate GHG emission rate,  it is essential to ensure their survival in marine environment (Cole and Galloway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2015</xref>). However, land-based sources are the considered as the major sources for marine pollution and according to a report, it is claimed that  the pollution is mainly caused by population living in coastal areas (within 50 km of coastline)  (Jambeck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2015</xref>). Apart from land sources, rivers, tides and coastline sources are the main sources of plastic pollution in marine environment. Due to the buoyancy effect, plastics float on ocean surface, and wind waves force plastic to merge at the centre of oceanic gyres or oceanic basins. Thus, at the centre of the ocean, plastics’ pollution is higher, which is then distributed around the periphery (Eriksen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2014</xref>). However, the presence of MPs, even at 75 MPs per millilitre and their ingestion of copepods cause not only the decrease in ingestion rate of CO2 by copepods but also affects their breeding (by releasing smaller eggs with a very low chance of successful hatching) (Cole and Galloway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2015</xref>). Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> illustrates the pathways of plastic input from the river to ocean and the contribution from different continents in 2015 (Eriksen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2014</xref>; Lebreton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2017</xref>). Rivers flowing through Asia have a major contribution to marine pollution than others as most of the rivers have their lifeline through Asian countries as well as the population also plays a vital role in this surge in marine pollution. Moreover, the coastal population in Northern Hemisphere has a major effect on the highest accumulation of plastics in oceanic gyres and basins in this region. Although the Southern oceans have less coastline population than Northern Hemisphere but have shown a similar order of magnitude of plastic pollution; thus, the inner movement of plastic wastes among the oceanic gyres and basins now becomes a serious concern (Eriksen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2014</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Global plastic input to the ocean</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41742_2023_507_Fig6_HTML.png" id="MO6"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Overview</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Plastic Entanglement</title><p id="Par46">Plastic materials causing entanglement of marine animals is now a global problem which has a bad impact on conserving marine wildlife. A large number of sea turtles, birds, and other mammals are killed every year after ingesting or entangled plastics. Pacific loggerhead and Hawaiian monk seals are among 700 species that eat plastic wastes (diversity). According to the recent convention on biological diversity report, fatal entanglement and ingestion of marine debris by these marine animals have increased by 40% in the past decade (index 22 Aug 2013). Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref> is the collected incidence of entanglement for different species, including seabirds, seals, and sea lions. The majority of entanglement materials are mainly plastics, such as fishing materials (like ropes and nets), water bottles, polybags, etc. The most common plastic material found is from fishing activities . It is approximated that &gt; 6.4 tons of fishing gear are abandoned in the sea every year (Macfadyen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2009</xref>). These materials continue to entangle with marine biota as most of them are  made from  lightweight, cheaper, and more durable synthetic materials. The entanglement of plastics for a specific species depends on its physical behaviour (Derraik <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2002</xref>). Among the listed species in Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>, the maximum entanglement rate is in the American crow in California, which is 5.6%. Marine plastics cause environmental, aesthetic, cultural and many other problems that are challenging to address (O’Brine and Thompson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">2010</xref>). In today’s world, ‘clean-up’ of those plastics by recycling then managed by authorities or following organizations has become a challenging phenomenon to a global extent (Ryan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">2009</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Plastic entanglement by organisms</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Location</p></th><th align="left"><p>Species</p></th><th align="left"><p>Study period</p></th><th align="left"><p>Entangled material</p></th><th align="left"><p>Entanglement rate</p></th><th align="left"><p>References</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>South Georgia</p></td><td align="left"><p>Antarctic Fur Seals</p></td><td align="left"><p>1988–1994</p></td><td align="left"><p>Polypropylene packing band (42%), synthetic string (21%), fishing net fragment (14%)</p></td><td align="left"><p>0.4%</p></td><td align="left"><p>(Arnould and Croxall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1995</xref>)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Cape Gantheaume, Kangaroo Island</p></td><td align="left"><p>New Zealand fur seals</p></td><td align="left"><p>1989–1991 and 2000–2002</p></td><td align="left"><p>Packing tape (30%), trawl netting (28%), lobster float rope (13%)</p></td><td align="left"><p>0.73%</p></td><td align="left"><p>(Page et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">2004</xref>)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Northwestern Hawaiian Islands</p></td><td align="left"><p>Hawaiian Monk Seal</p></td><td align="left"><p>1982–1998</p></td><td align="left"><p>Net, line, net and line combination, strap, ring</p></td><td align="left"><p>0.70%</p></td><td align="left"><p>(Henderson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2001</xref>)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Southern Australia</p></td><td align="left"><p>Australian fur seals</p></td><td align="left"><p>1997–2012</p></td><td align="left"><p>Plastic twine or rope (50%), other plastics (20%), monofilament line (17%)</p></td><td align="left"><p>N/A</p></td><td align="left"><p>(Lawson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2015</xref>)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Southeast Alaska and northern British Columbia</p></td><td align="left"><p>Steller sea lions</p></td><td align="left"><p>2000–2007</p></td><td align="left"><p>Packing bands 54%, rubber bands (30%), net (7%), rope (7%)</p></td><td align="left"><p>0.26%</p></td><td align="left"><p>(Rodrigue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">2017</xref>)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Seal Bay, Kangaroo Island</p></td><td align="left"><p>Australian sea lions</p></td><td align="left"><p>1988–2002</p></td><td align="left"><p>Monofilament netting (55%), packing tape (11%), trawl netting (11%), other rope (14%)</p></td><td align="left"><p>0.83%</p></td><td align="left"><p>(Page et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">2004</xref>)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Spanish Iberia and Mauritania</p></td><td align="left"><p>Northern gannets</p></td><td align="left"><p>2007–2010</p></td><td align="left"><p>Fishing ropes (73.5%), nets (11.8%), nylon fishing lines (14.7%)</p></td><td align="left"><p>0.93%</p></td><td align="left"><p>(Rodríguez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">2013</xref>)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Davis, California</p></td><td align="left"><p>American crow</p></td><td align="left"><p>2012–2013</p></td><td align="left"><p>Synthetic twine, string and rope (77%), plastic strips (10%)</p></td><td align="left"><p>5.6%</p></td><td align="left"><p>(Townsend and Barker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">2014</xref>)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>United States</p></td><td align="left"><p>Other Seals, sea lions, gull, fulmar and turtle</p></td><td align="left"><p>2001–2005</p></td><td align="left"><p>Fishing related (91.7%) such as fishing line, fishing hook, fishing string</p></td><td align="left"><p>N/A</p></td><td align="left"><p>(Thompson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">2009</xref>)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Effect on Marine organisms</title><p id="Par47">Plastics enter the marine environment directly through ocean-related activities like fishing, aqua-farming as well as from commercial ships and ferries etc. (Kershaw et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2011</xref>).

Plastic visibility is increasing due to plastic accumulation and its harmful influence on the environment and human health. Plastic takes centuries to degrade (Kaza et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2018</xref>). But due to their versatile nature, plastics have become a part of lifestyle and are currently used in different applications (Dhawan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2019</xref>).

About 99% of the total feedstock for plastic manufacturing is fossil fuel-based, which accounts for almost 8–9% of global gas and oil consumption (Nielsen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">2020</xref>). As depicted in the life cycle for plastic products in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, used plastic has been managed in two ways, either dumped or sent for recycling (waste to energy or waste to products conversation). In the case of recycling, there are several options like chemical recycling, mechanical recycling, energy recovery, etc. If the environmental, social and economic impact of producing a polymer is higher than that of mechanical recycling of the material in the end, it would be worthwhile to recycle the material instead of treating it as a waste (Simões et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">2014</xref>). The most traditional method is mechanical recycling, where plastic debris is collected, washed, melted and transformed into raw material (waste to product). On the other hand, chemical recycling is the process in which polymeric waste is converted to produce substances that are used as raw materials for the build-up of new products or to convert them into energy (waste to energy). Energy recovery includes incineration, pyrolysis and gasification, etc. Table <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref> gives an overview of the plastic recycling process used for different feedstocks and their respective outputs.<table-wrap id="Tab7"><label>Table 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Technologies of different chemical recycling processes (Europe 20/1/2021)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Recycling process</p></th><th align="left"><p>Feedstock</p></th><th align="left"><p>Output</p></th><th align="left"><p>Decontamination</p></th><th align="left"><p>Ability to treat mixed plastic</p></th><th align="left"><p>Maturity</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Mechanical recycling</p></td><td align="left"><p>PE, PET, PP, PS</p></td><td align="left"><p>Plastic (made of one or more polymers)</p></td><td align="left"><p>No</p></td><td align="left"><p>Yes</p></td><td align="left"><p>Industrial scale</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Solvent-based purification</p></td><td align="left"><p>PVC, PS, polyolefins (PE, PP)</p></td><td align="left"><p>Polymer</p></td><td align="left"><p>Yes</p></td><td align="left"><p>No</p></td><td align="left"><p>Pilot stage</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Chemical depolymerisation</p></td><td align="left"><p>PET, PU, PA, PLA, PC, PHA, PEF</p></td><td align="left"><p>Monomers</p></td><td align="left"><p>Yes</p></td><td align="left"><p>No</p></td><td align="left"><p>Existing pilot plants for PET, PU, PA</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Cracking (pyrolysis and gasification)</p></td><td align="left"><p>Plastic mix</p></td><td align="left"><p>Hydrocarbon mix</p></td><td align="left"><p>Yes</p></td><td align="left"><p>Yes</p></td><td align="left"><p>Pilot stage</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Thermal depolymerisation (pyrolysis)</p></td><td align="left"><p>PMMA, PS</p></td><td align="left"><p>Monomers</p></td><td align="left"><p>Yes</p></td><td align="left"><p>No</p></td><td align="left"><p>Pilot stage</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par51">Figure <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>a gives an idea of the volume of plastic waste generated per year.

That is the reason behind to end of their life cycle on either land or sea (Luo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2000</xref>). Several methods are used for the disposal of industrial and municipal wastes like incineration, landfilling, chemical recovery, etc. (Miskolczi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">2006</xref>). Suitable management of plastic wastes is one of the key issues of waste management. This management process impacts environmental and economic aspects (Delattre et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2001</xref>). In early 2000, the major amount of plastic waste was disposed of by landfilling (65–70%) and incineration (20–25%), whereas recycling is only about 10%. However, this scenario varies from country to country, depending on the standard of living and population (Mourshed et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2017</xref>; Masud et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par53">As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>, before 1980, plastic incineration and reprocessing were tiny.

The total waste produced was nearly 287 MT and increased with time.

In light of this hazardous waste management, environmental protection agency has improved federal and state regulations for landfilling by normalizing the use of landfilling beds, groundwater testing and post care after landfilling. As plastic waste has a high volume to weight ratio, appropriate landfilling space is a challenging issue.

This is because the octane number of some plastic materials is analogous with respect to some crude oil derivatives (Eriksson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2009</xref>), and it is predicted that almost 50% of total plastic wastes will be cured by incineration by 2050 (Geyer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2017a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">b</xref>).

This is a type of primary and secondary recycling process which starts with sorting out the thermoplastic to be used in the recycling process (La Mantia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2002</xref>). Homogenous waste thermoplastic is mainly converted into products with the nearly same original product. Figure <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref> illustrates the mechanical recycling steps of plastic products. After assembling natural gas, crude oil, salt, etc., from nature, these products pass to petrochemical companies in which polymer specialists make plastics after various stages of operation. After then, polymer colour, thickness, and size are customised and sent to distributed to the consumers. When the first life cycle ends, these products are treated as waste. Collecting these waste products is the first step of mechanical recycling. After sorting, these products go to the recyclers who try to recycle these products and form into the same or some different products. After this, it again passes to the consumers and this loop is going on. However, the recycling operation is not cost-effective as it needs a high amount of energy to reform, technology for sorting, cleaning, transportation and processing, and the subsequent costings to carryout all these steps in an environmental friendly manner Still, at first sight, mechanical recycling of plastic wastes appears to be one of the ‘green’ operations (La Mantia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2002</xref>).<fig id="Fig13"><label>Fig. 13</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Mechanical recycling loop of plastic products</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41742_2023_507_Fig13_HTML.png" id="MO13"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Biological Recycling</title><p id="Par59">To meet the demand for organic recovery, biodegradable plastics have been studied extensively. To handle the future demand, biological infrastructure must be established with proper technical know-how. Moreover, recycling biopolymers can be made possible by aerobic composting, aerobic bacteria, fungi, etc., which consume polymers for energy and reproduction. In addition, in biological recycling, organic carbon materials are also converted into biomass which possesses energy potential and saves environment. If degradable plastics face any obstacle in this process, they are sorted to be treated as non-degradable portions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Thermal Recycling or Incineration</title><p id="Par60">Generally, composite material which contains carbon fibre and polymer matrix is exposed to high temperatures during thermal recycling (Verma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182">2018</xref>). This high temperature usually lies between 450 and 700 °C depending on the resin property (Verma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182">2018</xref>). It can be seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref> that almost 54% of plastic recycling is carried out by thermal recycling (Tominaga et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">2015</xref>). Although the operation cost (cost of energy, labour) in thermal recycling is high but the easy refabrication process and utilisation of mixed plastics as feedstock materials makes thermal recycling much more popular than other recycling operations.

The limitation of separating the additives and non-intentionally added substances in plastic makes chemical recycling a far better approach than mechanical recycling (Europe and challenges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2019</xref>).

Large-scale open ocean transportation process is the most efficient way of transporting debris over a large distance, and this process has been operational since 1970 (Elipot et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2016</xref>).

Therefore, research works are going on, and many advanced techniques have been reported to reduce these huge piles of waste. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig20" ref-type="fig">20</xref>, plastic disposal methods can be classified into two basic strategies. One is degradation, and the other is recycling (Brems et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2013</xref>). Recycling of plastic disposals can be further classified into various types according to the characteristics of plastics. The American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) standard D5033-(2000) classifies recycling into four categories including primary (ASTM 1), secondary (ASTM 2), tertiary (ASTM 3) and quaternary (ASTM 4) recycling. Primary or physical recycling includes mechanical reprocessing of scrap materials, while secondary recycling includes mechanical processing of used plastic plastics into products with fewer performance requirements. Primary and secondary recycling indicates mechanical reprocessing of used materials to turn into new products with little or no effects on physical properties. Tertiary recycling means the recovery of chemical intermediates in the form of gases, liquids and solids, and quaternary recovery indicates the recovery of energy content of plastics (Okan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">2019</xref>). Tertiary recycling indicates changing intermediate chemical forms, while quaternary involves energy recapture. ASTM 1 and ASTM 2 include extrusion, segregation, direct reuse and so on, while ASTM 3 and ASTM 4 include gasification, hydrocracking, pyrolysis etc.<fig id="Fig20"><label>Fig. 20</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Currently used advanced methods for plastic waste management</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41742_2023_507_Fig20_HTML.png" id="MO20"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Resource Recovery</title><p id="Par74">Tertiary and quaternary recycling includes recovery of energy (waste to energy or WtE) and resources or products (waste to products or WtP). Currently, resource recovery of plastic wastes is mainly focused on thermolysis of thermoplastics. In thermolysis, thermoplastics undergo a chain reaction to process low molecular weight compounds (Okan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">2019</xref>). Again, thermolysis technology can be further classified into the following three methods:  pyrolysis, hydrocracking and gasification. The mechanism of all these three technologies is used to transform large molecular long-chain polymer into gas, oil and char (WtE) at high temperature. Pyrolysis is done in an inert atmosphere and sometimes with catalysts. However, gasification is carried out at sub stoichiometric air for CO, H<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub> fabrication, whereas hydrogenation is done in the presence of hydrogen (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR192">2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Pyrolysis</title><p id="Par75">Pyrolysis mainly refers to the transformation of a big chain polymer to a smaller one by thermal degradation. In this process, the temperature range varies from 300 to 900 °C under an inert gas atmosphere (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2014</xref>). Various important products like liquid oil, gas, etc. (WtE) are produced by pyrolysis. However, pyrolysis is suitable for treating polymers like PE, PP, and PET, which are composed of hydrocarbons (Wong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR189">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par76">Plastic pyrolysis is a complex route which is mainly governed by multi-step reactions depending on the feedstocks used. A simple pyrolysis process is illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig21" ref-type="fig">21</xref>a. Hirschler and Cullis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1981</xref>) offered the following four mechanisms of thermal polymer pyrolysis: (1) random chain scission, which is called fragmentation; (2) end chain scission, which is called depolymerisation; (3) cross-linking to form a chain network, and (4) elimination of side chain which is called chain- stripping. The decomposition route of plastic depends upon the chemical structure of a polymer.<fig id="Fig21"><label>Fig. 21</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic diagram of simple pyrolysis process (Gaurh and Pramanik <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2018</xref>), <bold>b</bold> simple schematic diagram of hydrocracking (Munir et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2020</xref>) (with permission to reuse)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41742_2023_507_Fig21_HTML.png" id="MO21"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Hydrocracking</title><p id="Par77">Hydrocracking or hydrogenation is the process in which long-chain hydrocarbons are converted into small molecules such as kerosene and gasoline. It is done by the addition of hydrogen in the presence of catalysts under high pressure (Al-Salem et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2017</xref>). A simple schematic diagram is given in Fig. <xref rid="Fig21" ref-type="fig">21</xref>b. With respect to pyrolysis, hydrocracking technology has several advantages. First, it can renovate plastic wastes into high-quality liquid fuels (Kasar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2020</xref>). It shows better selectivity for C<sub>6</sub>-C<sub>12</sub> range of gasoline than pyrolysis (Munir et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">2018</xref>). Again hydrocracking of plastic wastes can significantly reduce the heteroatom concentration and aromatic product yield in the products by improving the quality (Fuentes-Ordóñez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par78">Second, heat and mass transfer can be increased by hydrocracking. Pyrolysis has some drawbacks due to high viscosity and large size of polymer molecules at the output (Miranda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">2013</xref>). But it is an important matter of concern that hydrogen used in hydrocracking is expensive compared with other fluidizing gases in the pyrolysis process like nitrogen. For example, the cost of nitrogen is less than $200 per tonne, while electrically produced hydrogen costs approximately $2800 per ton (Ragaert et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">2017</xref>). Again, the hydrocracking process is held at high pressure, which requires high-cost equipment. Therefore, in terms of cost, hydrocracking is less popular than pyrolysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Gasification</title><p id="Par79">Gasification is also a type of thermolysis technology which is a worthy competitor to the other two technologies, pyrolysis and hydrocracking. Feeds are converted to syngas by gasification with light hydrocarbons like carbon dioxide, water, methane under high temperatures with the presence of oxygen (Brems et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2013</xref>; Krapivin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2017</xref>). There are various gasification processes used in the industries, such as the Battelle technique, Texaco gasification, Akzo process, etc. (Al-Salem et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2010</xref>). Among these, the Texaco gasification process is a commonly used technology, and a schematic diagram is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig22" ref-type="fig">22</xref> (Ragaert et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">2017</xref>). Texaco gasification process consists of two parts, including a liquefaction step and an entailed bed gasifier (Tukker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">1999</xref>). Plastics are thermo cracked into several particles in the liquefaction step with some condensable and non-condensable gas fractions or a heavy synthetic oil. These non-condensable gases are reused as fuel.<fig id="Fig22"><label>Fig. 22</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Texaco gasification process diagram (with permission to reuse)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41742_2023_507_Fig22_HTML.png" id="MO22"/></fig></p><p id="Par80">Condensed gases and resulting oil are injected into the gasifier. Gasification is held at a temperature between 1200 and 15,000 °C with stream and oxygen. Then it passes through under a cleaning process including hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen chloride removal. After all these steps, dry and clean synthesis gas is generated, which consists of hydrogen and carbon mono oxide with smaller portions of carbon dioxide, water, methane and some inner gases (Tukker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">1999</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Chemolysis</title><p id="Par81">Chemolysis is another resource recovery technology which is also defined as depolymerisation or solvolysis (Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2011</xref>; Ragaert et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">2017</xref>). In this process, individual plastics are chemically depolymerized into monomers at approximately 80–280 °C (Payne et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">2019</xref>). Unsaturated resins and polyesters like polyesters, polyethene terephthalate, polyamides, polycarbonate, polyurethane, etc., are mainly used as feedstock in hemolysis resource recovery technique (Panda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">2010</xref>; Dimitris and Achilias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2014</xref>; Oliveux et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">2015</xref>). In the chemolysis process, the recycling phenomenon is highly dependent on the type of plastic, resulting in difficulties in the recycling process of monomers from various plastic mixtures. For this reason, the procedure of the hemolysis process is comparatively narrow and is not considered the mainstream technology for plastic waste recycling. But some countries and reputed companies use this technique for various benefits due to its chemical reaction routes. Chemical reaction routes of hemolysis include glycolysis, methanolysis, hydrolysis and alcoholysis (Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Alcoholysis</title><p id="Par82">If the plastic polymer is depolymerized in alcohol to convert it into monomers, then it is called alcoholysis (Pardal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">2006</xref>). By alcoholysis, chemical degradation of polyurethane can be conducted. In this reaction, polyhydroxy alcohols and carbamate fragments are produced by transesterification reaction. But there is no carbon dioxide formed in output. By mixing different quantities of fresh polyhydroxy alcohols and isocyanates, converted monomers can be reprocessed from polyurethane (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR192">2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Hydrolysis</title><p id="Par83">Depolymerization of plastic polymers in an aqueous solution like alkaline, acidic or neutral is called hydrolysis (Raheem et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">2019</xref>). Raw materials can be recovered by this process by conducting a reaction of water molecules at the linkage point (Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2011</xref>). The monomers produced after hydrolysis can be reused with raw and fresh materials for the same foam. Reusing the facility of monomer materials improves the economic benefits, including environmental pollution.</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Methanolysis</title><p id="Par84">Depolymerization in the presence of methanol is called methanolysis (Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2009</xref>). PET produces ethylene glycol monomers and dimethyl terephthalate by methanolysis. These are essential monomers to produce epoxy resins and synthetic resins type materials. The depolymerization happens at 270–300 °C temperature and an approximate pressure of 0.1–15 MPa (Genta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2005</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec39"><title>Glycolysis</title><p id="Par85">Depolymerization of polymers in the presence of glycol is called glycolysis and is a universal material recovery method (Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2011</xref>). It is a popular commercial PET recycling method. Well-known companies like DuPont, and Dow adopted glycolysis commercially (Ragaert et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">2017</xref>) for the material recovery of PET. Glycolysis is called Specialized oligomeric products like α,ω-dihydroxy can also be produced by glycolysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec40"><title>Physical Recycling</title><p id="Par86">Physical recycling includes ASTM 1 and 2, which are called primary and secondary recycling. Due to relatively low recycling cost and simple mechanism primary recycling draws universal attention. Manufacturing a new PET bottle from a scrap PET bottle can be a good example of primary recycling like Coca-Cola and other PET bottles. By recovering of plastic wastes via mechanical means is called secondary or mechanical recycling. The new products created carry lower performance demand than the products generated from virgin plastics (Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2011</xref>). Treatment of plastic wastes in secondary recycling includes a number of steps like size reduction by granulators, segregation, crumbles or shredders, cleaning, palletisation, drying and extrusion. The secondary recycling application scope is limited for some kinds of thermoplastics. The thermoplastics which do not possess high melt viscosities as well as are not temperature sensitive show physical recycling (Okan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">2019</xref>). Major types of polymers which are recycled via mechanical recycling are PET and PE. Other types of polymers like PP, PS, PA, etc., are less than one per cent treated by mechanical or secondary recycling (MacArthur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">2017</xref>). Though physical recycling is an economically beneficial as well as environment-friendly technique, due to the above-mentioned reasons and more, this recycling process is applied narrowly.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>Marine Debris Treatment</title><sec id="Sec42"><title>Fuel Production from Marine Debris</title><p id="Par87">The debris which is extracted from the sea has a high calorific value that makes it suitable to be used as fuel. Coastal debris can be treated easily as it contains combustible materials like PE, PP, nylon and wood. Applying seawater as a solvent in a mixture of plastic materials is used in hydrothermal carbonization process. The operating temperature lies between 330 and 380 °C for the nylon fishing net, from 405 to 430 °C for PE fishing net, from 395 to 420 °C for PP rope coastal debris and from 115 to 115 °C for the wood (bamboo) coastal debris sample. Increasing the heating rate, the activation rate of global activation energy and the pre-exponential factors rose (Song et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">2019</xref>). Hydrochar at 300 °C is found to be the most affected thermal material; however, it can be seen from the study that HTC treatment is effective above 250 °C (Iñiguez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2019</xref>). However, hydrochar content has a proportional relation with temperature, whereas the number of inorganic anions reduced with temperature. The emission of gases also gets increases with temperature. The main organic compounds that are found in all cases are amides, alcohol and alkanes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec43"><title>Marine Debris Recycling</title><p id="Par88">The increasing number of marine plastics becomes difficult to manage; hence, subsequent recyclability of the plastic is necessary. Three following methods are generally used to conduct the recycling of marine debris: weathering method, characterization method and processing method. An artificial weathering method has been developed to investigate the recyclability of weathered and non-weathered PET. This model was designed to cope with major environmental effects (sunlight, temperature, seawater). In the characterization method, some PET flakes and HDPE caps are weathered. The surface change of the products is measured using a microscopic process. In the processing method, the following five different manufacturing methods are tested: filament and sheet extrusion, injection moulding, 3D printing and thermoforming. The test is conducted on all types of PET material, weathered, non-weathered and original PET (Ronkay et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec44"><title>Incineration of Marine Debris</title><p id="Par89">Energy recovery can be made in many ways from different types of feedstocks, and incineration is one of the processes to extract energy from waste. Using this process, heat and electricity can be produced from waste (Schneider et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">2018</xref>). Incineration helps not only to reduce waste volume but also helps to produce energy in the form of gas, fuel, heat, etc., from mixed and untreated marine waste. However, due to the high plastic content in marine debris, releasing toxic gases like dioxins, furans and polychlorinated biphenyls are common during the incineration of plastic waste (Iñiguez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2016</xref>). Thermal treatment also causes the emission of hydrogen halides along with various types of other hydrogen compounds (Iñiguez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2017</xref>). The presence of salt and some other minerals are a common problem in the incineration of marine debris, and all the plants cannot facilitate the cleaning system for the removal of salt; thus, the incineration process creates a lot of ashes in their output. South Korea has recently developed a new system that can process 100 kg/h of marine debris. This method uses slake limes for the removal of hydrochloric acid, activated carbon for the removal of dioxins and dust and back filter to remove heavy metal. The emission limit of the dioxins discharged in the atmosphere is also at a satisfactory level (Iñiguez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec45"><title>Biodegradation of Marine Plastic</title><p id="Par90">The biodegradation of plastic is a complex phenomenon. The initial biodegradation begins with the formation of microbial biofilm onto the plastic which is called plastisphere (Kirstein et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2019</xref>). This surface formation leads to the progress of bio deterioration. The exopolysaccharides secreted by microorganisms provide stronger biofilm adhesion to the plastic surface. The polymer is converted into a simpler form. Oligomers, dimers and monomers are the product of which the polymer is broken down. An enzyme destabilizes the carbon skeleton of polymers, promoting fragmentation (Degli-Innocenti <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2014</xref>). Mineralization the final step of the biodegradation of plastic, where the final product is released. BioLogiQ, Inc., a bioplastic resin manufacturing company, developed a new plastic which is a natural renewably resourced plant-based resin. The plastic is certified to biodegrade in 28 days. When polybutylene adipate terephthalate is mixed with BioPolymer, the biodegradable plastic also degrades in ocean environments. Test results showed that bioplastic has a 97% biodegradation rate in ocean water within a one-year period (Kennedy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec46"><title>Strategies for Marine Plastic Waste Management</title><p id="Par91">Current international policy for macro and microplastic contamination is a well-designed framework to minimize micro–macro plastic contamination from waterfront, beaches, oceans and marine environment (Sheavly and Register <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">2007</xref>). International convention for the prevention of pollution of ships (MARPOL) (Annex V pollution) gives the complete outline for international agreements and domestic legislation for marine vessels, and all the ships are encouraged to adopt these management practices and guidelines (Elgohary et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2015</xref>). Ship-owners are encouraged to adopt the best UNEP collaborates with international organizations like the International Oceanographic Commission Mission of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization to develop guidelines and regulations for monitoring marine litter and pollution (Walker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">2006</xref>). The strategy follows the main goal of reducing the amount and impact of land-based litter, sea-based debris and accumulated marine debris on the shoreline. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) also promote waste management education and mass awareness along with the monetarization of marine debris. The recommendation for the reduction of single use in light of plastic marine pollution includes: the effectiveness of bans on single used plastic is researched and evaluated so that the policies that are implemented will have a positive impact on the marine environment or not. Outreaching education is also in place to reduce the consumption of microbeads and plastic bags at the source (Kershaw et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2011</xref>). Launching take-back policies and incentives on returning to collect plastic bottles, cans, etc., in the sea areas can reduce plastic pollution from tourists. Moreover, installing more trash bins in tourist areas will be a step forward for the collection and minimization of random disposal of plastics in the marine environment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec47"><title>Product Bans</title><p id="Par92">The government should take necessary steps to ban two types of plastic products-microbeads and single used plastic carrier bags. Microbeads which are described as primary microplastic, policies regarding them should be strengthened due to their recent and inconsistent implementation. High taxes on plastic bags help to reduce the amount of plastic entering to waste stream as well as it will discourage people (both seller and buyer) (Ogunola et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">2018</xref>)<bold>.</bold> However, imposing these rules and legislations may cause economic disruption to many small and medium plastic production companies. But in the long run, it will help to design some suitable alternatives which are ecofriendly as well as keep running the small and medium enterprises. Therefore, detailed research should be conducted on the types of plastic products that should be banned and also suitable alternatives should be launched. Moreover, these initiatives should be initiated by the government and non-government organizations to back up the financial and political issues.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec48"><title>Scope and Challenges to Plastic Waste Management</title><sec id="Sec49"><title>Overview</title><p id="Par93">A theoretical model was presented by George et al.

Also adopting continuous monitoring technologies to observe the geo-ecosystem of water reserviours by considering the surrounding hydrological and socio-economic factors can be a great help to detect and control the possible contamination of water from different sources (Varotsos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR181">2020</xref>). Several countries that tried to implement this circular economy include Netherlands (Brouwer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2018</xref>), Austria (Van Eygen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR177">2018</xref>), United States (Martinho et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2017</xref>), Sweden (Singh and Cooper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">2017</xref>) and Finland (Dahlbo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2018</xref>), etc. To settle plastic pollution to a minimum level, the world-leading organisations should promote a circular economy to ensure maximum utilisation of our recyclable inputs. Beyond these, first of all, conventional mindsets should be changed in using plastic products.

After 2002, countries in Asia (Bangladesh), Africa and most of the European countries have introduced bans. Bangladesh in South Asia is the first country to ban thinner plastic bags (Today October 3, 2019). In 2016, Morocco introduced a nationwide ban on plastics (Today October 3, 2019), and New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern banned plastic bags in 2018 (Today October 3, 2019).</p><p id="Par97">Reductions in sales have been observed in areas where bans are affected, especially in the case of plastic bags, with shoppers opting to buy in other regions or limiting their purchases to whatever can be accommodated by reusable bags. In addition, some plastics may be cheaper to manufacture compared to alternatives such as jute or paper bags, and this not only increases the production costs incurred by businesses but also makes the product more expensive for consumers. We have also seen that in some countries, waste management services for conventional plastics, which is the bare minimum required, are already lacking. Therefore, any benefits attributable to biodegradable plastics will not be realized if they are introduced prematurely. Capacitating waste management systems in low-and middle-income countries will promote growth in the biodegradable plastics industry (Mazhandu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec52"><title>Psychological Interventions</title><p id="Par98">The first way to reduce plastic waste is by decreasing the quantity of buying plastic stuff. All the household plastic wastes, including non-recyclable bags and all those unhealthy crisps, need to be reduced by lowering our buying behaviour. It is all about taking simple things like owning own bags and refusing plastic bags and kinds of stuff everywhere.</p><p id="Par99">A six-level pyramid is shown in  Figure <xref rid="Fig26" ref-type="fig">26</xref> to illustrate the relative importance of reduce, reuse, repair, recycle, recover and disposal in waste management strategy. From all these aspects, the most important level is reducing our own buying intentions of fancy plastic stuff. But it is not conceivable to ban plastic entirely because still a lot of small and medium chemical industries run this business and create job opportunities for millions of people around the world. Reuse is the best option for all those pieces of stuff. A lot of plastic stuff ends up in recycling- requiring energy to turn it into a new look, or it is dumped where it will probably be sitting for hundreds of years. At this level, our throwaway culture should be challenged and replaced by the idea that anything brought can be brand new. The kinds of stuff in which the potential energy cannot be recovered should give to the administration. Motivating the mitigating actions and behavioural changes is an alternative pathway. These psychological benefits in nature can also extend economic values far beyond. Gaining a better behavioural cost and aid will lead to stimulating plastic pollution extenuation and effective policymaking.<fig id="Fig25"><label>Fig. 25</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Phase-out of lightweight plastic bags around the world (Xanthos and Walker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">2017</xref>) (with permission to reuse)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41742_2023_507_Fig25_HTML.png" id="MO25"/></fig><fig id="Fig26"><label>Fig. 26</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Six level pyramids to reduce plastic wastes</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41742_2023_507_Fig26_HTML.png" id="MO025"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec53" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par100">This review work mainly focuses on the identification of plastic waste generation sources and the severity of pollution in land and marine environment. Moreover, a comprehensive analysis is presented on the relative techniques to treat waste plastic as well as the challenges to attaining a sustainable plastic waste management policy. The adverse effect of plastic waste is now a global concern as it is linked with global warming and climate change by emitting toxic gases and contaminants to the environment. The increasing volume of plastic waste not only degrades soil fertility and contaminates groundwater but also heavily damages the surrounding ecosystems and marine environment. However, the conventional techniques of plastic management mainly involve open dumping or landfilling, burning, etc., and these processes ultimately cause environmental pollution rather than achieving sustainable waste management goals. In this work, traditional plastic waste management practised in land and marine environment is extensively reviewed, and their limitations to cope up with waste to energy conversion and recycling prospects are also illustrated. This work also sheds light on the in-depth analysis of new technologies to manage plastic waste and discussed the most environmental and economically friendly ways to manage plastic waste. Finally, this review work also sorts out the potential challenges and opportunities to manage plastic waste from diverse perspectives, including infrastructure development, introducing new alternatives to plastics, emphasising 3R and 4R waste management programs, strengthening the existing laws and regulations to control plastic pollution, and above all raising social awareness among every group in the society.
