A partial transformation of the CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> educt to CoO is observed and proposed to be a thermal decomposition process induced by the picosecond pulsed laser irradiation. The overpotential in the OER in aqueous alkaline media at 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> is reduced by 23% compared to the educt down to 0.32 V with a Tafel slope of 71 mV dec<sup>−1</sup>. Importantly, the catalytic activity is systematically adjustable by the number of PLFL treatment cycles. The occurrence of thermal melting and decomposition during one PLFL cycle is verified by modelling the laser beam energy distribution within the irradiated colloid volume and comparing the by single particles absorbed part to threshold energies. Thermal decomposition leads to a massive reduction in particle size and crystal transformations towards crystalline CoO and amorphous CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. Subsequently, thermal melting forms multi-phase spherical and network-like particles. Additionally, Fe-based layered double hydroxides at higher process cycle repetitions emerge as a byproduct. The results show that PLFL is a promising method that allows modification of the structural order in oxides and thus access to catalytically interesting materials.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>9</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>26</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2017_Article_13333.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Hydrogen is probably the cleanest fuel on earth, as it can be gained from water and reacts to water within its consumption. Nowadays, steam reforming of carbon-based fuels represents the main source of H<sub>2</sub>, but mainly fossil fuels are used and the carbon contamination of the produced H<sub>2</sub> is high<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The competing technology of electrolysis of water, which generates pure H<sub>2</sub>, is still consuming too much energy to implement as a long-term solution for the covering of our energy demand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. This is mainly due to the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction because of its four electron transfer, which requires suitable catalytic materials. Thus, the design of a highly active and cost-effective catalyst, to reduce the overpotential of water electrolysis, will play a key role in future’s success of H<sub>2</sub> as fuel. First row transition metals probably represent the most promising class of materials because of their abundance in earth’s crust and proven activity in the OER in alkaline media<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. However, their activity is usually lower compared to that of scarce and nobler materials like RuO<sub>2</sub> or IrO<sub>2</sub>. Thus, finding a suitable way to improve their OER activity is highly desirable. In general, it is believed that many heterogeneous catalysts can be further optimized by increasing the abundance of sites with high surface energy that are often related to surface defects. Thus, increasing the structural disorder of oxide particles seems promising, but a true synthetic control of metastable and defective nanoparticles is difficult to obtain as only a limited number of synthesis methods are adequate for this purpose.</p><p id="Par3">Among these, laser-induced transformations of particle morphology, crystallinity and chemical composition are promising and may lead to superior electrochemical properties. In this study, we focus on a catalyst synthesis via pulsed laser fragmentation in liquid (PLFL) approach that is applied to treat commercial CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> powder with the aim to induce structural disorder and improve its OER activity. CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is a spinel with interesting electronic and magnetic properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and is known to exhibit OER activity, but typically cannot compete with the best noble metal-based electrodes. Nevertheless, the research interest in spinels and especially ferrites, also perovskite-type, for catalytic applications is high. Taffa <italic>et al</italic>. recently published a mini-review on spinel-type ferrites as catalysts for photoelectrochemical water splitting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Another short review on ferrites in more general photocatalytic applications and on their synthesis has been published by Casbeer <italic>et al</italic>. in 2012<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. As well focused on photocatalysis, water splitting and pollutant decomposition, is the book chapter on ferrites of Ren <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Kharisov <italic>et al</italic>. included all fields of hetrogeneous catalysis into their mini-reviev on ferrite nanoparticle catalysts of 2014<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In regard to our study, the up to date and extensive review of Zhao <italic>et al</italic>. on spinels as catalysts for OER and ORR, that also contains a detailed part on preparation methods, is of highest relevance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Importantly, we utilize a flowing, not enclosed liquid jet for PLFL of CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> dispersed in water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Advantages of this setup include its scalability, precise energy dose quantification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, and higher intensity input into the colloid since no windows are required. This method allows precise control of oxide properties by applying the PLFL semi-continuously as shown by Lau <italic>et al</italic>. who were able to tune the band gap energy of ZnO particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Pulsed laser ablation in liquid (PLAL)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and PLFL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> are two methods that currently attract interest as synthesis routes for nanoscale catalysts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. These methods lead, due to the absence of ligands and precursor residues, to nanoparticles with bare surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. This enables increased interaction between catalyst and adsorptive which makes nanoparticles prepared by PLAL or PLFL suitable for heterogeneous catalysis. For instance, Blakemore <italic>et al</italic>. fabricated the most active unsupported spinel-type cobalt oxide nanocatalyst for OER, published to that time, by a PLFL of Co microscale powder in water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. The OER activity of the best CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/CoO catalysts in this study is higher than that reported previously by McCrory <italic>et al</italic>. for a CoFeO<sub>x</sub> catalyst<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. We reach an overpotential of 0.32 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> in 1 M KOH compared to that of 0.37 mV in 1 M NaOH reached by McCrory <italic>et al</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p id="Par6">PLFL is performed in a semi-continuous liquid flow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. We arrange the flow as a free – not enclosed – jet that is perpendicularly crossing the laser beam. In the following sections, we use the term <italic>passage</italic> (p in figure legends) as a description for the complete colloid volume flowing through the laser beam one time. Furthermore, we define the <italic>specific energy dose</italic> here as the energy, which is extinct by the total volume of particulate matter of the colloid within one passage. A definition of a volume related dose is reasonable since we compare the light absorption properties of particles of different sizes to thermal transformation thresholds.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>UV-vis extinction spectroscopy</title><p id="Par7">We observe and detect by UV-vis extinction spectroscopy a change of the colloids light extinction properties with increasing number of PLFL passages or specific energy dose, which indicates morphology transitions of the CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> educt during PLFL (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

The occurrence of such thermal effects during PLFL depends on the relation of the relaxation time of the electron-phonon coupling of the irradiated material to the laser pulse length. A pulse length longer than the relaxation time enables a transfer of by electrons absorbed laser light energy to the lattice atoms. The relaxation time of CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> or that of comparable Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is unknown, but Chen <italic>et al</italic>. observed lattice heating of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanocrystals irradiated by 60 fs pulses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Conclusively, an occurrence of thermal material transition effects is likely at our applied laser pulse length of 10 ps for CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanocrystals. As we illustrate in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, there is no significant change in the elemental composition during PLFL. Co, Fe and O are homogenously distributed in the different particle size fractions. However, we find single particles with diameters bigger than 10 nm – approximately each twentieth – that show a much stronger signal for Co in relation to Fe than expected for CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. One of those particles, with a diameter of around 50 nm, is shown in the top mid of Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>. This single particle has an atomic ratio of Co and Fe of nearly 1:1 instead of 1:2 as assumed for CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. This significant deviation of this byproduct particle refers to a possible thermal decomposition of CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> during PLFL that needs to go along with a change in particles lattice structure and a release of Fe species to the liquid. A comparison of the lattice structures of representative educt and product (after tenth passage) particles of around 50 nm in diameter is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The mainly single-crystalline lattice structure of educt particles (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a,b</xref>), clearly identifiable as CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, converts into a multi-crystalline one (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c,d</xref>), whose single domains could not be further investigated by fast Fourier transformation due to lattice disorder and overlay. Thus, it remains unclear from HR-TEM combined with EDX analysis which and to what extent Co-rich phases form during PLFL. Furthermore, a Fe-rich phase should also appear conclusively beside a Co-rich one. We proceed further analytics: X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as well as Mössbauer spectroscopy, to identify Co- and Fe-rich phases in the products after different numbers of PLFL passages.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Crystal lattice investigation of single particles of chosen CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> samples.

Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows the background corrected and normalized powder diffractograms, which clearly demonstrate two emerging phases beside CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>: CoO significantly present directly after the first passage on the one side and a layered double hydroxide (LDH) after 50<sup>th</sup> passage on the other. The relative amount of LDH in this sample is 18.6 vol.-%. This observation confirms the theory of the formation of Co-rich particles by a thermal decomposition, during which iron species are released to the aqueous phase and organize to LDH during further laser processing. Hunter <italic>et al</italic>. also observed a formation of LDH during PLAL of Fe and Ni foils immersed in alkaline metal salt solutions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. (The LDH formation is further described in the supplementary information). The amount by volume of CoO relative to CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> increases logarithmically with passage numbers and reaches saturation in 0.61 after tenth the passage (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). This lattice transformation correlates well with the change in UV-vis extinction properties of the colloid and at least partly with the ratio of the ultra-small particle fraction, which is the dominant fraction by surface after the tenth passage of PLFL (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). If we assume this fraction to form through a thermal decomposition process, the lattice transformation should also be caused by this decomposition with a high probability. To further investigate this effect, we applied the PLFL at same conditions for ten passages to a CoO submicron powder, and it fully transformed to Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref>). The spinel seems to be the preferred crystalline phase under the experimental conditions. This possibly explains why there is not a full transformation of CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> to CoO, but not why CoO forms at all. Conclusively, the formation of CoO depends on the presence of Fe<sup>3+</sup> and absence of Co<sup>3+</sup> in CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.

Spin canting angles on A- and B-sites increased strongly to 26(1) ° and 43(1) °, prohibiting a precise determination of the relative spectral areas and, therefore, of the inversion parameter. The strong increase in spin canting is indicative of a higher surface contribution, corresponding to a smaller average particle diameter, as supported by HR-TEM images (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). Alternatively, distinct spin canting can also be caused by a high degree of magnetic disorder, originating from structural defects induced by the laser treatment, or a combination of both effects. At room temperature, the spectral area of the superparamagnetic doublet is strongly increased to 27.1(4) % relative to 7.7(2) % in the product after first passage. This increase in superparamagnetic fraction is in agreement with the appearance of ultra-small particles visible in the HR-TEM analysis of the products after first and tenth passage of PLFL (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>).

However, the correlation is different from that of the crystalline CoO formation, since the formation is already saturated at the tenth passage. This is not the case for the electrochemical properties. When we plot the overpotential and charge transfer resistance versus the volume amount of crystalline CoO (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>), a linear dependency can be found until an amount of 0.6 is reached for the first time for the product after the tenth passage of PLFL. For the products after the 25<sup>th</sup> and 50<sup>th</sup> passage, we observe a clear gap in the graphs. Conclusively, the CoO formation obviously affects the electrochemical properties, but there is also another contribution. By plotting the electrochemical properties versus the surface-weighted relative amount of ultra-small particles (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>), an exponential decaying trend can be observed here without a clear deviation of values of the products after the 25<sup>th</sup> and 50<sup>th</sup> passage. But the relative amount of the ultra-small particle fraction is also not saturating after the tenth passage of PLFL (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d</xref>). A contribution to the activity increase of all products can be expected for the ultra-small particles. Additionally, a strong and trending increase in the BET surface is not observed, as we discuss more in detail in the supplementary information. Thus, we expect the overall improvement of the catalyst’s electrochemical properties during PLFL to mainly originate from structural disorder within the particles in form of crystal separation (up to the product after the tenth passage), multi-crystallinity and amorphousness. In addition, a further contribution on the improvement of the electrochemical properties of the products after the 25<sup>th</sup> and 50<sup>th</sup> passage is obvious. Since laser-generated LDH is already known for a good OER performance in the alkaline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> and noticeably present in those samples, we assume it to be the additional origin of activity.

Drastic changes in the morphology, chemical composition and crystallinity take place during PLFL. We find ultra-small, amorphous particles and multi-crystalline spheres of diameters up to 200 nm as main products, as well as sheet-like structures as byproducts of PLFL. Whereas, the chemical composition of bigger spheres is occasionally shifted to a surplus of Co, we identify the sheet structures as Fe-based LDH. We further expect the composition of ultra-small, amorphous particles to be comparable to CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> since superparamagnetism is strongly enhanced after tenth passage of PLFL. Our results indicate that thermal mechanisms, induced by laser light absorption of particulate matter, lead to particle decomposition and melting as well as fusion of agglomerated particles. As observed in the HR-TEM micrographs and shown by Mössbauer spectroscopy as well as the electrochemical investigation, structural disorder builds up during PLFL and improves the charge transport kinetics of the PLFL products compared to the CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoscale educt. Whereas, the light extinction properties and the chemical decomposition of the PLFL products reach saturation after the tenth passage, the electrochemical catalytic activity for OER is increasing until the 50<sup>th</sup> passage, as well as morphology transformations due to particle fusion.

Hence, the role of the CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-CoO-coexistence and the superparamagnetic particle fraction in the catalytic activity needs to be further clarified. A separation of both species, via centrifugation for instance, is not accessible due to magnetic polarization effects. Thus, we need to clearly address the synthesis of the single species within the PLFL process. As our model suggests, this should be achievable by a more homogeneous distribution of energy density within the liquid jet, which probably enables a control of the occurring thermal mechanisms by the applied laser power. Furthermore, we need to reduce the number of laser pulses irradiating a defined volume fraction of the colloid in one passage to one to avoid multiple transition processes during one PLFL passage.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Pulsed laser fragmentation in liquid (PLFL)</title><p id="Par25">PLFL was performed with a pulsed Nd:YAG laser (Atlantic, Ekspla, Vilnius, Litauen) with a pulse duration of 10 ps and, operated in the second harmonic, a wavelength of 532 nm with a measured power of 7.2 W. The applied repetition rate was 100 kHz, resulting in a pulse energy of 72 µJ. The setup consisted of the described picosecond laser, a cylindrical lens, a passage reactor (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>), a beaker and a power meter. The raw laser beam of 2 mm in diameter was focused at its vertical axis to a diameter of 44 µm, calculated by Supplementary Equ. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S5</xref>, by the cylindrical lens. An average fluence of 104 mJ cm<sup>−2</sup> is reached. From a capillarity with a measured diameter of 1.3 mm at the bottom of the passage reactor a CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> powder (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, USA), dispersed in water, flew centred through the focus position of the laser beam. The irradiated colloid (0.05 wt.-% of CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> in H<sub>2</sub>O) was collected in a beaker and afterwards refilled into the reactor. This procedure is called a passage and is repeated for 50 times maximum in our experiments. Power loss measurements were performed by utilization of a thermopile sensor (PowerMax PM30, Coherent, Santa Clara, USA).</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>General sample preparation for analytics</title><p id="Par26">For all analytical measurements described here, when not mentioned in a different way, the colloid was dried after PLFL in a crystallization tray at 70 °C for 12 h in air. For the separation of non-particle species from some products after the tenth passage of PLFL, a Optima MAX-XP (Beckman Coulter, Brea, USA) ultracentrifuge was used.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>UV-vis extinction spectroscopy</title><p id="Par27">Extinction spectroscopy was applied before drying the colloids to powders. Colloid samples (700 µL) were filled into a quartz glass micro cuvette with 10 mm beam way. All extinction spectra were recorded at an extinction calibrated Evolution 201 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) spectrometer in the range of 190 to 1,100 nm.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis</title><p id="Par28">PXRD patterns were obtained using a D8 ADVANCE (Bruker, Billerica, USA) powder diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ: 1.5418 Å, 40 kV and 40 mA) using a silicon single crystal as sample holder to minimize scattering. For better homogenization, the dried powder samples were re-dispersed in ethanol on the silicon surface and then investigated in the range from 10° to 90° 2 θ with a step size of 0.01° 2 θ with a counting time of 0.6 s. Rietveld refinement was performed with the program package TOPAS 5.0 (Bruker) to determine the lattice parameters. The background was modelled using Chebyshev polynomials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM)</title><p id="Par29">HR-TEM was performed at a JEM-2200FS (JEOL, Akishima, Japan), as well as the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Preparation of TEM grids was done by ten times diluting the colloid with water and directly dropping it on a carbon-coated copper grid and in some cases on a holey carbon grid because of the low contrast between Fe, Co and Cu.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Mössbauer spectroscopy</title><p id="Par30">Mössbauer spectra were recorded in transmission geometry using a constant acceleration Mössbauer driving unit with a <sup>57</sup>Co source embedded in a Rh matrix. The spectrometer was calibrated with a α-Fe foil reference sample at room temperature. Low temperature and in-field spectra were measured in a liquid helium bath cryostat with a superconducting magnet in split-coil geometry, providing magnetic fields of up to 5 T along the γ-ray propagation direction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)</title><p id="Par31">XPS measurements were performed at a VersaProbe II (Ulvac-Phi, Chanhassen, USA). Droplets of the different powder samples, redispersed in water, were put on cleaned copper foil. Both Al Kα and Mg Kα light was used to investigate the powder samples. No qualitative difference in the Co and Fe spectra were found for the two wavelengths.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Electrochemical analysis</title><p id="Par32">All electrochemical measurements were performed in a conventional three-electrode cell using an Autolab potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT12, Eco Chemie, Utrecht, The Netherlands) coupled to a rotating disk electrode rotator (Metrohm, Herisau, Switzerland). Disc shaped glassy carbon of 0.126 cm<sup>2</sup> geometric area, modified with the catalysts was used as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl/3 M KCl as the reference electrode and a Pt mesh as the counter electrode. The measured potentials were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale using the following equation <italic>E(RHE)</italic> = <italic>E(Ag/AgCl)</italic> + 0.210 V + 0.059 x pH V. The pH value was determined (using a pH meter) and was 14 for 1 M KOH. Prior to the experiments, the glassy carbon electrode was polished with a polishing cloth using different alumina pastes (3.0–0.05 μm) to obtain a mirror-like surface, followed by ultrasonic cleaning in water. For electrochemical measurements, the catalyst ink was prepared by dispersing the catalyst suspension (5.0 mg mL<sup>−1</sup>) in an ethanol-water mixture (1:1) and ultrasonicated for 30 min. The catalyst ink (5.0 μL) was drop coated onto the polished glassy carbon electrode and dried in air at room temperature. Before performing the OER measurements, modified electrodes were subjected to continuous potential cycling in the potential window of 0.1 V to 1.1 V vs. RHE until reproducible voltammograms were obtained. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was then recorded in the frequency range from 50 kHz to 1 Hz at the corresponding open circuit potential of the electrode, using an AC perturbation of 10 mV. The resistance of the solution was determined from the resulting Nyquist plot and the later used for ohmic drop correction according to the relation, <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> = <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> – i <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>, where <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> is the corrected potential and <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> is the applied potential. All reported current densities were calculated using the geometric surface area of the electrode.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Data Availability</title><p id="Par33">All data generated and analyzed, except some PXRD data used for phase assignment (see below), during this study are included in this published article and its Supplementary Information file at least graphically in diagrams.
