To evaluate the influence of different environmental stimuli, like humidity or solar radiation, on the long-term actuation behavior and mechanical robustness of these materials, it is necessary to precisely characterize the magnitude and range of stimuli that trigger reactions and the resulting kinetics of a material, respectively, with suitable testing equipment and techniques. The overall aim is to correlate actuation potential and mechanical properties with process- or application-oriented parameters in terms of demand-oriented stimuli-responsive element production. In this study, the impact of solar radiation as environmental trigger on the cellulose-based humidity-sensing material Cottonid, which is a promising candidate for adaptive and autonomously moving elements, was investigated. For simulating solar radiation in the lab, specimens were exposed to short-wavelength blue light as well as a standardized artificial solar irradiation (CIE Solar ID65) in long-term aging experiments. Photodegradation behavior was analyzed by Fourier-transform infrared as well as electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements to assess changes in Cottonid’s chemical composition. Subsequently, changes in micromechanical properties on the respective specimens’ surface were investigated with roughness measurements and ultra-micro-hardness tests to characterize variations in stiffness distribution in comparison to the initial condition. Also, thermal effects during long-term aging were considered and contrasted to pure radiative effects. In addition, to investigate the influence of process-related parameters on Cottonid’s humidity-driven deformation behavior, actuation tests were performed in an alternating climate chamber using a customized specimen holder, instrumented with digital image correlation (DIC). DIC was used for precise actuation strain measurements to comparatively evaluate different influences on the material’s sorption behavior. The infrared absorbance spectra of different aging states of irradiated Cottonid indicate oxidative stress on the surface compared to unaged samples. These findings differ under pure thermal loads. EPR spectra could corroborate these findings as radicals were detected, which were attributed to oxidation processes. Instrumented actuation experiments revealed the influence of processing-related parameters on the sorption behavior of the tested and structurally optimized Cottonid variant. Experimental data supports the definition of an optimal process window for stimuli-responsive element production. Based on these results, tailor-made functional materials shall be generated in the future where stimuli-responsiveness can be adjusted through the manufacturing process.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">WA 1672/23-1, ZO 113/22-1</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Technische Universität Dortmund (1006)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>9</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>11</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-collection-editor</meta-name><meta-value>Christophe Binetruy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/42252_2021_Article_22.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Materials Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Materials Science, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Chemistry and Materials Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction and state of the art</title><p id="Par2">Stimuli-responsive materials inspired by the natural behavior of biological structures, like plants, are adaptive elements in various applications, viz. in biomedicine for drug delivery, in microfluidics and robotics as well as in bioarchitecture for development of e.g. climate-adaptive shading systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. With regard to each application, different stimuli are relevant and, range e.g. from temperature and relative humidity to light and radiation. In bioarchitecture, the passive humidity-driven shape change of cellulose-based materials, like plants and wood, in reaction to changing environmental, i.e. weathering, conditions is used for an energy-efficient conversion of primary energy into a kinetic one. Consequently, it is in the nature of things, that these adaptive construction materials are additionally exposed to elevated temperatures and ultraviolet (UV) light during service, and it is of high relevance to characterize their thermal and radiation induced degradation behavior and its effect on their long-term material properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Since adaptivity to external stimuli, like temperature or relative humidity, is the condition for an efficient technical usage of weathering conditions within bioarchitecture, mostly polymer-based material systems, especially wood, are used for the development of so-called smart building skins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">In this context, Cottonid is a cellulose-based humidity-sensing material manufactured by the parchmentizing process, which exhibits great potential for the production of climate-adaptive elements with tailor-made material properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This study focusses the impact of solar radiation on chemical structure and micromechanical properties of Cottonid. It is an extract of a comprehensive experimental study on the influence of individual manufacturing parameters on the functional and mechanical properties of the biopolymeric material by means of instrumented actuation and fatigue assessments. The results are used for application-oriented structural optimization of Cottonid for applications for adaptive construction materials by adjustment of the manufacturing process.</p><p id="Par4">The results presented were obtained by a combination of non-destructive analytical and micromechanical investigations to build up a more profound knowledge about Cottonid’s interaction with its environment and the effect of long-term exposure to weathering conditions on its structure-property-relationships on the exposed surface. In the next step, the effect on the macromechanical properties will be investigated by the help of instrumented quasi-static and fatigue experiments.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Bioinspired, stimuli-responsive materials for construction-related applications</title><p id="Par5">In response to external stimuli, like temperature, relative humidity or light etc., stimuli-responsive polymer-based material systems are able of autonomous reactions, e.g. adaptive shape changing, which is an energy-efficient way of producing kinetic energy or a mechanical force due to volume expansion. Therefore, nowadays in terms of energy-efficiency and eco-friendliness this bio-inspired mechanism is very interesting for implementation in technical and engineering issues. Applications fields are various and range from microfluidics over soft robotics to so-called bioarchitectural topics, where smart building skins respond to changing weathering conditions with adaptive reactions. E.g., with increasing temperature, single façade elements expand to provide shading and shrink, when temperatures are decreasing again, so that they are not permanently blocking the sight out of the building. In case of cellulose-based materials, like wood, the decisive stimulus, which activates the adaptive reactions, is humidity. Due to hygroscopic water uptake from the surrounding environment, cellulose micro fibrils swell perpendicular to their orientation within the material and cause a passive shape change, whose magnitude and direction is programmed in the microstructure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This behavior can be observed for various plant systems, where the microstructure of the cell walls is used for directed swelling and shrinking processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These biological moving concepts have been an inspiration for the development of a variety of bio-inspired actuators for different applications in recent years to introduce the efficient relationship between structure and function by development of new functional materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The available actuation concepts, like one-dimensional bending, which is realized over bilayered systems, with one active and one passive layer with regard to the present stimulus, two-dimensional stretching, buckling or three-dimensional volume expansion, can be adjusted by the microstructure of the polymer-based material systems and have their specific advantages and disadvantages with respect to the intended application. Also, a combination of these deformation modes in one actuator system is conceivable by microstructural tuning. Furthermore, the development of systems that respond to multiple external stimuli in a smart and foreseeable way is in the focus of current research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Additionally, experiments with chemical degradation of matrix polymers to retain just the more porous cellulose scaffold for functionalization have been conducted. Besides usage of the dimensional instability when in contact with humidity in climate-adaptive building shells, the material behavior can also be used for production of curved timber elements by specific upstream humidity treatment and intelligent combination of layers with different micro fibril angles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Therefore, smart building skins play an important role in the required global reduction of energy consumption, since autonomous, humidity-driven wood bilayers can serve as an energy-efficient alternative to motor-driven façade shading elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. To assess the performance of the systems, especially the long-term stability as well as the repeatability of the humidity-driven movements, instrumented test setups, which simulate outdoor weathering conditions have been developed using environmental chambers and materials’ reactions have been characterized, e.g. by optical monitoring of the swelling and shrinkage strains, measurements of changes in temperature, moisture content or other material specific parameters. Furthermore, the effect of different humidity cycles, slow and fast cycles in high and low humidity ranges, where investigated. During these experiments, a hysteresis was observed, when strains are plotted as function of relative humidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Thermal and light-induced degradation mechanisms in cellulose-based materials</title><p id="Par7">As stated above, the properties of cellulose-based material systems are affected by environmental effects, like elevated temperatures, changing degrees of relative humidity as well as influence of oxygen and solar radiation, manifesting in e.g. discoloration, pronounced decrease of mechanical properties and embrittlement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For cellulose, which is the most abundant biopolymer on earth and therefore intensively used as raw material for various stimuli-responsive material systems, the mechanism of photodegradation is induced by a superimposition of several radical reactions. An initial reaction is a decrease in degree of polymerization (DP) caused by scission of cellulose chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Yatagai and Zeronian investigated degradation mechanisms caused by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, heat exposure and by a combination of both treatments. They revealed changes in color as well as formation of carbonyl, carboxyl and hydroperoxide groups, resulting in an additional decrease in α-cellulose content. It was stated, that heat exposure alone caused reactions comparable to UV exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Hon further observed a reaction of cellulosic carbon-centred radicals with oxygen molecules in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies, identifying oxygen as decisive reagent in photooxidative degradation of cellulose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">In case of cellulose-based material systems, wood is one of the most important engineering and structural materials. Infrared spectroscopy studies on wood exposed to UV irradiation observed an increased amount of carboxylic and carbonyl chromophoric functional groups and a decreased amount in aromatic functional groups, respectively. In these studies, mainly lignin-derived degraded products could be observed limited to the specimens’ surfaces. Nevertheless, as stated above, degradation by sunlight or UV radiation, resulting in pronounced structural modifications, is also expected for the other chemical components (cellulose, hemicelluloses) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Efficient methods for characterizing these changes in chemical structure are Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. EPR gives information about evolution of radicals related to radiation-induced degradation mechanisms and can be used to verify oxidation reactions that cause deviations from the initial IR spectra [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">To characterize the impact of degradation mechanisms on the long-term behavior of cellulose-based material systems in architectural applications, a precise simulation of outdoor weathering conditions has to be performed in the lab. Solar radiation envelopes a range from 200 to 2500 nm, where highest irradiance levels are present in the visible part. For polymers, the UV part of the spectrum, which reaches the earth’s surface, is the most critical one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Therefore, the influence of short-wavelength visible radiation as well as thermal loads on the long-term material properties in the already described application field is of high importance. Further, it is an advantage for research, if aging experiments could be accelerated while simultaneously not changing the temperature due to radiative energy input and hence keeping the causes for degradation viz. temperature and radiation separated. On this topic, Baltscheit et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and Hemmerich et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] report on the simulation of the aging behavior of transparent bioplastics, like polyactide, under accelerated artificial conditions with prioritizing effects under blue light radiation with short-wavelength and high energy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Cottonid material system</title><p id="Par10">Cellulose as most abundant biopolymer on earth and therefore a very sustainable resource is an attractive material candidate for substitution of fossil products in specific, i.e. mostly functional, applications as stated above. Besides native cellulose, cellulose derivates, like e.g. regenerated or oxidized cellulose containing cellulose II crystals, are favored because of their simple and reproducible way of manufacturing. For this material class, the amount of inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds is very important for the physical properties of cellulosic commercial products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. For the above rendered adaptive applications, pure cellulosic materials often show a more pronounced swelling and shrinking behavior in comparison to composite materials like wood. In this case, Cottonid is a modified natural material fully based on partly modified cellulose and appears to be a mix of cellulose I and II. Based on unsized raw paper, chemical modification is achieved by a treatment with a warm zinc dichloride (ZnCl<sub>2</sub>) or sulphuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) solution, called parchmentizing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The temperature of the catalyst bath T<sub>cat</sub> and the reaction time t<sub>react</sub> in it define the amount of inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds that are newly formed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. These are, as stated above, important for the final mechanical and physical properties. Since nowadays this well known material gains new relevance in technical and especially climate-adaptive applications, Scholz et al. performed an experimental assessment to qualify Cottonid in general for technical applications compared to established materials, like synthetic plastics and wood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], as well as to assess the influence of individual manufacturing parameters on the amount of hydrogen bonds present and therefore on the functional and mechanical properties of Cottonid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Furthermore, the impact of outdoor weathering conditions on the long-term actuation and fatigue behavior is characterized. The aim is to structurally optimize Cottonid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] through adjustment of the manufacturing process for the production of Cottonid elements with tailor-made properties for either adaptive or constructive applications.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Sample preparation</title><p id="Par11">For aging experiments, specimens were cut out of a plate of industrial Cottonid material (Ernst Krueger, Geldern, Germany) with a thickness of t<sub>mat</sub> = 2.0 mm.</p><p id="Par12">For actuation experiments, specimens were cut out of plates of the structurally optimized Cottonid variant M60Z50 with material thicknesses of t<sub>mat,thin</sub> = 0.4 mm and t<sub>mat,thick</sub> = 4.0 mm.

For chemical treatment, a 70 wt-% zinc dichloride (ZnCl<sub>2</sub>) solution, subsequently marked as “Z”, is used as catalyst. The sample name of the resulting Cottonid variants is a combination of the chosen manufacturing parameters (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The samples are then smoothed and dried in a calender (Sumet, Denklingen, Germany) under pressure and temperature. In order to prevent a dimensional change of the material due to water absorption from the environment, the samples are stored under weight in a dry atmosphere until further analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].

The height and area of the peak provides information about inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds present in the material.

The close-ups of the interesting regions make the changes more visible. The increase of peaks in the range of 1750 and 1740 cm<sup>− 1</sup> results from the formation of carbonyl and carboxyl groups due to reactions with the surrounding oxygen. These reactions imply the splitting of cellulose chains on the surface and a decrease of degree of polymerization (DP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Therefore, the peak at 2900 cm<sup>− 1</sup> simultaneously decreases because of these oxidative reactions, indicating a degradation of C – H combinations.

It could be shown, that the impact of thermal loads in combination with solar radiation leads to chemical modifications of the cellulose on the surface of the aged Cottonid specimens. Infrared spectra revealed changes in adsorption at 2900 cm<sup>− 1</sup>, i.e. the spectral region of C - H stretching vibrations, and between 1800 and 1700 cm<sup>− 1</sup>, i.e. the spectral region of C = O stretching vibrations, and therefore indicate oxidative stress on the surface of the aged specimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These findings are underlined with results of EPR spectroscopy, which indicate the presence of oxidation-related radicals. The oxidative stress obviously provokes a decreased surface roughness leading to embrittlement, which could be verified by increased Martens hardness HM and indentation modulus E<sub>it</sub> assessed by ultra-micro-hardness tests. Therefore, a change in micromechanical surface properties of the aged Cottonid specimens due to chemical modifications induced by a combination of thermal loads and solar irradiation could be observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Experiments with pure thermal loads induced comparable degradation effects to combined loads, whereas aging with a standardized artificial solar irradiation caused a more distinct material reaction compared to aging with short-wavelength blue light radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. These more or less material-specific reactions onto the induced loads could origin from the chemical modification of cellulose I in a not yet defined mix of cellulose I and II during the manufacturing process of Cottonid and have to be thoroughly investigated in further studies. Since for manufacturing of Cottonid the cellulose contained in the raw paper layers gets partly hydrolyzed by the help of a chemical catalyst, which was observed to be a stabilizing process in terms of light-induced radical reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], these investigations will be of high interest to qualify Cottonid for outdoor applications. Further, since the presented results were obtained on industrial manufactured Cottonid material, which has a unique red color, it is essential to investigate and comparatively evaluate photodegradation mechanisms on colorless, i.e. white, Cottonid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">Actuation tests on the structurally optimized Cottonid variant M60Z50 revealed an influence of the material thickness t<sub>mat</sub> as well as of the predefined orientation of the cellulose micro fibrils. It can be stated, that Cottonid’s actuation behavior is a function of its material thickness, i.e. a ten times thinner specimen achieves a ten times increased humidity-driven expansion. Furthermore, humidity-driven actuation is more pronounced perpendicular to micro fibril orientation, which is already described in various studies concerning cellulose-based materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. These findings can be used for the development of climate-adaptive Cottonid elements capable of complex passive shape changes due to efficient and smart combination of microstructure and material thickness. Since Cottonid is manufactured by chemical modification of single paper layers, which are stacked to get thicker material, the adjustment and smart usage of these manufacturing parameters for tailor-made climate-adaptive element production can be easily implemented.</p><p id="Par35">In summary, the conditions of the manufacturing process of Cottonid and its hygroscopic material behavior make the material ideal for the development of application-oriented adaptive elements capable of complex passive, humidity-driven shape changes with adjustable magnitude e.g. for construction-related applications. The aging experiments revealed an interaction of Cottonid with thermal and light-induced loads, which are expected in natural weathering conditions, i.e. environmental triggers, in this application field. The change in micromechanical properties and degradation processes, respectively, on the surface have to be considered for the prediction of the long-term behavior of climate-adaptive Cottonid elements. Up to now the results show, that degradation takes place and that the modifications of the chemical structure also affect the micromechanical properties.</p><p id="Par36">In further studies, it will be investigated how these mechanisms affect the macroscopic deformation behavior of Cottonid and its specific mechanical values, like Young’s modulus and ultimate tensile strength, as well as the actuation behavior. For this, in a first step aging experiments will be conducted at different temperatures and relative humidity levels to assess the influence of weathering conditions on the degradation behavior. Furthermore, the customized specimen holder for actuation experiments can be equipped with LEDs, so that in the near future swelling and shrinking behavior can be characterized with superimposed thermal and light-induced loading.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the Hahnmuehle FineArt GmbH (Dassel, Germany) and the Ernst Krueger GmbH &amp; Co.
