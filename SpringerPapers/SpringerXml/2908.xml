This article explores the materials needed for water splitting electrolysis, electrochemical abstraction of hydrogen from light alkanes, and looping thermal-chemical reaction processes that typically form and then dissociate an acid compound in a two- or three-step process. The focus is on the R&amp;D needs of materials that are used for high-temperature electrochemistry, focusing on solid-oxide, ion-conducting cell materials sets (SOECs). To exploit the availability of low-cost electricity, these materials must stand up to cyclic operations. They also must be durable for years of service to reduce operating and maintenance costs, and they must achieve high conversion efficiencies to avoid large, energy-intensive recycle

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par6">Hydrogen has been proposed as a game changing, low-emissions energy currency that can provide energy storage or be used immediately in all of the major energy sectors. The classical process of steam reforming for hydrogen production is a steady-state process involving large radiant hot boxes that cannot be readily adapted to variable renewable energy sources. The hypothesis of this article is that electrochemical processes can competitively produce clean (zero-emissions) hydrogen. Two processes will be explored: (1) water-splitting electrolysis and (2) deprotonation of alkane hydrocarbons. Some unit operations of thermochemical water-splitting processes can be operated variably, but in whole, they are large and need to be run at steady state. The emphasis is on electrolysis using high-temperature solid-oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) that take advantage of both thermal and electrical power to achieve high thermodynamic efficiencies. The subject of low-temperature alkaline electrolysis (AE) and proton-exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis has been widely covered elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> A variety of thermochemical cycles continue to be developed; however, these processes must surmount several challenges, which include the development of materials that can withstand high-temperature acidic environments, large capital costs associated with multiple process steps and large recycle streams, and an inability to respond to process dynamics on the time scales associated with emerging demand response needs of the electricity grid.</p><p id="Par7">To produce affordable clean hydrogen for all its anticipated purposes as a new energy currency, it is essential that low-cost electricity be exploited. The variable nature of wind and solar energy requires that other generation sources respond to load demand capacity in a dynamic manner. Nuclear energy has been proven to be a safe, reliable, and concentrated source of clean energy that can be used to produce electricity and hydrogen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> Traditional nuclear plants are large and operate at steady state with on-line reliability exceeding 93% of rated capacity annually.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> However, these plants are increasingly required to operate flexibly as wind and solar power generation continue to expand. This is illustrated in <bold>Figure </bold><xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>1</bold></xref> for a region such as the southwestern United States, which has significant solar generation. In this example, excess power generation is experienced as solar energy generation climbs during the day. This excess power can be diverted for hydrogen production. Wind energy can have a similar, though less predictable, impact on the power generation assets. In both cases, large thermal baseload plants need to be flexible in matching load demand as renewable sources are built out. Instead of ramping up and down, these plants produce hydrogen during periods of low demand or high renewable power generation.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Illustrative consequences of excess solar energy power generation.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/43577_2022_278_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par8">The hydrogen produced with clean energy sources can be stored and used to regenerate electrical power or it can be injected into the natural gas pipeline as a clean energy substitute. Alternatively, the hydrogen can be used for chemicals, fuels, and steel production as illustrated in <bold>Figure </bold><xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>2</bold></xref>. Recent studies estimate the market potential for clean hydrogen can easily increase by a factor of 3–5 by 2050.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> This provides incentive for developing advanced electrochemical processes that can be ramped up and down to use the excess capacity of nuclear and renewable energy when it is available.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Clean hydrogen production and transfer to the manufacturing and transportation sectors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup></p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/43577_2022_278_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p id="Par9">Four factors are critical to producing hydrogen using the electrochemical process that exploits excess power capacity. First, it is imperative that these processes are responsive to periods when energy is available at a low cost. Second, the cost of the electrolysis materials and unit operations must be minimized. This can be accomplished by avoiding expensive catalysts and exotic alloys, reducing the number of unit operations, and limiting the mass of recycle streams. Third, the materials must be durable and withstand cyclic and potentially harsh conditions, including high temperatures and pressure, high concentrations of hydrogen, oxygen, and water vapor, and impurities that are introduced by the materials themselves. Fourth, relatively high conversion rates and steam utilization efficiency are required to reduce the size of the balance of plant and the energy used for product purification and recycle streams.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Electrochemical hydrogen production processes</title><p id="Par10">In its most simple form, electrolysis can be carried out by splitting water or steam as shown in <bold>Figure </bold><xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>3</bold></xref>. Steam electrolysis takes advantage of clean process heat provided by nuclear reactors or by concentrating solar systems to boil water and to superheat the steam. When thermal energy is available, high-temperature electrolysis (HTE) can be more efficient than low-temperature electrolysis (LTE) because it requires less electricity.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Routes for splitting water by LTE and HTE.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/43577_2022_278_Fig3_HTML.png" id="MO4"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Solid-oxide cell water-splitting formats</title><p id="Par11">Solid-oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) split water within a catalyst-bearing electrode that is connected to an ion-conducting electrolyte. The ion-conduction electrolyte can selectively transport either the oxygen ions (O<sup>=</sup>) or hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>, also known as a proton) to an adjacent electrode where the ions recombine to form hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), as shown in <bold>Figure </bold><xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>4</bold></xref>. Herein, an oxygen-conducting SOEC will be designated as O-SOEC. Proton-conducting cells will be designated P-SOEC. Although similar in principle, the unit cell materials and operating temperature are very different. O-SOEC is relatively mature; hence, it is close to commercial application.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> P-SOEC, on the other hand, is less mature and requires materials development and cell testing starting with button cells and small stack formats, according to a recent review.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup><fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>SOEC water-splitting cells.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/43577_2022_278_Fig4_HTML.png" id="MO5"/></fig></p><p id="Par12">Because water splitting is strongly endothermic, SOEC requires a heating source to maintain the cell temperature above 750°C for O-SOEC and 600°C for effective P-SOEC functionality, respectively. This is achieved by electrical-resistive heating within the SOEC electrode and electrolyte. Therefore, one of the materials design requirements is achieving a composite cell with a specific resistance that remains approximately constant over the operating life of the cell. This parameter is widely referred to as the area specific resistance (or ASR).</p><p id="Par13">Additionally, SOEC stacks are comprised of repeating cells, separated by gaseous flow channels that feed steam to the cathode and collect the gases that evolve from both the cathode and electrode. Both metallic and ceramic plates have been tested for this purpose. Metal plates or interconnections provide better support and can also function as a charge distributor and collector.</p><p id="Par14">The design of a SOEC requires several materials design considerations that are typical of electrochemical systems:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par15">The materials must conduct electrons and disperse the charge uniformly across the cell (which may be planar or cylindrical).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par16">The electrodes require catalytic functionality to effectively dissociate molecules into ion pairs. Typically, this is performed with nickel dispersed in the cathode. A relatively high conversion efficiency (referred to as steam utilization) is preferred to reduce hydrogen purification costs. Operating conditions need to protect the catalyst from oxidation on one hand, and hydride formation on the other.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par17">The electrolyte material must selectively conduct one of the ion pairs; typically, this requires high-temperature operation for ion trans-locomotion.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par18">The materials must be mechanically strong and have a similar coefficient of expansion; this requires a robust support that can be provided by one of the principal electrodes, electrolyte, or metal interconnect or support.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par19">Electrical charge connections must provide uniform electron dispersion across all sections of every cell in a stack.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par20">Electrical resistance heating is typically required to achieve a thermal-neutral state.

Instead of relying on resistive heating, heat may also be directly added to the cell using microflow channels or by superheating the sweep gas to the anode.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par21">Metal supports and charge collectors need to be protected to avoid introduction of fugitive elements, such as chromium, that can deactivate the catalyst.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Co-electrolysis of steam and carbon dioxide</title><p id="Par22">The same O-SOEC cell format for steam electrolysis can functionally disassociate CO<sub>2</sub>. This has the advantage of producing a mixture of H<sub>2</sub> and CO, which are the building blocks for a variety of chemicals and fuels. Simultaneous electrolysis of steam and CO<sub>2</sub> is referred to as co-electrolysis (<bold>Figure </bold><xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>5</bold></xref>). It is viewed as a convenient method of utilizing CO<sub>2</sub> to avoid sequestration in a geological repository. Several synergies between electrolysis and fossil fuel conversion have sprung from this concept. For example, suppose a stream of CO<sub>2</sub> is available from an exogenous source. This could be an ethanol plant or a fossil-fired combustor. The CO<sub>2</sub> can be co-electrolyzed to form syngas. It can also be used as a sweep gas to harvest oxygen. The mixture of CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> can then be used as a replacement for air to fire a fossil fuel combustor. This is referred to as oxy-firing and has been proposed as a solution to reduce the costs of carbon capture and sequestration.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Co-electrolysis of H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub> with O-SOEC.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/43577_2022_278_Fig5_HTML.png" id="MO6"/></fig></p><p id="Par23">From a materials perspective, the key challenges include avoiding coking on the cathode and achieving the desired ratio of H<sub>2</sub> and CO product. Additional research is needed to optimize the electrode materials for performance and to match the resistance with the endothermicity of the joint reactions to maintain thermal neutrality in the cell. The cell temperature and operating pressure can be optimized to promote a water–gas shift of the H<sub>2</sub> with CO<sub>2</sub> as the gas passes through the cell.</p><p id="Par24">From an application perspective, co-electrolysis provides synergy between nuclear power plants and fossil-fired power plants, as illustrated in <bold>Figure </bold><xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig"><bold>6</bold></xref>. The overall goal is to reduce the carbon emissions while taking advantage of the vast infrastructure and natural resources that are available and produced today. When the synthesis gas is converted to durable products, part of the carbon in fossil fuels is permanently incorporated in a usable commodity or product. Synergy between these combined processes also includes the oxygen that is transported to the coal-fired plant using the CO<sub>2</sub> that is recycled. The CO<sub>2</sub> recycle is first partitioned to both the anode and the cathode of the electrolysis cells. Co-electrolysis occurs on the cathode, while diluent CO<sub>2</sub> is simply used to sweep O<sub>2</sub> from the anode. The CO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> mixture replaces the air normally used for coal combustion, thus producing a concentrated exhaust of CO<sub>2</sub>.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Fossil fuel combustion enhancement with nuclear energy using O-SOEC for carbon management.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/43577_2022_278_Fig6_HTML.png" id="MO7"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Solid-oxide alkane deprotonation cell format</title><p id="Par25">With the advent of a P-SOEC, it is possible to abstract hydrogen from alkanes as shown in <bold>Figure </bold><xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig"><bold>7</bold></xref>. This leads to the production of an alkene monomer that can be quickly polymerized to form a plastic material. Early research has proven P-SOEC can effectively de-protonate ethane and propane to support the production of ethylene and propylene.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> A technical and economic assessment of a fully integrated commercial process indicates this process can disrupt traditional olefin steam-cracking processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> One gap that could make an additional improvement to the overall process is to find a membrane to separate the alkene compounds from the cell effluent. This would reduce the cost of product separation that uses a more expensive cryogenic separation scheme. The hydrogen product on the other hand is pure and can be harvested without gas cleanup.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Alkane deprotonation P-SOEC for polymer production.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/43577_2022_278_Fig7_HTML.png" id="MO8"/></fig></p><p id="Par26">In the case of alkane deprotonation, the reaction is more exothermic than water splitting. This necessitates the addition of high heating to maintain the operating condition of around 500–600°C. Nuclear energy is once again a candidate for supplying zero-emissions heat and electricity to this process.

This allows PEM inverters to interface with the grid in a manner that is useful for regulating the frequency of the grid when using IEEE protocols that allow automatic communication between the grid and the inverters. While the inverter to the HTE process may be cycled in a similar manner, the cell materials, stacks, heat exchangers, and stream flows will lag in response. In general, it will be best to avoid thermal cycling. Hence, the goal at this point is to operate SOEC systems in a pattern that is supportive of solar energy daily cycles and to be capable of providing spinning reserve capacity in other markets. Spinning reserves typically require an asset to supply power to the electricity grid within 10 min and for up to one hour of operation. That asset may then be throttled as other non-spinning or regularly scheduled capacity are brought back into service.</p><p id="Par38">A SOEC hydrogen plant tied to a nuclear power station can provide spinning reserve by simply turning down the HTE plant. To reduce the impact of thermal cycling, it would be wise to maintain the electrolysis plant at some minimum production level (see <bold>Figure </bold><xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig"><bold>11</bold></xref>).

Perhaps the most significant concern is how this form of dynamics over hundreds and even thousands of cycles may result in metal fatigue and stress crack corrosion of any of the materials in the high-temperature heat delivery system and electrolysis plant. Large variations in the volumetric flow alone may result in transient heat flux and temperature variations that could fatigue weld joints, pipe turns, the SOEC stacks, and other appurtenant equipment.

In other situations, it may be profitable to produce and store hydrogen for production of electricity during periods when the sun has set or when wind power is not being generated.

Most of these reactors are designed with inherent safety features that greatly reduce, or altogether eliminate, concerns of runaway power excursions and potential radionuclide releases.

Nuclear-supported SOEC produces pure hydrogen for processes, such as ammonia production, and therefore, will be competitive once a high-volume manufacturing system is in place.
