An enhancement of vapour generation efficiency from the sunlight can improve the overall system performances. Several factors have been considered to facilitate efficient steam generation under solar irradiation without any artificial light concentration or electric power: sufficient absorption in the solar spectrum, thermal insulation from heating of bulk water and efficient escaping process of generated vapour bubbles through fluid with minimal heat losses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The antireflective and light trapping properties of metallic nanoshells or nanoparticles have been used to realize the localized resonant surface plasmon heating, resulting in high light-to-heat conversion efficiencies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Efficient resonant light absorption has been established by metallic gap resonators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, gratings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and microcavities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> with surface plasmon by designing appropriate geometries. However, the structures have inherently narrow absorption bandwidth due to the resonant characteristics of surface plasmon excitations. In addition, angle, polarization and wavelength dependence of the plasmonic structures limit the realization of omnidirectional broadband absorber. In contrast, nonresonant broadband absorption of unpolarized light has been demonstrated by touching subwavelength-sized metal cylinders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and spheres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. However, the nonresonant absorption remains less efficient at longer wavelengths than at the surface plasmon resonance wavelength.</p><p id="Par5">To attain photothermal conversion using the full solar spectrum from visible to infrared wavelength ranges, adiabatic nanofocusing of surface plasmons is recommended for highly efficient broadband light absorptions, as it excites surface plasmon modes throughout the arrays of ultrasharp metal grooves or subwavelength-sized wedges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. In general, heat generation by plasmonic nanofocusing has long been regarded only as a side effect that had to be avoided, for example, for use in plasmonic waveguide and high-resolution near-field microscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Therefore, nanofocusing structures have been optimized to minimize the dissipative loss while maintaining low surface plasmon reflection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. As the structure’s taper angle gets smaller, the plasmon reflection decreases while power dissipation loss significantly increases, consequently decreasing plasmon propagation length. Thus, to this day, many efforts have been made to find the optimal taper angle to lower the plasmon reflections and dissipation loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">In contrast to the competing relationship between plasmon reflection and dissipation loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, efficient solar steam generation simultaneously requires high surface plasmon dissipation losses for heat generation and the high light absorption in the metal structure. For this purpose, adiabatic nanofocusing of plasmons with the smallest taper angles is perfectly suited. At sufficiently small taper angles near zero, the gap surface plasmon wave vector does not change significantly on the scale of the light wavelength throughout tapered metallic grooves and tips, leading to adiabatic nanofocusing. The plasmon does not experience noticeable reflections and propagates towards the groove bottom or tips, where it asymptotically stops, eventually dissipating in the metal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">The adiabatic nanofocusing structures with small taper angles, which have high surface plasmon dissipation loss and absorption, are difficult to fabricate for large area because fabrication parameters should be controlled precisely over the whole process. We use a bottom-up self-assembly approach that combines anodization, wet etching and sputtering, which are well established for large-scale fabrication procedures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Using this technique, we propose a novel concept of self-aggregated metallic nanowire bundle array structure on the microporous substrate to produce flexible thin-film black gold membranes. Our multiscale structure has sufficiently small taper angle (∼1°), hence there is a wide range of metallic nanoscale gaps from zero to hundreds of nanometres over few microns depth as well as 3 μm funnel-shaped structures. The small taper angle and varying nanogaps between aggregated metallic nanowires are responsible for the broadband absorption in the visible to near-infrared region. The 3-μm funnel structure yields ultrabroadband absorption up to 17 μm in the mid-infrared region. Our thin-film black gold membrane absorbs the light with the measured average absorption of 91% in the wavelength range from 400 to 2,500 nm and the average reflection of 7% from 2.5 to 17 μm. Using this film, we efficiently generate solar vapour with solar thermal conversion efficiency up to 57% at an incident intensity of 20 kW m<sup>−2</sup>.</p><p id="Par8">In addition, the thin black gold membrane floats on the water surface and this minimizes the thermal energy loss through the non-vapourizing bulk water because vapour bubbles are able to escape directly from the surface. If the vapourizing hot regions are not appropriately shallow, the vapourized bubbles easily liquefy back while they travel through the water. Our nanofocusing membrane allows for heat localization within the plane of few microns thickness, as well as the continuous water provision from bulk water through micropores in the substrate. Such characteristics allow more efficient solar vapour generation even in lower solar illumination in comparison with nanoparticles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par9">Here we demonstrate flexible thin-film black gold membranes with multiscale structures of microscale funnel structures and varying metallic nanoscale gaps at the same time. The adiabatic nanofocusing generated by self-aggregated gold-coated nanowire bundles provides high absorption from ultraviolet to infrared regime. The microscale funnel structures also produce high absorption up to 17 μm. This membrane, which floats on the water surface, allows continuous water provision through micropores and heat localization within the few micrometre-thick layer by minimizing the thermal energy loss through the non-vapourizing bulk water.

By employing pore-widening processes with controlled wet etching time into AAO templates, we get self-aggregated nanowire bundles. To widen the nanoholes of porous AAO templates with initial pore size of 30 nm, we used chemical wet etching with 5 wt% phosphoric acid. The etching time and temperature dominantly determine the enlarged diameter of the porous AAO nanoholes. At a fixed temperature of 30 °C, we controlled the etching time in a range of 0–50 min. As we enlarged the diameter of nanoholes, surrounded by thin alumina nanowalls, the neighbouring pores began to merge after the etching time of ∼42 min. After a suitable etching time of about ∼45 min, the appropriate conglomerations between the nearest neighbouring pores allowed the residuals of alumina nanowalls to become vertically aligned nanowire arrays resembling triangular-shaped cross sections. To terminate the pore-widening, we took the AAO sample out and subsequently washed with water before drying in air. In the drying process, if the water–air surface tension between two alumina nanowires exceeds the stiffness of the nanowire, then the nanowires will bend towards the surrounding nanowires. If this bending force is greater than the yield strength, the bending nanowires will plastically collapse, resulting in the formation of self-aggregated nanowire bundles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Because the surface tensions are in random directions, our self-aggregated nanowire bundles displayed irregular three-dimensional (3D) patterns similar to mountain ridges and valleys, as shown in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b,c</xref>. On top of the structure, we sputtered gold film with 40 nm thickness and the film appeared black in colour. Then, we peeled off the gold-coated film with a scotch tape. The optical photograph of the flexible sample is shown in the inset of <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>.

Six gold-coated alumina nanowires with triangular cross section were assembled in the shape of the Star of David with 11 nm gaps between the closest triangles at the bottom ends. These slanted six wires were bound together at the top ends.

Resonant plasmon nanofocusing appears at shorter wavelength in narrow nanogaps while at longer wavelength in larger nanogaps.

We floated the black gold membrane peeled off by microporous substrate (3M Micropore Surgical Tape 1530S-1) on the surface of water in the tube. We used this tape because its interconnected micropores provide hydrophilicity, thus encouraging underlying fluid flow to the top surface through the tape. 3M Micropore tape is initially hydrophobic in the air, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1589">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>, hence the contact angle of a water drop is 126°. Many open micropores contain air cavities that increase the air–water interfaces area, which makes the surface hydrophobic. However, after we soak this tape into water, the wet tape’s contact angle decreases to 26°, which represents hydrophilicity. For the sufficiently soaked tape, the air inside micropores escapes and water completely fills the micropores that attract water by capillary forces. This leads to hydrophilicity and finally provides the paths for fluid to flow to the surface through the pores. The water flow through the micropores enables continuous solar vapour generation with constant water provision.

Our floating membrane offers localized hot zones near the water surface and it enables efficient evaporation of the very thin water layer on top of the membrane. The thin-film membrane allows nanofocusing heat localization within the layer of few microns thickness. When this membrane keeps appropriate position from the top surface of water, while receiving continuous water provision through the micropores of the tape, heat localization by nanofocusing enables us to achieve efficient solar vapour generation even with lower solar illumination. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref> is the thermal images by infrared camera (E6, FLIR Systems, Inc.) when the black gold membrane is floating on the top surface of the water cuvette (top) and attached at the bottom of the 45-mm height cuvette (bottom) under the same solar illumination of 10 kW m<sup>−2</sup>.

We note that temperature values could have small difference due to the infrared absorption by the sidewalls of quartz cuvettes. Nevertheless, the relative temperature distribution at different locations of the cuvette provides meaningful information for qualitative comparison. When the black gold membrane is floating on the surface, the temperature rises only on the surface up to Δ<italic>T</italic>=40 °C, while at the depth of 15 mm the temperature increases only by Δ<italic>T</italic>=9 °C.

The bundles have multiscale structure with a significantly wide range of metallic nanoscale gaps from zero to hundreds of nanometres over few microns depth and microscale funnel structures, leading to the ultrabroadband absorption of the membrane. The small taper angle and varying nanogaps between aggregated nanowires are responsible for the broadband absorption in the visible to near-infrared region. The 3-μm funnel structure yields the ultrabroadband absorption up to 17 μm in the mid-infrared region.

Spectra were acquired in the 4,000–600 cm<sup>−1</sup> range with a resolution of 0.1 cm<sup>−1</sup> and calibrated with a gold mirror reference (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>FDTD simulations</title><p id="Par33">We performed numerical simulation using Lumerical Solutions, a commercial FDTD simulation software package.
