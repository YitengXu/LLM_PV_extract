We follow the removal of 1,8-diiodooctane directly after spin-coating using ellipsometry and ion beam analysis, while using small angle neutron scattering to characterise the morphological nanostructure evolution of the film. In PffBT4T-2OD/PC<sub>71</sub>BM devices, the power conversion efficiency increases from 7.2% to above 8.7% as a result of the coarsening of the phase domains. This coarsening process is assisted by thermal annealing and the slow evaporation of 1,8-diiodooctane, which we suggest, acts as a plasticiser to promote molecular mobility. Our results show that 1,8-diiodooctane can be completely removed from the film by a thermal annealing process at temperatures ≤100 °C and that there is an interplay between the evaporation rate of 1,8-diiodooctane and the rate of domain coarsening in the plasticized film which helps elucidate the mechanism by which additives improve device efficiency.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>7223</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>13</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2017_Article_BFsrep44269.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>17</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep44269" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep44269</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Organic photovoltaic solar cells (OPVs) represent a promising approach to generate renewable energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.

The photovoltaic effect in a BHJ commences with the generation of an exciton resulting from the absorption of a photon. Such excitons must be rapidly dissociated at a donor-acceptor interface to avoid recombination, with the charges generated being extracted through a bicontinuous and interpenetrating network of phase-separated fullerene and polymer-rich domains.

Thermal annealing (TA) was the first of these strategies to be explored as it proved most effective when used with crystalline polymers such as P3HT. For example annealing P3HT:PCBM blends at around 150 °C was used to improve the degree of crystallinity of the polymer and thus enhance device efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. This is in contrast with less crystalline or amorphous polymers such as PCDTBT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> in which annealing at temperatures &lt;100 °C has a limited benefit on device PCE mainly through removal of residual solvent rather than by causing a change in film nanostructure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, with annealing at higher temperatures causing a drastic decrease in PCE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.

For example, Chen <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, using AFM, estimated that in the P3HT:PCBM system the addition of 3% v/v DIO to the solution caused an increase in domain sizes in the corresponding BHJ from ~10 nm to ~15 nm. However the mechanism by which this process occurs as well as the early stages of the film drying and nanostructure evolution are still poorly understood.</p><p id="Par6">Among a variety of electron donor materials, poly[(5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazol-4,7-diyl)-alt-(3,3′″-di(2-octyldodecyl)2,2′;5′,2″;5″,2′″-quaterthiophen-5,5′″-diyl)] (PffBT4T-2OD) has recently attracted attention due to its potential to fabricate high performance OPV devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. This potential stems from the fact that PffBT4T-2OD exhibits high crystallinity resulting in high hole-mobility, together with the formation of relatively purer polymer domains that allow it to perform well even when used in relatively thick layers (~300 nm) in an OPV device.</p><p id="Par7">Liu <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> have shown that in solution, PffBT4T-2OD exhibits a peculiarly strong temperature-dependent aggregation behavior, characterized by the formation of a gel at room temperature. Consequently, PffBT4T-2OD thin films are always cast from warm solutions (&gt;60 °C), which then aggregate or crystallize during cooling and film formation. Indeed, it has been shown that this aggregation behavior is insensitive to the presence of the fullerene acceptor and can be efficiently used to control the morphology of the corresponding BHJs. This has permitted a near-ideal polymer:fullerene morphology to be created (containing highly crystalline, preferentially orientated, yet small polymer domains) by control over polymer aggregation during solution casting.</p><p id="Par8">Ma <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> have studied the influence of processing parameters such as solution temperature, concentration, spin-rate and solvent quality, as well as the influence of polymer molecular weight on the morphology and properties of PffBT4T-2OD:PC<sub>71</sub>BM solar cells. Here, it was found that the molecular orientation and molecular packing can be tuned by adjusting the spin rate during spin-coating and the solution temperature for blend films, with a low spinning rate and low solution temperature inducing highly ordered face-on polymer packing, and a high spinning rate and high solution temperature producing poorly ordered edge-on polymer packing. The best OPV performance was achieved using films spun-cast at 800 rpm from a solution at 100 °C, creating a smooth film containing sufficient aggregates to yield a favourable morphology.</p><p id="Par9">A detailed study of the processing methodologies to optimize the morphology of PffBT4T-2OD based OPV devices has however not yet been reported in the literature.</p><p id="Par10">Experimentally, many different techniques have been used to study the morphology of polymer:fullerene BHJ systems, however difficulties remain in precisely determining the composition and size of the blend phases, the structure of the interfaces between phases and film morphology as a result of limited contrast between the materials in the blend. Despite the fact that it is possible to distinguish between semi-crystalline conjugated polymers and fullerenes using electron and x-ray based techniques, difficulties remain in determining the structure associated with amorphous materials, and as such it is difficult to probe amorphous regions in conjugated polymer-fullerene blends. Furthermore, techniques such as AFM only allow the morphology of the solid-air interface to be determined, however film structure at this interface is often very different from that in the underlying bulk. One technique that can be used to probe such systems is neutron scattering. Neutron scattering has been highly effective in probing the structure of polymer:fullerene BHJs as contrast between these materials originates from differences in the scattering length density (SLD) of fullerenes compared to protonated conjugated polymers, with no additional deuteration of the components being necessary. For this reason, neutron scattering techniques such as Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> and Neutron Reflectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> have provided new insight into the nanomorphology and vertical layer structure of bulk heterojunctions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par11">In this paper, we elucidate the mechanism by which 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) improves the device efficiency of PffBT4T-2OD/PC<sub>71</sub>BM based devices. Through a combination of small angle neutron scattering, ion-beam analysis and ellipsometry we demonstrate that DIO acts as a plasticizer to increase molecular mobility and domain coarsening in a process that is assisted by thermal annealing and in which thermal annealing plays two antagonistic roles; it increases molecular mobility due to increased thermal energy, however it simultaneously promotes the evaporation of the plasticizer (DIO) which consequently decreases molecular mobility. Therefore, the ideal morphology results from a fine balance between these two effects; the evaporation rate of DIO and the rate at which domains coarsen in the plasticized film. We believe that this understanding of the mechanism by which additives improve device efficiency can be used in the development of smart strategies for additive development.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and Discussions</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Photovoltaic performances</title><p id="Par12"><xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1(a)</xref> shows the chemical structure of the polymer PffBT4T-2OD. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1(b)</xref> shows the structure of the OPV devices studied in this work, comprising ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Active layer/Ca/Al.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Molecular structure of PffBT4T-2OD (<bold>b</bold>) A schematic of the device structure explored.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2017_Article_BFsrep44269_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p id="Par13"><xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(a)</xref> shows current density-voltage (JV) curves of devices processed with DIO and then annealed for different times as well as an unannealed control.

Importantly, these improvements in device metrics all occur in the initial 3 to 5 minutes of annealing, with annealing beyond this time not apparently leading to further improvements in device performance. In fact, we find that longer annealing times lead to a slight decrease in PCE. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(b)</xref> shows representative JV curves of two devices processed without DIO, one unannealed and the other annealed for 5 minutes, together with the JV curves of the corresponding devices processed with DIO as reproduced from <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2(a)</xref>.

The inset shows the same data, plotted around the initial 5 minutes for films with and without DIO, with thickness normalised to its value after 5 minutes annealing at 100 °C. The results clearly show that in the case of the film processed with DIO, there is a drop of &gt;30% in film thickness during the first 2 minutes of the annealing; a process that we attribute to the loss of DIO through evaporation. In contrast, the film that does not contain DIO undergoes a small increase in thickness, which we attribute to thermal expansion of the film. This indicates that in this film, the CB/DCB casting solvent underwent complete evaporation during spin-coating. Although CB and DCB have boiling points of 131 °C and 180 °C respectively, this complete evaporation results from the fact that films were spun-cast from a hot solution (110 °C) onto substrates that were held at the same temperature. This result is consistent with other studies on P3HT/PCBM BHJ films<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> spun-cast from CB or from 1,2,5-trichlorobenzene (b.p. = 214 °C) that dry almost completely in a time period shorter than 10 s if heated to 50 °C.

Even though DIO is added at low concentration (3% v/v), it is a liquid with extremely low volatility and thus significant quantities are expected to remain in the film after casting.

For this reason, the large reduction in thickness observed upon annealing is not surprising.</p><p id="Par18">In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM41">Supplementary Figure 1</xref> we show that the annealed BHJ film processed without DIO, shown in the inset of <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, undergoes a slight contraction (~1%) as it is cooled from 100 °C to 30 °C. We note that the T<sub>g</sub> of the polymer is close to 100 °C, and thus we attribute this contraction to a relaxation and rearrangement of the polymer molecules.

However, we cannot exclude difference in SLD resulting from sample-to-sample variability.</p><p id="Par21">We have used ion-beam analysis (Rutherford backscattering, RBS) to explore the evaporation of DIO from the films. RBS experiments are highly sensitive to the presence of DIO as the iodine nuclei are by far the heaviest atoms in the sample and thus ion-recoils from iodine are detected at significantly higher energy than recoils from other nuclei within the film or substrate. Ion-beam experiments do not require the time-consuming sample alignment and heating ramp steps involved in ellipsometry and thus can more accurately follow the kinetics of evaporation in the earliest stages of film drying.</p><p id="Par22">Typical ion-beam data and fits are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM41">Supplementary Information</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM41">Supplementary Figures 6 and 7</xref>.

In the case of annealed samples the signal decreases systematically in height and width with increasing annealing time, corresponding to a loss of DIO from the sample with annealing. For every film except the unannealed sample, <italic>ϕ</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub> was found to be zero, and for this case it is likely that significant thickness variations in the freshly prepared film surface are responsible for this result. Nevertheless the very large signal at higher energy when compared to the signal at lower energy from the substrate is consistent with a high concentration of DIO initially present. Interestingly, the fit to the 1 min sample includes a significant tail in the low energy part of the RBS data (~1255 keV) corresponding to a diffuse composition profile for DIO. This feature of the data coupled with the sharp edges at 1065 keV (sulfur surface) and 1616 keV (iodine surface) indicates that at very early stages of annealing, DIO may diffuse into the lower PEDOT layer of the sample before eventually evaporating at longer times. This finding is consistent with other work by Yi <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> who report that solvent additives may affect the PEDOT:PSS layer. At longer annealing times, 3, 5 and 20 minutes, the fits and peaks due to DIO and the sulfur rich layers are consistent, and confirm that the DIO maintains an even vertical distribution within the film as it evaporates.</p><p id="Par25">Our ion-beam analysis measurements shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM41">Supplementary Figure 7</xref> suggest that thermal annealing the BHJ films at 100 °C is enough to reduce the DIO concentration through evaporation by nearly three decades in around 20 minutes, even though this temperature is well below the DIO boiling temperature (167–169 °C at a base pressure of 6 mmHg). We note similar work by de Villers <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>, in which an annealing temperature of 175 °C was used to facilitate the removal of DIO from a BHJ film in order to reduce photo-degradation.

We note however that as we make several assumptions in this calculation, these values should be considered only as first-order estimates.</p><p id="Par32">We have also characterised the UV-Vis absorption of PffBT4T-2OD:PC<sub>71</sub>BM blend films processed with DIO before and after annealing, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM41">Supplementary Figure 11</xref> where all spectra have been normalized based on the intensity of the 0–1 transition peak at ~640 nm. It can be seen that the region at ~700 nm corresponding to the 0–0 transition peak remains almost unchanged with thermal annealing which suggests that no significant change in crystallinity has occurred<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In the same Figure we show as inset the EQE spectra for two devices processed with DIO, with one BHJ being subjected to 5 minutes of thermal annealing at 100 °C and the other BHJ remaining unannealed. As shown, the EQE of each device are similar to the absorption spectra of the BHJ as expected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. We find that annealed device has a slightly higher peak EQE at 500 nm compared to the unannealed device (75% compared to 70%), however over most of the absorption bandwidth the measured EQE spectra are similar. There is a small increase in the integrated EQE (3.8%) with annealing, this result is consistent with the fact that thermal annealing for 5 minutes does not result in a significant increase in J<sub>sc</sub> for devices that contain DIO (see <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="Par33">The effective separation and transport of the photo-generated charge carriers is crucial to device performance and in order to investigate the yield of exciton generation, we measured the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum from the different films as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM41">Supplementary Figure 12</xref>. From 0 to 3 minutes annealing, there is a dramatic increase in PL intensity that then remains almost unchanged over a following 3 to 60 minutes annealing time. This large increase in PL intensity, which is associated with a corresponding decrease in exciton quenching, suggests that upon annealing the films containing DIO the phase domains become purer which is also in agreement with our SANS observations.</p><p id="Par34">We have used grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) to study the impact of the different processing conditions on the crystalline structure of the system, and the results are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM41">Supplementary Figure 13 and 14</xref>. The dominant orientation for the blends without DIO is a face-on lamellar structure. Annealing this blend for 5 minutes improves the out-of-plane ordering, and we can see well-defined peaks for the face-on lamellar packing at 0.29 Å<sup>−1</sup> along with higher orders at 0.59 Å<sup>−1</sup> and 0.88 Å<sup>−1</sup>. The lamellar stacking spacing for all the samples studied is somewhat greater than that seen for pure PffBT4T-4OD (q = 0.28 Å<sup>−1</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> with values closer to ~0.3 Å<sup>−1</sup>, which means a smaller spacing. The same is true for the π-π stacking distance, with values ~1.77 Å<sup>−1</sup> compared to 1.74 Å<sup>−1</sup> for the pure polymer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. We also observe a broad halo at q = 1.4 Å<sup>−1</sup> characteristic of PC<sub>71</sub>BM aggregation. In terms of the sample with 3% DIO, here we see much more isotropic orientation of the polymer crystallite orientation, with Debye-Scherrer like rings instead of the strong out-of-plane orientation dominance seen without DIO, showing that the crystals exist in all possible orientation angles relative to the substrate surface. We think that this is due to the difference in drying dynamics, insofar as the films without DIO are dry and vitrified after spin coating has finished. Whereas the films with DIO are still solvated by DIO and therefore mobile, the strong shear gradient from spin coating has been removed before the blend layer has vitrified. These results are in agreement with our SANS results in showing that DIO facilitates changes in the morphology of the film.</p><p id="Par35">To compare our findings determined from the different characterisation techniques, we plotted in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6(a)</xref> the characteristic length scale (correlation length), PCE and the PL intensity ratios (recorded at 740 nm) of annealed films (I) and un-annealed film (I<sub>0</sub>), as a function of annealing time.

This coarsening then slows progressively, with no further domain coarsening observed for annealing times greater than approximately 20 minutes. As can be seen in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6(b)</xref> this time-scale seems correlated with the time required to evaporate the DIO upon annealing. This correlation of time-scales suggests that DIO acts as a plasticizer that increases the molecular mobility, and that phase coarsening only occurs while the residual DIO is present. It can also be seen that annealing results in a large increase in PL emission intensity. This observation is also consistent with increased phase separation of the polymer and PC<sub>71</sub>BM (as a result of domain coarsening) and thus reduced exciton quenching via charge-separation. From our aggregated data presented in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6(c)</xref>, it can be seen that the highest PCE (obtained after 5 minutes annealing) is associated with a characteristic length scale in the range 11.7–12.9 nm. Furthermore, we find that coarsening of the blend morphology beyond this length scale is associated with a slight decrease in PV efficiency. We note that the characteristic length scales necessary to produce the highest device PCEs can only be attained through a simultaneous combination of the use of a DIO additive and appropriate thermal annealing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par37">In conclusion therefore, we have explored the morphology of a PffBT4T-2OD/PC<sub>71</sub>BM PV applicable blend film during thermal annealing using a variety of optical and structural probes. Neutron reflectivity measurements indicate that the vertical distribution of PC<sub>71</sub>BM within such films is fairly homogeneous, a feature that is qualitatively different from other polymer:fullerene blends<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Importantly, we find that DIO improves the PCE of PffBT4T-2OD/PC<sub>71</sub>BM OPV devices upon annealing by plasticizing the film. This plasticization enables the coarsening of the nanomorphology of the BHJ during annealing at 100 °C, with characteristic length scales having an initial value of 9–10 nm reaching a value of 12–13 nm after around 5 minutes. Although further annealing leads to further small increases in characteristic length scale (to ~14 nm) this is apparently detrimental to device PCE.</p><p id="Par38">Our results strongly suggest therefore that there is an interplay between the kinetics of domain coarsening and the evaporation of DIO. Indeed, the amount of plasticizer DIO present in the film drops abruptly during annealing due to evaporation, being almost completely removed from the film after 20 minutes. On removal of the DIO, the rate of domain coarsening drops abruptly, with the final film phase morphology becoming effectively locked-in. We believe therefore that the domain size within a polymer:fullerene blend may be controllable through the selection of plasticizers having different evaporation rates, with our results providing a rational framework for the development of improved processing routes for PV-applicable BHJ materials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Experimental Section</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par39">PEDOT:PSS (HC Stark CleviosAI4083) and PC<sub>71</sub>BM were purchased from Ossila Ltd.

Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene): poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) was used as the hole transport layer. The active layer was cast from a solution of chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene (1:1 volume ratio) with 3% DIO (volume percentage) as a solvent additive, with the polymer and PC<sub>71</sub>BM having a relative concentration of 9 mg/ml and 10.8 mg/ml respectively.

The active layer was spin-cast in a nitrogen filled glove box, with the films produced having a thickness of ~300 nm as measured with ellipsometry.

We used a Cauchy model to fit Ψ (the ratio of the amplitude of the incident and reflected light beams) and Δ (the ratio of the phase lag of the incident and reflected light beams) over the wavelength range in which the film is optically transparent (840 to 1000 nm). For measurements under annealing conditions, thin films prepared as previously described, were placed on a Linkam heating/cooling stage. The cell had two transparent windows to allow transmission of the polarized incident and reflected ellipsometry beams. The films were rapidly heated from 25 °C to 100 °C and left at 100 °C for 1 hour, with Ψ and Δ recorded as a function of annealing time.
