the size range of about 1–100 nm, in order to create materials, devices, and systems with fundamentally new properties and functions because of their small structure. The 1999 “Nano1” report Nanotechnology Research Directions: Vision for Nanotechnology in the Next Decade described nanotechnology as a broad-based, multidisciplinary field projected to reach mass use by 2020 and offering a new approach to education, innovation, learning, and governance—a field expected to revolutionize many aspects of human life.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> Nanotechnology can profoundly affect the ways the authors live, how healthy the authors are, what the authors produce, how the authors interact and communicate with others, how the authors produce and utilize new forms of energy, and how the authors maintain the environment.</p><p>Ten years have passed since that first “Nano1” U.S. National Science and Technology Council report on the prospects for nanotechnology. During this past decade, research and development in nanotechnology has made astonishing progress and has now provided a clearer indication of its potential. This new report (“Nano2”) examines the last decade’s progress in the field and uncovers the opportunities for nanotechnology development in the United States and around the world in the next decade. It summarizes what has been achieved with the investments made since 2000, but more importantly, it describes the expected targets for nanotechnology R&amp;D in the next decade and beyond and how to achieve them in the context of societal needs and other emerging technologies.</p><p>The Nano2 report incorporates views of leading experts from academia, industry, and government shared among U.S. representatives and those from over 35 other economies in four forums held between March and July 2010. These began with a brainstorming meeting in Chicago (United States) and included U.S.-multinational workshops in Hamburg, Germany (involving European Union and U.S. representatives); Tokyo, Japan (involving Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and U.S. representatives); and Singapore (involving Singapore, Australia, China, India, Saudi Arabia, and U.S. representatives). Participants came from a wide range of disciplines, including the physical and biological sciences, engineering, medicine, social sciences, economics, and philosophy.</p><sec id="Sec1"><title>Outline of the study</title><p>The international study documents the progress made in nanotechnology from 2000 to 2010 and lays out a vision for progress in nanotechnology from 2010 to 2020, in four broad categories of interest:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p><italic>Methods and tools</italic> of nanotechnology for investigation, synthesis, and manufacturing</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Safe and sustainable development</italic> of nanotechnology for responsible and effective management of its potential; this includes environmental, health, and safety (EHS) aspects and support for a sustainable environment in terms of energy, water, food, raw materials, and climate</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Nanotechnology applications</italic> for advances in biosystems and medicine; information technology; photonics and plasmonics; catalysis; and high-performance materials, devices, and systems</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Societal dimensions</italic>, including education, investing in physical infrastructure, and governance of nanotechnology for societal benefit</p></list-item></list></p><p>This study is addressed to the academic community, private sector, government agencies, and generally to nanotechnology stakeholders.

Single-phonon spectroscopy and sub-nanometer measurements of molecular electron densities have been performed. Single-atom and single-molecule characterization methods have emerged that allow researchers to probe the complex and dynamic nature of nanostructures in previously impossible ways (Chapter 2). A tool-kit has been established.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Simulation from basic principles has expanded to assemblies of atoms 100 times larger than in 2000, and “materials by design” can now be done for a few polymeric and other nanostructures (Chapter 1).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Fundamental structure–function studies for nanomaterials have led to the discovery and development of important new phenomena such as plasmonics, negative index of refraction in IR/visible wavelength radiation, Casimir forces, nanofluidics, nanopatterning, teleportation of information between atoms, and biointeractions at the nanoscale. Other nanoscale phenomena are better understood and quantified, such as quantum confinement, polyvalency, and shape anisotropy. Each has become the foundation for new domains in science and engineering.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An illustration is the discovery of spin torque transfer (the ability to switch the magnetization of nanomagnet using a spin polarized current), which has significant implications for memory, logic, sensors, and nano-oscillators. A new class of devices has been enabled, as exemplified by the worldwide competition to develop spin torque transfer random access memory (STT-RAM), which will be fully commercialized in the next decade.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Scanning probe tools for printing one molecule or nanostructure high on surfaces over large areas with sub-50 nm resolution have become reality in research and commercial settings.

However, since 2005, more sophisticated products with “active” nanostructures and devices have been introduced to meet needs not addressed by current technologies (e.g., point-of-care molecular diagnostic tools and life-saving targeted drug therapeutics).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Entirely new classes of materials have been discovered and developed, both scientifically and technologically. These include one-dimensional nanowires and quantum dots of various compositions, polyvalent noble metal nanostructures, graphene, metamaterials, nanowire superlattices, and a wide variety of other particle compositions. A periodic table of nanostructures is emerging, with entries defined by particle composition, size, shape, and surface functionality.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Entirely new concepts have been proved: first quantum device was built and tested in 2010, first artificial cell with synthetic genome was completed, and first hierarchical structures by design have been calculated.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A versatile library has been invented of new nanostructures and surface patterning methods that are fueling the development of the field. These include commercialized systems such as a large variety of nanoparticles, nanolayers, nanostructured polymers, metals, ceramics, and composites, optical and “dip-pen” nanolithography, nanoimprint lithography, and roll-to-roll processes for manufacturing graphene and other nanosheets. This said, nanotechnology is still in a formative phase from the standpoints of characterization methods, the level of empiricism in synthesis and manufacturing, and the development of complex nanosystems. More fundamental R&amp;D is needed to address these limitations.</p></list-item><list-item><p>New processes and nanostructures have been formulated using basic principles from quantum and surface sciences to molecular bottom-up assembly, and have been combined with semi-empirical, top-down miniaturization methods for integration into products.

The first point-of-care nano-enabled medical diagnostic tools such as the Verigene System are now being used around the world to rapidly diagnose disease. In addition, over 50 cancer-targeting drugs based on nanotechnology are in clinical trial in the United States alone.

The state of the art in nanoelectronics has progressed rapidly from microscale devices to the realm of 30 nm and is continuing this trajectory to even smaller feature sizes.

Nanotechnology will be translated from the research labs to consumer use, motivated by responsiveness to societal challenges such as sustainability; energy generation, conservation, storage, and conversion; and improved healthcare that is lower-cost and more accessible. During the first decade, the main driver was scientific discovery accruing from curiosity-driven research. During the next decade, application-driven research will produce new scientific discoveries and economic optimization leading to new technologies and industries. Such translation will benefit society but will require new approaches in accountable, anticipatory, and participatory governance, and real-time technology assessment.

This picture suggests the integration of various nanotechnology-based solutions in the design of a blended hybrid-wing-body concept for future subsonic commercial aircraft. It represents a radical departure from conventional subsonic aircraft design. Mechanical and thermal insulation properties of the nanocomposite will allow for “morphing” airframe and propulsion structures that can change their shape or properties on demand to improve aerodynamic efficiency and respond to damage. Composite materials derived from low density, high strength carbon nanotube-based fibers and durable nanoporous matrixes will enable the production of ultra-lightweight multifunctional airframes and with embedded lightning strike protection. Nanotexturing will create surfaces that are naturally resistant to ice accretion thereby eliminating the need for runway deicing and in-flight ice mitigation. Replacement of heavy copper wiring cables with carbon nanotube wires will enable significant reductions in aircraft weight. Distributed autonomous networks of nanotechnology based state sensors powered by high efficiency energy harvesting (thermoelectric, piezoelectric, or photovoltaics) will enable real-time monitoring of the overall health and performance of the aircraft leading to reduced emissions and noise and improved safety. The design, developed by NASA and Massachusetts Institute for Technology, is for a 354 passenger commercial aircraft that would be available for commercial use in 2030–2035 and would enable a reduction in aircraft fuel consumption by 54% over a Boeing 777 baseline aircraft.
