Rooftop Solar photovoltaics (RTSPV) technology as a subset of the solar photovoltaic electricity generation portfolio can be deployed as a decentralized system either by individual homeowners or by large industrial and commercial complexes. Over the past decade, reduction in the deployment cost coupled with policy-driven initiatives has led to a rapid uptake of RTSPV globally. Between 2006 and 2018, the installed capacity of the RTSPV has grown from 2.5 GW to 213 GW- an 85-fold increase globally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. With an additional capacity installation of 41 GW, RTSPV currently accounts for 40% of the global cumulative installed capacity of the solar PV and nearly one-fourth of the total renewable capacity additions in 2018—surpassing the combined new installed capacities of both coal and nuclear. At the same time, RTSPV technology has demonstrated a steep decline in its deployment costs which ranged between 63 and 265 $ MWh<sup>−1</sup> in the year 2019—a reduction of between 42 and 79% over 2010 values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Globally, nearly 800 million people were without electricity in 2018, the majority of who are living in rural areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Here, the role of decentralized rooftop PV in advancing the ethos of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 becomes very important. The fast installation time and low levelised cost of RTSPV can aid in mitigating the problem of energy access by making citizens or communities a prosumer. The prosumer can generate and consume electricity as per their requirements without depending exclusively on a centralized grid infrastructure. As the fastest deployable energy generation technology with the highest year-on-year growth rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, solar PV technology is projected to supply 25–49% of the global electricity needs by 2050 while providing employment for up to 15 million people between 2018 and 2050<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Out of this, RTSPV deployment will contribute up to 40% of the total solar PV-derived electricity generation by 2050.</p><p id="Par5">Increased deployment of RTSPV can support displacing fossil fuels out of the current energy generation mix as can be observed in the successful implementation of rooftop photovoltaics in Germany. As the demand for electricity as an energy source increases in the future, RSTPV based generation sources will form a large part of the future renewable-based generation portfolio. This shift in the current generation mix coupled with the future low carbon generation capacity expansion can aid in reducing the energy-derived greenhouse gas emissions and also aid in advancing the SDG13 goal of combating climate change with co-benefits for the SDG3. RTSPV technology can thus lead to consumer-driven breakthroughs in tackling climate change, reducing local air pollution, accelerating development, and providing affordable energy access to areas lacking electrification.</p><p id="Par6">To better understand the role that an RTSPV system can fulfill in the future, a global harmonized geo-mapped assessment of its technical potential and the costs associated with attaining the technical potential is pertinent especially when such assessments at a global level are lacking. RTSPV systems are deployed as a decentralized system contrary to the utility-scale solar PV systems, which increases the complexity of its assessment as the smallest unit of deployment becomes a rooftop as opposed to a large plot of a green or brownfield site. Along with the complexities associated with accurately determining the rooftop area, assessment of seasonal variations of its potential is also important to understand the supply dynamics of variable renewable energy (VRE) technologies like RTSPV. This highlights the need for a high-resolution spatiotemporal assessment that accurately represents the geographical variability of the built environment along with impacts of seasonal changes in solar insolation.</p><p id="Par7">Current research primarily focuses on utility-scale solar PV resource assessment at a global scale. A similar assessment has not been done for decentralized RTSPV at a scale greater than regional/national levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. As a result, energy system models and research informing climate change policy have not fully considered the role of solar PV in meeting the climate change mitigation goals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Assessment of RTSPV potential requires an underlying dataset of building footprints, solar insolation mapping, and technology-specific information like panel size, conversion efficiency, and system losses. The current literature is adequate in providing global information on the latter two categories, with the largest inaccuracies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> attributed to the demarcation and calculation of building footprints which require large data and costly information processing hardware to extract buildings from satellite imagery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">Two major approaches are currently used to determine built-up area, or more specifically the extent and area occupied by building rooftops, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>. The first approach addresses the problem from a “Bottom–up”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> perspective and is the most common approach currently implemented to calculate rooftop area at scale. Such approaches establish the relationship between building footprint data (cadastral, crowd-sourced, satellite-derived) and socio-economic metrics (Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Population) for a small sample set and then estimate the extent of building footprints across a wider scale. In the study by Jacobson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, the authors have used the bottom-up methodology to calculate available rooftop areas for 179 countries by establishing relationships between population, GDP, and floorspace area per capita based on sample data from the USA and several European countries. For a full set of global countries, Gernaat et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> have used the relationship between population density, household expenditure, and rooftop area to calculate available rooftop area per country. They have calibrated their relationship equations on World Bank’s data and realized an <italic>R</italic><sup>2 </sup>= 0.66. These methods are quick to implement and are relatively accurate when predicting building footprint areas in the neighborhood regions, but inaccuracies arise when the analysis is upscaled towards country/regional levels. This reduction in accuracy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> can be attributed to the inaccuracies in the coarse geospatial mapping of socioeconomic data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> and the heterogeneity of built-up landscapes.</p><p id="Par9">The second approach addresses the problem from a “Top–Down”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> perspective, utilizing aerial imagery to determine built-up area along with building footprints contained in it. “Top–Down” methods include earth observation, drone-mounted Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and machine learning (ML) classification algorithms to detect buildings. On a country-wide scale, Gagnon et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> have used LiDAR datasets for 128 US sample cities to calculate available rooftop areas for the continental USA using statistical inferencing to extrapolate beyond their sample site. They have generated statistical measures to generalize rooftop orientation, slope, and availability based on high-resolution LiDAR imagery. Collecting, processing, and analyzing the aerial imagery is a costly and computationally intensive task requiring datacentre scale infrastructure. These shortcomings have led to limitations in the scale of studies using top-down methods, where only a few commercial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> ventures have been able to provide country-wide building footprints, and to date, a global-scale analysis has yet to be implemented. One solution to mitigate the processing and data bottleneck is to use predefined land cover classification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> to demarcate global land areas which are artificially built up and then downscale the built-up area to actual building footprint<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> using simplifying assumptions. This hybrid approach was used in a study by Bodis et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, where they have established a relationship between cadastral data of Netherlands, CORINE landcover, and European Settlement Map to infer the rooftop area in the other 27 EU countries.</p><p id="Par10">The current state of art<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> methods utilize ML-based object detection algorithms to map individual buildings for Region of Interest (ROI) at the city/country level. However, none of the state of art methods have been applied to a global ROI assessment partly due to the amount of data processing required in ML-based methods and partly due to the limitations of the ML algorithm in detecting similar objects that deviate from training sample sets.</p><p id="Par11">Here, we directly address the gap in the current literature by developing a hybrid framework that integrates “Top-down” and “Bottom-up” methods using a ML model to provide a high-resolution global assessment of rooftop solar PV technical potential at a monthly temporal resolution (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We divide the entire global landmass into multiple 10 km<sup>2</sup> assessment units. In each assessment unit, we utilize a high-resolution population dataset (at 100 m spatial resolution), road length, and built-up area boundaries to estimate the rooftop area. The estimation algorithm built upon the ML model is designed to learn the relationship between population, road length and built-up area boundaries, and actual rooftop area from a large global sample set covering countries in various stages of socio-economic development and built-up topography. This way we utilize a comprehensive set of disparate built environment archetypes involving variable population densities in different landscape configurations to overcome the limitations imposed by the “Top-down” and “Bottom-up” methods used in previous studies. Along with the geo-mapping of the technical potential, we also map the associated Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE) and regional supply cost curves for a global ROI covering &gt;195 countries, spanning 130 million km<sup>2</sup> land area, containing buildings ranging from detached rural nucleated settlements to global conurbation dotted by multi-storied skyscrapers across varied geographies.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Framework for assessment of RTSPV’s global technical potential and costs.</title><p>The framework developed in this study starts with data preparation and mapping of various geospatial metrics to both Top-down and Bottom-up pathways. Further, the machine learning model is trained and used to estimate BFE<sub>FN</sub> values from BA<sub>FN,</sub> PPLN<sub>FN</sub>, and RL<sub>FN</sub> values. Next, the BFE<sub>FN</sub> values are used to calculate the technical potential (SP) with the aid of the conversion factors (CF). Finally, the calculated potential dataset is used to map the Levelised Cost of Electricity (LCOE) values using IRENA’s renewable power generation cost data.

The results presented in this study have considered a 100% rooftop availability at a 10% panel efficiency. To account for the change in the potential due to different panel efficiencies and rooftop availability, we have documented global and regional potentials for a set of rooftop scaling factors and panel efficiencies (Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4 and</xref><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>).

Aggregation of the built area (BA<sub>FN</sub>) within each FN was undertaken using built area sub-classifications (100 m resolution) provided by the global landcover layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> (LC) of the Copernicus land monitoring program. Being derived from a native 10 m resolution satellite imagery, the LC layer provided us with a significantly improved representation of built-up area over the current state of art methods that utilize coarser-resolution landcover classification. The use of pre-built landcover classifications also aided in reducing the information processing overheads related to manually classifying petabytes of satellite imagery.</p><p id="Par14">It is important to highlight that the BA<sub>FN</sub> layer aggregations contain buildings along with roads, green area boundaries, footpaths, parking lots, etc. These additional built-up structures are not relevant to the current analysis and can occupy significant BA<sub>FN</sub> areas in a low-density built environment. Methodological uncertainties can also arise due to the heterogeneity of impervious landscapes and due to misclassification caused by the similar spectral signatures of other built structures on the ground, but at a global ROI, these errors form a very small percentage of the ground truth. This underscores the need to downscale the BA<sub>FN</sub> layer globally to accurately represent a harmonized rooftop area.</p><p id="Par15">To downscale the BA<sub>FN</sub> layer, we started by generating a subset of global FN containing actual building footprints<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> (BF<sub>FN</sub>), road length<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup> (RL<sub>FN</sub>), and population count<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup> (PPLN<sub>FN</sub>). For calculating building footprints (derived from Microsoft AI, Ecopia AI, and Open Street Map-OSM datasets), we aggregated individual building footprints based on FN cells overlapping the individual buildings to generate a single building footprint area value per FN (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In total, 37,115 km<sup>2</sup> of building footprint area and 11.4 million km<sup>2</sup> of the total land area were covered by our sample FNs, accounting for &gt;300 million individual buildings ranging from small outdoor sheds to mega factories. The building samples also provided us with a diverse set of building types in different geographies spanning a wide spectrum of socio-economic stages of development. These global sample sets (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>) are a marked improvement over the previous literature, where a narrow sampling strategy often at a city/country level is undertaken. Using heterogeneous global building samples enables the overall analysis to be more resistant to generalization error which is introduced due to overreliance on a small set of similar built-up landscapes.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Visual representation of a sample FN involved in Bottom-up methods.</title><p><bold>a</bold> The image is depicting an area over New York, USA.

The high-resolution population dataset coupled with a high-resolution BA<sub>FN</sub> layer enabled us to accurately map the population count for each of our sample FN. Previous studies at country/regional scale have used coarse resolution (≥1 km resolution) population count which can lead to inaccuracies in downscaling due to over counting of the population in a given FN.</p><p id="Par18">Aggregation and processing of big data like geospatial building and road datasets require a very high computation time and significant cost in hardware. To overcome this challenge, we used Google Earth Engine’s (GEE) cloud computing platform to perform planetary-scale analysis, where the datasets were split into smaller raster files based on each FN’s geographical extent and finally aggregated to represent a single value (see “Methods” section). It should be noted that the GEE platform is lacking in the processing of vector data like building and road polygons, for which we utilized multi-core processing enabled by ArcGIS PRO desktop software. This combination of GEE for raster data (PPLN<sub>FN</sub>, BA<sub>FN</sub>) and ArcGIS PRO for vector data enabled us to process our datasets at a fraction of the time and cost. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at merging two fundamentally different service platforms to assess global potentials, which could be useful for other planetary-scale resource assessments. Links to the input datasets and their validation reports are documented in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>.</p><p id="Par19">Next, we linked the aggregated BA<sub>FN</sub>, PPLN<sub>FN</sub> datasets from Top-down methods and processed BF<sub>FN</sub>, RL<sub>FN</sub> datasets from the Bottom-up methods using a ML model that takes BA<sub>FN</sub>, PPLN<sub>FN</sub>, RL<sub>FN</sub> datasets as independent variables and BF<sub>FN</sub> as the dependent variables. The ML model trains from the relationship between the independent and dependent variables for our sample FNs and estimates the aggregated building rooftop area for the rest of the non-sample FNs, effectively downscaling the BA<sub>FN</sub> layer to an estimated area occupied by building rooftops (BFE<sub>FN</sub>). For data gaps in PPLN<sub>FN</sub>, RL<sub>FN</sub> layer, we used an iterative imputing method to interpolate missing values in the dataset using multiple regression runs.</p><p id="Par20">In our tests, the ML model built upon XGboost algorithm provided better accuracy (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value) and better overall error reduction (considerably lower mean absolute error) in the prediction of sample data as compared to multivariate regression (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). To reduce the overfitting of the ML model, a 10-fold cross-validation strategy was used for tuning hyper-parameters to generate the best model (see “Methods” section). The ML model performed well (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d, e</xref>) with ±4 km<sup>2</sup> error in predicting total building footprint per 100 km<sup>2</sup> FN, with the majority of errors lying between ±0.25 km<sup>2</sup>. Also, for a total of 37,000 km<sup>2</sup> of absolute building footprint area across our samples, a total of 4 km<sup>2</sup> of absolute error was recorded. On a regional level, slight left skewness/systematic underestimation of rooftop area was observed for the Asian Region (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>).

The CF<sub>FN</sub> layer is provided as a griddled raster dataset representing kWh produced by each kWp installed capacity per day. The locations outside the latitudes were assigned a constant CF value of 3.5 kWh/kWp/day (peak). Next, CF<sub>FN</sub> values for each of the twelve months were used to generate monthly solar potential per FN (SP<sub>FN</sub>,<sub>M</sub>). Further, we aggregated monthly technical potentials to yearly technical potentials for each of the countries to generate a global RTSPV potential map, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. To represent the costs associated with the technical potential, we used the LCOE metric (see “Methods” section). The capital expenditure (CAPEX) values range between 840 and 3874 $ kW<sup>−1</sup> of installed capacity for 17 countries in total, with the rest of the world being allocated averages for the continent they are in. The operation and maintenance cost (OPEX) and discount rates (DR) were based on whether the country is OECD or Non-OECD. For each FN, LCOE costs were calculated based on CAPEX, OPEX, SP, and DR with a project lifetime of 25 years.

The cost to achieve the potential in these countries ranges from 200 to 280 $ MWh<sup>−1</sup>. U.K (251 $ MWh<sup>−1</sup>) has the highest country-specific costs to achieve its potential.</p><p id="Par29">Globally, CAPEX required to access potential varies both with respect to the size of the GDP and with respect to the LCOE values (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>). To realize the complete potential in their respective countries, low-income countries would need to invest capital which is multiple times (up to 3.5 times) their 2015 GDP value even at relatively low LCOE of between 80 and 150 $ MWh<sup>−1</sup> to cover for high upfront costs. For similar LCOE values, high-income countries (World Bank Income Classification) can achieve their complete potentials with a capital investment equivalent to a fraction (up to half) of their 2015 GDP value.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Global economic and technical variation in accessing the potentials.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Disparity in achieving full potential, with low-income countries requiring capital investment greater than their respective 2015 GDP value to achieve full potential. <bold>b</bold> Distribution of 32 regions in relation to their relative yield factor and GDP per capita.

In this study, we defined the yield factor as the yearly potential that can be realized from 1 TW of installed capacity. Based on this categorization, we found out that emerging economics including India, Brazil, and Mexico have high yield factors (1.5–2) that would favor the deployment of RTSPV in these countries. Even though the LCOE difference between the two most populous countries (India and China) is minimal, with the greater solar endowment and with high yield factor, RTSPV technology rollout becomes more favorable in India compared to China. However, the uptake of RTSPV is still very low in these countries due to lack of credit and the inability to pay the high upfront cost of the RTSPV system. This highlights the need for global cooperation, technology transfer, and green financial instruments to accelerate the deployment of low carbon RTSPV technology in low-income and medium-income countries.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par31">The study showcases how a framework based on big data and an ML model in conjunction with cloud computing platforms can be used to undertake a planetary scale resource potential assessment. We analyzed 130 million km<sup>2</sup> of global land surface area by utilizing learnings from global samples containing 300 million buildings with 16 million km of roads. Using Google Earth Engine and a ML model we demarcated 1.2 million km<sup>2</sup> of the built-up area containing 0.2 million km<sup>2</sup> of rooftop area. As part of the assessment, we generated (1) a global rooftop area dataset (2) a global RTSPV potential dataset at a monthly temporal resolution, (3) costs of attaining the technical potential. The datasets were further used to generate high-resolution global maps of the potential and costs. We have also advanced the current state of art by combining the top-down and bottom-up approaches at a global scale to develop a hybrid framework for resource potential assessment which can also be used in advancing the assessment of global wind and bioenergy potentials. The assessment shows that a sizeable RTSPV potential of 27 PWh yr<sup>−1</sup> exists at a global level that can be attained for costs between 40 and 280 $ MWh<sup>−1</sup>. The potential is highest in Asia followed by North America and Europe. A capital investment of around 7 trillion dollars is required at current prices to achieve a global RTSPV based electricity generation of 10 PWh yr<sup>−1</sup> below the LCOE of 100 $ MWh<sup>−1</sup>, covering 3.72 billion people globally.</p><p id="Par32">At the EU-27 regional level, our estimated rooftop area of 7596.4 km<sup>2</sup> is similar to the 7935 km<sup>2</sup> calculated in the Bodis et al. study when incorporating a rooftop scaling factor of 0.3. For the USA, our estimated rooftop area and annual potential of 8827 km<sup>2</sup>/1.9 PWh yr<sup>−1</sup> compare well with the estimates of 8130 km<sup>2</sup>/1.4 PWh yr<sup>−1</sup> presented in the Gagnon et al. study when incorporating a rooftop scaling factor of 0.32. On a city level basis, our potential of 1 TWh yr<sup>−1</sup> is in alignment with the 1 TWh yr<sup>−1</sup> calculated in a study by Hong et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> where they have used advanced hillshade analysis to capture the effects of building induced shadows in a dense urban topography. A detailed global/regional/country and city level comparison of our results with selected research work is documented in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>. From the comparison with other studies, we can conclude that the results from our framework demonstrate high veracity as they are within the margin of error of values present in the literature. In addition, the good estimation accuracy of our framework at high spatial resolution feeds into higher accuracies at aggregated lower resolutions.</p><p id="Par33">Our assessment has important implications for addressing the twin challenges of sustainable development and climate change with co-benefits in advancing SDG 3 and SDG 7. First, the analysis of spatial RTSPV potential presented in this study shows that 55% of the global RSTPV potential is spread across low-density areas. This highlights an important aspect of solar transition, where the majority of its benefits in providing cost-effective and fast deployable electricity can be realized in rural areas. RTSPV can thus aid in mitigating the energy poverty being experienced in the less developed and sparsely populated areas in a country where extensive grid integration may be costly or where competition for land may exist. Nearly 20% of the global potential lies in the high-density areas where the deployment of RTSPV can aid in displacing fossil fuel-derived electricity with less polluting electricity generation thereby reducing local air pollution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Second, from a perspective of energy equality and “leaving no one behind” agenda of the SDG, the most disadvantaged areas with respect to access to electricity are currently the low-income countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> which require the rapid and cost-effective deployment of clean electricity generation infrastructure. Our assessment shows that low-income countries may need significant capital investments as steep upfront RTSPV installation costs in the order of magnitude 2–3 times their 2015 GDP value to achieve their country-specific potentials. At current costs, governments may need to provide subsidies and seek external investments to improve the prospects of deployment of RTSPV in these areas. This highlights the vital role that the developed economies may play in enabling the deployment of RTSPV in these countries by the means of financial flows to realize the climate change co-benefits. With maturing of the technology and the emergence of an economy of scale, costs will further go down to enable a solar revolution in these areas and aid in their low carbon energy future.</p><p id="Par34">Third, countries that are currently reaping their demographic dividends like India and China are better suited for rapid deployment of RTSPV. We showed that these countries have high potential with low seasonal potential variability along with the low cost of deployment. As these countries have the largest population share globally with large building stocks, they can be the first movers in decarbonizing their electricity generation infrastructure by substantially deploying a decentralized electricity generation portfolio, further aiding in climate change mitigation. Along with climate mitigation, RSTPV deployment in these countries can gain a lot from the high workforce percentage in the population in the form of cost-effective manufacturing and operational maintenance. Fourth, the high-resolution assessment can aid the local governments in identifying suitable locations for the rapid deployment of energy generation infrastructure. This way bottom-up formulation of energy policy can lead to inclusive designing of nationwide policies to provide energy justice to the citizens. Fifth, businesses and financial institutions like World Bank and International Monetary Fund can analyze in-depth the investment opportunities and risks in implementing RSTPV infrastructures leading to local job creation and sustainable development of manufacturing industries. Sixth, the information contained in the assessment along with supply cost curves is a measurable step forward and fills in a significant information gap that is present in current integrated assessment models where solar PV potentials are often represented as aggregated potentials for utility and rooftop installations. Our assessment provides insightful findings and technical potential datasets that will certainly aid in accurately modeling the future carbon-neutral scenarios to inform national energy policies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>. This will no doubt aid in exploring sustainable and inclusive low-carbon future possibilities.</p><p id="Par35">Our study shows pronounced variability of seasonal potentials in the higher latitudes for countries covering Europe, North America, and Australian regions. These regions have high electricity consumption per capita along with the financial capacity to introduce significant VRE in the electricity generation mix. To mitigate the variability of the potentials over the year, smart grids that optimize the generation portfolio and the introduction of regulator-driven mechanisms that balance the generation market becomes important. Further, the introduction of new market mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup> is needed to effectively integrate the prosumers and utility operators in competitive electricity generation markets. With falling prices of electricity storage technologies and smart management of interconnected grids, RSTPV technology will play a critical role in these markets by undertaking generation, storage, and system balancing roles.</p><p id="Par36">In conclusion, our assessment shows that the current electricity generation potential of RTSPV exceeds the current (2018) yearly aggregated global electricity demand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. Our assessment also shows that a minimum of 50% of the total global rooftop area is required to meet the yearly global aggregated electricity demand. Due to the diurnal cycles of solar insolation and to balance the seasonal and daily variability of the RTSPV generation, the role of storage solutions to compliment RTSPV electricity generation is critical in realizing the maximum potential of this technology and to meet the peak daily demand. Hence, the practical realizable potential of RTSPV will depend on the future cost trajectory of storage technologies, capital expenditure related to the technology, and the overall configuration of the energy system.</p><p id="Par37">Even with its limitations and shortcomings the current assessment is still the state of art and provides researchers with global analysis datasets. The underlying methods and datasets have been peer-reviewed and are of the highest quality currently available and represent a generation advancement over the datasets used in the current state of art methods. The current dataset can be improved by using a next-generation 10 m resolution landcover dataset and with an increase in the spatial resolution of the population and solar data at a global scale. Better data processing platforms can enable further work to be accomplished at a 1 km resolution providing a 100 times increase in the spatial representation of the potentials. In addition, inputs in the form of realistic regional variation in the rooftop availability will aid in narrowing down the uncertainty in potentials and cost and should be the next logical research step in model improvement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Top–down method</title><p id="Par38">We generated a total of 3,521,120 fishnets using the ArcGIS PRO desktop application for all the global landmass except for the continent of Antarctica.

Due to the sheer size of the data being processed, we found that multicore architectures and parallel computing frameworks developed in recent years can be of great use in designing and executing planetary-scale analysis with minimal cost and time requirements.</p><p id="Par45">We have used cloud computation in the form of the Google Earth Engine platform. In general, parallelization of the data processing was performed in four ways, first when disaggregating global raster datasets and mapping the aggregated values to our global FNs. We did this task for 12 monthly solar rasters, 1 Landcover raster, and finally for the global population raster. Here, we ran all the raster algebra and mapping codes on Google Earth Engine where the backend data processing was split into multi parallel streams and executed on google cloud infrastructure. This led to the speeding up of the data crunching as raster algebra is highly parallel in its execution where each raster cell can be worked on independently. Second, when disaggregating global vector datasets and mapping the aggregated values to our global FNs. As of the time of writing this article, Google Earth Engine was less efficient in undertaking vector analysis. The reason for this is that instead of pixel raster surface which can be computed in a parallel fashion, vector datasets need specialized algorithms. Here, we utilized the multi-core parallel processing architecture of ARCGIS Pro where vector datasets in the form of building footprints and roads can be effectively processed by splitting the map into different regions and processing each region on a single core. This task is performed in the backend using apache spark. Third, when doing data aggregation and manipulation inside desktop python environment. Large components of the data processing ranging from calculating rooftops to LCOE calculations were performed using the DASK framework. In this framework, data frames can be broken down into small chunks and processed in parallel. This provided us with a significant reduction in processing times. Fourth, when training ML model. Custom scripts were written on python to perform hyperparameter optimization and 10-fold cross-validation in a parallel fashion. Each of the 10-folds of the cross-validation was assigned to the independent core of our 12-core machine which led to faster convergence of the hyperparameters to an optimal solution.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Downscaling model</title><p id="Par46">The ML model was trained on PPLN<sub>FN</sub>, RL<sub>FN</sub>, BA<sub>FN</sub> as independent variables and BF<sub>FN</sub> as the dependent variable for each sample FN.

The roof-mounted solar PV is installed at the optimum angle for each latitude and is sun-facing and shade-free to generate maximum electricity output. The building rooftops are flat in design leading to the utilization of the entire rooftop for the installation of solar panels.</p><p id="Par50">Based on the assumptions i.e., 10 m<sup>2</sup> area for a 10% efficient panel, the technical solar potential is calculated for all the global FNs for 12 months using the following:<disp-formula id="Equ6"><label>6</label><alternatives><mml:math id="Equ6_Math"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">SP</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">FN</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">BF</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">E</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">FN</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">C</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">FN</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Day</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math><tex-math id="Equ6_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The World Bank’s solar conversion factors are available for regions between 60°N and 45°S. For regions beyond 60°N and 45°S, we assumed a constant conversion factor of 3.5 kWh/kWp/day. This has led to a slight over-assessment of the potential for countries like Sweden, Norway. However, as the density of built-up area reduces significantly beyond the 60°N and 45°S, the total global error due to this assumption remains small. The calculations for generating the solar potential are processed using custom python scripts using the DASK module to handle massive arithmetic operations. Further, the processed solar potential raster dataset is stored as a geopackage file for visualizations and economic calculation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Cost calculation</title><p id="Par51">LCOE provides an easy and robust method to compare the economic viability of a project within a specific FN.

While calculating the SP and LCOE, it was assumed that no rooftop solar PV installation exists globally, and all the additional capacities will start their commissioning from the year 2019.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par53">Our assessment is based on the accuracy of the global landcover layer, which with its 100 m resolution can in some locations overestimate the built-up area extents. In addition, the landcover classifies roads, parking lots, boundaries of green areas, tennis courts, and archeologically significant areas as built-up areas with misclassification varying between different regions. Our assumption that the rooftops being flat, shadow-free and sun-facing with a full rooftop available for installation adds to the methodological limitations. Next, the big data related to building footprints and global roads have inherent methodological limitations like the simplified representation of a complex rooftop with a square polygon, overlapping roads, etc.</p><p id="Par54">For technical potential calculations, we assumed that 100% of the estimated rooftop is available for installing solar panels i.e., orientation and slope of the building are not accounted for the 100% rooftop availability assumption-based results in our main analysis. These assumptions can lead to limitations in the real-world interpretation of main results as a fraction of rooftop may be available for the installation of solar panels. To account for this, we have documented regional change in potential as an uncertainty analysis for a combination of rooftop scaling factors and panel efficiencies. In the current literature, reduction of total rooftop area to available rooftop area is generally done through a rooftop scaling factor which is a proxy for loss of rooftop area due to orientation, slope, and roof superstructures like chimneys, etc. Although, some studies exist at the country level where the rooftop scaling factor is documented, on a global scale no authoritative dataset exists that can demarcate country-wise rooftop scaling factors. Further work is required to document the country-specific rooftop scaling factors which are outside the scope of the research aim of this study.</p><p id="Par55">Our cost assumptions cover 17 different countries across continents with average values for the rest of the countries. These assumptions can assign increased or decreased LCOE values to a certain region like Africa and South America. Another limitation of the cost assumptions is the inability of the LCOE metric to capture intra country variation of LCOE to a high degree due to lack of high-resolution cost data. Also, cost variability due to additional grid rollout, tariff mechanisms, and global change in prices due to trade protectionism practices are beyond the scope of the current assessment. Finally, we calculated all the cost and potential metrics assuming that no installed capacity exists for the ROI, where in the present time horizon, some installed capacity does exist.</p><p id="Par56">A majority of limitations can be attributed to the underlying data used in our assessment, which can be improved with subsequent advancement in the methodology of the data providers. Further research can be undertaken to reduce the methodological limitations that are currently bootstrapped by the data availability and lack of homogenous global data.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>S.J., B.O.G. and J.G. are supported by a research grant from Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under the SFI-NSFC Partnership Programme Grant Number 17/NSFC/5181.
