To achieve broadband enhancement, we apply, first, aluminum as a nanodisk material with moderate loss throughout the whole visible spectral range. Second, broadband light coupling is mediated by surface lattice resonances from a multipitch array built from two superimposed gratings with different grating constants formed by elliptic and circular nanodisks. To demonstrate the viability of this concept, the grating structure was embedded in the hole transport layer of a solution-processed phosphorescent WOLED exhibiting a current efficiency of 2.1 cd/A at 1000 cd/m<sup>2</sup>. The surface lattice resonances in the grating raise the current efficiency of the device by 23% to 2.6 cd/A at 1000 cd/m<sup>2</sup>, while the device emission changes from a neutral white to a warm white appearance with CIE1931 (x,y) coordinates of (0.361, 0.352) and (0.404, 0.351), respectively. The WOLED was characterized in detail optically by extinction and angle-resolved photoluminescence and as well by electroluminescence measurements for its opto-electronic characteristics. The experimental results agree well with finite-difference time domain simulations that aim at a better understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms. In summary, our work presents a novel versatile approach for achieving broadband enhancement of light emission in WOLEDs over a wide spectral range.</p></abstract><kwd-group

light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have emerged as a viable technology for display applications on the verge of capturing a majority share of the small display market [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. With thermally activated delayed fluorescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] as well as phosphorescent emitter systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] exhibiting high internal quantum efficiencies (IQE) of close to 100%, the foundation for the application of OLEDs in the lighting segment was laid. Here, the prospect of flexible and/or large area luminaries obtainable by low-cost roll-to-roll processes is intriguing. Presently, however, depending on the emission color relatively low external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of only 15–45% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] low lifetimes prove to be formidable stumbling blocks for OLEDs in the lighting market. With the attainable IQE already being close to unity, it is evident that to significantly improve the EQE one needs to tackle light trapping processes in the device, which are caused [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] by surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) at the organic-metal interface and guided optical- and substrate modes in the active device stack. Several concepts have been proposed to counter these loss mechanisms and hence to increase the amount of extracted light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The most straightforward solution to drastically reduce light trapping is to align the dipole emission with the direction normal to the OLED plane. Even though this solution would be generally preferable, the mechanism behind obtaining dipole orientation is not clearly understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and successful demonstrations are so far limited to monochromatic OLEDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] containing only one emitter. Here, we exclude molecular engineering and concentrate on schemes that rely on the modification of the device stack to extract light more efficiently. Corresponding approaches include Bragg gratings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], integrated 2D photonic crystals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], internal scattering layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], micro-lens arrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], high refractive index glass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and specific substrate surface patterning techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], to only name a few.</p><p id="Par3">Another outcoupling scheme relies on regular arrays of plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs). The regular 2D particle arrangement gives rise to diffraction in specific directions, as commonly exploited with light from an external source incident onto a (1D or 2D) grating. For arrays formed by plasmonic NPs, the light fields of grating orders diffracted along the array plane can strongly couple to the localized plasmon resonances (LSPRs) of the NPs. Thereby, hybrid light/plasmon modes form, so-called surface lattice resonances (SLRs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] that signify particularly strong light/matter interaction and that can lead to spectral modifications and a strong near field enhancement, as compared to an irregular NP array [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. When a regular array of plasmonic NPs is embedded in a light-generating layer, the outcoupling of light is facilitated by grating diffraction (by design, preferably in the direction normal to the OLED layers) for a range of wavelengths that is determined by the NP distance, i.e., the particle grating pitch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In addition, upon direct interaction with the light-generating entities, the resonantly enhanced plasmonic near fields can significantly alter their emission properties in terms of excited state lifetime, emission profile and (for intrinsically poor emitters) IQE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">The proof-of-principle of NP array modified emission was demonstrated for photoluminescence (PL) from a single emissive layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It should be noted that earlier work already showed plasmon-mediated outcoupling enhancement from an OLED, however, for a modulated metal surface without LSPRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], emission modifications from a single-emitter OLED were reported. A recent approach embedded a plasmonic NP array within an organic light-emitting field effect transistors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], resulting in substantially enhanced emitted light intensities. Typically, silver or gold NPs are used for their rather low damping, but recently aluminum (Al) was also found to show surprisingly good plasmonic properties in the spectral UV-to-NIR range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Combined with its self-passivating properties and abundant nature, Al is a particularly intriguing candidate as the base material for SLR-supporting plasmonic arrays suitable for enhanced broadband light generation and extraction. While Al NP arrays have indeed been extensively studied to enhance the efficiency of color converting layers for inorganic light-emitting diodes (LEDs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], we have recently shown that Al NP arrays enable to tune the emission color [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and to enhance the performance of blue-emitting phosphorescent OLEDs by 35% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Extending this concept to be applicable for white-light-emitting OLEDs (WOLEDs) would be a welcome addition for designers of luminaires to enhance device efficiencies, while at the same time benefiting from fine-color adjustments. Obviously, a major hurdle originates from the fact that these SLRs are usually only active for one spectral band (red, green or blue), which makes it difficult to exploit for broadband enhancement across the entire spectral range of a WOLED stretching from blue to red.</p><p id="Par5">To mitigate that issue, we here propose a new approach by designing and implementing a structure addressing multiple spectral bands, consisting of a multipitched array formed by two superimposed particle gratings that are built from differently shaped disk-shaped NPs. One grating comprises elliptic nanodisks (NDs), while the other is built from circular NDs. Compared to, e.g., line-gratings, this provides the benefit of individual spectral tuning of the plasmonic resonances by means of ND shape and grating pitch and thereby to obtain optimal enhancement in the relevant spectral regions. At the same time, ND gratings can be fully embedded into the solution-processed hole transport layer (HTL) of the WOLED, minimizing obstruction of the device performance. Through angle-resolved PL and electroluminescence (EL) spectroscopy, we demonstrate clearly that the SLRs induced by the superimposed gratings truly cover the relevant parts of the luminosity function for a human observer from 480 to 620 nm and indeed enhance the current efficiency of the WOLED. The presented device-related work is supported by detailed measurements using optical spectroscopy and finite-difference time domain (FDTD) simulations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Experimental section/methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials and WOLED preparation</title><p id="Par6">Copper (I) thiocyanate (CuSCN), diethyl sulfide (&lt;99%) (DES), tetrahydrofuran (&lt;99.9% HPLC) dichloromethane (&lt;99.9% HPLC) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

The ITO substrates were treated in ultrasonic baths of 2 vol% Hellmanex III for 20 min at a temperature of 50 °C. The substrates were then carefully rinsed with deionized water after which another 10 min of ultrasonication in acetone and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) followed. The cleaning was completed by a final IPA rinsing and nitrogen dry-blowing step. A 100 nm thick layer of PMMA was spin coated followed by a bake-out at 180 °C for 5 min. The sample was subsequently transferred into a RAITH e-line plus electron beam lithography (EBL) system, and the whole structure consisting of two superimposed rectangular ND gratings was exposed to the resist. After developing the sample, a 20 nm thick layer of aluminum was thermally evaporated, followed by a lift-off step using acetone. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were recorded in the EBL system using the in-lens secondary electron detector. The ITO substrates with the superimposed Al gratings were rinsed with acetone and IPA before subjecting them to an ultrasonication treatment for 10 min.

Ellipsometry measurements were carried out on films made by spin-coating the EML and evaporating 45 nm of the ETL on cleaned Si wafers nominally without native oxide (however, the modeling had to include a thin silicon oxide layer with 2 nm thickness). The optical properties and the thickness of the films were derived by means of variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE, J. A. Woollam Co., Inc).

The symmetry of the rectangular array pattern allowed for a reduction in simulation volume. The respective thicknesses of the individual layers of the WOLED stack (as input values for the simulations) were known with an error of ±2 nm, as after full PL/EL characterization the devices were disassembled in a layer-by-layer fashion for measuring layer thicknesses by AFM.

We note that this is a flexible but rather slow method; however, the involved structure dimensions could as well be achieved with scalable techniques as nanoimprinting. The requirements for the grating design were to include three different ND LSPRs for effective coupling to the molecules, and to provide distinct SLRs for every emission wavelength. This was achieved by using two different ND shapes. First, a circular ND (diameter 80 nm, height 20 nm) with a plasmon resonance in the blue wavelength range and, second, an elliptically shaped ND with different resonances along the long (140 nm) and short (70 nm) axis, again with a height of 20 nm.

Accordingly, the chosen grating pitches lead to SLRs around wavelengths of 476, 527 and 620 nm, corresponding to the three emitters. Most importantly, in the spectra we observe broadband extinction over the whole visible spectral range with various specific features at the designed energies that in turn are expected to couple light out of the WOLED. Concerning the detailed interpretation of these features we have, however, to emphasize two points. First, while the grating geometry was designed for operation in the WOLED, we first analyzed its optical response (as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) following fabrication on bare ITO, i.e., before the addition of the further WOLED layers.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Measured extinction spectra of a superimposed ND broadband grating with dimensions as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b for unpolarized, <italic>x</italic>-polarized and <italic>y</italic>-polarized light.

Second, spectrally close SLR and LSPR features can hybridize, i.e., interact in terms of energetic repulsion, leading to peak anticrossing and complicating their spectral signatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Nevertheless, we briefly discuss the main features in the spectra in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, beginning with the <italic>x</italic>-polarized case. This excitation condition leads to LSPRs that basically resemble dipoles oriented in <italic>x</italic>-direction. Their main emission is thus in <italic>y</italic>-direction, making the grating pitches in <italic>y</italic> (together with the ND dimensions in <italic>x</italic>) the relevant parameters. The peak around 420 nm that is far from the expected SLR positions can be assigned to the circular ND LSPR, while the long axis elliptical LSPR is evidenced by the prominent peak at 620 nm. The features around 550 nm are due to the long wavelength SLR, while the strong peak around 460 nm is most likely due to a higher order SLR introducing polarization crosstalk, a fact that deserves further investigation. For <italic>y</italic>-polarized light, we find an intense peak around 420 nm due to both LSPRs of the circular ND and the short axis elliptical ND. Around 450 nm, a SLR signature dominates the spectrum. For unpolarized illumination, we find the expected superposition of the two spectra taken with polarized light, further illustrating the broadband character of the grating.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Implementation of the multipitched Al ND grating in the WOLED stack</title><p id="Par19">As a first step toward assessing the performance of the fabricated embedded Al ND array in the WOLED stack, it needs to be verified that the array does not introduce additional leakage current through the formation of shunts, thus hampering current efficiency. Generally, a ND height of 20 nm must be considered a relevant distortion for the overall 160 nm thickness of the organic layers of the WOLED stack.

Starting the discussion with the current density characteristics (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a), a clear drop in current density compared to the unstructured reference device is observed at similar applied bias voltages. At the emission onset (4.7 V), the current density is only 45% of the reference device. Increasing the bias toward 16.8 V, the difference reduces to 31% at a bias of 16.8 V and it vanishes for a bias larger than 20 V. This severe difference is attributed to the 18% coverage of ITO with the Al NDs, which reduces the device current due to significantly obstructed hole injection into the device because of the formation of. ca. 3-nm-thick native aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) on the ND surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Given current experimental limitations in device fabrication, which include an unavoidable transfer of the sample in air, we unfortunately cannot remove the oxide or avoid the oxide formation. Remarkably, in an earlier report we found almost no deviation in the carrier injection behavior at a total coverage of 12.6% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], while here at 18% coverage less than half the current density is observable. While at first glance this might be considered unsatisfactory, in the present study the focus was on investigating the superimposed Al ND array and we are confident that optimization of the device fabrication process using an additional reactive ion etching process and interlayer deposition processes within an inert cluster tool to avoid the formation of an Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> interlayer in a next step will eliminate the observed injection barriers. Moreover, in reverse bias direction we observe a drastic increase in the leakage current by almost three orders of magnitude as compared to the device without the Al ND array. This is attributed to the additional corrugation introduced into the device stack due to the Al ND array and the fact that the utilized CuSCN HTL can help to only smoothen the corrugation by a limited amount.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Device characteristics for a WOLED with embedded Al ND array (red symbols) and a reference device (black symbols). <bold>a</bold> Current density- and <bold>b</bold> luminance versus applied bias voltage, <bold>c</bold> current efficiency versus luminance and <bold>d</bold> normalized EL emission spectra.

The reduced overall luminance is a clear consequence of a deteriorated hole injection. Even though the overall luminance is reduced in devices with the Al ND array, the corresponding current efficiency (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b) increases from 2.1 cd/A (for the device without the Al ND array) to 2.6 cd/A (22.8%), as perceived at 1000 cd m<sup>−2</sup>. As already mentioned, the introduction of the Al ND array leads to a shift of the most dominant emission band (from the blue emission band with a maximum of 471 nm to the red emission band with a maximum at 621 nm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d) in the spectral power distribution. In accordance, this causes a shift of the CIE1931 (x,y) coordinates from (0.361, 0.352) to (0.404, 0.351) and a shift of the correlated color temperature from 4434 to 3153 K, which results in a change from a neutral white to a warm white appearance of the device emission.</p><p id="Par24">Still, changes of the EL spectra of the reference and grating device and their respective overlap with the luminosity function may also affect the values of photometric units. However, normalizing both EL spectra to a radiant flux of 1 W shows that this would correspond with a luminous flux of 250.8 lm in case of the reference device and 245.1 lm in case of the device with the grating structure. This slightly lower value of the luminous flux in case of the device with the grating structure is due to the lower sensitivity of the human eye in the red wavelength range, which is enhanced for this device. Therefore, one can conclude that this gain in current efficiency originates from enhanced generation and outcoupling of light. The somewhat lower value for the luminous flux in case of the grating device with the grating structure shows, that this enhancement of light generation and outcoupling is even slightly larger than 22.8% as it is expressed on the base of the above-mentioned enhancement of the overall current efficiency.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Optical characterization and simulation of the grating WOLED</title><p id="Par25">We now turn to the optical extinction measurement and FDTD simulation of the grating embedded in the WOLED stack.

Still worth discussing is the broad enhancement in the low energy part of the spectrum below 600 nm. For this, it is required to keep in mind that in a WOLED host/guest system with three different molecular emitters, the generation of white light has to rely on the fact that at some point the red emitter, which has the lowest optical bandgap in the system, will saturate because of the high lifetime of phosphorescent emitters. Even though the near field enhancement provided by the LSPR is usually not as high within the EML as the one provided by the SLR, the chosen thickness is low enough to still generate a significant enhancement within the EML. This enhancement could lead to a decrease in the excited state lifetime and thus, a shift of the saturation point toward a higher voltage.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Angular dependence of emission</title><p id="Par28">So far, we have shown that the efficiency of a WOLED can be effectively enhanced by a multipitched ND grating.

We showed that embedding the superimposed grating within a layer of CuSCN effectively planarizes the surface which minimizes the risks of electrical shorts and shunt pathways and thereby leakage current and device failure. Embedding an Al ND array within a WOLED led to a current efficiency of the device enhanced by 23% even though the grating impaired the injection of holes. Through FDTD simulations, we achieved good agreement with the experimental measurements. The enhancement obtained in PL as well as in EL was found to correlate with the calculated field enhancement at the spectral positions of the SLRs. Angle-resolved PL and EL measurements yielded a good correlation between the calculated dispersion and the measured enhancement, thus confirming a coupling between the Al ND array and guided light modes in the WOLED stack. Our study validates the approach of using multipitched plasmonic particle gratings for broadband enhancement in WOLEDs. Further optimization of the grating geometry (lattice constants, particle sizes, total surface coverage) as well as by choosing hole transport layers with a higher in-plane conductivity will allow for eliminating the observed injection barriers and thereby unlock the full potential of the provided concept.</p><p id="Par32">Although not focused on in this study, it should be mentioned that our approach, besides efficiency enhancement, may also lay the foundation for a new strategy to enhance the white light quality of WOLEDs in the field of lighting.

This approach, which to some extend also applies for only two, concerted, wavelengths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] subsequently, was used for the development of compact fluorescent lamps with high color rendering indexes. Future approaches for WOLED-based lighting devices may also benefit from these relationships and the use of two and more particle gratings. This could be done by an appropriate choice of the emitter materials in combination with the design of the shapes and sizes of the individual grating elements, so that light extraction becomes enhanced in concerted wavelength ranges that also support large color rendering index values. Although the latter, in principle, also could be achieved by an appropriate choice of the emission wavelengths of the emitter materials by its own, the combination with nanostructured gratings will allow to tune and enhance both, extraction efficacies and color rendering indices.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) and the Austrian Climate and Energy Funds for funding this work under the project “PlasmOLED” (841148).
