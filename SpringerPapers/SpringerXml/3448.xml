Arguably, policy makers have very important roles in governing transitions in any given society through established institutional frameworks. It has also been argued that energy infrastructure choices are determined by institutional dynamics and structures. However, what are the underlying influences required to change energy systems and what lessons can we draw from them for the governance of energy transition? This study focuses on understanding the dynamics of energy transition governance in the Nigerian electricity sector with the aim of drawing lessons that impact on energy transition and energy systems change.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Using explorative research tools, this study investigates the dynamics of energy transition governance in the Nigerian electricity sector with the aim of drawing lessons that impact on energy transition and energy systems change.

These are: (1) Changing perceptions and goals (during the period leading up to Nigeria’s independence, 1890–1960s); (2) Direct government interventions in energy infrastructure provisions (1940s–1970s); and (3) Major changes in market rules (from 2005 and beyond).</p></sec><sec id="ASec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">The study concludes by highlighting that: (1) there is a need for government institutions to tackle energy access issues that address the needs of the poor; (2) it is imperative to explore technological options that are more sustainable; and (3) there is a need to address energy consumption patterns that are more energy intensive. Indeed, available energy resources, technological changes in electricity supply systems, and the ‘geographies of energy’ are major factors that influence energy production and consumption dynamics. All of them needs should be considered, as energy decisions are primarily political choices.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Energy systems</kwd><kwd>Fossil fuels</kwd><kwd>Nigeria</kwd><kwd>Renewables</kwd><kwd>Sustainable energy</kwd><kwd>Sustainability</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>40</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>10</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>27</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-collection-editor</meta-name><meta-value>Philipp Späth, Dagmar Fiedler</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/13705_2021_Article_317.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Renewable and Green Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Sustainable Development</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy Policy, Economics and Management</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par15">Energy systems can be very complex, entangled with multiple interconnected issues that require both urgent and simultaneous solutions that may lead to unprecedented energy transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].

Providing access to modern energy, improving the security of energy supply and reducing the effect of energy systems on climate are three important global energy challenges with implications on national and global energy governance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].

This paper explores the energy governance dynamics in the Nigerian electricity sector while drawing out lessons on some of the impacts of the various governance dynamics.</p><p id="Par17">Nigeria has been chosen for this study because of its vital role as a major energy provider, as well as its energy poverty challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. About ninety million people, amounting to about 45% of Nigerians, have no access to electricity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The Nigerian electricity sector has undergone serial changes over time to address some of the inherent challenges, including the partial liberalization of the electricity market. However, some of the problems still persist. In what ways do historical decisions impact on energy transition? What lessons can we draw for future energy governance in the electricity sector in Nigeria and other developing countries with similar trajectories? Addressing these questions within the Nigerian context can provide some generalizable learning that can be used for understanding some historical factors that have shaped the electricity systems in developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">In “Research context” Section, some background is presented that contextualizes the study. “Materials and methods” Section presents some brief methodological considerations.

The increased demand for electricity beyond lighting applications led to the expansion of existing plants and the provision of new ones as shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The need to power the workshops of the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) for the maintenance of locomotives triggered the next wave of power plant expansion. In the Plateau region of Nigeria, the need to provide electricity to support mining activities for Tin was another motivation for provision of electricity infrastructure in that region. The topography of the region (being a high plateau) supported the provision of the first hydropower plant in Nigeria. Indeed, lighting, powering of NRC workshops, supporting the Tin mines and powering government offices and government settlements were key motives for the provision of electricity infrastructure in pre-independent Nigeria.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Summary of electricity infrastructure provision in colonial Nigeria (</p><p>Source: Author compilation)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>s/n</p></th><th align="left"><p>Power station/supply</p></th><th align="left"><p>Year</p></th><th align="left"><p>Capacity</p></th><th align="left"><p>Fuel type</p></th><th align="left"><p>Technology type</p></th><th align="left"><p>Main application</p></th><th align="left"><p>End-user group</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>1</p></td><td align="left"><p>Lagos Marina Station</p></td><td align="left"><p>1896–1920</p></td><td align="left"><p>30KW which grew to 420KW</p></td><td align="left"><p>Diesel</p></td><td align="left"><p>Steam engines</p></td><td align="left"><p>Lighting application</p></td><td align="left"><p>Mainly Europeans</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>2</p></td><td align="left"><p>Iddo Power Station</p></td><td align="left"><p>1923</p></td><td align="left"><p>3.6 MW which grew to 13.75 MW</p></td><td align="left"><p>Coal</p></td><td align="left"><p>Coal-fired steam engines</p></td><td align="left"><p>Lighting and Railway workshops</p></td><td align="left"><p>Mainly Europeans</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>3</p></td><td align="left"><p>Plateau Electricity Supply (owned by the Nigeria Electricity Supply Company—NESCO—a British company</p></td><td align="left"><p>1922–1945</p></td><td align="left"><p>2 MW which grew to 12 MW (with peak load at installed capacity of 18.4 MW)</p></td><td align="left"><p>Hydro</p></td><td align="left"><p>Hydro-electric plant</p></td><td align="left"><p>Lighting applications and mining industry</p></td><td align="left"><p>European settlements and Tin mines</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>4</p></td><td align="left"><p>Enugu Electricity Supply</p></td><td align="left"><p>1922–1953</p></td><td align="left"><p>3 X 350KW plant which grew to 3000KW by 1953</p></td><td align="left"><p>Diesel</p></td><td align="left"><p>Steam engine plants</p></td><td align="left"><p>Lighting and industry</p></td><td align="left"><p>Nigerian Eastern Railway (NER) workshops, European settlements, Church, and Barack</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>5</p></td><td align="left"><p>Nigerian Railway Plant Port-Harcourt</p></td><td align="left"><p>1928</p></td><td align="left"><p>2250KW that grew up to 8530KW</p></td><td align="left"><p>Diesel</p></td><td align="left"><p>Steam engines</p></td><td align="left"><p>Industrial application (transport)</p></td><td align="left"><p>Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) workshops</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>6</p></td><td align="left"><p>Kaduna Northern Province Head Quarters</p></td><td align="left"><p>1929</p></td><td align="left"><p>8.28 MW installed capacity</p></td><td align="left"><p>Diesel</p></td><td align="left"><p>Steam engines</p></td><td align="left"><p>Lighting, residential and administrative uses</p></td><td align="left"><p>Government offices and residential areas</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par55">The fuel source for the power plants also constituted a vital part of electricity infrastructure decisions.

The study revealed that the dominant technology for most power plants that were deployed in Nigeria between 1890 and 1940 were steam engine technologies that were either diesel-fired of coal-fired power plants. The only exception was the hydropower plant built in the plateau region due to the advantages presented by the topography of the region. Indeed, the study demonstrated that there was a case of technological lock-in to the use of steam engine technologies that was interrupted (and completely halted) by the Second World War since at that time it became impossible to get maintenance spares for the plants owing to the war.</p><p id="Par57">Some other power stations that operated on stream are listed in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, along with their capacity, location and institution responsible for its provision.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Direct government interventions (1940s–1970s)</title><p id="Par58">The study reveals that government intervention in the provision of electricity infrastructure was evident through the establishment of institutions that were given the mandate to address a specific challenge that served as a barrier to the diffusion, spread and expansion of a new and existing electricity infrastructure catering to the growing energy needs.

This intervention led to the establishment of several industries in different parts of the country starting from the early 1950s. Indeed, by 1970, there were more than 2000 industries scattered around different industrial estates in Nigeria. The NGEU, which was set up as a holding company, eventually morphed into a new corporation in the 1950s called the Electricity Corporation of Nigeria.</p><p id="Par60">The Electricity Corporation of Nigeria (ECN) was the second major institutional intervention set up by the Nigerian government with a mandate of seeking ways of providing the cheapest form of energy that is consistent with continuity of supply. The ECN was established on the 6<sup>th</sup> of July 1950 but only took over from the NGEU on the 1st of April 1951. The ECN continued with their established mandate. However, frequent cases of fire outbreaks owing to electrical faults necessitated an intervention by the Nigerian government to further extend the mandate given to the ECN (in the 1960s) to include developing standards for electrical equipment and devices to help curtail the frequent fire incidences.</p><p id="Par61">The study further revealed that in the 1960s, government interventions on electricity infrastructure provision led to the establishment of the Niger Dams Authority (NDA) with a clear mandate of developing Nigeria’s hydropower potential. This intervention led to the planning and provision of several large dams in Nigeria, particularly Kainji, Jebba and Shiroro dams.</p><p id="Par62">The need to have a coordinated system where one central institution of government can take charge and responsibility for everything that has to do with electricity infrastructure in Nigeria led to the establishment of the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) in the 1970s. NEPA came about as the result of a merger of the Niger Dams Authority and the Electricity Corporation of Nigeria.</p><p id="Par63">Indeed, the study further revealed that there were other interventions that were mainly private interests.

This process started in 2001 with the introduction of the National Electric Power Policy (NEPP) which paved the way for the production of the National Energy Policy (NEP) framework in 2003. The NEP framework provided a basis for the preparation and enactment of the Electrical Power Sector Reforms Act (EPSRA) in 2005. The EPSRA act provided the legal/regulatory backing that aided the liberalization process of the Nigerian electricity sector. This act paved the way for the establishment of the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN), a holding company that was eventually unbundled to eighteen companies comprising six generation companies, one transmission company and eleven distribution companies.</p><p id="Par67">The study indicated that the liberalization of the Nigerian electricity market also opened up other opportunities for Nigeria by providing a platform for the establishment of some important agencies of the government or some regulations to address specific challenges within the Nigerian power sector. An example is the formation of the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) saddled with the responsibility of regulating the activities of various players within the Nigerian electricity sector. The Renewable Energy Policy Guideline (REPG) and the Renewable Action Program (REAP) were instrumental for initiating the large-scale deployment of solar home systems and off-grid solutions. The national biofuels policy formulated in 2007 assisted the formulation of a national guideline for the use of biofuels. Indeed, these various changes in market rules were instrumental in the liberalization of the Nigerian electricity market which paved the way for the inclusion of cleaner on-grid and off-grid energy sources to Nigeria’s energy mix.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par68">Following the findings from this study, four important lessons can be drawn from the Nigerian case for the understanding of energy transition processes in developing African countries.

We noticed similar trajectories of policy and institutional interventions (as in Nigeria) in Ghana that led to the initial provision of diesel-fired generators, hydro power plants and later large gas-fired thermal power plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. These interventions were driven by both endogenous and exogenous factors such as increased residential energy demand, energy for industrialization and commerce, and later, climate change agreements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].</p><p id="Par74">Another important factor in the policy environment that impacted on the electricity infrastructure interventions in Nigeria was an industrial policy (from the 1940s) aimed at providing the electricity infrastructure to aid industrialization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. This greatly shaped electricity planning that led to increased coal –fired power plants in the 1940s, and later the building of hydro-power plants from the 1950s. The provision of thermal power plants and (more recently) the scaling up of decentralized renewables as a way to address energy access issues and to support small businesses are also results of policy interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].

The fact that energy infrastructure provision has enabled some everyday practices to be performed in a manner that helps to satisfy the need for greater levels of comfort, cleanliness and convenience has also increased the public value for energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Indeed, energy is that net currency that enables the actualization and entrenchment of new and existing practices becoming more energy intensive.</p><p id="Par77">Available energy resource options have played (and will continue to play) a dominant role in energy choices and energy system changes.

Prior to 1960, many infrastructure decisions were aligned to the interest of the colonial governments. Between 1966 and 2000, Nigeria was under (the most part of the period) a military rule. Most decisions were results of military edicts with minimal stakeholder consultation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This meant that a lot of the infrastructure provided during this era was simply aligned to the interest of the military regime. From the 2000s, with the advent of a democratic rule, there was a gradual transition to infrastructure decision making that had a pattern of inclusiveness that was aligned to the interests of policy makers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p id="Par79">A major limitation of this study is the sole dependence on archival records for data collection and analysis.

Indeed, interviewing stakeholders who were involved in historical electricity infrastructure decisions prior to Nigeria’s independence (in 1960) would have provided more insights in the transition factors (such as contextual factors and future expectations) that led to certain transition outcomes in the forms of changes in energy systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par80">To conclude, there are three takeaways from this study that are of utmost importance. First, there is a need for government institutions to tackle energy access issues that addresses the needs of the poor; Secondly, it is imperative to explore technological options that are more sustainable; and thirdly, there is a need to address energy consumption patterns that are more energy intensive. Indeed, available energy resources, technological changes in electricity supply systems, and the ‘geographies of energy’ are major factors that influence energy production and consumption dynamics. All of them needs to be considered as energy decisions are primarily political choices.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The author expresses their profound gratitude to the Nigerian Railway Corporation for permission to access their archives used in this research.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>This work is solely authored by the corresponding author.
