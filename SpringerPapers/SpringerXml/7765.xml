However, ultralong RTP (URTP) with high efficiency is still rarely achieved. Herein, by dissolving 1,8-naphthalic anhydride in certain organic solid hosts, URTP with a lifetime of over 600 ms and overall quantum yield of over 20% is realized. Meanwhile, the URTP can also be achieved by mechanical excitation when the host is mechanoluminescent. Femtosecond transient absorption studies reveal that intersystem crossing of the host is accelerated substantially in the presence of a trace amount of 1,8-naphthalic anhydride. Accordingly, we propose that a cluster exciton spanning the host and guest forms as a transient state before the guest acts as an energy trap for the RTP state. The cluster exciton model proposed here is expected to help expand the varieties of purely organic URTP materials based on an advanced understanding of guest/host combinations.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Purely organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (URTP) attracts attention but high efficiencies are rarely achieved.

The quenching propensity of triplet excitons at room temperature, however, tends to make organic phosphorescence only available under cryogenic temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, which inevitably hinders practical applications. To achieve more useful room temperature phosphorescence (RTP), a routine method is to incorporate noble metals such as Ir, Pt, and Ru to form organometallic complexes, which yet face issues such as cost, toxicity, and instability against moisture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In comparison, purely organic RTP materials without metals are promising in tackling such problems and thus have attracted particular attentions over the past decade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Promoting the intrinsically spin-forbidden intersystem crossing (ISC) is fundamental to realize efficient purely organic RTP. The most common strategy is to introduce functional groups that can facilitate spin-orbit coupling (SOC), such as carbonyl, heteroatoms (O, N, P, etc.) and halogens (Br and I). However, these moieties tend to increase rates of S<sub>n</sub>–T<sub>n</sub> and T<sub>n</sub>–S<sub>0</sub> electronic transitions simultaneously. As such, an inherent dilemma exists that increasing RTP efficiency always leads to decreased RTP lifetime. So far, efficient purely organic RTP with a lifetime longer than 500 ms is still rare<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. This situation may not meet the demand for RTP with both high efficiency and ultralong lifetime in many application fields, such as anti-counterfeiting, novel digital display and time-resolved bioimaging.</p><p id="Par4">To pursue efficient purely organic RTP with ultralong lifetimes, one may be inspired by nature. Nature is abundant in inorganic materials such as luminous pearls and glow-in the dark stones whose noticeable afterglow can last for hours or even longer. Though the precise mechanism of the afterglow in these materials remains ambiguous, it is generally accepted that impurity is responsible and three steps may be involved: (1) excitation of the guest species (impurity), (2) trapping of the excited electrons by defects in host lattices, (3) slow charge recombination of the trapped electrons by thermal energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Mimicking this guest/host architecture of minerals, purely organic afterglow lasting for more than one hour has been realized recently via doping one electron-donating guest in an electron-withdrawing host<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. However, the ultralong organic luminescence based on charge separated state may lack versatility. Therefore, we tend to realize and expand the scope of efficient ultralong luminescence based on a more precise and versatile mechanism of molecular phosphorescence, i.e., URTP emitted from triplet excited state, in organic guest/host system.</p><p id="Par5">Purely organic RTP based on guest/host architecture has been reported using co-crystallization or other methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, whereas almost all reported cases still rely on conventional wisdom of external or internal heavy atom effect from being in close proximity to Br or I<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. On the one hand, these species are usually unstable due to photo-homolysis propensity of C–Br and C–I bonds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. On the other hand, they tend to have lifetimes &lt;100 ms due to accelerated T<sub>n</sub>–S<sub>0</sub> transitions. Most importantly, it is generally considered that the guest undergoes the excitation and emission processes, while the host only plays passive roles such as diluting and rigidifying the guest to suppress the non-radiative decay. So far, no investigation has been carried out on detailed photophysics, especially electronic transition processes concerning the host species. Inspired by inorganic afterglow materials, where both host and guest play active roles in electronic transitions, we reason that certain organic counterparts must exhibit similar traits in the solid-state guest/host systems. However, suitable characterization methods must be implemented to study how organic host and guest interact in the excited states. Therefore, in this study we set out to answer the following questions in organic guest/host systems: (1) Are host and guest molecules acting individually or synergistically in the photo-excited electronic transitions? (2) Are there any transient species formed upon photo-excitation? It remains challenging to find the answers by routine characterizations, such as steady-state emission, excitation, and absorption spectroscopies, which limit the understanding and development for more RTP systems. Herein, in short, we aim to obtain efficient purely organic URTP by guest/host strategy, drawing inspiration from inorganic afterglow materials. Meanwhile, we hope to shed light on RTP photophysics in the solid state by means of ultrafast spectroscopy to show the multiple roles the host molecules play.</p><p id="Par6">To study the model systems, commercially available and scalable molecules are given a high priority. In addition, compounds containing photolabile bond, such as C–Br or C–I are excluded<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Finally, to avoid quenching from photo-induced electron transfer, all guest and host molecules used in the study are electron-deficient. As a proof of concept (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), pentachloropyridine (PCP), phthalic anhydride (PA), and 1,2-dicyanobenzene (DCB) are selected as the host species, respectively, while 1,8-naphthalic anhydride (NA) is selected as the guest due to its more red-shifted absorption. We show that after preparation of the solid-state solution, efficient purely organic RTP with ultralong lifetimes is achieved. Most importantly, fs-TA studies reveal that: (1) host and guest molecules play active roles synergistically in the photo-excited electronic transition processes; (2) cluster excitons spanning both guest and host molecules form as transient species before the localized triplet excited state of the guest acts as an energy trap to emit the URTP. In the sense that host and guest species both play active roles in the photophysics, we are able to show that mechanistically similar RTP, vs. inorganic afterglow, exists in purely organic systems. Furthermore, when host molecules are mechanoluminescence (ML)-active, we show that the tested guest/host systems exhibit an extra feature of ML, which ultimately induces notable URTP with almost identical spectroscopic signatures to the UV-excited URTP. In general, combined advantages including simplicity, stability, low cost, scalability, multiple excitation sources, and excellent performances, along with mechanistic insights revealed by ultrafast spectroscopy of current guest/host URTP system are expected to attract wide attentions from both material and scientific communities.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Design of the guest/host system. <bold>a</bold> Schematic illustration of the guest/host system, i.e., solid-state solutions where guest is the solute and host is the solvent, showing UV/mechano-excited ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (URTP).

The shoulder peaks are apparent at both the fluorescence and phosphorescence bands presumably due to vibrations of aromatic skeletons in PCP molecules. The delayed PL spectrum (Δt = 50 ms) filters out of the fluorescence band around 350 nm and is almost identical with the band centered at 510 nm with vibrational peaks in the steady-state spectrum, further verifying the phosphorescence nature of the green afterglow. At 77 K (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>), PCP crystals exhibited blue-shifted phosphorescence (Max <italic>λ</italic><sub>em</sub> = 440 nm) which is likely due to reduced thermal relaxation from higher energy levels of triplet excited states.

When PCP crystals were crushed with mechanical force, persistent green luminescence with a duration of ~1 s was observed without UV excitation.

The ML spectrum of PCP almost superimposes with that of PL except for its less obvious vibrational structures at the fluorescence band around 350 nm. When turned into fine powders after repeated crushing, PCP hardly exhibits ML after being subjected to further mechanical forces. The XRD data of the PCP powder (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">23</xref>) show extra peaks than do those of the PCP single crystals, indicating that the PCP powders are crystals with much smaller sizes rather than amorphous.

Though the blue emission of the DCB crystals was also weak to naked eyes under UV irradiation at room temperature, the overall quantum yield of the DCB crystals was as high as 19.3%. Steady-state PL spectrum revealed that the major emission peak of the DCB crystals was in the UV region, centering at 335 nm (<italic>τ</italic> = 8.0 ns), and only very weak tail was present beyond 400 nm. After UV irradiation ceased, very faint yellow–green afterglow lasting for ~3 s was observed. Correspondingly, the delayed PL spectrum was centered at 550 nm with a lifetime of 163 ms. The RTP of the DCB crystals was so weak compared to its fluorescence that the phosphorescence peak could not be noticed in the steady-state PL spectrum.

Instead, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, an intense off-white emission was observed and a strong yellow afterglow lasting for ~5 s was noticed after the UV irradiation had ceased. The steady-state PL spectrum of NA/PCP shows two main bands centered at 400 nm and 540 nm, respectively. The emission of pure PCP crystals at 350, 478, and 510 nm is still present in the spectrum of NA/PCP, most likely due to the uneven distribution of NA in PCP. Similarly, emission at 440 nm was mainly ascribed to fluorescence of the undissolved NA crystals in the blend. The newly emerged band centered at 400 nm with shoulder peaks at 356, 376 and 418 nm and the more intense one centered at 540 nm with shoulders at 585 and 636 nm were ascribed to species well dispersed at the molecular level, i.e., NA/PCP solid solution where NA is the solute (guest) and PCP is the solvent (host). The lifetimes at 400 and 540 nm were measured to be 2.2 ns and 363 ms (decay curves are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>), indicating their fluorescence and phosphorescence characters respectively.

It is noted in the experiment that NA does not always exhibit RTP in all matrices (such as PS) under deoxygenated conditions, we thus suspect that the host could also play an active role in the emergence of URTP observed in addition to diluting and rigidifying the guest. To shed light on the excited state dynamics concerning each component, fs-TA experiments were carried out.</p><p id="Par21">As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, after excitation by the 267 nm pulsed laser, the resulted transient absorption spectra of pure PCP film exhibited a narrow band centered at 355 nm initially at 919 fs, which can be assigned to the lowest singlet excited state of PCP. This band decays over time and gives rise to a new broad peak at 636 ps with a maximum at 460 nm, assignable to the lowest triplet excited state (emitting state). As for NA/PCP film (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>), an almost identical peak at 355 nm, initially at 955 fs, presumably the lowest singlet state of PCP, decays much more quickly than that of pure PCP. The duration to cross over to the lowest triplet excited state (the same broad peak centered at 460 nm) of PCP is a mere 126 ps. For comparison, the transient absorption spectra of pure PCP at 144 and 636 ps and that of NA/PCP at 126 ps were normalized in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>. From the figure, the triplet band of NA/PCP at 126 ps already fully superimposes with that of the pure PCP at 636 ps except for the peak at ~370 nm caused by the presence of NA (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">26</xref>). The results clearly show that the ISC of PCP has been accelerated substantially upon dissolving trace amount of NA, which unambiguously shows that the excited-state dynamics for PCP is altered in the presence of NA. Usually, faster ISC is caused by enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and/or diminished energy gap between the two electronic states of different multiplicities. Although the carbonyl group has been known to help facilitate the ISC process, the minute amount of NA presence is not likely to cause any noticeable change to PCP since such external SOC enhancement requires orbital overlap between the guest and host molecules. Furthermore, the difference between the excitation spectrum of NA/PCP (monitored at 700 nm which belongs to the NA RTP judging from the vibrational pattern) and that of the pure PCP indicates that energy transfer from the host to the guest is not the major cause of the observed URTP (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">30</xref>). Experimentally, the tremendous effect could only mean that NA changes the photophysical dynamics of several PCP molecules in proximity simultaneously, given that detection by absorption requires new species of high concentrations. Our interpretation of the results is proposed in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, b</xref>, where a cluster of molecules consisting of PCP and NA are believed to have participated in the excited states. The cluster excitons thus serve as the experimentally detected transient species, which then rapidly decay to a lower and more stable triplet state, i.e., the localized triplet state of NA.

The hypothesis was tested by three additional phosphors with varying singlet/triplet energy levels (PA, 2,3-NA, and NDA, Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">36</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>) in addition to NA using PCP as the host. Only 2,3-NA/PCP shows a green URTP with a duration of ~11 s, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">37</xref>), which matches both conditions. In contrast, both PA/PCP and NDA/PCP exhibit characteristic RTP of the PCP host (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">38</xref>).</p><p id="Par24">As for the general guideline to choose the host in the cluster exciton model, it is reasoned that the host and guest should have a matching electron donating or withdrawing character to avoid the formation of a strong charge transfer state which tends to quench luminescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. For instance, all effective hosts (PCP, PA, DCB, ABDO, and TMBN) that can turn on the URTP of NA contain electron-withdrawing group; in contrast, NA/DMB (dimethoxybenzene which is strongly electron-donating, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">31</xref>) did not show RTP at all. Finally, to suppress the competitive non-radiative decay of the cluster exciton, the host species should have a melting point sufficiently higher than room temperature.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Applications</title><p id="Par25">Besides insights in mechanistic interpretation, we finally demonstrated the application values of current guest/host RTP system. Since the guest can be dissolved into the hosts at molecular level via facile evaporation and grinding methods, the system is of great potential to serve as security ink and scratch/stress detection materials. Take NA/PCP for example (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>, left), the part of Chinese character “He” (means summation, etc.) and the other part of a filter paper was soaked by EA solution of NA/PCP and pure PCP respectively and then dried and combined at ambient conditions. The resulting paper looked like as a normal one without writing to naked eyes under ambient lighting. However, after 254 nm UV excitation, the part of “He” and the other part of the filter paper exhibited notable persistent yellow afterglow lasting for over 4 s and relatively shorter green afterglow lasting for only ~1 s, respectively. Therefore, dissolving in proper solvent, current guest/host system can serve as ideal security ink materials due to their distinguishable URTP. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref> (right), mixture of PA and NA powders was sprinkled evenly on the whole surface of a filter paper and then a Chinese character “He” (means combination, cooperation, etc.) was written by scratching heavily on the paper with a cotton swab. Under ambient lighting, the filter paper seemed normal without powder or scratch on it. After 254 nm UV excitation, however, the scratched/written part, i.e., the Chinese character, on the paper exhibited remarkable yellow afterglow lasting for over 4 s. Therefore, turn-on of the yellow URTP by simply dissolving the guest into the host under mechanical force (also seen in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">25</xref>) made them hopeful to serve as scratch or stress detection materials.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par26">In this work, we have designed and achieved purely organic RTP with both high efficiency and ultralong lifetime utilizing a guest/host strategy. When the host was ML-active, the URTP of the guest/host system could also be produced by mechanical excitation. Furthermore, we succeeded in elucidating the RTP photophysics in solid state by means of ultrafast spectroscopy (fs-TA). The fs-TA studies revealed that: (1) host and guest molecules worked synergistically in the photo-excited electronic transition processes; (2) cluster excitons spanning both guest and host molecules formed as transient species before guest molecules act as an energy trap, localized triplet excited state, to emit RTP. Therefore, besides the passive role of the host in suppressing non-radiative decay of the guest, we showed that host and guest species both played active roles in the photophysics. In this sense, mechanistically similar RTP, vs. inorganic afterglow, exists in purely organic systems. The difference is that the afterglow of inorganic materials arises from a charge separated state while the ultralong luminescence in our system is ascribed to emission from a localized triplet excited state, i.e., molecular phosphorescence. Combined advantages of current purely organic guest/host URTP system, such as simplicity, low cost, scalability, absence of unstable species (C–Br and C–I bond), multiple excitation sources, facile fabrication and excellent performances, are expected to show great values in practical applications. In addition, mechanistic insights in this work may advance the understanding of organic phosphorescence and help develop more URTP materials in the future, basing on unlimited combinations of host and guest species.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par27">Chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and were purified by column chromatography followed by triple recrystallization, and their purity were verified by HPLC (Agilent 1260 Infinite HPLC system with ZORBAX SB-C18 column) measurement before optical characterizations.
