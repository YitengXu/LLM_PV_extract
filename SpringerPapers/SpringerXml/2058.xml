Herein, we develop a reliable nonstoichiometric acid–base reaction route to stable perovskite films by intermediate chemistry and technology. Perovskite thin-film prepared by nonstoichiometric acid–base reaction route is stable for two months with negligible PbI<sub>2</sub>-impurity under ∼65% humidity, whereas other perovskites prepared by traditional methods degrade distinctly after 2 weeks. Route optimization involves the reaction of PbI<sub>2</sub> with excess HI to generate HPbI<sub>3</sub>, which subsequently undergoes reaction with excess CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> to deliver CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> thin films. High quality of intermediate HPbI<sub>3</sub> and CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> abundance are two important factors to stable CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite. Excess volatile acid/base not only affords full conversion in nonstoichiometric acid–base reaction route but also permits its facile removal for stoichiometric purification, resulting in average efficiency of 16.1% in forward/reverse scans.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">The stability of perovskite thin films and devices depends on a number of environmental factors, amongst which humidity.

Recently, a layered and/or two-dimensional perovskite as well as pseudo-halide perovskite light absorbers were demonstrated to possess enhanced moisture stability, but unfortunately the efficiency was low (2–8%), probably due to poor electronic properties attributable to their long-chain cation and large-size anion components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.

Moreover, Chen <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> developed a stable PSC adopting highly doped inorganic charge extraction layer with shielding capacity from moisture and delivered 15% <italic>PCE</italic> with 1 cm<sup>2</sup> large area. However, the stability of perovskite itself without shielding was still &lt;1 week in a humid environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Without device encapsulation, MAPbI<sub>3</sub>/FAPbI<sub>3</sub> perovskites were regarded to be unstable under high humidity. The degradation kinetics had been studied to some extent using thermal gravity analysis (TGA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and ultrafast spectroscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, which revealed some possible routes, but the degradation process related to transition states and intermediate products is not well-resolved. For example, the sequence of HI and CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> release was ambiguous and some believed that HI was released before CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>). Besides, CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>I was very thermally stable even when the temperature increased to 150 °C (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>), but the perovskites quickly decayed to PbI<sub>2</sub> in association with CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>/HI release at 80–150 °C after 24 h, which meant the decomposition kinetic pathways were different from each other<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Thus, this degradation kinetics of perovskite requires a closer examination to address these stability issues, and an alternative strategy is expected for enhancement of perovskite stability while keeping its high performance.</p><p id="Par5">In this work, we report our investigation of the degradation and recovery of CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite, which revealed the role of the intermediate product as well as methylamine amount in achieving stability. Hybrid perovskite decomposes sequentially in terms of thermodynamics based on MA-recoverable degradation, such that it first loses CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> and then HI, leaving behind PbI<sub>2</sub> solid. On the basis of this, we have developed an alternative two-step nonstoichiometric acid–base reaction route (NABR) for the synthesis of moisture-resistive perovskite, that is the production of starting HPbI<sub>3</sub> using excess HI to react with PbI<sub>2</sub>, followed by perovskite conversion from HPbI<sub>3</sub> using excess CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>. We have established that CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> abundance in synthesis and the formation of high-quality HPbI<sub>3</sub> built of columnar face-sharing PbI<sub>6</sub> octahedra are two key parameters for stabilized perovskite. In NABR, excess and volatile reagents lead to complete reaction as well as stoichiometry, respectively. Therefore, a perovskite thin-film prepared via this route possesses reduced lattice vacancy, thus eliminating the penetration of undesirable H<sub>2</sub>O molecules into vacant sites and avoiding formation of monohydrate degradation product in association with H-bonding between H<sub>2</sub>O and MA<sup>+</sup>. We have demonstrated that the CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite thin-film remained highly stable in ∼65% humidity for up to 2 months with negligible PbI<sub>2</sub>-impurity, whereas other perovskites prepared by traditional one-step or two-step methods degrade distinctly after 2 weeks. The PSC using thin-film after humidity exposure delivered even better efficiency than that from freshly prepared film probably due to slight doping. This work provides an important insight into perovskite intrinsic stability and the utilization of simple chemical reaction for material control in PSC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Recoverable degradation</title><p id="Par6">To find a way to improve the stability of CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>, we have first investigated the degradation of traditional perovskites and used the recent defect-healing process for the recovery of degraded perovskite to check the transition products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a–c</xref> show the X-ray diffraction, optical images and photoluminescence mapping for degraded and recovered perovskite thin-film (prepared by traditional two-step method).

The recovered perovskite films existed in the form of nanoscale crystals judging from the broad X-ray diffraction peaks. The photoluminescence mapping contrasts (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>) for the degraded (left) and recovered (right) films indicated their uniform reversion to perovskite. In comparison, the degraded film prepared by traditional one-step method was used for recovery test. These films had fast degradation rates and yielded some transition product under observation during the degradation. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d–f</xref> show the basic results. After 3-day degradation in 65% humidity, we observed a small-angle X-ray diffraction peak at 2<italic>θ</italic>=8.1°, which was identical to that in the monohydrate (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>˙H<sub>2</sub>O, with X-ray diffraction peaks at 2<italic>θ</italic>=8.10°, 8.66° and 10.66°) (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>). After 3 weeks, the degraded film had only one PbI<sub>2</sub> peak at 2<italic>θ</italic>=12.6°. However, these films were partially recovered as perovskite nanoscale crystals (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>), with photoluminescence mapping so as to confirm the uniform recovery judged from the strong photoluminescence at 760 nm (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>; <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>).

Under ∼65% humidity, there was no signature of PbI<sub>2</sub>-impurity after 1 month of exposure and negligible PbI<sub>2</sub> (∼7%) from X-ray diffraction monitoring.

This can be explained by the sequential degradation thermodynamics in combination with degradation kinetics if we consider the surface effect. On the surface of pin-hole-free film, due to the ready release of both HI and CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>, the sequential degradation reaction (5–7) occurred nearly simultaneously and thus only yielded PbI<sub>2</sub> that we could observe. When degradation went to the interior that was single crystal-like<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> and HI were difficult to be released from the interior of high-quality of the film, thus as formed internal HPbI<sub>3</sub> and CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>˙H<sub>2</sub>O were detected by X-ray diffraction patterns after long-time degradation. This explanation has been further tested by the following experiments. First, we tried to convert the CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>˙H<sub>2</sub>O back to CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> through heating (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>).

We then increased the calcination temperature gradually and found a change happened at above 110 °C, which was actually the decomposition threshold of defective perovskite. Second, we also checked the morphology after 70 days degradation and found that the rod-like degradation products were really embedded in the film (compare <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1519">Supplementary Fig. 18</xref> with <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>), which thus confirmed our assumption. Finally, we once again draw attention to degradation of the perovskite film without nucleation agent above.

The weight concentration was characterized for the control film and NABR produced film. We can see that over 90% perovskite remained after about 2 months, while only about 60% perovskite residue was found after 7 days degradation from the control method. The best performance of perovskite against humidity has doping concentration of about 7%, which is generally consistent with the concentration range in previous work using PbI<sub>2</sub>-rich inorganic/organic composition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par32">Besides, it is notable that stable PSCs through layer shielding reported in previous works are generally lower than 16.2% efficiency in reverse scan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. According to the detailed reports, MAPbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite itself could not endure high humidity (55%) for 1–6 days without encapsulation of its high-efficiency photovoltaics, which indicates that its high stability primarily comes from device encapsulation. However, here we demonstrate that NABR using excess CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> to react with well-defined HPbI<sub>3</sub> provides a reliable route to producing material-stable perovskites superior than those reported in previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par33">This alternative NABR method is probably beneficial for long-term development and large-scale production under ambient conditions, thus reducing the cost in device fabrication and encapsulation. First, in NABR, both CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> and HPbI<sub>3</sub> are chemically stable and thus readily facilitate fabrication. Moreover, the synthesis of HPbI<sub>3</sub> is much easier than CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>I and can be collected using ethanol. Second, fundamentally speaking, the use of well-defined HPbI<sub>3</sub> that is stoichiometrically identical to the intermediate complex as starting material is more chemically reasonable. Besides, we have fabricated a large area PSC up to 1.0 × 0.5 cm<sup>2</sup> in area, which successfully delivered 15.0% <italic>PCE</italic> at the present stage. Thus, the present study demonstrates up-scaling potential for the assembly of modules in solar cells that function efficiently under ambient condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1519">Supplementary Fig. 23</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1519">Supplementary Table 5</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par34">In conclusion, we have investigated the degradation and recovery of CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite and established an improved stability process. The degraded perovskite can be recovered as fresh perovskite using methylamine CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>, which means that methylamine can substantially retard the degradation. On the basis of this understanding, we have developed an alternative route using NABR to facilitate the synthesis of perovskite. This NABR procedure, involving the production of HPbI<sub>3</sub> using excess HI acid and PbI<sub>2</sub> as well as subsequent reaction between excess CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> base and HPbI<sub>3</sub> acid, provides CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite thin-film that is highly stable under ∼65% humidity for 2 months without appreciable PbI<sub>2</sub>-impurity, whereas other perovskites prepared by the traditional one-step and two-step methods withstand degradation &lt;1 week and 2 weeks, respectively. We have identified a high-quality form of HPbI<sub>3</sub> with identical Pb(II) coordination number to perovskite and CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> abundance as two important factors towards stable perovskite with as less site vacancies as possible. Excess and volatile acid/base leads to full coordination and stoichiometry, respectively, thus eliminating the penetration of water vapour and improving the stability in highly humid environments. The device has been optimized to 17.0/15.2% <italic>PCE</italic>s in forward/reverse scans after 1 month exposure in ∼65% humidity. This work provides an important insight into intrinsic stability and efficiency of perovskite as well as the utilization of simple reaction procedure with up-scaling potential via bottom-up synthetic chemistry for high-performance photovoltaics. Through the reaction demonstration, the vacancy-free insight into improving stability is probably a general paradigm for other perovskites. For example, FA<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>Cs<sub>1−<italic>x</italic></sub>PbI<sub><italic>y</italic></sub>Br<sub>3−<italic>y</italic></sub>, in which the FA<sup>+</sup>/Cs<sup>+</sup> is also difficult to be removed, delivers as less vacancy as possible at the A sites of AMX<sub>3</sub> perovskite for high stability. It is challenging to make MAPbI<sub>3</sub> stable in traditional routes so far. Our NABR route provides a way to enhance the stability through smart reaction control to reduce vacancy without any other material composition. The intermediate structure of HPbI<sub>3</sub> is especially interesting, in which the proton seems to move freely around the [PbI<sub>3</sub>] column. The perovskite after humidity test has even higher performance in this work, which may arise from protons in HPbI<sub>3</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par35">Methylammonium iodide (MAI, Dyesol), PbI<sub>2</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), <italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>-dimethylformamide (DMF, Sigma-Aldrich, anhydrous, 99.8%), spiro-OMeTAD (Merck), 4-tert-butylpyridine (Sigma-Aldrich, 96%), Titania paste (TiO<sub>2</sub>, 30 nm, Dyesol), Titanium(IV) isopropoxide (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.999%), methylamine (Sigma-Aldrich, 33% in ethanol), hydroiodic acid (HI, 57% in water), lithium bistrifluoromethanesulfonimidate (LiTFSI, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.95%), chlorobenzene (Sigma-Aldrich, anhydrous, 99.8%), and all other chemicals were used as received without further purification.</p><p id="Par36"><italic>HPbI</italic><sub><italic>3</italic></sub><italic> preparation:</italic> HPbI<sub>3</sub> powder was prepared by mixing PbI<sub>2</sub> and excess HI (1.5:1 molar HI:PbI<sub>2</sub>) in DMF to ensure complete conversion, and stirring at 40 °C overnight.
