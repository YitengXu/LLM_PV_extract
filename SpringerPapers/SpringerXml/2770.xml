In this work, a concept of drug-free therapeutics is proposed and defined as a therapeutic methodology without the use of traditional toxic drugs, without the consumption of therapeutic agents during treatment but with the inexhaustible therapeutic capability to maximize the benefit of treatment, and a Z-scheme SnS<sub>1.68</sub>-WO<sub>2.41</sub> nanocatalyst is developed to achieve near infrared (NIR)-photocatalytic generation of oxidative holes and hydrogen molecules for realizing combined hole/hydrogen therapy by the drug-free therapeutic strategy. Without the need of any drug and other therapeutic agent assistance, the nanocatalyst oxidizes/consumes intratumoral over-expressed glutathione (GSH) by holes and simultaneously generates hydrogen molecules in a lasting and controllable way under NIR irradiation. Mechanistically, generated hydrogen molecules and GSH consumption inhibit cancer cell energy and destroy intratumoral redox balance, respectively, to synergistically damage DNA and induce tumor cell apoptosis. High efficacy and biosafety of combined hole/hydrogen therapy of tumors are achieved by the nanocatalyst. The proposed catalysis-based drug-free therapeutic strategy breaks a pathway to realize high efficacy and low toxicity of cancer treatment.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Nanoparticles have been used to reduce the toxicity associated with chemotherapeutic agents.

As high drug loading capacity as possible is pursued all the way, but is always limited. Drug-free therapeutics, which is defined as a therapeutic methodology without the use of drug, without the consumption of therapeutic agents during treatment but with the inexhaustible therapeutic capability, will maximize the benefit of treatment and is thus worth expecting. Tang et al. developed a calcification method to kill cancer cells by injecting folic acid and Ca<sup>2+</sup> into tumor, but these two therapeutic agents were consumed during cancer treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Recently, Shi et al. has proposed the concept of nanocatalytic medicine to improve the efficacy of cancer therapy, which can realize drug-free therapy in principle in favor of evading toxic side effects of drug<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. However, most of the developed catalytic nanomedicines have to load toxic drugs and easy-exhaustion therapy-assisted agents. The development of nanocatalytic nanomedicine for drug-free therapy is quite intriguing but still challenging. We here propose to develop drug-free nanocatalysts which can consume intratumoral endogenous substrates to generate therapeutic species for drug-free therapy of cancer.</p><p id="Par4">Electrons and holes generated on the surface of catalyst have reductive and oxidative capabilities, respectively. In theory, electrons with enough high reductive capability (≥1.23 eV for H<sup>+</sup>-to-H<sub>2</sub> evolution) can be used to reduce endogenous H<sup>+</sup>/CO<sub>2</sub>/NO<sub>3</sub><sup>‒</sup> into H<sub>2</sub>/CO/NO for gas therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, while holes with enough high oxidative capability (≥0.32 eV for GSH-to-GSSG evolution) can be utilized to oxidize glutathione (GSH) into GSSG to destroy the tumor microenvironment for cancer therapy. We here propose a concept of hole therapy, which is defined as a therapeutic methodology of using catalyst-generated holes for disease treatment. The development of wide energy band of catalysts possessing high oxidation and reduction capabilities for hole/gas therapy is vitally important, but still challenging.</p><p id="Par5">The full utilization of NIR light energy at a high proportion (about 50%) in solar for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is significant to hydrogen energy but also challenging at present, because NIR-photocatalysts possess narrow energy band width (≤1240/<italic>λ</italic><sub>NIR</sub>, ≤1.53 eV with 808 nm NIR light) and too low oxidative capability (≥1.23 eV reduction potential of H<sup>+</sup>/H<sub>2</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. As to hydrogen medicine, NIR light as an external stimulus source for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution has obvious advantages over UV/visible light owing to its higher tissue penetrability and lower photo-toxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. However, the development of photocatalysts for NIR-driven hydrogen evolution for disease treatment is currently facing the similar issues to hydrogen energy. Recently, Sung et al. improved their photo-driven hydrogen-evolving liposome nanoreactor (citrate-UCNP-Au-Chlα@liposome) by encapsulating upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP) as NIR-to-visible transducer to realize NIR-photocatalytic production of hydrogen for anti-inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. However, the content of encapsulated sacrificial agent citrate (6.0 wt%) is limited and the NIR-to-visible conversion efficiency of UCNP is poor, restricting the amount and efficiency of hydrogen evolution. Here, we hypothesize that the utilization of endogenous reductive substrates such as intratumoral over-expressed GSH (0.32 eV oxidation potential of GSH/GSSG) as sacrificial agent could realize long-lasting hydrogen production and drug-free therapy. Moreover, we propose to construct the Z-scheme structure with highly oxidative (low valence band) plasmatic nanodots and NIR-activable (narrow band gap) semiconductor to realize NIR-driven hot electrons injection and high-efficiency NIR-photocatalytic evolution of hydrogen molecules and GSH-oxidizing holes for combined hole/hydrogen therapy of cancer (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Schematic illustration of combined hole/hydrogen therapy strategy and mechanisms with the NIR-activable Z-scheme SnS<sub>1.68</sub>–WO<sub>2.41</sub> nanocatalyst.</title><p>Several main advances are achieved.

As to the Janus-like Z-scheme structure of nanocrystals such as MnS–Cu<sub>7</sub>S<sub>4</sub> generally constructed by the ion-exchange approach, well-defined interfaces and well-exposed surfaces on both semiconductors favor efficient interfacial charge transfer and reduction/oxidation half-reactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, but the candidate of catalytic materials is limited and the realization of NIR-photocatalytic hydrogen generation is challenging. In comparison, the Z-scheme structure could be constructed facilely by heterogeneous growth without limitation of the choice of catalytic materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In this work, the screening of two NIR-sensitive catalysts, SnS<sub>1.68</sub> nanoplates with a high reductive potential and WO<sub>2.41</sub> nanodots with high oxidative potential, for construction of the Z-scheme structure aimed for efficient hydrogen generation and GSH depletion for combined hydrogen/hole therapy. On the one hand, WO<sub>2.41</sub> nanodots have an oxygen defect-induced localized surface plasmon resonance effect with strong NIR adsorption as well as a high oxidative potential in favor of GSH oxidation. On the other hand, SnS<sub>1.68</sub> nanoplates possess a sulfur-deficient structure, leading to a narrow band gap (1.49 eV) and a NIR absorption edge (832 nm), in favor of NIR-photocatalytic hydrogen generation. The heterogeneous growth of WO<sub>2.41</sub> nanodots on the surface of SnS<sub>1.68</sub> nanoplates by a one-pot method enabled NIR-driven hot electrons injection into conjugated SnS<sub>1.68</sub> nanoplates, enhancing NIR-photocatalytic reduction for hydrogen generation. Therefore, we chose the materials system of the Z-scheme SnS<sub>1.68</sub>–WO<sub>2.41</sub> nanocatalyst to realize efficient NIR-driven hydrogen generation and GSH depletion.</p><p id="Par7">In this work, we proposed a strategy of photocatalysis-mediated drug-free therapeutics, and developed a kind of Z-scheme NIR-photocatalyst by in situ conjugate WO<sub>3-x</sub> nanodots onto SnS<sub>2-y</sub> nanoplates. The NIR-excitated surface plasmatic resonance of WO<sub>3-x</sub> injected hot electrons into SnS<sub>2-y</sub> for NIR-controlled hydrogen evolution and synchronous GSH oxidation by holes (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). The simultaneous generation of hydrogen molecules and holes enabled hydrogen therapy and hole therapy, respectively, which inhibited cellular energy metabolism and destroyed cellular anti-oxidation defense system (ADS) by GSH decrease and subsequent ROS increase, synergistically inducing the apoptosis of cancer cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><p id="Par8">SnS<sub>2</sub> nanoplates with a stoichiometric proportion of Sn:S = 1:2 were prepared by a solvothermal method, and used as a control. WO<sub>2.41</sub> nanodots heterogeneously grew on the surface of SnS<sub>2</sub> nanoplates by the solvothermal method, and meanwhile, a part of sulfur was deprived by trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) during the oxidation of tungsten, leading to partial lack of sulfur and oxygen for SnS<sub>1.68</sub>–WO<sub>2.41</sub>. Through electrical microscopy observation, both obtained SnS<sub>2</sub> and SnS<sub>1.68</sub>–WO<sub>2.41</sub> exhibited a kind of hexagonal plate-like morphology (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a‒c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>) as well as uniform size of about 100 nm in diameter in favor of cellular uptake. Elementary mapping and high-resolution TEM results suggested that there were small nanodots of tungsten oxide (at a 2.5% molar ratio of W to Sn, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>) evenly dispersed on the surface of tin sulfide (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2e</xref>) in favor of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), which could be the reason that the surface of SnS<sub>1.68</sub>–WO<sub>2.41</sub> nanoplates was rough and porous (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2d</xref>). XPS patterns further indicated that the valence state of Sn in obtained SnS<sub>2</sub> nanoplates was only 4+, while that in SnS<sub>1.68</sub>–WO<sub>2.41</sub> nanoplates included 4+ and 2+ (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). The ratio of various Sn valence states in SnS<sub>1.68</sub>–WO<sub>2.41</sub> was measured to be Sn<sup>4+</sup>:Sn<sup>2+</sup> = 0.681:0.319, determining the non-stoichiometric ratio of Sn:S = 1:1.68. Such a sulfur-deficient structure of SnS<sub>1.68</sub> led to the slight change in the crystal lattice of SnS<sub>2</sub> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4b</xref>). Invisible XRD peaks of tungsten oxide in SnS<sub>1.68</sub>–WO<sub>2.41</sub> nanoplates (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4a</xref>) could result from its small particle size and low content. But FTIR results clearly indicated the composition of SnS<sub>1.68</sub>–WO<sub>2.41</sub> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>) in accordance with the above elementary mapping results (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). XPS patterns further confirmed that there were three valence states of tungsten in SnS<sub>1.68</sub>–WO<sub>2.41</sub> at the ratio of W<sup>6+</sup>:W<sup>5+</sup>:W<sup>4+</sup> = 0.307:0.216:0.477 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>), determining the non-stoichiometric ratio of W:O = 1:2.41. So many oxygen vacancies in SnS<sub>1.68</sub>–WO<sub>2.41</sub> nanoplates would greatly favor the enhancement of LSPR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In addition, SnS<sub>1.68</sub>–WO<sub>2.41</sub> nanoplates were conjugated with trithiol-terminated poly-(methacrylic acid) (PTMP-PMAA) by a coordination method to enhance their aqueous dispersion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.

Furthermore, NIR-photocurrent measurement with 808 nm NIR laser indicated that the NIR-photocurrent onset potential (V<sub>onset</sub>) of SnS<sub>1.68</sub>–WO<sub>2.41</sub> was as low as 0.57 V (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>).

Noticeably, a hydrogen electrode was used to monitor the hydrogen generation process of the SnS<sub>1.68</sub>–WO<sub>2.41</sub> nanocatalyst in real time, where catalyst-free detection solution was separated from NIR-illustrated nanocatalyst solution by a piece of filter membrane (molecular weight cut-off of 3000 Dalton) in order to avoid the effect of photoelectrons on the surface of nanoparticles on the electrode. From Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>, the SnS<sub>1.68</sub>–WO<sub>2.41</sub> nanocatalyst can indeed generate hydrogen gas under irradiation of 808 nm laser, and the hydrogen generation rate depended on NIR laser power density, as higher power density caused faster hydrogen evolution. Moreover, hydrogen generation was highly controllable and repeatable by switching on/off NIR laser, which enabled on-demand hydrogen therapy. When NIR irradiation was switched off, hydrogen concentration went down a little bit owing to low solubility and density-induced hydrogen gas escape from the solution. Furthermore, GSH concentration was also monitored by an Ellmann probe (5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), DTNB). It was found from Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref> that GSH consumption was dependent on NIR irradiation. No NIR irradiation almost did not cause GSH consumption, while higher NIR irradiation resulted in more GSH consumption, owing to GSH oxidation by photo-generated holes on the SnS<sub>1.68</sub>–WO<sub>2.41</sub> nanocatalyst rather than by the nanocatalyst itself, enabling hole therapy. The GSH consumption seems to have a linear relationship with irradiation time, indicating the nanocatalyst can steadily oxidize GSH for generating hydrogen molecule with high cycle stability of NIR-photocatalysis. It is worth noting that such a drug-free therapy method is sustainable and repeatable without restrictions, empowering any extent of therapy for optimal outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>In vitro hole/hydrogen therapy efficacies and mechanisms</title><p id="Par11">Cellular uptake behavior of the SnS<sub>1.68</sub>–WO<sub>2.41</sub> nanocatalyst was investigated first.

Effective cellular uptake of nanocatalysts would be favorable for cancer therapy. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of nanocatalysts was investigated with SnS<sub>2</sub> nanoplates and WO<sub>2.41</sub> nanodots as two controls that cannot oxidize GSH and generate hydrogen molecules under NIR irradiation because of unqualified energy band structures.

By comparison, combined hole/hydrogen therapy groups of SnS<sub>1.68</sub>–WO<sub>2.41</sub> plus UV irradiation demonstrated remarkably higher cytotoxicity at the same particle concentration and power density.

Therefore, we investigated the effect of the SnS<sub>1.68</sub>–WO<sub>2.41</sub> nanocatalyst on both intracellular levels of ATP and ROS and the functions of mitochondria and DNA in the presence and absence of NIR irradiation in order to uncover the mechanism of hole/hydrogen therapy. First, catalytic GSH oxidation (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10a</xref>) and hydrogen evolution (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10b</xref>) were further confirmed in the model of 4T1 cells in accordance to the above-mentioned results in the simulated fluid (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3ef</xref>), which was responsible for above-mentioned hole/hydrogen therapy outcomes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Furthermore, intracellular ROS monitoring results from Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref> indicated that 10 min NIR irradiation to SnS<sub>1.68</sub>–WO<sub>2.41</sub> nanocatalyst-treated 4T1 cells quickly caused the visible increase of intracellular ROS level in a power density-/concentration-dependent way, but no NIR irradiation did not affect intracellular ROS level obviously. It is worth noting that intracellular ROS level persistently increased (up to two folds within 1.5 h at 0.5 W/cm<sup>2</sup> at 100 μg/mL) after stopping NIR irradiation, indicating that the damage of GSH oxidation to the ADS can be gradually amplified and then persisted for a long term (&gt;4.5 h, Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Such a remarkable and irreducible enhancement of intracellular ROS level led to visible DNA damage (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>), being accountable for hole therapy. On the other hand, NIR-photocatalytically generated hydrogen gas severely impaired the mitochondria of 4T1 cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref>), and thus caused the remarkable reduction in cellular energy level (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). Moreover, the response of intracellular ATP to hydrogen molecules was synchronous with the response of intracellular ROS to GSH oxidation, and even more persistent in favor of sustained proapoptosis. The hydrogen-mediated decrease of cellular energy level can not only directly induce the apoptosis of cancer cells but also impede the repairing of DNA damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, and therefore synergistically enhance the effect of hole therapy. By comparison, SnS<sub>2</sub> nanoplates did not affect intracellular levels of ROS and ATP despite concentration and NIR irradiation (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>), probably owing to their good cytocompatibility and impossible NIR-photocatalysis.

During the 20 min NIR irradiation treatment, the temperature of irradiated tumors was monitored in real time by an infrared thermal imaging instrument and was found to always maintain below 40 °C, indicating that photothermal effect of the nanocatalyst was quietly slight. NIR irradiation was operated at day 1 and day 3.

Therefore, in vivo results suggested that NIR-photocatalytical GSH oxidation caused the increase of intratumoral ROS level and thus damaged the DNA of tumor cells to induce tumor apoptosis, while NIR-photocatalytically generated hydrogen gas inhibited the energy level of tumor cells and consequently prevented from DNA repair to accelerate tumor apoptosis, further confirming the proposed mechanism for combined hole/hydrogen therapy (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>).</p><p id="Par15">Furthermore, we investigated the change of tumor microenvironment (TME) after hole/hydrogen therapy to deeply understand its influence. There are a variety of tumor-associated stromal cells, involving inflammatory cells, vascular cells, and fibroblasts, which make important contributions together to TME in support of tumor angiogenesis, proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. Besides, tumor defense systems in TME safeguard the normal running of tumor system from internal and external attacks. Doing damage to TME by destroying tumor defense systems is equally important with directly killing tumor cells, and it has been well recognized that combined therapy for simultaneously damaging TME and killing tumor cells is more efficient than individual therapy, typically immunochemotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. After hole/hydrogen therapy, the proliferation of Ki67<sup>+</sup> tumor cells was almost thoroughly suppressed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>); both Caspase-3-positive (Cap3<sup>+</sup>) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling-positive (TUNEL<sup>+</sup>) cellular apoptosis increased remarkably (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b, c</xref>); excessive CD31<sup>+</sup> vasculatures regressed drastically (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>); and tumor-associated macrophages (Iba1<sup>+</sup>) were also almost fully eradicated (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>), indicating that tumor-induced immunodepression was demilitarized.

By comparison, other control groups did not cause remarkable changes of TME (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">16</xref>). By virtue of hole/hydrogen therapy, both GSH depletion and hydrogen regulation upon tumor tissue could spread over the whole of TME, destroy the ADS in TME, and influence all tumor and tumor-associated stromal cells because of high tissue penetration of GSH and hydrogen molecules.
