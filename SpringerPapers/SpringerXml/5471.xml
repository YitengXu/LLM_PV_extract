Iridium oxide (IrO<sub>2</sub>) is the only currently known 5d transition metal oxide possessing admirable OER activity. Tremendous efforts have been carried out to enhance the activity of iridium oxides. Unfortunately there lies a gap in understanding what factors responsible for the activity in doped IrO<sub>2</sub> or the novel crystal structure. Based on two metallic pyrochlores (Bi<sub>2</sub>Ir<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> and Pb<sub>2</sub>Ir<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6.5</sub>) and IrO<sub>2</sub>. It has been found that there exists a strong correlation between the specific OER activity and IrO<sub>6</sub> coordination geometry. The more distortion in IrO<sub>6</sub> geometry ascends the activity of Ir sites, and generates activity order of Pb-Ir &gt; IrO<sub>2</sub> &gt; Bi-Ir. Our characterizations reveal that distorted IrO<sub>6</sub> in Pb-Ir induces a disappearance of J = 1/2 subbands in valence band, while Bi-Ir and IrO<sub>2</sub> resist this nature probe. The performed DFT calculations indicated the distortion in IrO<sub>6</sub> geometry can optimize binding strength between Ir-5d and O-2p due to broader d band width. Based on this insight, enhancement in OER activity is obtained by effects that change IrO<sub>6</sub> octahedral geometry through doping or utilizing structural manipulation with nature of distorted octahedral coordination.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>21028</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep38429.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>23</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep38429" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep38429</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over the past few years, the growing demands of decreasing greenhouse emissions and ever-increasing environmental problems drive extensively through the phase of renewable energy production and storage technologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>), a clean energy has been attracted much attention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, that can be collected by electrolytic splitting of water. This is an efficient pathway, however, is restricted intensively by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the anodic surface due to its sluggish kinetics and complicated reaction mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. A critical requirement for overcoming this bottleneck is in pursuit of developing efficient OER catalysts for decreasing the prohibitive over-potential within the quest of current density. There lies no doubt in relating the OER catalytic activity of materials to their electronic structure as bond making or breaking in OER processes are based upon the intermediates bonding of O-2p with the surface sites of catalysts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Accordingly, there lie tremendous endeavors to design and prepare an efficient catalyst from both experimental and computational insights.

In particular, the property-activity relationship for metal oxides OER is the typical Volcano descriptor which elucidates that adsorption of O-intermediates on surface sites should be neither too strong nor too weak<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The density functional calculation (DFT) gives a very instructive scaling relation that the energy gap between the G<sub>OOH*</sub> (the third step of OER in acid solution) and G<sub>OH*</sub> (the first step of OER) is approximately about 3 eV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, and combines a lot of experimental results with the theoretical calculations to put forward that energy gap relative to ideal value (2.46 eV) depends on the nature of surface sites.</p><p>Currently iridium oxide (IrO<sub>2</sub>) is the only known 5d transition metal oxide exhibiting an admirable OER activity and being widely accepted as state-of-the-art catalyst<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The preciousness and expensiveness of Ir limit its expansion in various applications. Thus, a vast research is being conducted in devotion to explore an advancement in OER activity to reduce Ir consumption based on iridate, such as binary or ternary oxides by doping other metal elements like Co<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, Ni<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, Cu<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, Ru<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and Sn<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, or oxides of new structure like hollandite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and pyrochlore<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Even though enhancement of OER activity is acquired through addition of elements, still there is less understanding of structural aspects demonstrating variation in its activity when transition metals replace Ir sites in rutile IrO<sub>2</sub> or in the other novel crystal structure. At present, due to the unique electronic properties of Ir, the 5d iridium oxides (Iridates) are grasping more attention from magnetism and conductivity except in electro catalysis applications. For example, the perovskites iridates Sr<sub>2</sub>IrO<sub>4</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> and CaIrO<sub>3</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> are a Mott insulator due to a strong spin-orbital interaction (SOI) coupled with electron-electron repulsion in their IrO<sub>6</sub> coordination to generate a band gap. While, most of iridates are metallic oxides and on account of extensive broad <italic>d</italic> band structure makes Fermi level (E<sub>F</sub>) easily crosses their valence band<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Therefore, there is no doubt that the different properties of iridates are completely dominated by their electronic structure, which duly has strong relationship with the IrO<sub>6</sub> coordination geometry in the oxides. However, there exists a gap in understanding the correlation between IrO<sub>6</sub> structure and its OER activity.</p><p>Pyrochlore metal oxides with the general formula A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7-δ</sub> are very common in chemistry oxides as the perovskites are the focus of attention. Their unique properties such as magnetic behavior, conductivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> and phase tolerance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> renderenormous applications in magnetic devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, Li-O<sub>2</sub> battery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, solid state high temperature fuel cells (SOFC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, nuclear waste immobilization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> and water splitting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> and so on.

In here, based on two different pyrochlore iridates (Pb<sub>2</sub>Ir<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6.5</sub> and Bi<sub>2</sub>Ir<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>), it is illustrated that the properties of IrO<sub>6</sub> coordination geometry in oxides play an important role in its OER activity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Physical characterization for Pb-Ir pyrocholre</title><p>The <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> shows the XRD pattern of the obtained Pb-Ir pyrochlore. All reflections of Pb-Ir indicate the presence of peak angles corresponding to the cubic pyrochlore structure (A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>O’). The cubic pyrocholre belongs to space group Fd3m (No. 227)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Generally, the larger cation A often occupies 16d site (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) and smaller cation B at 16c (0, 0, 0). The O anion resides at 48 f (x, 0.125, 0.125) and O’ anion at 8b site (0.375, 0.375, 0.375).

Actually, the pyrochlore structure is a superstructure derivative from the fluorite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, the diffractions of plane angles are very close to the fluorites.

There is a plausible probability for forming solid solution oxides between Pb and Ir, because oxides of both metals have a rutile structure. However, according to the Hume-Rothery rule, the difference of ionic radius between Pb and Ir (in an octahedral) is 19.6% which is larger than15% indicating rare possibility of forming Pb-Ir rutile structure solid solution. In our study, a mixture phase comprising IrO<sub>2</sub> and Pb-Ir pyrochlore is observed in Pb-2 and Pb-3 cases where Ir is rich in oxides; it ascertains that Pb cannot substitute the Ir lattice to form the rutile structure. While, an interesting feature is that Ir can be doped into PbO<sub>2</sub> fluorite structure. These observations are displayed in TEM images and XRD pattern as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S1</xref>. The morphology of IrO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticle looks like a rice grain, and the nanoparticle size is about 5–10 nm, while Pb-Ir pyrochlore particle size is larger than IrO<sub>2</sub>, mainly due to Pb-Ir pyrochlore cell unit volume (a = 10.26 Å, V = 1081 Å<sup>3</sup>) being quite greater than IrO<sub>2</sub> (a = 4.5 Å, c = 3.15 Å, V = 64.1 Å<sup>3</sup>). Thus, nanoparticles of IrO<sub>2</sub> and Pb-Ir pyrochlore can be observed clearly in the TEM images of Pb-2 and Pb-3 cases. These observations are also confirmed by XRD. The peaks intensity of diffraction planes (222) and (044) for Pb-Ir pyrochlore observed in Pb-2 case increases with Pb enrichment. In contrast to this the diffraction intensity for IrO<sub>2</sub> decreases until complete disappearance in Pb-4 case. Whereas, for Pb-5 and Pb-6 cases the diffraction peaks (111), (200) and (220) define a PbO<sub>2</sub> fluorite structure, and no IrO<sub>2</sub> diffraction planes are observed indicating that Ir can be doped into the PbO<sub>2</sub> fluorite lattice. As guided by Hume-Rothery rule, the difference of ionic radius in fluorite structure is 16% which is slightly higher than 15% limit, meaning that Ir has a large possibility to substitute Pb site. From XRD pattern, the fluorite diffraction planes in Pb-5 case such as (111) and (220) are shifted slightly to right compared to Pb-6 case. According to Bragg equation, it means that smaller Ir doped to PbO<sub>2</sub> decreases the inter-planar distance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Electrochemical performances</title><p>To assess the electrochemical properties of as-prepared materials, the electrodes are evaluated by the typical technique of cyclic voltammetry (CV) under the 0.1 M HClO<sub>4</sub> solution with different scan rates.

Here, the Pb-4 obtains a higher q* than any other materials, but there is no linear relation of the q* with increasing Pb content. In detail, Pb-1 and Pb-2 have lower values than IrO<sub>2</sub> does, while Pb-3 and Pb-4 samples are in contradiction. The function of q* with v<sup>−1/2</sup> can give the inner capacitance of the electrodes, an important descriptor for evaluating the number of active sites by extrapolating the charge at zero sweep rate. The order of the inner capacitance is Pb-4 &gt; Pb-2 &gt; IrO<sub>2</sub> &gt; Pb-3 &gt; Pb-1, which shows that Pb-Ir pyrochlore has more active sites. The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) can be determined by using the double layer capacitance (the double layer capacitance is calculated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S2</xref>). The <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref> shows that Pb-4 has the largest ECSA of 160 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup> while IrO<sub>2</sub> provides a medial value of 121 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup>. The ECSA of Pb-Ir cases increase with Pb enrichment although being lower than IrO<sub>2</sub> except Pb-4 case. It is hard to explain the ECSA variations in Pb-Ir oxides by simple physically mixed Pb-Ir pyrochlore with IrO<sub>2</sub>, which implies a strong interaction between the oxides in low Pb contents.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Voltammetric charge q* at the different scan rate for Pb-1, Pb-2, Pb-3, Pb-4 and IrO<sub>2</sub> as reference.

In further, the onset potential of Pb-Ir oxides presents a decreasing trend on increasing Pb contents, signifying Pb-Ir pyrocholre as a water oxidation catalyst. The polarization curves of OER are presented in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, it can be found that Pb-3 has a notable OER activity. In low Pb composite cases, the OER activity enhances with increasing Pb content. The Pb-4 is the watershed, in low Ir composite cases, such as Pb-5 and Pb-6 show low OER response that indicates Ir as a real active site rather than Pb. However, there is no doubt that strong interaction of the two phases has a remarkable synergistic effect to enforce the OER activity. The Tafel plots (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>) confirm the observations, where Pb-3 gives 59 mV dec<sup>−1</sup> while the benchmark IrO<sub>2</sub> presents 72 mV dec<sup>−1</sup>.

No matter either computationally or experimentally, the OER activity of a material has a strong correlation with its electronic structure. Herein, it is worth to elaborate the differences in electronic structure of these oxides. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref> is their Ir-4f core level X-ray photoemission spectrum (XPS). For the single crystal IrO<sub>2</sub>, the binding energy of Ir-4f7/2 and 4f5/2 are 61.7 eV and 64.7 eV, respectively. In our hydrothermally synthesized IrO<sub>2</sub> sample, the binding energies are 61.76 and 64.7 eV, which are close to single IrO<sub>2</sub> values. Comparing to IrO<sub>2</sub>, Pb-Ir pyrochlore shows a clear low binding energy, while there is no variation between IrO<sub>2</sub> and Bi-Ir. However, our finding is different compared to Kennedys reporting partial Ir component having a higher binding energy and owing to the Ir<sup>5+</sup> valence. For the extensive Ir oxides, there is distinctly asymmetrical shape of the Ir-4f photoemission spectra due to the final state effects. J. M. Kahk <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> systematically studied this asymmetric shape in IrO<sub>2</sub> and proposed that it was incorrectly attributed to the complex line of different valence states, especially for those containing higher valence surface phase. Seemingly, in our de-convoluted Ir-4f spectra for IrO<sub>2</sub> case, there exists a higher binding energy peak. As precisely because of the strong asymmetric peak shape exhibited in Ir-4f, it is no longer tenable in regarding the higher binding energy as the higher valence state. In similarity, the de-convoluted peaks with higher binding energy in Bi-Ir and Pb-Ir are not contributed to the high Ir valence phase.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Ir-4f and (<bold>b</bold>) O-1s core level XPS spectra of IrO<sub>2</sub>, Bi-Ir and Pb-Ir pyrochlores.

It clearly depicts a marked shift towards lower binding energy in Pb-Ir compared to IrO<sub>2</sub>. While for Bi-Ir case, the O-1s has no significant change compare to that of IrO<sub>2</sub>. The binding energy of Bi-4f<sub>7/2</sub> is 158.05 eV (as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S5</xref>), which is close to the value reported by Kripasindhu Sardar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup><italic>et al</italic>., suggesting the presence of Bi with +3 valence in here. The binding energy of three elements in all prepared Pb-Ir oxides are compared as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S6</xref>. From Pb-4f XPS, it is clearly noted that two de-convoluted peaks were identified in Pb-Ir oxides except Pb-1. These doublet peaks are also observed in β-PbO<sub>2</sub>, but their peak shapes are different<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. For in β-PbO<sub>2</sub>, it is a tetragonal structure. While in our samples, Pb is located in cubic pyrochlore structure. Their different crystal structure is responsible for their novel peak distribution. It is noted that the binding energy of Pb-4f progressively shifts to a higher energy direction with increasing Pb component until Pb-4 case. When Pb content further increases such as in Pb-5 and Pb-6, the binding energy shifts to a lower value. The O-1s are also complicated. In Pb-2 case, three fitting peaks are observed, the low energy one may contribute to Pb-Ir pyrochlore, while the middle one arises from binding of Ir atom which is consistent with IrO<sub>2</sub> reflection. To be noted, there is no significant difference in energy position of lattice O between pyrochlore and fluorite structure. For the Ir-4f XPS, there is a slight shift to lower energy in all Pb-Ir oxides even in Pb-Ir fluorite. This difference is probably due to the different crystal structure of pyrochlores and fluorites. These findings are also observed in the valence band spectra of O-2s and Pb-5d components (as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S7</xref>), where O-2s has an inverse variation to Pb-5d whose energy position increase with increasing Pb component. However, there is no obvious variation of Ir binding energy to Pb/Ir ratio changes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Differences in their IrO<sub>6</sub> octahedral geometry</title><p>Apart from the differences in Ir-4f XPS spectra of these three oxide types (IrO<sub>2</sub>, Pb-Ir and Bi-Ir), their VBS also have obvious distinction. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref> is the VBS of IrO<sub>2</sub>, Bi-Ir and Pb-Ir by applying Shirley background. It is worth noting that a shoulder peak near Fermi level is obviously observed in IrO<sub>2</sub>, that attributes as spin-orbital couple (SOC) splitting the five t<sub>2g</sub> bands into four electrons occupied J = 3/2 subband and one electron occupied J = 1/2 subband<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> (note that IrO<sub>2</sub> gives the electron configuration of t<sub>2g</sub><sup>5</sup>e<sub>g</sub><sup>0</sup>). The J = 1/2 subband formation is descripted in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>. This shoulder peak is common in many iridium oxides and is utilized to characterize the SOC effect in IrO<sub>6</sub> octahedral coordination. Many efforts proposed that a strong SOC effect and electron-electron repulsion determine the nature of Motta-insulator in Sr<sub>2</sub>Ir<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and CaIrO<sub>3</sub>. Despite the strong SOC (our VBS also confirms it) effect also embeds in IrO<sub>2</sub>, the wide t<sub>2g</sub> bands and special orbital property contribute to conducting behavior of IrO<sub>2</sub> (our DOS will also confirms the fact that electrons cross the Fermi level). Notable fact that this weak shoulder peak is also observed in our Bi-Ir case, the intensity of J = 1/2 subband is relatively weaker than J = 3/2 due to a quarter of electrons states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. However, the Pb-Ir VBS depicts a notable feature with very large shoulder peak rather than a weak shoulder peak which is in contrast to IrO<sub>2</sub> and Bi-Ir. The paradox is that this J = 1/2 subband state is even higher than its neighboring J = 3/2 subband. Accordingly, it implies that the SOC effect of IrO<sub>6</sub> coordination may disappear in Pb-Ir pyrochlore. The VBS for all prepared Pb-Ir oxides as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S7</xref>. It is worth to note that the J = 1/2 subband is clearly observed in case of Pb-1, Pb-2 and Pb-3, because they are mixture of two phases of IrO<sub>2</sub> and Pb-Ir pyrochlore, thus IrO<sub>2</sub> contributes the shoulder peak nearly E<sub>F</sub>. Intriguingly, the disappearance of J = 1/2 subband is also present in Pb-5 and Pb-6 cases, it is mainly due to that the IrO<sub>6</sub> symmetry of Ir replaced by IrO<sub>8</sub> coordination in fluorite structure.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Valence band spectra of IrO<sub>2</sub>, Bi-Ir and Pb-Ir pyrochlores.

Lifting degeneracy of orbitals in the metal-ligands is often accompanied by the structural distortion. A famous case commonly discovered on six-coordinated Cu<sup>2+</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, Mn<sup>3+</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> compounds is the Jahn-Teller effects, a structural distortion result of transformation from regular octahedron to elongated one, which strongly affects electronic structure in materials and consequently influence their conductivity, magnetism, optical property and catalytic activity. In here, it is noted that the IrO<sub>6</sub> coordination in these three oxides is extremely different as displayed in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>. In the case of IrO<sub>2</sub>, the six bonds of IrO<sub>6</sub> octahedron are unequal with two short apical Ir-O bond (1.96 Å) and four long planar Ir-O bond (1.998 Å), which gives a slightly compressed octahedron (transfer from O<sub>h</sub> to D<sub>2h</sub>). While in Bi-Ir case, the six bonds are all equivalent (2.003 Å) and delineate a regular octahedron. Composites of IrO<sub>2</sub> and Bi-Ir do not deviate significantly from the O<sub>h</sub> symmetry and avoid large structure distortion, in consequence a strong J = 1/2 peak is observed from performed VBS. Remarkably, the octahedral coordination is intensively distorted in Pb-Ir case where the un-equivalent bonds not only exist in apical direction (one is 2.18 Å and another is 1.822 Å) but also in the four planar Ir-O bonds (two of them are 2.18 Å and the remain are 1.822 Å). Their Ir-O bond lengths distribution are also calculated based on the most stable crystal model as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S8</xref>, the Pb-Ir composite has different Ir-O bond length both in the plane and apical section of the octahedron. This distortion will result in weakening of shielding effect in the elongated bond direction, and further lifting the t<sub>2g</sub> and e<sub>g</sub> degeneracy responsible for the disappearance of J = 1/2 subband. The properties associated to lone pair distribution of the later are also significantly different from IrO<sub>2</sub> and Bi-Ir. It presents asymmetric and uneven distribution of charge density, whereas it is symmetric and uniform in case of IrO<sub>2</sub> and Bi-Ir in their 4-coordination plane.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>–<bold>c</bold>) respectively are the IrO<sub>6</sub> polyhedral, the Ir-O bond length are indicated in structure, the shape of IrO<sub>6</sub> octahedral coordination, lone pair charge density for the specific cut plane and the cell unit crystal structure in IrO<sub>2</sub>, Bi-Ir and Pb-Ir pyrochlores.

The distorted IrO<sub>6</sub> coordination brings a significance in bonding character and occupancy of the orbital states. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a</xref> is the calculated density of state (DOS) of the three compounds. The bonding area with pink color represents σ bonding and π bonding. It can be found clearly that Pb-Ir has the widest (7.8 eV bandwidth) bonding region, while the Bi-Ir gives the narrowest bandwidth and the IrO<sub>2</sub> has the medial one. For the π anti-bonding colored by yellow, IrO<sub>2</sub> provides bandwidth of 3.6 eV and Pb-Ir approaches 3.1 eV, both remaining higher than Bi-Ir. The Pb-Ir shows the broadest width in whole conduction band of 10.9 eV, which mainly is the outcome of the distorted IrO<sub>6</sub> coordination. Previous studies revealed a principle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> for the most powerful catalyst that the M (metal) −O bond in oxides is neither too strong nor too weak so that it can tune energy for the rate-determining step (RDS). Aleksandra Vojvodic <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> pointed out that the occupancy of the d states correlates with the oxygen adsorption energy and hence affects the catalytic activity. The adsorption strength depends on the interaction between metal’s d bands and O-2p adsorbate. The higher degree of overlap, the stronger the bonding. As illustrated in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>, the distorted IrO<sub>6</sub> octahedron gives rise to a broaden Ir-5d bands, which improves the orbital overlap with O-2p. It further strengths the intermediate adsorbates (O*, OH* and ooh*) interacting with catalyst surface sites, especially decreasing the OOH* (often regarded as the rate-determining step) adsorption energy. In our findings, the Pb-Ir pyrochlore has the most broad bands in these three oxides, while the most regular IrO<sub>6</sub> symmetry in Bi-Ir has the narrowest bands and IrO<sub>2</sub> has a middle one. As shown in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>, the OER specific activity order is Pb-Ir &gt; IrO<sub>2</sub> &gt; Bi-Ir, which is consistent with d bands width order and also with the order of IrO<sub>6</sub> geometry distortion.

The hollandite structure of K<sub>x</sub> = <sub>0.25</sub>IrO<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> also exhibits better OER activity than IrO<sub>2</sub>, and its IrO<sub>6</sub> coordination is a distorted octahedron that strongly affect its electronic structure.

All above of the transition metals Cu, Co, Ni doped into IrO<sub>2</sub> brings enhancement in OER activity, mainly due to the dopant atoms altering the IrO<sub>6</sub> coordination. In this circumstance of mismatched crystal systems, oxygen vacancies are induced due to the low valence dopants. As depicted from DOS of Cu doped and K<sub>x</sub> = <sub>0.25</sub>IrO<sub>2</sub> cases, their IrO<sub>6</sub> octahedral coordination is also quite different from IrO<sub>2</sub> which leading to a broadened valence band. Thus, these variations further lead to optimize the electronic structure resulting in promoting the OER activity of Ir sites.</p><p>In summary, we have prepared successfully Pb-Ir, Bi-Ir pyrochlores and relevant Pb-Ir oxides by simple hydrothermal synthesis and characterized their OER activity along with structural properties. The order of specific activity for OER is that Pb-Ir &gt; IrO<sub>2</sub> &gt; Bi-Ir pyrochlore. We demonstrate that there is a strong correlation between the IrO<sub>6</sub> coordination geometry in the oxides structure and their OER activity. For the Pb-Ir pyrochlore, it has a strong distorted IrO<sub>6</sub> geometry due to different Ir-O bond lengths, while IrO<sub>2</sub> is a D<sub>2h</sub> symmetry and Bi-Ir gives a perfect IrO<sub>6</sub> octahedron without any distortion. The differences in their IrO<sub>6</sub> coordination also change their valence band structure causing disappearance of J = 1/2 sunbands in Pb-Ir case. The properties of IrO<sub>6</sub> geometry also affect significantly their lone pair charge density distribution, where Pb-Ir has an asymmetric charge density distribution while Bi-Ir upholds symmetricity. The calculated DOS confirms that Pb-Ir has a more broaden bandwidth than IrO<sub>2</sub>, while Bi-Ir has the narrowest. The broaden bands no doubt promote O-2p (intermediate adsorbate) overlap with valence band of oxides, that benefits in response to enhance its OER activity. Also, previous studies on transition metals (Cu, Co, Ni) doped IrO<sub>2</sub> obtain enhancements for promoting OER activity prove that there are some defects and lattice disorders due to the mismatch of the crystal structures. In short, our demonstrations indicated that the distorted IrO<sub>6</sub> geometry plays an important role in determining its OER activity. Based on these results, it can be obtained that enhancement in OER activity is affected due to change in IrO<sub>6</sub> octahedral geometry via doping or utilizing other structure corresponding to the nature of distorted octahedral coordination.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Synthesis of Pb-Ir and Bi-Ir pyrochlores</title><p>Both two pyrochlores are synthesized by using hydrothermal method.
