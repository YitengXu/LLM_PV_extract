While antiviral compounds and chemical inactivation remain inadequate, physical approaches based on irradiation provide new potentials for prevention and treatment of viral infections, without the risk of drug resistance and other unwanted side effects. Light across the electromagnetic spectrum can inactivate the virions using ionizing and non-ionizing radiations. This review highlights the anti-viral utility of radiant methods from the aspects of ionizing radiation, including high energy ultraviolet, gamma ray, X-ray, and neutron, and non-ionizing

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par28">Historically, viruses have been the causative agent of the most significant human diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), various types of influenza viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and SARS-CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As one of the most devastating pandemics in human history, the â1918 influenza pandemicâ, caused by an H1N1 virus, was responsible for tens of millions of casualties in the early twentieth century [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. For several hundreds of years, light has been recognized as a potential antimicrobial device to fight against infection diseases. Niels Ryberg Finsen made numerous efforts to use concentrated light rays to treat lupus vulgaris, the most common Mycobacterium tuberculosis skin infection, which earned him the Nobel Prize in Physiology/Medicine in 1903 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The exposure to the healing rays has become a common form of light therapy against bacterial infections, as well as wound infections,Â psoriasis,Â acne vulgaris,Â rickettsia, depression, jaundice, and a host of other diseases. To date, studies continue to explore the application of rays, from sunlight to non-invasive laser light, against infective pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">In general, the shapes of viruses include filamentous, icosahedral, enveloped, and head-and-tail. Animal viruses, such as coronaviruses, are often enveloped and have a punched-in spherical appearance. Enveloped viruses are surrounded by an outer lipid membrane that makes them sensitive to some environmental changes, therefore it is easier to inactivate these viruses compared to non-enveloped viruses. Membrane of enveloped viruses mainly consist of three types of structural proteins; spike protein (S), membrane protein (M), envelope protein (E). The internal parts of viruses include a nucleocapsid protein (N). Many viruses, whether enveloped or non-enveloped, carry stealthy spikes that bind to host cell receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The binding of spike protein to the receptor provokes fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane, resulting in internalization of the viral nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In many cases, the spike protein penetrates the plasma membrane of infected cells and fuses adjacent cells to form syncytia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">A variety of drugs have been synthesized for intervening virus activities by interrupting and blocking virus membranes, inactivating genetic contains, and boosting the immune system. Some drugs and active molecules are able to inactive virus or cell receptors to inhibit their attachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Antiviral drugs have major limitations. Inactivation of viruses by chemical drugs requires passing across the rigid capsid of the virus membrane. Chemotherapies (drugs) can interfere with the virus life-cycle after infection, but the host may suffer harmful side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Besides, rapid viral mutations, alteration of the spike protein, and subsequently changing the viral antigenicity are considered critical challenges to vaccine and drug designation, which reduce their effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Many pathogenetic viruses, including the novel coronavirus, can alter their genetic code to survive against effective drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. With the example of AZT drug resistance in HIV treatment leading to a healthcare cost crisis, the search for alternative therapies that can attack multiple targets in the virus is becoming more urgent to prevent viral resistance. Apart from drug resistance, common treatments should be used for several weeks to be effective against microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">As alternative antiviral therapies, scientists have introduced physical methods and techniques to disrupt viral functionalities. For example, it has been demonstrated that the application of light beams can be useful for viral inactivation (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A combination of physical methods and an understanding of the physicochemical mechanisms of viral inactivation will be effective in designing and developing tools for viral elimination with improved efficacy, safety, and long-term application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This article reviews irradiation-dependent physical methods and studies related to the inactivation of viruses, especially enveloped viruses such as HIV, influenza, or hepatitis, which are responsible for serious problems in humans (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The virus inactivation using electromagnetic waves.

Although this method is suitable for the sterilization of biological samples or producing inactivated vaccines, it is limited to the environment and personal protective equipment (PPE). Moreover, ionizing radiation such as X-ray and Gamma ray have been widely used in medical sciences, such as radiology in diagnosis of diseases and treatment. Energetic photons, including gamma rays, X-rays, and UVC light, can release their energy when interacting with coronaviruses and damage the viral genome either directly by radiolytic cleavage of genetic material or indirectly by the action of radicals on viral nucleic acids, as shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].

UV radiation is a well-known means of inactivating all known microorganisms and viruses. However, on the downside, UV radiation plays a key role in the initiation phase of skin cancer by causing DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].

UVC is the strongest UV light with the most potent antimicrobial/antiviral properties. UVA (320â400Â nm) is less energetic but 20 times more intense and therefore induces the formation of cyclobutene pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) along with a variety of oxidatively generated lesions, such as single strand breaks and oxidized bases. UVB, 280â320Â nm leads to the formation of CPDs and pyrimidine (6â4) pyrimidone photoproducts (64PPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].

UVC damages the viral genome, but there are some reports of damage to viral proteins. In the case of DNA viruses, two major UV-induced lesions, pyrimidine dimers (Py-Py) and pyrimidine (6â4) pyrimidones [Py(6â4)Py], which arise at the same nucleotide sites, are lethal and mutagenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In contrast, RNA differs from DNA mainly in the presence of uracil nucleotides instead of thymine.

At all wavelengths, the number of plaques decreased exponentially with the total dose of DUV-LED energy. The DUV-LED, operating at a wavelength of 265Â nm, showed the highest inactivation effect on SARS-CoV-2.

These mutations forced by irradiation are known as "mutational signatures", which could be tracked by high-throughput nucleotide sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].

The results showed complete inactivation of PV by doses of 45Â kGy, preserving the surface epitopes required for high immunogenicity during vaccination. Inactivated Sabin viruses stimulated equivalent or enhanced neutralizing antibody responses in Wistar rats compared with commercially used IPV products. Their approach reduces the biosafety risk of the current method of PV vaccine production by using the Sabin strains instead of the wild-type neurovirulent strains.

In contrast to influenza A (H3N8), PRRSV, the second single-stranded RNA virus analyzed in this study, was completely inactivated with a dose of 10.4Â kGy at similar titers. These differences could be due to differential sensitivity to irradiation caused, for example, by different genome structures (one RNA strand in PRRSV versus a segmented genome in influenza A) and different bacterial genera.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] used the pulsed fs laser (800Â nm) with an optimal power of 4Â Î¼W and a cell exposure time of 10Â ms to deliver different amounts of anti-retroviral drugs (ARVs) including Nevirapine, Efavirenz, Ritonavir, and Raltegravir into HIV-1 infected TZMbl cells. Then, alterations in cellular responses were assessed in cellular morphology, viability, cytotoxicity, and luciferase activity. In the presence of ARVs, laser-exposed cells showed a significant reduction in viral infection and cell viability and increased cytotoxicity. This study proved that fs laser pulses effectively promote the transmission of ARVs to HIV-1-infected TZMbl cells and lead to a significant reduction in HIV-1 infection. Maphanga et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>] used fs laser pulses for the targeted in vitro delivery of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs into HIV-1 infected cells. In the experiment, HEK 293Â T cells were used to produce HIV-1 enveloped pseudovirus (ZM53) to infect TZM-bl cells, which were later treated with laser pulses emitted by a titanium sapphire laser (800Â nm, 1Â kHz, 113Â fs,â~â6.5Â ÂµW) to create sub-microscopic pores in the cell membrane to allow the influx of extracellular medium. Therefore, optical delivery of ARVâs increased drug absorption, enhanced drug efficacy, subsequently reduced HIV-1 infection.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Approaches of selective virus inactivation using light</title><p id="Par75">Viruses are unlikely to increase resistance to light radiation, as is the case with drugs. However, ionizing radiation affects different tissues regardless of their location in the body and does not have the complicated delivery to different body compartments. Thus, an alternative strategy is to eradicate viruses from infected reservoirs using targeting-based approaches. Attaching markers such as fluorescent dyes to viruses using different strategies and the resulting generation of individual emission wavelengths could enhance the ability and selectivity of lasers to inactivate viruses. The use of light beams as inactivators and exciters for viral genetic content or receptors can be combined with photosensitizers to improve damaging the viral membrane. The selectivity of this photo-inactivation strategy could be improved via conjugation with antibodies targeting either virus envelope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>] or envelope-expressing infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. However, the ideal treatment should use light and no mediators to minimize side effects and, of course, costs. With this viewpoint, an attractive strategy for selective inactivation of viruses is the use of NIR sub-picosecond laser [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>] and visible ultrashort pulsed laser [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>] which have showed promising results for treatment of blood-borne viral diseases.</p><p id="Par76">Viral inactivation of tissues and organs could be accomplished by low energy lasers or fs lasers. It is believed that injection or inhalation of nontoxic nebulized photosensitizers into the lungs and the delivery of appropriate light irradiation into deep organs may be practical to kill respiratory viruses such as Influenza [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>]. Another alternative to virus inactivation in infected organs could be an innovative combination of normothermic ex vivo perfusion and light-based inactivation using infected human lungs. This strategy has been used to inactivate HCV virus in HCV-infected human lungs in a short period of time during lung transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Conclusion and future perspective</title><p id="Par77">We review here the rapid advances in the use of physical irradiation methods for viral inactivation. Compared to chemical drugs and materials used to inactivate viruses and treat diseases, the variety of physical techniques that include electromagnetic light waves with wavelengths of gamma rays, X-rays, UV rays, and visible light offer unique opportunities for eliminating deadly viruses. In our review, for each innovative method we decipherer the mechanisms, discuss the key parameters and showcase the recent validation experiments towards efficient viral inactivation, already lead to a range of new tools and devices developed with improved performance. Through detailed analysis, we show that new advances in the characterization of viral genome and proteins during irradiation will be the key to better understanding of mechanism and quantifying each key parameter for efficient viral inactivation without harmful side effects to human and the environment.</p><p id="Par78">Besides, studies on the viral-cell entry during irradiation are also important to develop viable approaches of viral inactivation in vaccine production, downstream diagnostics, and directly in the body for treatment of patients. For enveloped viruses, the irradiation strategies causing the damage of viral envelope proteins are advantageous over the other strategies destroying nucleic acids, to prevent virus mutations. When choosing the appropriate method, we should consider size, shape, structure, and type of the virus. When it goes to antiviral therapy, the implementation ability, repeatability, affordability, and lack of long-term toxicity of the method are the most important factors.</p><p id="Par79">The use of low-energy lights to generate shock wave-like mechanical vibrations can be promising, due to the minimal damage to tissues, high potential for damaging various parts of the virus, reduced treatment time, and deep penetration of the virus into the tissues. The mechanical vibrations on the virus structure could be provoked using pulsed laser via impulsive stimulated Raman scattering, or plasmonic enhancement, while future advances in resonance vibrational studies may improve light-based virus inactivation.</p><p id="Par80">Our world is facing many threats: COVID -19, the many potential viral epidemics and possible future pandemics that have already caused many deaths in all countries facing limited medical resources. Therapies using physical waves and in combination with chemical drugs and materials may produce synergistic effect for virus inactivation. Irradiation strategies are preferred because they do not destroy the cells and our bodies, are environmentally friendly, and are cost-effective. However, compared to thermal methods and ionizing approaches, it is important to ensure high efficiency of virus inactivation due to the mild nature of non-ionizing strategies. Therefore, further research is needed to fully understand the potential for viral effects, cytotoxicity, and possible viral recovery after non-thermal methods.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Outlook</title><p id="Par81"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par82">Using physical waves and irradiations with non-destructive controlled parameters are promising to inactivate viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, without the risk of drug resistance.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par83">Recent reports from different research groups claim the non-ionizing blue light can inactivate the virus in an unknown mechanism.
