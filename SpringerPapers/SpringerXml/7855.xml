splitting is widely considered to be a critical step for efficient renewable energy production, storage and usage such as sustainable hydrogen production, rechargeable metal-air batteries and fuel cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr"

Currently, the state-of-the-art catalysts to split water are IrO<sub>2</sub> and Pt for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively, with ∼1.5 V to reach 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> current (for integrated solar water splitting)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. However, the price and scarcity of these noble metals present barriers for their scale-up deployment. A great deal of effort and progress have been made towards efficient OER and HER catalysts with earth-abundant materials, such as cobalt phosphate, perovskite oxides and transition metal oxides (TMOs)/layer-double-hydroxides for OER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, and transition metal dichalcogenides and nickel molybdenum alloy for HER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. However, pairing the two electrode reactions together in an integrated electrolyser for practical use is difficult due to the mismatch of pH ranges in which these catalysts are stable and remain the most active. In addition, producing different catalysts for OER and HER requires different equipment and processes, which could increase the cost. Therefore, developing a bifunctional electrocatalyst with high activity towards both OER and HER in the same electrolyte becomes important yet challenging. A recent work demonstrated an impressive water photolysis efficiency of 12.3% by using efficient NiFe layer double hydroxide bifunctional catalyst<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. It was shown that 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> overall water-splitting current was achieved in 1 M NaOH solution at ∼1.7 V (iR uncorrected) with a 470-mV overpotential from the equilibrium. Despite this exciting progress, new bifunctional materials with low overpotential and long-term stability are still needed. Here we demonstrate a novel bifunctional catalyst of lithium-induced ultra-small NiFeO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> nanoparticles (NPs), with a remarkable performance of only 1.51 V (280 mV overpotential) to achieve 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> current in 1 M KOH solution for long-term operation.</p><p id="Par4">We choose TMOs as candidates to develop bifunctional catalysts due to their good stability within a wide range of electrochemical window in base<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. They have been shown as good catalysts for either OER or HER but there has not been an example that a single TMO can be an efficient catalyst for both reactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Previously our group has developed lithium-ion intercalation and extraction methods in battery cells to tune layered material catalysts, such as MoS<sub>2</sub> and LiCoO<sub>2</sub>, and showed significant enhancement of catalytic activity for HER and OER, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Our hypothesis here is that the electrochemical lithium reaction method can tune the material properties of certain TMO catalysts to become highly active in both OER and HER for overall water splitting.</p><p id="Par5">In this work, we explore a conversion reaction mechanism between Li and TMOs to improve the catalytic behaviour. Tarascon’s work on lithium-ion batteries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> shows that, conversion reaction (MO+2 Li<sup>+</sup>+2 e<sup>−</sup>⇌M+Li<sub>2</sub>O) takes place by breaking the M–O bonds and forming M–M and Li–O bonds, which is different from the lithium interaction or extraction mechanism employed in our previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Conversion reaction can cause dramatic change in the MO materials (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Once lithium is extracted to reform MO, the initial MO particles would transform into much smaller ones with few nanometres in diameter (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. This morphological transformation opens up opportunities to increase the surface area of TMOs tremendously. With the limited number of lithium galvanostatic cycles, these small particles can be maintained interconnected (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c,d</xref>). We assume that the ultra-small, interconnected TMO NPs present an ideal structure for highly active and stable electro water splitting because they create a great number of grain boundaries as active centres, expose additional catalytically active sites and strongly interact with each other during the delithiation reaction process which helps to maintain good mechanical and electrical contacts. However, large number of battery cycles may break off the particles, resulting in the loss of connection and form a thick solid electrolyte interface covering the surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, which induce negative effects on the catalytic performance of TMOs (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). Therefore, we will need to limit the number of battery cycles to select the most active catalyst. Herein, we demonstrate the general efficacy of lithium galvanostatic cycling in improving OER catalytic activities of TMOs (M=Fe, Co, Ni, and their mixture). High-performance OER catalyst is then selected to show the enhanced HER activity. With two half reactions greatly improved by the galvanostatic cycling method, efficient and stable overall water splitting by the bifunctional catalyst is presented.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Schematic of TMO morphology evolution under galvanostatic cycles.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>–<bold>e</bold>) TMO particles gradually change from single crystalline to ultra-small interconnected crystalline NPs.

The pristine CoO NPs are ∼20 nm in diameter and uniformly distributed on CNFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1079">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>, we denote this sample as pristine CoO/CNF). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and the corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) images suggest the monocrystalline nature of pristine CoO NPs (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). The spacing of (111) atomic planes is measured to be 0.24 nm, consistent with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. The CoO/CNF was then assembled in a lithium-ion battery pouch cell for galvanostatic lithiation (charge) and delithiation (discharge) processes (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>, see Methods)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Small charge/discharge current (compared with regular battery cycling) was selected for thorough reaction (see Methods), which also helps to maximally maintain the integration of the particles for long-term stability. The morphology of CoO begins to change after one cycle of the charge/discharge process (we denote the cycled samples as 1-cycle, 2-cycle and 5-cycle CoO/CNF). While the whole lattices are still visible, the fringes become curvy and loose compared with pristine CoO (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Defects are created during the cycling process, as suggested by the blurred areas present in the zoomed-in TEM image. The average (111) spacing of 1-cycle CoO is ∼0.26 nm, slightly expanded from the pristine 0.24 nm. This lattice expansion and distortion in the first cycle lower the energy barrier for a small lattice domain to change orientation, preparing for the large particle to be further transformed into smaller particles in the following cycles. The TEM images of 2-cycle CoO/CNF show that the monocrystalline CoO particle is converted into interconnected crystalline NPs, with ultra-small sizes ∼2 nm (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). The FFT image with significantly more diffraction spot patterns than pristine CoO also suggest that many lattice orientations are present in this single CoO particle. The ultra-small NPs create boundaries, defects and dislocations, which are considered to be active sites of electrocatalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Two neighbouring NPs merge together at the boundary without any visible gaps present, suggesting that they are strongly interconnected with each other that ensures good electrical and mechanical contact for efficient and stable catalysis. Similar structures are also observed in NiO, FeO and NiFeO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> NPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1079">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). As indicated by the TEM images of 5-cycle CoO/CNF (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1079">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), further cycles do not significantly reduce the sizes of the interconnected NPs or even convert them into amorphous, suggesting that ultra-small NPs have reached the minimum domain sizes under the specific cycling condition. In areas away from the integrated particle, we observe that several ultra-small CoO crystals are detached, which indicates that more cycling number harms the integration of the whole particle and may also loosen the contacts between the interconnected NPs. X-ray diffraction spectroscopy of pristine CoO has three distinguished peaks, which however disappear in all of the battery-cycled samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1079">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>), indicating that the sizes of the interconnected NPs are under the X-ray coherence length<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Raman spectra of pristine and 2-cycle CoO/CNF confirm that the phase of CoO is not changed after the battery cycling process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1079">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>TEM images and OER activities of battery-cycled CoO/CNF.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) TEM image of pristine CoO/CNF.

The as-prepared catalysts were tested in 0.1 M KOH solution. All of the potentials are referred to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and have been iR corrected unless noted (see Methods). Pristine CoO/CNF shows a sluggish OER process with an onset potential around 1.59 V and a Tafel slope of 69.8 mV per decade (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). The activity of 1-cycle CoO/CNF is significantly improved, achieving a reduced onset potential to ∼1.55 V while exhibiting a slightly increased Tafel slope of 83.7 mV per decade. The increased surface area, atomic defects and distortions created during the first cycle in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref> are considered to contribute to the improved catalytic activity. The OER performance is continuously improved after two galvanostatic cycles, as additional surface areas and active sites are introduced by those ultra-small interconnected NPs (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c,e</xref>). While the Tafel slope (73.6 mV per decade) of 2-cycle CoO/CNF is not changed much, the onset potential is further lowered to ∼1.51 V, significantly improving the OER activity which reaches 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> anodic current at ∼1.57 V. Five-cycle CoO/CNF shows a degraded OER performance compared with the 2-cycle sample, consistent with the analysis of the TEM image (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>) that some of the ultra-small NPs are detached from and lose electrical contact with the mother particle. The electrochemical double layer capacities of the catalysts, which represent the active surface areas, are obtained by applying cyclic voltammograms at a series of scanning rates (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1079">Supplementary Figs 7 and 8</xref>). The trend of the capacity versus the cycle number agrees well with that of the OER activity, where 2-cycle CoO/CNF exhibits the largest capacity. Therefore, we conclude that two galvanostatic cycles is an optimized condition for improving the catalytic performance of as-synthesized TMO NPs. While the conversion from monocrystalline particle to polycrystalline NPs helps to significantly increase the active sites and surface areas, whether those ultra-small crystalline NPs become amorphous under the OER conditions is worth to be further examined. The TEM image of 2-cycle CoO/CNF after OER catalysis is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1079">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>, in which the structures and sizes of interconnected crystalline NPs are well maintained and no sign of amorphization process is observed. No Li signal is observed in 2-cycle CoO/CNF by electron energy loss spectroscopy as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1079">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>, indicating that the concentration of residual Li is lower than the electron energy loss spectroscopy detection limit. In addition, the molar ratio of Li to Co in 2-cycle CoO/CNF is determined to be 1:23.4 by inductive coupled plasma mass spectroscopy, suggesting the negligible amount of residual Li after the cycling process. To shed light on how Li doping influences the catalytic activities, we doped CoO/CNF with Li by charging the electrode to 1 V versus Li<sup>+</sup>/Li (right above the conversion reaction plateau, Li to Co ratio was determined to be 1:7 by inductive coupled plasma mass spectroscopy). The OER performance shows a slightly decay compared with pristine CoO/CNF in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1079">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>, indicating that Li doping does not contribute to the improvement in OER performance. Combined with the analysis of the great contributions from the increased surface areas as well as capacitances, we therefore conclude that the very small amount of residual Li does not play a role in improving the OER catalysis. We also rule out the possibility of background contributions by performing battery cycling on bare CNF in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1079">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>TMO NPs synthesized on CFP for high-performance catalysis</title><p id="Par8">To avoid the long-term stability and large current bubble-releasing issues of TMO NPs on CNF (due to the use of binder and the hydrophobic nature of carbon respectively), we directly synthesize TMO catalysts on CFP substrates including CoO/CFP, NiO/CFP, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/CFP and the mixed oxide of NiFeO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>/CFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1079">Supplementary Figs 13 to 16</xref>, see Methods).

Galvanostatic cycling shows its general efficacy in improving all of the TMOs from their pristine counterparts, with significantly reduced onset potentials as well as overpotentials to achieve 20 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> OER current (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a–d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1079">Supplementary Figs 18–20</xref>). It is interesting to notice that 2-cycle NiO/CFP shows a significantly increased NiO to NiOOH oxidation peak, again confirming the impressively increased surface areas and active sites, which suggests the potential applications of the galvanostatic cycling method in supercapacitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. The best OER performance comes from 2-cycle NiFeO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>/CFP (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1079">Supplementary Fig. 18</xref>). In 0.1 M KOH, 20 wt% Ir/C reaches 10 and 20 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> at ∼1.53 and 1.58 V, respectively. As a comparison, the OER activity of 2-cycle NiFeO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>/CFP outperforms this noble metal, with only 1.48 (<italic>η</italic><sub>OER 10 mA</sub>=250 mV) and 1.50 V (<italic>η</italic><sub>OER 20 mA</sub>=270 mV) to achieve the corresponding currents (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1079">Supplementary Figs. 18e,f</xref>). This highly efficient catalyst exhibits even better OER performance as pH increases to 14 (1 M KOH; <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). To avoid the overlap of the NiO to NiOOH oxidation peak with the OER onset currents, we scanned the voltage from the positive to the negative direction (the inset of <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>) and determine the onset potential of 2-cycle NiFeO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>/CFP in 1 M KOH to be ∼1.43 V (<italic>η</italic><sub>OER onset</sub>=200 mV), nearly 40 mV lower than Ir/C. The OER current of 2-cycle NiFeO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>/CFP then ramps up quickly to 200 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> at only 1.51 V. This high OER activity benefits from the small Tafel slope of 31.5 mV per decade which does not show the curve bending as observed in pristine NiFeO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>/CFP and Ir/C, suggesting the improved kinetic and bubble-releasing processes by galvanostatic cycling (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>). To avoid the oxidation peak and therefore obtain a larger range of current for NiFeO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>/CFP Tafel slope analysis, we reversely swept the <italic>I–V</italic> curve as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1079">Supplementary Fig. 21</xref> and calculated the Tafel slope to be 34.2 mV per decade, very close to the forward sweeping result. It is worth noting that the voltage sweeping rate in all of the tests is 5 mV s<sup>−1</sup>, which is slow enough to reach the steady state for accurate analysis of Tafel slopes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1079">Supplementary Fig. 22</xref>). The reverse scanning method also helps to reveal an interesting conclusion that in more concentrated KOH solution the oxidation process can go deeper on the surface of the NiFeO<sub>x</sub> catalyst (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1079">Supplementary Fig. 23</xref>).

The Tafel slope increases from 84.6 to 150 mV per decade after the battery cycling process, which may be related to a change of the reaction pathway or a mass transport limit (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1079">Supplementary Fig. 25</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.

Together with the other half reaction of OER, the galvanostatic cycling method creates an attractive bifunctional NiFeO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>/CFP water-splitting catalyst to compete with the combination of Pt and Ir benchmarks. The overall water-splitting polarization of 2-cycle NiFeO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>/CFP bifunctional catalyst exhibits a slightly larger onset voltage than the benchmark combination, but quickly catches up with them due to the facile kinetic and bubble-releasing processes (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). In addition, the sizes of O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> bubbles observed on 2-cycle NiFeO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>/CFP electrodes under 200 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> are distinctively smaller than those on the benchmark electrodes, indicating the great capability for large current operations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1079">Supplementary Movie 1</xref>). The long-term stability testing further illustrates the advantages of 2-cycle NiFeO<sub>x</sub>/CFP over those noble metals (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>).

During the long-term stability testing, it is possible for the oxidation process (MO to MOOH) to get deeper at a very slow rate, gradually reaching to a limit. This may help to create additional active sites and refresh the boundaries of the interconnected particles, which slightly increases the activity.
