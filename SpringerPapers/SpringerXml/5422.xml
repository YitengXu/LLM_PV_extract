However, current industrial hydrogen production processes, such as steam reforming of methane, contribute significantly to the greenhouse effect. Therefore alternative methods, in particular the use of fermentative microorganisms, have attracted scientific interest in recent years. However the low overall yield obtained is a major challenge in biological H<sub>2</sub> production. Thus, a thorough and detailed understanding of the relationships between genome content, gene expression patterns, pathway utilisation and metabolite synthesis is required to optimise the yield of biohydrogen production pathways.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">In this study transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of the hydrogen-producing bacterium <italic>Clostridium butyricum</italic> CWBI 1009 were carried out to provide a biomolecular overview of the changes that occur when the metabolism shifts to H<sub>2</sub> production. The growth, H<sub>2-</sub>production, and glucose-fermentation profiles were monitored in 20 L batch bioreactors under unregulated-pH and fixed-pH conditions (pH 7.3 and 5.2). Conspicuous differences were observed in the bioreactor performances and cellular metabolisms for all the tested metabolites, and they were pH dependent. During unregulated-pH glucose fermentation increased H<sub>2</sub> production was associated with concurrent strong up-regulation of the nitrogenase coding genes. However, no such concurrent up-regulation of the [FeFe] hydrogenase genes was observed. During the fixed pH 5.2 fermentation, by contrast, the expression levels for the [FeFe] hydrogenase coding genes were higher than during the unregulated-pH fermentation, while the nitrogenase transcripts were less abundant. The overall results suggest, for the first time, that environmental factors may determine whether H<sub>2</sub> production in <italic>C. butyricum</italic> CWBI 1009 is mediated by the hydrogenases and/or the nitrogenase.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">This work, contributing to the field of dark fermentative hydrogen production, provides a multidisciplinary approach for the investigation of the processes involved in the molecular H<sub>2</sub> metabolism of clostridia.

id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p id="Par11">Molecular hydrogen has great potential as a clean energy vector given its pollution-free combustion and the ease with which it can be converted into electricity via fuel cells. However, current industrial hydrogen production processes, such as steam reforming of natural gas, release large quantities of CO<sub>2</sub> and thereby contribute substantially to the greenhouse effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Consequently, scientific interest in recent years has focused on alternative methods of hydrogen production, in particular on the use of photosynthetic and fermentative microorganisms for CO<sub>2</sub>-neutral H<sub>2</sub> production from renewable energy sources, such as solar energy and biomass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Nevertheless, a major challenge when using microorganisms for H<sub>2</sub> production is the low yield generally obtained, with typical mesophilic fermentation of carbohydrates supplying only 10 to 20% of the H<sub>2</sub> potentially available in the substrate. Consequently, research in the field of metabolic engineering has investigated different approaches with a view to optimising the yield of well-characterised biohydrogen production pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, such strategies require a thorough and detailed understanding of the relationships between genome content, gene expression patterns, pathway utilisation and metabolite synthesis.</p><p id="Par12">In dark anaerobic fermentation microorganisms break down carbohydrate-rich substrates into organic acids and alcohols while releasing H<sub>2</sub>. Strict anaerobes such as clostridia have been the most widely studied among the various anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria capable of fermentative hydrogen production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. H<sub>2</sub> production in living organisms is always dependent on the presence of H<sub>2</sub>-producing enzymes such as hydrogenases and nitrogenases. [FeFe] hydrogenases, which are especially abundant in clostridia, are well recognised as the main H<sub>2</sub>-producing enzymes in this genus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. By contrast, nitrogenase-mediated hydrogen production has never been proposed for clostridia, even though this is known to be an intrinsic metabolic property of many cyanobacteria and photosynthetic bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Interestingly, in 1960 Carnahan showed that the free-living soil microorganism <italic>Clostridium pasteurianum</italic> is an efficient N<sub>2</sub> fixator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Later <italic>nif</italic> operons were described in <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic> and <italic>C. beijerinckii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], but the contribution of nitrogenase to overall H<sub>2</sub> production in clostridia has not yet been reported in the literature.</p><p id="Par13"><italic>Clostridium butyricum</italic> CWBI 1009, a strain recently isolated from an anaerobic sludge, was previously shown to ferment different carbon substrates at acidic pH to H<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> with formate, butyrate and acetate as the main end-products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It possesses four different [FeFe] hydrogenases, three of which are monomeric belonging to clusters A2, B2 and B3, and one which is a trimeric enzyme representing cluster A8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Despite the fact that optimum growth for this bacterium occurs at pH 7.3, it only starts to produce H<sub>2</sub> when the pH declines due to the natural acidification of the medium as fermentation proceeds. The optimal pH value to produce H<sub>2</sub> under fixed-pH culture conditions was found to be 5.2 and has been discussed in previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Although many studies have described the fermentative activity of <italic>C. butyricum</italic> associated with H<sub>2</sub> production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], a comprehensive analysis of the fermentative pathways at the genomic and proteomic levels has not yet been reported. Relative gene expression profiles, together with the associated proteomic and metabolite data, can now be used to provide the visibility needed for well-targeted metabolic engineering. Moreover, a better understanding of the shifts in gene and protein expression, which occur in response to pH changes and during the growth phase, should facilitate the optimisation of bioreactor performance.</p><p id="Par14">Therefore, in this study three parallel approaches were used to investigate the changes at the molecular level associated with pH-dependent hydrogen production in <italic>C. butyricum</italic> CWBI 1009, namely metabolite analysis, transcriptomics and proteomics. The effect of the naturally decreasing pH was studied with glucose in 20-L batch bioreactors. Additionally, the effect of fixed-pH fermentations was evaluated to provide comparative data under optimal pH conditions for cellular growth (pH 7.3) and H<sub>2</sub> production (pH 5.2), respectively. The genome of <italic>C. butyricum</italic> CWBI 1009, which was unknown until now, was also sequenced to provide better mapping of the RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) reads during natural acidification of the medium. In addition the expression levels of the H<sub>2</sub>-producing enzymes, namely the [FeFe] hydrogenases and the nitrogenase, were determined under different pH conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Experimental design</title><p id="Par15">Three 20-L glucose fermentations were carried out under unregulated-pH conditions (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, A, D and G), allowing characterisation of the impact of naturally decreasing pH on fermentative H<sub>2</sub> production by <italic>C. butyricum</italic> CWBI 1009. Additional glucose fermentations (three replicates for each condition) performed at two fixed pH values, namely 7.3 (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, B, E and H) and 5.2 (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, C, F and I), were carried out to provide comparative data for the interpretation of the results obtained during the unregulated-pH fermentations.

The fermentation results presented below for the triplicated experiments were characterised by standard deviations ranging from 5 to 10% of the absolute value. Therefore, the reproducibility of the results may be considered as sufficient and typical for these kinds of experiments in 20-L bioreactors.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>Characteristics of the different glucose fermentations for</bold><bold><italic>Clostridium butyricum</italic></bold><bold>CWBI 1009 performed under unregulated-pH and at fixed pH 7.3 and 5.2.

Exponential growth followed the lag phase under both pH conditions. At pH 7.3 rapid consumption of glucose was observed (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>H), and the glucose uptake rate peaked at 0.96 ± 0.08 g glucose/h.

The cellular metabolisms for all the tested metabolites varied between the unregulated-pH fermentations and those when the pH was fixed at 5.2 and 7.3. Moreover, the lactate produced during the early stages of fermentation was later consumed, which was not the case with the fermentations carried out under unregulated-pH conditions (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>H and I).

This occurs via the glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase pathway in accordance with the equation: glutamate + ATP + NH<sub>3</sub>↔ glutamine + ADP + Pi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Therefore, the ability to synthesise glutamate and glutamine is essential to the cellular metabolism, since they are involved in the incorporation of inorganic nitrogen into cell material; that is, the synthesis of new proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Further ammonia incorporation occurs through the action of NAD(P)-specific glutamate dehydrogenase, and this protein also was found to be 1.81-fold more abundant at lower pH. Moreover, amino acids such as glutamate have been described as known osmoprotectants and have been shown to play a role in acid tolerance in, for example, <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">The HPLC analyses for metabolites indicated that, in addition to formate, acetate and butyrate were the main fermentation end-products obtained when <italic>C. butyricum</italic> CWBI 1009 was cultured under unregulated-pH conditions (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>G). Therefore, it was not surprising that acetate and butyrate kinases were respectively 1.49- and 1.68-fold more abundant at the lower pH compared to pH 7.3. Additionally, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (thiolase), which catalyses the first steps of the butyrate synthesis pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], was also more abundant at the lower pH (+1.51). Of the other core fermentative enzymes, type II acetaldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase was also more abundant, suggesting that increased alcohol production was associated with decreasing pH.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>H<sub>2</sub> production from glucose at fixed pH 5.2 is likely to be hydrogenase- mediated</title><p id="Par36">Maintaining the <italic>C. butyricum</italic> CWBI 1009 culture at fixed pH 5.2 (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>F) led to a 50% increase in cumulative H<sub>2</sub> production (in comparison to the unregulated-pH culture; Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). Furthermore, bacterial fermentations at fixed acidic pH are commonly used for efficient H<sub>2</sub> production. This is why glucose fermentations were also performed at two different fixed pH values, namely pH 7.3 (control fermentation with best growth) and pH 5.2 (test fermentation with best H<sub>2</sub> production). In addition to the description of the fermentative profiles characteristic for the two fixed pH values, RT-qPCR was used to study the gene expression levels for the [FeFe] hydrogenases and the nitrogenase.</p><p id="Par37">At pH 7.3 no differential gene expression occurred throughout the fermentation (Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A), as was expected given the barely detectable H<sub>2</sub> production (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E). Surprisingly, at fixed pH 5.2, although the H<sub>2</sub> production rate constantly increased during the fermentation, no change in the gene expression pattern was detected between the early and the late exponential stages of fermentation, neither for the nitrogenase nor for the [FeFe] hydrogenases (Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B). This apparent lack of change in the temporal gene expression profile could be due to the fact that the bacterial pre-culture, used to inoculate the reactor, was pre-incubated at pH 5.2 as well. Therefore, the lower H<sub>2</sub> production observed at the beginning of the fixed pH 5.2 fermentation (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>F) was more likely attributable to low cell density rather than any differential [FeFe] hydrogenase gene expression.

Firstly, based on the cDNA copy numbers, <italic>hydA2</italic> is the most abundant hydrogenase and seems to be insignificantly regulated under the two different fixed pH conditions.

Of particular interest also is the observation that during the unregulated-pH fermentation the basal expression levels of the four [FeFe] hydrogenase coding genes were lower than their expression levels at fixed pH 5.2 (10 h incubation, late exponential growth phase, Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B and Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>D).

A Western blot analysis carried out on samples corresponding to the different fermentation stages for both fixed-pH cultures gave no positive signal for the NifH subunit (data not shown). This observation suggests that in contrast to the unregulated-pH glucose fermentation, where a strong up-regulation of nitrogenase genes was observed, H<sub>2</sub> production at fixed pH 5.2 may be essentially hydrogenase-mediated.</p><p id="Par40">To better understand the phenomenon of possibly differential nitrogenase- and hydrogenase-mediated H<sub>2</sub> production in clostridia under different pH conditions, further investigation is required.

Nevertheless, it is tempting to speculate about the significance of the differential carbon metabolisms (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>G and I) observed for fermentation under unregulated- pH compared with fermentation under fixed pH 5.2 condition. This may be an indication of metabolic adaptations affecting the H<sub>2</sub>-producing enzymes, thereby leading to distinct H<sub>2</sub> production profiles (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D and F). Interestingly, it has recently been shown that the nitrogenase-mediated H<sub>2</sub> evolution in a photoheterotrophic bacterium <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</italic> was enhanced by ethanol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].

Reactive protein bands were detected using NBF/BdP reagents (Sigma).</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Sample preparation for 2D-DIGE</title><p id="Par53">Freshly harvested cells were resuspended in a denaturation buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 2% ASB-14, 20 mM DTT, Complete EDTA free [Roche], 1 mM EDTA pH 8.5, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5) and intensively vortexed for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the suspensions were briefly sonicated and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min to remove any insoluble material. In order to discard the remaining salts, fatty acids and nucleic acids, the protein extracts were precipitated three times and cleaned twice with a 2D-clean up Kit (GE Healthcare). Protein pellets were then resuspended in a DIGE labelling buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 2% ASB-14, EDTA free anti-protease cocktail [Roche], 0.5 mM EDTA 50 mM TRIS adjusted at pH 8.5). The protein concentration was estimated with an RC/DC protein assay kit (BioRad Laboratories), and was adjusted to a value between 5 and 10 mg/ml for optimal CyDye labelling. Each sample (containing 25 μg of protein) was labelled with 0.2 nmol of either Cy3 or Cy5 (minimal labelling). At the same time, an internal standard consisting of equimolar amounts of the two samples was labelled with Cy2 (GE Healthcare). The labelling reaction was stopped after 30 min by adding 5 nM of lysine. The Cy2, Cy3- and Cy5-labelled proteins were pooled together prior to isoelectrofocussing with the IPGphor3 IEF System (GE Healthcare). Pooled samples were reduced by adding 20 mM DTT, resuspended in a Drystrip rehydration buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 2% ASB-14 w/v, 0.6% IPG Buffer [GE Healthcare] v/v), and then supplemented with Destreak solution (GE Healthcare), to provide a final volume of 450 μl which was spread on a 24-cm regular strip holder. The 3-11 NL IPG Drystrips (GE Healthcare) were passively rehydrated in the strip holder for 10 h at 20°C prior to running the IEF under the following conditions: 50 V for 2 h (step), 200 V for 200 Vh (step), 500 V for 150 Vh (gradient), 500 V for 500 Vh (step), 1,000 V for 500 Vh (gradient), 8,000 V for 13,500 Vh (gradient), 8,000V for 8,0000 Vh (step) and 500 V for 10 h (step); with a maximum current setting fixed at 50 μA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. After the first electrophoretic migration (first dimension), the strips were reduced in an equilibration buffer (50% glycerol v/v, 4% SDS w/v, 6 M urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl adjusted to pH 8.8) and incubated with 300 mM DTT for 15 min. The strips were then alkylated for 15 min in the same equilibration solution with DTT replaced by 350 mM of iodoacetamide. After equilibration, the strips were put on top of a 12.5% acrylamide gel in a Laemmli SDS electrophoresis buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 1% SDS w/v). Electrophoresis was carried out overnight at 1 W/gel. Following migration, the gels were scanned (Typhoon 9400, GE Healthcare) at a resolution of 100 μm for the excitation wavelengths corresponding to each CyDye. The scanner generated 18 gel images for each biological replicate (9 images for the comparison between the two pH values and 6 images for the internal standard) which were analysed with the DeCyder V7.0 software (GE Healthcare). The co-detection of the three CyDye-labeled forms for each spot was done using the Differential In-gel Analysis (DIA) module. Statistical analysis was carried out in the Biological Variation Analysis (BVA) module after inter-gel matching. Protein spots that resulted in a statistically significant Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test value (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, n = 6) were considered as being differentially abundant at pH 5.2 compared to pH 7.3.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>In-gel digestion and mass spectrometry</title><p id="Par54">Protein identification was performed using preparative gels (150 μg of loaded material) prepared under the same experimental conditions, but with only one CyDye to label the protein sample (Cy5). In addition, the gel plates were treated with a Bind-silane solution for spot picking. The resulting scanned gels were matched with the BVA module. Matched spots presenting a statistical difference were detected using the Ettan Dalt Spot Picker (GE Healthcare). Subsequently, the proteins in the gel pieces were washed (three times with Milli-Q water and 100% ACN and three times with 25 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> and 100% ACN) to remove excess detergent and buffer. After a final dehydration step in ACN, the gel pieces were rehydrated and treated with 2 μl of a 5 ng/μl trypsin proteomic grade solution (Roche) for 2 h at 4°C, to ensure sufficient diffusion in the gel. The temperature was then raised to 37°C for an overnight digestion. After tryptic digestion, the resulting peptides were extracted from the gel pieces by adding 5 μl of a 1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) v/v, 30% ACN v/v solution, and vortexing for 30 min. 1 μl of the resulting extract was dropped on a 384-600 MTP Anchorship MALDI target plate (Bruker Daltonic), previously spotted with a 3% w/v HCCA matrix (Sigma) dissolved in acetone. Each drop was washed 3 times with a 10 mM (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(HPO<sub>4</sub>) solution. Protein identification was carried out with MALDI-TOF/TOF instrumentation (Ultraflex II, Bruker Daltonic) in MS and MS/MS modes and the Mascot search engine was configured with a maximal mass error rate at 100 ppm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].
