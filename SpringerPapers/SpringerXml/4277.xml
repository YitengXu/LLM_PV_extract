Designing an efficient and selective electrocatalysis system for electrochemical conversion reactions remains a challenge due to a lack of understanding of the reaction mechanism. Shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) is a promising strategy for experimentally unraveling a reaction pathway and rate-limiting step by detecting intermediate species and catalytically active sites that occur during the reaction regardless of substrate. In this review, we introduce the SHINERS principle and its historical developments. Furthermore, we discuss recent SHINERS applications and developments for investigating intermediate species involved in a variety of electrocatalytic reactions.</p></abstract><kwd-group

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Environmental deterioration has become a major concern around the world. Energy-generating processes are currently reliant on fossil fuels, which emit greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane, and nitrous oxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Based on the British Petroleum Statistical Review of World Energy in 2020, fossil fuels accounted for 84.3% of the overall energy consumption in 2019. In line with this, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increased by 0.5% in 2018, reaching 34,169 million tons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Accumulated CO<sub>2</sub> molecules in the atmosphere primarily contribute to environmental deterioration by lowering seawater pH and causing global warming through the greenhouse effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">Replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources, such as hydropower, wind, and solar, as well as directly converting CO<sub>2</sub> into other chemicals using renewable energy sources, have all proven to be effective strategies for mitigating CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Hydrogen is another promising candidate for replacing fossil fuels because of its ability to transport energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Chemical energy is converted to electricity in a fuel cell via hydrogen oxidation reaction and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Moreover, renewable energy sources can be used to obtain green hydrogen via a water-splitting reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These approaches have been studied and tested as a possible solution to environmental problems.</p><p id="Par4">It is important to investigate the reaction pathway and rate-determining step (RDS) in environmentally friendly energy conversion processes, where essential intermediate species are involved in the reaction. Researchers could develop new ideas based on the RDS to produce a superior electrocatalyst with optimal binding strengths for the key intermediates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. For example, OOH* and CO* intermediates are involved in the electrochemical reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> to CO. When the COOH* binding strength is extremely weak to be adsorbed at a specific surface, increasing the binding strength can improve catalytic performance by facilitating the RDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">In situ surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) has been used to investigate the reaction mechanisms of various electrochemical reactions, including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], oxygen evolution reaction (OER) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], ORR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and CO<sub>2</sub> reduction reaction (CO<sub>2</sub>RR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Raman measurement collects the inelastic photon scattered from the excitation of vibrational modes within the sample and at the surface. It can detect catalyst phase evolution and intermediate species adsorbed on the catalyst surface. In situ SERS allows for detection of more surface vibrations in a broader spectral range, such as metal–oxygen and metal–carbon in the low wavenumber region, in comparison with in situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced Infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In addition, the prisms used as a substrate in ATR-SEIRAS impose limitations in terms of electrolyte pH and available wavenumber range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], while SERS is measured on an actual catalyst electrode. Furthermore, analysis of SERS spectra is straight-forward because background subtraction is not needed as in ATR-SEIRAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, the catalyst surfaces that can be investigated by SERS are mostly Au, Ag, and Cu metals that have an intrinsic ability to facilitate surface plasmon resonance and amplify Raman signals generated at the surface. Other metals, such as Pd, Pt, Ni, and Co, have also been investigated, but the Raman enhancement was relatively low, and the adsorption of the chemical species on catalyst surfaces was difficult to detect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">To overcome the limitation, shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) has been proposed as a general method for enhancing Raman signals from surface intermediate species in electrocatalysis reactions. The plasmonic core in SHINERS is coated with a thin protective layer, which prevents direct interaction between a probe molecule and the plasmonic core while allowing for surface plasmon resonance. The shell-isolated nanoparticle (SHIN) is then placed on the target substrate to detect molecules adsorbed at the surface of a substrate. In this regard, it has been reported that this method can be applied to any kind of substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In addition, the shell can improve the plasmonic core stability in a wide range of pH and electrolytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Here, the historical development and fundamental principle of SHINERS technology are discussed. Next, recent advances of SHINERS in investigating reaction mechanisms of electrochemical reactions, such as ORR, CORR, CO electrooxidation reaction, OER, and nitrate reduction reaction (NO<sub>3</sub>RR), are outlined. Finally, the potential application of SHINERS in other electrocatalysis fields is discussed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Principle of SHINERS</title><p id="Par7">The enhancement in SERS mainly originates from the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). The LSPR is a special phenomenon that occurs by collective coherent oscillating modes of electrons on nanoparticle surfaces under light illumination, as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a. The oscillating mode causes localized electromagnetic fields around the nanoparticle surface, which contribute to the enhancement of Raman intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold> Illustration of the localized surface plasmon resonance on the nanoparticle surface, reproduced with permission from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].

The local electromagnetic field in the nanogap between two or more nanoparticles is strong because of the electromagnetic coupling of the nanoparticles. According to Tian’s group, the SERS enhancement factor of Au nanosphere dimer increased by 10,000 times from 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>9</sup> when the gap distance reduced from 10 to 2 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, reducing the nanogap between each nanoparticle has its limitation since electron quantum tunneling effects between the coupled nanoparticles will occur. The electron tunneling, e.g., charge transfer across the narrow junction in the sub-nanometer level, decreases the electric field across the junction and thus causes a considerable reduction in the electromagnetic field enhancements across the dimer junction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">At the interface of the core–shell nanoparticle and the plasmonically inactive electrode (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b and c), the field enhancement is more intensified around the contact between the core–shell nanoparticle and the electrode film. Under light illumination, the core–shell nanoparticle induces a mirror plasmon oscillation from the electrode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The coupling of those oscillating plasmon results in a high electromagnetic field concentrated around the contact point, which further contribute to the amplification of Raman intensity from probed molecules.</p><p id="Par10">Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the historical progress on SERS application in catalysis, from the discovery of the SERS effect to the borrowing strategy, SHINERS method, and SHINERS satellite structures. In 1974, Fleischmann et al. discovered that the Raman signal of adsorbed pyridine was significantly enhanced on electrochemically roughened silver electrodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Later on, in 1977, Van Duyne et al. reported that the Raman signal from pyridine adsorbed was about 10<sup>5</sup>–10<sup>6</sup> times stronger than that of bulk pyridine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The researchers initially concluded that the significant enhancement of the Raman signal was due to an increase in the amount of pyridine absorbed at the electrode surface. However, it was later revealed that the enhancement was due to the localized electromagnetic field formed around the metallic nanostructures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The historical illustration of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy for the catalysis application.

However, only Ag, Au, and Cu metals have been found to have high enhancement factors of Raman signals because these metals intrinsically generate a large electromagnetic field around the metal nanoparticle surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. To overcome the limitation and probe various catalyst surfaces in addition to Ag, Au, and Cu, a borrowing strategy has been utilized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, the objective was to deposit a thin layer of the catalytically active material of interest, represented by silver color, on the yellow-colored SERS-active material. As a result, the catalyst surface can borrow a localized electric field from the under layer. Despite the utility of the borrowing strategy, obtaining vibrational information of adsorbed molecules on atomically flat surfaces, such as various single-crystalline electrodes, which are widely used as a model system in surface science and electrochemistry, was difficult because flat electrodes are relatively inactive for SERS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Tian et al. developed SHINERS in 2010 to solve the limitations of the catalyst used in SERS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a shows the SHINERS electrode structure and working principle. They synthesized Au nanospheres coated with pinhole-free and ultrathin silica (or alumina) shells. The Au/SiO<sub>2</sub> core/shell nanoparticles were coated onto the substrate adsorbed by probed molecules. The principle is the same as that of tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS), in which the Au tip end can provide localized electromagnetic field enhancement, and the probed molecule can borrow the enhancement from the Au tip, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b. In SHINERS, the core–shell nanoparticles act as the TERS tip. The layer of nanoparticles spread over the catalyst electrode provides many TERS tips, resulting in a very strong Raman signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Furthermore, since silica shell is usually more inactive than the Au surface for many catalytic reactions and intermediate adsorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], it can act as a protective layer for the conservation of SERS-active Au core and the inhibition of the interaction between Au and probed molecules, which is a great advantage of the SHINERS method.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The comparison between SHINERS working principle with other <bold>a</bold> shell-isolated mode: SHINERS. <bold>b</bold> non-contact mode: tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, reproduced with permission from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

Different sizes of nanoparticles have different extinction spectra and resonance wavelengths under light illumination, which affects the Raman enhancement factor, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Fang et al. evaluated the SERS activity of Au nanoparticles with sizes ranging from 16 to 160 nm that were adsorbed using pyridine as the probe molecule in the absence of a silica shell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b shows the SERS spectra of pyridine adsorbed on Au nanoparticles of different sizes. At a diameter of 135 nm, the SERS intensity of v<sub>1</sub> pyridine vibration positioned at 1007 cm<sup>−1</sup> was at its maximum (approximately 32,000 counts s<sup>−1</sup> mW<sup>−1</sup>). Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c shows the relationship between SERS intensity and nanoparticle size. These results show that there is an optimum nanoparticle size that is consistent with the 633 nm laser excitation wavelength. The resonance wavelength of SERS is widely known to be dependent on the nanoparticle size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Shell thickness also affects the Raman signal enhancement in SHINERS. As shown in the three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (3D-FDTD) simulation result from a 2 × 2 array of 55 nm Au@SiO<sub>2</sub> on Au substrate (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d), the distribution of electromagnetic field enhancement changes with the thickness of the SiO<sub>2</sub> shell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A common trend that electromagnetic field decreases with distance from nanoparticle is observed for 2 and 8 nm SiO<sub>2</sub> thicknesses while stronger field occurs on a broader space in the case of 2 nm SiO<sub>2</sub> by LSPR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. When the SiO<sub>2</sub> shell becomes thinner, the distance between the Au core-Au core and Au core-Au substrate decreases. Therefore, the LSPR can be occurred on the junction between Au core-Au core and Au core-Au substrate, resulting in stronger electromagnetic field enhancement. As a result, the Raman peak intensity of pyridine adsorbed on the smooth Au@SiO<sub>2</sub>-coated Au substrate decreases as the SiO<sub>2</sub> shell thickness increases (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e). Tian’s group also plotted the peak intensity of the Raman vibration positioned at 1013 cm<sup>−1</sup> (normalized for the signal intensity obtained at 2 nm thickness) against the shell thickness (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>f) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This result shows that a thin silica layer is preferred for use in the local electric field from the Au core, provided that a pinhole-free silica layer can be grown.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold> The extinction efficiency of Au nanospheres with different diameters, reproduced with permission from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].

The Au nanospheres are generally synthesized using the method developed by Turkevich and Frens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In the synthetic method, HAuCl<sub>4</sub> solution was first heated, and sodium citrate solution was subsequently added. After the solution color changed to red, the heating was continued for 30 min, and the resultant solution was cooled to room temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Sodium citrate acts as a reducing agent and a stabilizing agent to produce monodisperse and uniform Au nanoparticles. Nanosphere particle size can be controlled by adjusting the amount of sodium citrate. If the amount of sodium citrate is reduced, the size of the nanosphere would be small [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Nanorods have been widely used in SERS activity control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Au nanorod was first synthesized based on a method by Sau and Murphy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The HAuCl<sub>4</sub> was mixed with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), which served as a shape-controlling agent for the gold nanoparticle. Next, NaBH<sub>4</sub> solution, a reducing agent, was added while stirring, and the solution had a pale brown-yellow color. The seed solution was then added to the growth solution consisting of AgNO<sub>3</sub>, CTAB, and HAuCl<sub>4</sub>. The Ag<sup>+</sup> ions serve as sacrificial ions, allowing for the reduction of Au<sup>3+</sup> ions to form Au nanorods. Afterward, (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (APTMS) solution was added to the nanorod solution while stirring, and sodium silicate was added for SiO<sub>2</sub> layer coating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Quyen et al. demonstrated that the Raman intensity of rhodamine 6G captured with a rod-shaped Au@SiO<sub>2</sub> as the SERS material was more than 3 times higher than that captured with spherical-shaped Au@SiO<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The signal enhancement was attributed to the different photophysical property of Au@SiO<sub>2</sub> nanorods. It had a long-wavelength band in the near-infrared region with a high absorption intensity.</p><p id="Par17">Sharp edges are known for increasing the electromagnetic field surrounding plasmonic materials because of their high electron density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Kudelski’s group developed dipyramidal-shaped Au@SiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles to increase the efficiency of Raman signal enhancement in SHINERS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Dipyramidal gold was synthesized by growing pyramids on gold nanoparticle seeds with two key factors: pH and Ag<sup>+</sup> concentration. A solution with a low pH is required to increase the redox potential of ascorbic acid. In this condition, an Ag monolayer can be deposited on the gold nanoparticle surface, stabilizing it and inhibiting tip growth. When using a high pH, the Au<sup>3+</sup> reduction rate increased, resulting in fast deposition along the crystal face and short aspect ratio nanorod development in all directions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Raman spectra of 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (MBA) and 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (MES) were examined on a platinum surface covered with dipyramidal shaped Au nanoparticles and spherical shaped Au nanoparticles for Raman intensity enhancement. In comparison with spherical-shaped Au nanoparticles, dipyramidal-shaped Au showed a significant enhancement in Raman intensity of about 11 and 16 times for MBA and MES, respectively.</p><p id="Par18">In a similar context, Krajczewski et al. synthesized a star-shaped silica-coated gold nanoparticle with a higher number of edges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. They used HAuCl<sub>4</sub> as a gold precursor, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as a reducing agent, and NaOH to trigger the reduction reaction and stabilize the gold nanostar nanoparticle. Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was used as a silica source for SiO<sub>2</sub> coating. The SiO<sub>2</sub> shell growth was controlled by the adjusting reaction time; a 15-min reaction time resulted in a 2–4 nm thick layer. The same group also compared the Raman enhancement efficiency of MBA monolayers on the Pt surface covered with Au nanostar and spherical Au nanoparticles using SERS spectra. The Raman spectra obtained by MBA using Au nanostar as SERS probe were enhanced more than 10 times when compared to spherical Au nanoparticles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Although Au metal is widely used as a core nanoparticle in SHINERS, other metals with high plasmonic characteristics, such as Ag, can also be used. Tian’s group synthesized Ag nanospheres with Au seeds because Ag has a tendency to be oxidized, and this resulted in the formation of anisotropic nanoparticles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Ascorbic acid was used to reduce the Ag<sup>+</sup> ions on the Au seed surfaces. The polyol method has also been used to synthesize silver nanowires. In this method, ethylene glycol is used as a solvent and reducing agent. Polyvinylpyrrolidone acts as a capping agent, regulating the growth rate of silver nanowires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Although Ag is more easily oxidized and mobile than Au, it is significantly less expensive and has a higher surface plasmon efficiency than Au. Tian et al. observed that the enhancement effect of the pyridine Raman intensity in Ag@SiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles was 100 times higher than that in Au@SiO<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">The plasmonic core in the SHINERS was coated with an ultrathin metal oxide shell, such as SiO<sub>2</sub> and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. For silica coating, APTMS solution was added to the solution of Au or Ag nanoparticles under vigorous stirring. The APTMS caused the Au nanoparticle surface to generate silanol functional groups, which are responsive to silicate ion deposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Subsequently, a sodium silicate solution with a pH of 10.2 was added to the mixture. One of the important parameters for SiO<sub>2</sub> shell growth is pH regulation. If the pH of sodium silicate is higher than 11, shell dissolution by NaOH will obstruct its growth, resulting in the detection of a pinhole. If a lower pH (pH 8) is used, the SiO<sub>2</sub> shell will rapidly grow and become excessively thick.</p><p id="Par21">The reaction temperature is another key parameter that must be controlled. Tian’s group used a 90 °C water bath for SiO<sub>2</sub> shell growth instead of the typically used room temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The elevated temperature can reduce the reaction time from 48 or 72 h to just 1 h for producing SiO<sub>2</sub> with a 4 nm shell thickness. The thickness of the silica shell can be delicately adjusted by controlling the reaction time. For example, a 2 nm shell thickness can be achieved by heating the mixture for 20 min, whereas thicker shells of 4 and 6 nm can be obtained by extending the reaction time to 1 and 2 h, respectively.</p><p id="Par22">The atomic layer deposition (ALD) method can also be used to prepare ultrathin SHIN shells. In summary, the ALD method is used to coat Au core nanoparticles by sequentially purging the shell precursor gas, resulting in layer-by-layer growth with high uniformity. This method has been widely used to fabricate metal oxide shells, such as Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and TiO<sub>2</sub> shells, which can be ultrathin and uniform without a pinhole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Zhang et al. used the ALD method to obtain a large quantity of SHINs (1–10 g) with uniform shells by floating metal nanoparticles in a chamber via gas flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Noble metals such as Pt, Pd, Rh, and Ru are known to be inactive for SERS but catalytically active. Coating those metals on the plasmonically-active material also can be a way to probe the catalyst surface by constructing a plasmonic-catalytic hybrid nanoreactor. Acharya et al<italic>.</italic> applied plasmon-induced photocatalytic ALD to deposit atomically thin catalytic-active metal on the Au nanorod surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Firstly, the gold nanorod was individually isolated with a hollow silica shell. For catalytically-active metal coating, the hollow silica-coated Au nanorod dispersion was mixed with metal salt in ethylene glycol (EG) and irradiated with a near-infrared (NIR) laser with a power density of 0.4 W/cm<sup>2</sup> at 35 °C. EG was used to control the metal shell growth around the Au nanorod surface. If stronger reducing agents such as ascorbic acid or hydroxylamine were used, a dendritic shape metal growth would be resulted instead of the conformal metal coating.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>SHINERS application</title><p id="Par24">SHINERS has been used to gain mechanistic insights into various electrochemical reactions, including HER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], ORR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], CO reduction reaction (CORR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], CO oxidation reaction (COOR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>], CO adsorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], OER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], and NO<sub>3</sub>RR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> summarizes the applications of SHINERS in the electrocatalysis research field, as well as the detailed experimental conditions, such as SHINs, electrode, electrolyte, and laser wavelength. According to previous studies, SHINERS has proven to be a powerful method for probing intermediate species that are rarely detected. For example, SHINERS can be used to monitor the vibrational modes of the binding of an atom and a smooth metal electrode with a low SERS activity (e.g., Pt(111)–H and Rh(111)–H) regardless of the type of metal substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The vibrational information obtained by SHINERS could be used to provide further insight into enhanced activities of high-performance electrocatalysts, provided that the binding strength of key intermediates at the catalyst surface has a strong correlation with the catalytic activity based on the Sabatier principle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Furthermore, SHINERS can be applied to a particular metal oxide film, such as electrodeposited iridium oxide (IrO<sub>x</sub>) film [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. This study demonstrated a highly sensitive detection of an Ir = O stretching mode near the onset potential of the OER. In this regard, SHINERS has great potential for the mechanistic investigation of electrocatalysis, and its applications should be discussed in detail. In this chapter, we discuss several case studies in which the SHINERS technique was used to observe surface chemical species for ORR, CORR, COOR, OER, and NO<sub>3</sub>RR. The proposed reaction mechanisms and reaction pathways are discussed in detail based on the SHINERS results.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Summary of reported

Therefore, the difference in the ORR activity between the Pt(111) and Pt(110) and (100) surfaces can be attributed to the difference in the OOH* dissociation. The Tian group also investigated the ORR process on Pt (211) and (311) surfaces with different applied potentials. They discovered two peaks that appeared at 786 and 1042 cm<sup>−1</sup> after the potential reached 0.9 V and further confirmed that the two peaks were from OOH* and OH*, respectively, demonstrating that high-index facets of Pt metals have different intermediate adsorption features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Carbon monoxide reduction reaction</title><p id="Par29">CO is an important chemical that is used as a precursor in the pre-existing petrochemical industry and recent electrochemical conversion research because of its ability to be converted into valuable hydrocarbons and alcohols, such as methane, methanol, and ethanol.

However, the in situ Raman spectra recorded in the presence of Au@SiO<sub>2</sub> (Figs. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b and d) revealed multiple surface species related to Cu.

At a more negative potential, a peak appeared at 612–622 cm<sup>−1</sup>.

Interestingly, the band at 1152 cm<sup>−1</sup> shifted toward a relatively low wavenumber as the potential became increasingly negative.

SHINERS is a critical strategy for capturing intermediate species of various electrochemical reactions even on smooth electrodes and metal oxide films despite low SERS activity, as demonstrated in the mechanistic studies for ORRs and COORs on different Pt single crystal surfaces. Simultaneously, SHINs can significantly amplify SERS signals from a thin layer of surface reactive sites. As shown in the case studies of water oxidation reactions, CORRs, and NO<sub>3</sub>RRs, SHINERS allows for monitoring of the potential-dependent behaviors of electrode surfaces and for determining the catalytically active sites by comparing the SHINERS results with chronoamperometric and linear sweep voltammetric measurements. Therefore, SHINERS can be used to investigate a reaction mechanism regardless of the type of electrode, and it has a wide potential in a variety of electrocatalysis and electrochemical systems. We believe that this review not only provides a comprehensive understanding of the SHINERS technique in unraveling reaction mechanisms for electrocatalysis but also provides new insights into observing catalyst–electrolyte interfaces that have not been probed.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AH and CWL wrote the manuscript.
