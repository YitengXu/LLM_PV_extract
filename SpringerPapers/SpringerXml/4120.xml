Since then, there has been an extensive research debate over the potential links between the volcanic/intrusive activity and tectonic processes, particularly because the earthquake swarm and dyke propagation did not eventually result in an eruption. The current study seeks to estimate the relative changes in surface temperatures as a means for detecting an impending dyke-fed eruption or, alternatively, dyke arrest at a shallow depth. An analysis of thermal (infrared) data with a focus on the spatial distribution of land surface temperatures over a longer period of observation may help reveal the link between volcanic activity and dyke propagation. Here, the land surface temperature changes in the centre of Harrat Lunayyir were recorded when the 2009 dyke was propagating toward the surface. The spatial distribution of the land surface temperatures in the area indicated the segmentation of the dyke and suggested the segments were arrested at somewhat different depths below the surface.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Dyke emplacement</kwd><kwd>Dyke arrest</kwd><kwd>Surface temperature</kwd><kwd>Volcanic hazard</kwd><kwd>Remote

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Volcanoes pose a significant threat to human life and property through their extensive lava flow from effusive volcanic eruptions as well as pyroclastic flows and falls from explosive volcanic eruptions that altogether may create far-reaching hazards in the surrounding environment (Alberico et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2010</xref>). Considering the significance of these hazards, there has been extensive research over the past few decades aimed at exploring effective methods for the monitoring of volcanic activities (IUCN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2009</xref>). Monitoring systems are of great importance in terms of providing adequate warning of imminent potential disasters related to active volcanoes. Volcanic activity is usually controlled by processes that take place in the depths of the Earth’s lithosphere, particularly in the magma reservoirs, and, thus, there are several challenges related to the monitoring of active volcanoes and interpreting volcanic unrest episodes (Noguchi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2011</xref>; Pyle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2015</xref>; Al Shehri and Gudmundsson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2018</xref>; Gudmundsson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2019</xref>). Volcanic eruptions result in the transfer of heat from erupted lava flows and pyroclastic layers as well as from eruption columns that extend into the atmosphere. Additional environmental and tectonic processes associated with volcanoes include gas emission, earthquakes, and surface deformation (Harris <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2013</xref>; Murphy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2013</xref>; Noguchi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2011</xref>; Pyle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2015</xref>; Gudmundsson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">The Red Sea Rift is one of the few areas in the world in which the processes of continental rifting and splitting actively take place and intraplate volcanism occurs, with a range of volcanic risk episodes observed in the western part over the last few decades (Bailey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2009</xref>; van der Zwan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2013</xref>). The Red Sea Rift may be considered the most recent example of the early stages of ocean development via sea-floor spreading. This makes the areas within and adjacent to the rift particularly suitable for exploring volcanotectonic structures, dyke and fault patterns, and the inter-relation between structural, sedimentary, tectonic, and volcanic processes. Volcanic fields and dyke swarms formed along the eastern margin of the rift, predominantly during the Red Sea spreading as a result of a series of volcanic eruptions (Genna et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2002</xref>; Hansen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">b</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">One of the most recent and significant volcanotectonic episodes occurred in Harrat Lunayyir, a young basaltic lava field located in the northwestern part of Saudi Arabia and adjacent to the central part of the Red Sea in 2009. This volcanotectonic activity was primarily characterised by an intense earthquake swarm that occurred between April and June 2009, with more than 30,000 earthquakes taking place over the period of 3 months. It produced far-reaching consequences for the socioeconomic status of the region despite its limited direct damage and considering the area is quite remote and no eruption took place. As a result of the episode, the Saudi Arabian government had to evacuate 40,000 residents from the town of Al Ays, which is located in the path of lava flows from the potential volcanic fissure that would have formed if the dyke had reached the surface. The predominant interpretation based on both the earthquake data and geodetic data is that a near-vertical dyke of magma made its way from a great depth but then stopped at ~ 2 km beneath the surface, which induced most of the earthquakes in the swarm (Jónsson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2010</xref>). More recent studies, however, conclude that the dyke became arrested at much shallower depths, namely, several hundred metres below the surface, indicating a significantly greater hazard than previously estimated (Al Shehri and Gudmundsson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2018</xref>). The arrest of the dyke at a shallower depth is likely to be the factor in the observed tension fractures and normal fault formation at the surface. Another important research question behind why the dyke’s movement was arrested at such a shallow depth—a topic analysed in many papers and of great interest and importance to volcanotectonic and hazard studies (e.g., Gudmundsson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2003</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">In order to study the complex volcanic processes that lead to eruptions and other natural hazards as well as to monitor volcanic activities, remote sensing techniques have been extensively applied. Specifically, satellite images provide key data for understanding volcanic behaviour and registering thermal emissions from high-temperature events (Barnie and Oppenheimer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2015</xref>; Harris et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1997</xref>; Tralli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2005</xref>). The fact that this data is acquired remotely makes these processes relatively risk-free, meaning this method is particularly well-suited to studying the precursor signals of changing volcanic activity patterns. Additionally, thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing of land surface temperature has been used in the past 20 years to monitor and explore volcanic processes and activity. TIR remote sensing is a significant tool in terms of mapping and monitoring the temperature of the surface; therefore, it could be used to identify increased volcanic activity by examining precursor signals (Haselwimmer and Prakash <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2013</xref>; Realmuto and Worden <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2000</xref>; Tralli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2005</xref>; Vaughan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2005</xref>). TIR data can provide a simultaneous and synchronous view of temperature changes in a given landscape, overcoming the limitations specific to meteorological or land-surveying data. Remote sensing TIR is generally used to monitor and map the surface temperature in various regions, as volcanic and other natural processes can release substantial amounts of heat. Therefore, the increase of volcanic activity signals can be both detected and measured with such types of technology and through the evaluation of precursor signals (Haselwimmer and Prakash <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2013</xref>; Tralli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2005</xref>; Vaughan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2005</xref>). Nevertheless, recent studies have indicated a currently limited employment of TIR data due to the prevailing use of low-resolution satellite images (Sobrino et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2008</xref>). The present project addresses this phenomenon by using Landsat 7 satellite images, a split-window algorithm of land surface temperatures, and threshold methods for heat emission measurement (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Despite the disadvantages of Landsat 7, which has only one thermal band, this method of emissivity measurement meets the project objective of capturing surface temperature anomalies.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold> Satellite image (Landsat 7) identifying the area of interest. <bold>b</bold> Harrat Lunayyir borders</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/12517_2019_4774_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par6">Thermal mapping based on satellite data is a valuable tool that produces a temporal and spatial interpretation of baseline thermal activity to identify thermal anomalies. Thermal mapping has been a common practice in the study of thermal patterns exhibited during volcanic eruptions (Ramsey and Flynn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2004</xref>). The primary advantage of this method is that it enables the retrieval of a greater number of spatial details. More conventional methods, such as meteorological monitoring, are characterised by a lack of a spatial dimension. A focus on spatiality is particularly important to this project since it aims to establish the relationship between the tectonic and volcanic components. A juxtaposition of thermal maps using the data from tectonic observations, also acquired through remote sensing, is hypothesised to be a suitable method for identifying any further relationships between these phenomena, thus addressing the research gaps discussed above.</p><p id="Par7">This paper focuses on monitoring and estimating changes in surface temperature during the 2009 dyke emplacement in Harrat Lunayyir, Saudi Arabia, in order to examine how this method can be used to detect a potential dyke-fed eruption through significant temperature deviations. Overall, this method could provide critical information related to the support of disaster response and emergency management. The results also provide a foundation for response prioritisations and disaster assessment as well as informed mitigation planning and thorough risk assessments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title><p id="Par8">The methodological framework employed in the current paper involved extending upon the recent research findings from the Harrat Lunayyir dyke emplacement episode by adding more extensive spatial components (Al-Amri and Fnais <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2009</xref>; Baer and Hamiel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2010</xref>; Hansen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2013</xref>; Al-Zahrani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2013</xref>). First, the geological settings and hypotheses regarding volcanic and seismic activity in the area were reviewed to construct a basis for the empirical framework. Second, through the processing of remote sensing data, the major spatial configurations of both volcanic and seismic processes were identified using spatial density mapping and spatial alignment. Third, thermal mapping was conducted based on Landsat 7 satellite images, which helped plot the distribution of heat anomalies across the periodical timescale. This allowed for the connection of the spatial density and alignment analysis findings to the land surface heat distribution patterns. The resulting surface temperature maps were then further related to the previous hypotheses about the 2009 dyke intrusion and analysed using spatial analysis techniques.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Geological setting of Harrat Lunayyir</title><p id="Par9">In order to provide a methodology applicable to the scope of this project, the major geological and geomorphological characteristics of the area of interest were identified. Harrats, also known as Cenozoic basaltic lava fields, are commonly found in the Arabian Shield (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These fields are predominantly composed of alkali olivine basalt (Koulakov et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2014</xref>) and tholeiitic basalt (Al-Amri and Fnais <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2009</xref>) lava flows. Harrat Lunayyir is located in the western region of the Arabian Plate and is composed of Neogene and Quaternary basaltic lava flows that cover the Neoproterozoic basement (Koulakov et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2014</xref>). Lunayyir is one of the youngest Harrats in the region, exhibiting a more diverse composition. According to studies conducted by Al-Amri et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2012</xref>), in terms of geo-structural composition, Harrat Lunayyir is represented by two different basalt age groups: older Neogene basalts and younger Quaternary basalts (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). The Quaternary basaltic lava flows are common in the western region of the Arabian Shield and formed during the Red Sea spreading, which has been occurring since the Miocene period (Al-Amri and Al-Mogren <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2011</xref>). The older Neogene basalts are characterised by scoria cones, which are significantly eroded to the extent of having indistinct crater formation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). The basaltic layers rest directly on the Precambrian Arabian Shield (Al-Amri and Al-Mogren <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2011</xref>; Al-Amri and Fnais <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2009</xref>), while some Precambrian formations are also exposed in the central parts of the field. The volcanic deposits at Harrat Lunayyir are not radiometrically dated, although a number of studies have indicated a possible eruption that occurred in the tenth century (Zobin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2013</xref>). Moreover, signs of recent volcanic activity have been identified through the examination of the geomorphic features of the deposits, including pristine vent structures and unweathered lava surfaces (Pallister et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2010</xref>; Zobin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2013</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Landscape features representing typical volcanic structures located in the southeastern part of the Harrat Lunayyir field. <bold>a</bold> Ground-level view of the volcanic scoria rocks in the northeast of Harrat Lunayyir (position: 24° 21′ 21.2″ N; 39° 46′ 55.3″ E). <bold>b</bold> Basaltic lava flows of the Quaternary age, southwestern part of Harrat Lunayyir (position: 24° 12′ 9.1″ N; 39° 52′ 41.6″ E) <bold>c</bold> Typical scoria cone with a cater formation, northern most part of the Harrat Lunayyir field (position: 24° 23′ 4.5″ N; 39° 49′ 59.02″ E, towards north)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/12517_2019_4774_Fig2_HTML.jpg" id="MO2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Dyke intrusion and other hypotheses</title><p id="Par10">The initial monitoring data obtained in the region demonstrated that the observed magmatic intrusion, or dyke propagation, was continuous throughout the earthquake swarm (Pallister et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2010</xref>). The bulk of research on these earthquake swarms and their associated surface deformation indicated that the primary surface deformation might be partly associated with dyke propagation at a shallow depth and that the earthquake epicentres resided beneath the morphologically young volcanic crater cones (Pallister et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2010</xref>). According to Mukhopadhyay et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2013</xref>), the vertical dyke propagation initiated at crustal depths and exhibited a 5-day peak period (15–20 May 2009). After this peak, the volcanic activity was seen to gradually diminish. During the intrusion process, the dyke propagated to more shallow crustal levels, which may have contributed to a portion of the meter-scale fault slip on the western graben-bounding faults (Mukhopadhyay et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2013</xref>; Pallister et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2010</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">Zahran et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2009</xref>), relying on a range of geodetic monitoring data, registered seismotectonic observations corroborating the dyke intrusion hypothesis. This data indicated that there was a 3-km-long surface rupture in the central area of the harrat, which had been extending prior to May 2009. InSAR data demonstrated that there was an uplift and 1-m extension following the peak of the earthquake swarm, which corresponded to the first hypothesis, specifically in terms of stalled eruption, namely, an arrested dyke (Zahran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2009</xref>)<italic>.</italic> There are three major mechanisms through which dyke arrest occurs: stress barrier, elastic mismatch, and Cook–Gordon delamination (Gudmundsson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">b</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2019</xref>). The Cook–Gordon delamination mechanism implies that whatever contact that arrests the dyke is mechanically weak and has low tensile strength, so it opens up by the dyke-parallel tensile stress induced by the propagating dyke (Gudmundsson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">b</xref>; Kavanagh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2018</xref>). The opening of a contact is observed in many numerical models on dyke emplacement (Gudmundsson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2019</xref>). When the dyke tip finally reaches the open contact, the tip becomes either deflected along the contact to form a sill or, alternatively, stops altogether (i.e., is arrested) (Gudmundsson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2011a</xref>).</p><p id="Par12">Most dykes become arrested at various depths in the crust rather than ever reaching the surface (Gudmundsson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2003</xref>; Moran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2011</xref>; Rivalta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2015</xref>; Townsend et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2017</xref>) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Previous models (Baer and Hamiel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2010</xref>; Pallister et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2010</xref>) have inferred that dyke intrusion is based on the fact that seismic events in the area tended to form a linear structure oriented toward the southern part of the harrat. In light of this, Koulakov et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2014</xref>) modelled the distributions of P-wave to S-wave velocities in the area and concluded that it is not possible to directly confirm whether the dyke intrusion took place in 2009. Based on their research and further attempts to develop seismic tomography models, an alternative hypothesis emerged, which assumes a buried fault may have caused the tectonic displacements that resulted in the linear structure of the events distribution (Koulakov et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2014</xref>).

There is an evident clustering of eruption points and vents, as indicated by the contours (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).

Identification of the alignments was based on the Hough transform method algorithm and automatically calculated using the geosimulation capacity of the software. The algorithm behind this method is based on the transformation of the linear data in a Cartesian plane into points in a parameter plane, calculating the length and angle between any line of vent alignment origin and the coordinate system.

The volcanic fissures, which were inferred from the volcanic alignments, have also been highlighted (Figs. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). When more than one configuration is possible, the elongated caters can be used to highlight the general inferred fissure trend, following a standard method (Paulsen and Wilson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2009</xref>). The strikes of the elongated vents then coincide with corresponding strikes of the volcanic fissure. Using the GEOrient software, rose diagrams could also be produced, which helped identify the volcanic fissures in the NNE–SSW or NNW–SSE trends that dominate the volcanic region along with the presence of some small subsets like the N–S subsets.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Lineaments, mostly normal faults, in Harrat Lunayyir.

Satellite images have major potential to gain more information about volcanic eruptions and the behavioural aspects related to such natural phenomena. In addition, the investigation and observation of thermal energy emissions from high-temperature events such as eruptions or shallow intrusions are also considered to be of paramount significance in this field (Barnie and Oppenheimer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2015</xref>; Harris et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1997</xref>; Tralli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2005</xref>).</p><p id="Par18">Thermal infrared (TIR) technology is a remote sensing approach that has been utilised to evaluate the surface temperature of targeted regions as well as to monitor and investigate volcanotectonic events, volcanic eruptions, intrusions, and any associated earthquakes and tremors.

Thus, vegetation, soil, rock, water, and living beings emit infrared band–based thermal and electromagnetic radiation, which can in turn be measured and evaluated using infrared energy emission–detection sensors. The human eye is incapable of detecting any measurement or change in thermal energy emissions in the infrared energy band, as it can only detect light beams in the 400- to 700-nm range and remains sensitive only within this spectrum. Moreover, the sensitivity of the human eye is generally restricted to the infrared reflective index range of 700 nm–3.0 μm and the infrared energy range of 3.0–14 μm (Jensen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2007</xref>).

Infrared radiation is a sub-category of thermal radiation and can also transfer heat; consequently, it is frequently referred to as ‘heat radiation’. However, only a fraction of the infrared radiation spectrum is actually able to carry heat (Wellons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2007</xref>; Da Wen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2010</xref>). While all matter with a temperature greater than 0°K (absolute zero) will emit electromagnetic radiation, either the radiant flux density or the rate of energy flow per unit area and the spectral composition of this radiation is dependent upon the temperature of the emitting matter (Blackett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2017</xref>). Thermal radiation is also capable of directly transferring heat over long distances (e.g., the Earth continuously receives thermal radiation from the Sun). As a consequence of the wave nature of radiation and the Earth’s atmosphere, a proportion of the energy received will be reflected back, while some may be transmitted further and the remainder absorbed. Only the latter results in the direct heating of the matter. The percentage of reflected, absorbed, and transmitted heat is dependent on the nature of the matter, the surface characteristics of the matter, and the wavelength of the incipient radiation (Da Wen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2010</xref>). The Stefan–Boltzmann law states that the radiant flux density generated by an object is directly proportional to the fourth power of that object’s surface temperature (Boya <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2004</xref>) (i.e. the greater the temperature of an object, the greater the total energy it will emit).</p><p id="Par29">Temperatures associated with volcanic features are subject to wide variations.

No surface deformation was correlated with this occurrence (Xu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2016</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Mean temperatures from grids</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th><p>Month/year</p></th><th><p>2007</p></th><th><p>2008</p></th><th><p>2009</p></th><th><p>2010</p></th><th><p>2011</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>March</p></td><td><p>35.7</p></td><td><p>37.4</p></td><td><p>42.8</p></td><td><p>40.3</p></td><td><p>36.6</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>June</p></td><td/><td/><td><p>58.4</p></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td><p>July</p></td><td/><td/><td><p>55.5</p></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td><p>August</p></td><td/><td><p>49.5</p></td><td><p>47.7</p></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td><p>December</p></td><td><p>38.9</p></td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Mean monthly surface air temperature, Harrat Lunayyir</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th><p>Month/year</p></th><th><p>2007</p></th><th><p>2008</p></th><th><p>2009</p></th><th><p>2010</p></th><th><p>2011</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>March</p></td><td><p>22.2</p></td><td><p>25.1</p></td><td><p>22.7</p></td><td><p>25.6</p></td><td><p>23.6</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>June</p></td><td><p>29.7</p></td><td><p>31.1</p></td><td><p>30.9</p></td><td><p>32.5</p></td><td><p>31.2</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>July</p></td><td><p>31.9</p></td><td><p>31.8</p></td><td><p>32</p></td><td><p>32.8</p></td><td><p>32.5</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>August</p></td><td><p>32.6</p></td><td><p>31.8</p></td><td><p>32.2</p></td><td><p>34.5</p></td><td><p>31.9</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>December</p></td><td><p>22.2</p></td><td><p>22.4</p></td><td><p>21.9</p></td><td><p>23</p></td><td><p>21.9</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="Fig11"><label>Fig. 11</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>March 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011 surface temperature maps (degree Celsius); the yellow colour indicates the temperature anomalies</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/12517_2019_4774_Fig11_HTML.png" id="MO11"/></fig></p><p id="Par34">However, the seismic swarm that occurred from October 2007 to May 2008 may be considered a precursor to the main swarm that occurred during the dyke emplacement between April and July 2009. This precursor swarm has been interpreted as a deep-seated reservoir subject to inflation and potential rupture (Koulakov et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2015</xref>). During reservoir inflation, the reactivation of fractures, especially faults in the reservoir roof, would typically result in earthquakes. Furthermore, in regard to the swarm of 2009, the extent of coverage increased toward the northern portion of the Harrat and there are other inferred segments of the dyke. It is therefore anticipated that a number of other dyke areas will assume the same direction as the 2009 extinction fracture; however, all such areas have been arrested at different sub-surface depths (Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12c</xref>).<fig id="Fig12"><label>Fig. 12</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Landsat 7 image of Harrat Lunayyir. <bold>a</bold> From the SGS website, the probable epicentre locations for the 7 May–15 August 2009 seismic events are shown as green circles, whereas the extension fracture is represented by a red line. <bold>b</bold> The dashed yellow line represents the projection line of the dyke direction at depth (modified after Baer and Hamiel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2010</xref>; Pallister et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2010</xref>); the red and yellow solid lines are the projections of the other inferred segments of the dyke. <bold>c</bold> Dyke segments arrested at different depths along the extension fracture of 2009</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/12517_2019_4774_Fig12_HTML.png" id="MO12"/></fig></p><p id="Par35">To achieve a more comprehensive presentation of the spatial–temporal distribution of LST for several subsequent periods (using the month March of each subsequent year), Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref> reveals the range of the temperature over the Harrat Lunayyir range—from 51 to 60 °C. The high temperature coincides with areas of maximum tectonic deformation (e.g., extensive fracture formation) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>). Spatial density analysis and LST revealed that heat emission spikes can be observed throughout the years regardless of whether earthquakes, or any sort of seismic activity, had occurred or not. However, there is a statistically significant correlation between the density of heat and the seismic period timescale.</p><p id="Par36">The analysis of the tectonic processes over the same periods of observation reveals insignificant levels of correlation between the surface temperatures and seismic intensity. The main cluster of seismic intensity formed in the southwestern part of the Harrat Lunayyir was not linked to any post- or pre-activity temperature increase. The epicentre locations reveal the general direction of the fracturing process toward the northern central area, which is in-line with previous research results (Pallister et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2010</xref>). Notably, the cluster of temperature anomalies in the southern central part were seen to have intensified in the period following the earthquake swarm. These patterns most likely reflect the emplacement of a very shallow dyke intrusion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par37">TA thorough interpretation of the heat anomalies and variability in land surface temperature based on the remote sensing data is limited due to certain other factors (geothermal, hydrothermal, and geomorphological) behind temperature variations as well as characteristics of the remote sensing data. Hence, there are a number of factors that must be taken into account when acquiring and analysing thermal maps. These factors include the following:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par38">Spatial resolution. The TIR band of the ETM+ satellite sensor has a spatial resolution of 60 m, whereas the other six multispectral bands have a spatial resolution of 30 m, and the panchromatic band (or band 8) has a spatial resolution of 15 m (Galiano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2011</xref>). A major difficulty commonly encountered in evaluating the accuracy of thermal surveys is the disparity between the spatial scale of the remote sensing measurements and contemporaneous ground truth measurements (Vlassova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2014</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par39">Atmospheric effects. Further research should be directed toward the incorporation of InSAR and other methods of atmospheric correction into volcanic activity monitoring systems that use remote sensing data. Additional complications related to aerial or orbital measurements of surface radiance to actual surface temperatures must be introduced to address these factors. This is particularly true for space-borne sensors with large fields of view that conduct regional surveys over ground swaths of hundreds of kilometres or more (Hammerle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2017</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par40">Emissivity. This is the ratio of energy emitted from a particular body to that radiated from a perfect emitter (a blackbody) at the same temperature and wavelength (Blackett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2017</xref>). The energy emitted by the Earth is related to the temperature and emissivity of the objects or materials within a pixel on the ground (Becker and Liang Li <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2009</xref>; Galiano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2011</xref>). Emissivity quantifies the radiating efficiency of a surface. An object with an emissivity of 1.0 is a perfect emitter, emitting radiation with 100% efficiency; all other objects emit with less efficiency, with the consequence that the apparent (or radiance) temperature of such objects, if measured remotely, is less than the true kinetic temperature of the object (Blackett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2017</xref>) (Vlassova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2014</xref>).</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par41">In addition to the aforementioned factors, there is a need to account for different explanations for the land surface temperature variation observed via remote sensing data. These temperature variations may be partly due to differences in solar activity and terrain influence. In the case of Harrat Lunayyir, the tectonic activity component can be a residual component after accounting for volcanotectonic activity and terrain influence. The significant scatter pattern of the heat anomalous pixels in the developed surface temperature maps indicates the segmentation of the dyke and forms a linear configuration. The spatial alignment between the volcanic vent and temperature anomalous areas indicates a correlation between the observed thermal variation and volcanotectonic activity, that is, the inferred dyke emplacement.</p><p id="Par42">Another major consideration is the hydrothermal regime of the region. The active geothermal systems are located in the central and southern parts of the Arabian Shield. However, even in the north and north-central parts closer to the Red Sea Rift, active thermal springs have been found (Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>). Based on previous studies (Chandrasekharam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2016</xref>) of the geothermal regime, issuing temperatures associated with these springs are in the range of 31–55 °C but may reach up to 70 °C during summer periods. Another geothermal factor contributing to heat anomalies is the high heat input from post-orogenic granites, which are common in the Harrat Lunayyir area. The clusters of heat anomalies located in the outskirts of the Harrat might be the result of heat flow generation due to the process of magma movement at shallower levels.<fig id="Fig13"><label>Fig. 13</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Map of the geothermal system of the Red Sea Rift area (Chandrasekharam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2016</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/12517_2019_4774_Fig13_HTML.png" id="MO13"/></fig></p><p id="Par43">The map shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref> indicates that the hot water wells in the Lunayyir area are preferentially located along the margins of the basaltic field, but they are typically restricted to the margins of the lava flows. This pattern is in agreement with the regional characteristic of hot springs found in the vicinities of the basaltic fields along the cataclastic zone (Lashin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2015</xref>). These hot water wells are characterised by low charge, but individual heat flows may radiate long distances. The maximum depth of the hot wells is 80 m (Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). At this depth, permeable components are likely to include tension fractures and normal faults oriented toward the centre of the field. The hot water wells of this crustal part are also characterised by low resistance as a result of Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The far-distance heat emanating from the centre of the field that can flow is also reflected in the two mapping datasets (Figs. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> and <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>), with the heat anomalies clustered toward the centre of the field and the hot water wells located alongside the margin. Future research objectives highlight the need for a variety of activities, including in situ field studies on bulk emissivity and the thermal inertia of surface cover materials. An empirical analysis of high spectral and spatial resolution imagery is needed to evaluate the utility of thermal infrared measurements for mapping variations in the emissivity of natural surfaces. This is also specifically necessary to evaluate trade-offs between increased resolution and decreased signal-to-noise. In future research, atmospheric effects can be accounted for within localised areas through the use of upward-viewing, ground-based radiometers.<fig id="Fig14"><label>Fig. 14</label><caption

activities and provided new insights into the spatiotemporal relationship between volcanic and tectonic processes in the area. Through the employment of the methodology of thermal mapping and spatial density mapping of volcanic vents (primarily crater cones and small lava shields), the land surface temperature changes in the centre of Harrat Lunayyir were recorded when the 2009 dyke was propagating toward the surface. The obtained results are in agreement with previous research findings indicating the northwest–southeast direction of the dyke system and the normal fault formation.</p><p id="Par45">This paper focused on monitoring and estimating relative changes in surface temperatures as a means for detecting an impending dyke-fed eruption or, alternatively, dyke arrest at a shallow depth, which consequently provides an understanding of the point at which a particular hazard event (‘fissure eruptions’) is most likely to occur. This provides critical information that supports disaster responders and emergency management. Consequently, this helps provide the foundation for response prioritisations, disaster assessment, informed mitigation planning, and thorough risk assessments. Therefore, infrared observations may increase understanding about a volcano’s activity status and reveal incoming changes in activity.</p><p id="Par46">A strong correlation was found between dyke intrusion and LST. The variety of surface temperature values in the past several years based on the thermal energy response. Consequently, this study was beneficial in that it can help protect the lives of those residing close to danger zones by suggesting necessary courses of action to take before a disaster occurs in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>AAS thanks Morayyea Al-Shahrani, President of the General Commission of Survey for the helpful suggestions.
