As fossil-fuel supplies become scarcer and environmental concerns increase, hydrogen is likely to become an increasingly important chemical energy carrier and eventually may become the principal chemical energy carrier. When most of the world’s energy sources become non-fossil based, hydrogen and electricity are expected to be the two dominant energy carriers for the provision of end-use services. In such a “hydrogen economy,” the two complementary energy carriers, hydrogen and electricity, are used to satisfy most of the requirements of energy consumers. A transition era will bridge the gap between today’s fossil-fuel economy and a hydrogen economy, in which non-fossil-derived hydrogen will be used to extend the lifetime of the world’s fossil fuels—by upgrading heavy oils, for instance—and the infrastructure needed to support a hydrogen economy is gradually developed. In this paper, the role of hydrogen as an energy carrier and hydrogen energy systems’ technologies and their economics are described. Also, the social and political implications of hydrogen energy are examined, and the questions of when and where hydrogen is likely to become important are addressed. Examples are provided to illustrate key points.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Hydrogen energy</kwd><kwd>Production</kwd><kwd>Storage</kwd><kwd>Economics</kwd><kwd>Environment</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Joint Center on Global Change and Earth System Science of the University of Maryland and Beijing Normal University, co-published with Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>Joint Center on Global Change and Earth System Science of the University of Maryland and Beijing Normal University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/40974_2016_Article_5.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>ReviewPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Environment, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Ecology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The world has a wide variety of energy sources which can be harvested to produce an even wider variety of energy carriers. Some energy sources, such as fossil fuels, are also energy carriers. That is, their energy can be transported to and used by energy consumers in the same form as it is found. Other energy sources, such as falling water and solar radiation, must first be converted to an energy currency (commonly, electricity) before the energy can be used.</p><p id="Par3">Presently, fossil fuels are the main energy sources and energy carriers in the world. However, the supply of fossil fuels is finite and their use causes environmental impacts. As supplies eventually begin to become scarcer and environmental concerns increase, the world will turn increasingly to alternative energy sources. But all foreseeable future energy sources (falling water, solar radiation, uranium, wind, tides, waves, etc.) cannot act as energy carriers for the provision of end-use services. Moreover, using present technology, these sources are capable of producing, for the most part, one energy carrier: electricity.</p><p id="Par4">However, the world’s societies cannot operate effectively with energy provided only in the form of electricity, as they also need chemical fuels and feedstocks. For example, many transportation vehicles, especially airplanes, cannot be economically flown using electricity (Scott <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2007</xref>; Balat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2008</xref>). As use of fossil fuels declines and is replaced with energy supplies from non-fossil sources, the world could eventually become oversaturated with electricity and deficient in chemical fuels.</p><p id="Par5">Marchetti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">1985</xref>) illustrated this point using historical energy-source data gathered by the Energy Systems Group of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The data are presented on a semilog plot with an abscissa of time and an ordinate of <italic>F</italic>/(1 − <italic>F</italic>), where <italic>F</italic> is the fraction of total sources captured by the identified source. On the right-hand side of the ordinate, <italic>F</italic> is presented on a nonlinear scale (the parameter <italic>F</italic>/(1 − <italic>F</italic>) is used because it is important in the logistic substitution procedures which were used to model the data). Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows that, as time progresses, an ever-decreasing fraction of the world’s energy sources has been supplied by wood, coal, oil and natural gas; the figure also predicts that an increasing fraction of energy sources in the future will be supplied by nuclear fission and “solfus” (solar and nuclear fusion). Wind energy can be treated as part of solfus. There likely exists a maximum fraction of energy transactions which can use electricity; assuming this value is 0.3, it can be seen that the fraction of energy transactions using nuclear fission, solar and nuclear fusion will eventually surpass the 0.3 “ceiling,” leading to an oversupply of electricity. In some regions and countries, surpluses of electricity have at times existed.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>World primary energy substitution in terms of the fraction <italic>F</italic> of total sources captured by the identified source [adapted from Marchetti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">1985</xref>)]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40974_2016_5_Fig1_HTML.gif" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par6">This argument, which follows from the future decline in fossil-fuel use shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and the limitations on energy end-uses serviceable with electricity, suggests that eventually it will be necessary to produce some chemical fuel, either directly from non-hydrocarbon energy sources or from the electricity they are already capable of producing. Other energy researchers (Muradov and Veziroglu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2008</xref>; Bose and Malbrunot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2007</xref>; Penner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2006</xref>; Smith and Santangelo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">1980</xref>; Wallace and Ward <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">1983</xref>) have made similar arguments. Moreover, there is a consensus among many researchers that hydrogen is the most logical choice as a chemical fuel in the future societies of the world. An eventual “hydrogen economy,” where hydrogen and electricity serve as complementary secondary energy carriers, has been envisioned for many decades (Muradov and Veziroglu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2008</xref>; Dunn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2002</xref>; Marban and Valdes-Solis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2007</xref>; Elam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2003</xref>; Bose and Malbrunot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2007</xref>; Sigfusson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2007</xref>; Penner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2006</xref>; Maack and Skulason <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2005</xref>; Arnason and Sigfusson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2000</xref>; Lattin and Utgikar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2007</xref>; Midilli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">b</xref>; Scott <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2007</xref>). Note that in a hydrogen economy there will remain other primary energy carriers such as uranium, which can be readily stored and transported, even if hydrogen and electricity become the main secondary energy carriers.</p><p id="Par7">The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of hydrogen energy and hydrogen energy systems so as to describe the prospects for hydrogen as an energy carrier. In the paper, the use of hydrogen as an energy carrier is described, as are hydrogen energy systems and technologies, including methods used for the production, utilization, storage and distribution of hydrogen. Next, the economics of hydrogen energy systems and their social and political implications are discussed. Finally, the questions of when and where hydrogen energy will become important in the short and long terms are addressed, and advancements anticipated in hydrogen systems in the future are detailed. Throughout, aspects of hydrogen energy systems which are dependent on geographical location are pointed out.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Background on energy and the environment</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Energy</title><p id="Par8">Energy is a key driver of industrialized societies.

It can be stored and transported, and it can be used as a fuel or converted to electrical energy in such devices as fuel cells. Hydrogen can be benign environmentally since, depending on the energy source from which it is derived, it can be produced from water and it reverts back to water after oxidation.</p><p id="Par19">There are many reasons why hydrogen is a logical and appropriate choice as a chemical fuel to replace today’s fossil fuels. The principal reason is that hydrogen is a complementary energy carrier to electricity (Scott <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2007</xref>). Both energy carriers are necessary as each can satisfy a range of energy service demands, some of which cannot be satisfied by the other. Hydrogen’s advantages and disadvantages as a chemical fuel stem from its properties and characteristics. The principal advantages of hydrogen, as noted by several researchers (Johnson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1981</xref>; Smith and Santangelo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">1980</xref>; Wallace and Ward <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">1983</xref>; Scott <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2007</xref>), are listed below:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par20"><italic>Producible</italic>.

The choice of what form hydrogen is best stored in for a given application depends on several factors, such as what the hydrogen will be used for.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par23"><italic>Transportable</italic>. There are many ways to transport hydrogen (e.g., road, rail, ship). Also, it is transportable over long distances using conventional pipeline technology with losses lower than those associated with electricity transport using high-voltage electrical lines. Thus, the energy from non-hydrocarbon energy sources located at great distances from energy consumers can be used to produce hydrogen and then easily transported.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par24"><italic>Environmentally benign</italic>. Hydrogen utilization involves oxidation, and the only direct major hydrogen oxidation product is water. A small quantity of nitrogen oxides is released when hydrogen is combusted in air, but these can be controlled with careful engine design (Wallace and Ward <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">1983</xref>). The environmental impacts with other phases in the life cycle of a hydrogen system are similar to those for other energy technologies and may be small or large, mainly depending on the source of hydrogen.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par25"><italic>Recyclable</italic>.

Hydrogen energy systems usually incorporate many synergisms. That is, by using hydrogen as an energy carrier, other demands of the system can also be satisfied.

The “Hindenburg Syndrome,” which is characterized by a fear of anything in which hydrogen plays a role, was termed as a phrase after the Hindenburg dirigible accident in 1937 at Lakehurst, New Jersey. Hydrogen, like any fuel, does have dangerous properties (Cox and Williamson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1979</xref>), but the public’s fears of hydrogen often appear to stem mainly from a fear of the unknown. Besides its dangerous properties, hydrogen also has some safe ones. The results of many studies of hydrogen’s safety implications indicate that the dangers of hydrogen do not seem worse than those of gasoline, natural gas or any other fuel, but are merely different. Consideration of the flame temperature, explosion energy and flame emissivity of hydrogen suggests that it is safer than methane and gasoline. Due to its non-toxicity, a hydrogen leak does not cause environmental damage and hydrogen dissipates rapidly as it rises from its source due to its low density, reducing the risk of fire or explosion (Cipriani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2014</xref>; Sharma and Ghoshal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2015</xref>). Furthermore, many groups, such as the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the petrochemical industry, have been using hydrogen safely for many years (Scott <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2007</xref>; Johnson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1981</xref>). In general, most people working with or studying hydrogen have concluded that hydrogen can be used safely.</p><p id="Par34">The preceding discussions suggest hydrogen may have a prominent role as an energy carrier in the future. The path from the present to the future can be broken down into three eras. The world is evolving from the present “fossil-fuel era,” an era in which fossil fuels and electricity are the main energy carriers and hydrogen is essentially not used as an energy carrier, to a “hydrogen era,” an era in which there will be only two principal energy carriers: hydrogen and electricity. A “transition era” will link the fossil-fuel era to the hydrogen era.</p><p id="Par35">The transition era will be characterized by a gradual substitution of chemical energy carriers. Light hydrocarbons, such as petroleum and natural gas, will gradually be replaced by heavy hydrocarbons, such as coal, oil shales and sands and tar sands. These, in turn, will likely be replaced by hydrogen. Scott (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2007</xref>) notes that a key feature of such a transition era will be an integration of energy sources and energy carriers. Whereas in the fossil-fuel era, one energy source is often used to produce one energy carrier (e.g., uranium to produce electricity, or natural gas to produce heat), in the transition era, a set of energy sources more often will be used to produce a set of energy carriers. For example, methanol, hydrogen, electricity and low-grade heat were produced from natural gas, uranium and water at a demonstration plant in Julich, Germany (Scott <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">1987</xref>; Johnson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1981</xref>). This integration will mainly be directed toward delaying a point in time when fossil fuels cannot be economically recovered and reducing environmental impacts.</p><p id="Par36">Another type of integration involves the use of hydrogen produced from non-hydrocarbon sources in refining processes. The amount of products from refinery processes is greatly increased if such hydrogen is added to the heavy hydrocarbons, instead of removing carbon. In Ontario, Canada, for example, proposals have been made to use electricity generated from nuclear power plants to produce hydrogen for use in upgrading heavy oils into a marketable blend of liquid fuels.</p><p id="Par37">The hydrogen era will be reached after fossil fuels become too expensive to recover economically and/or environmental or other imperatives cause modifications of our energy systems. Hydrogen is produced through from renewable energy sources using low-cost environmentally clean processes (Ursua and Gandia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2012</xref>). Then, it will be used as an energy carrier in ways which take advantage of its unique properties, and the infrastructure necessary to support a hydrogen era will be established. Final use technologies, especially fuel cells, will be widely spread (Ball and Weeda <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2015</xref>; Ursua and Gandia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2012</xref>; Veziroglu and Macario <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2011</xref>). The duration of the hydrogen era is anticipated to be great.

In a move toward lowering CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, this sector as well may benefit from the use of hydrogen as a fuel for vehicles. Hydrogen storage is one of the main barriers in hydrogen automotive applications, where weight and volume should be kept as low as possible. Various options have been proposed in the automotive industry for replacing current fuels with hydrogen: fuel cell cars and hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicles.</p><p id="Par55">Hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles appear as a viable options for transportation in the future as they cause no pollution and their range is comparable to that of the traditional internal combustion engine vehicles (400–500 km on a single refueling, given a 700-bar onboard hydrogen storage) (Ball and Weeda <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2015</xref>; Alazemi and Andrews <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>). Their high efficiency at part-load operation makes them suitable options for passenger cars (Verhelst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2014</xref>). If the hydrogen used in these vehicles is produced from low-/zero-carbon feedstocks or if the CO<sub>2</sub> generated during their production is captured and stored, these vehicles offer an effective means for decarbonising the entire fuel supply chain. To satisfy the requirements of normal operation, reasonable behavior during transients (e.g., accelerations and braking) and a longer life for the stack, fuel cell cars are designed in a hybrid format using a battery pack or capacitor with a fuel cell (Cipriani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2014</xref>). However, material supply could become a limiting factor of widespread adoption of fuel cell vehicles (Verhelst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par56">Hydrogen can also be used in internal combustion engines that are designed similarly to traditional combustion engines. The mature industry and a vast production infrastructure available for internal combustion engines make hydrogen internal combustion engines economically attractive. Furthermore, unlike fuel cell vehicles, these vehicles do not rely on materials that may limit their large-scale production (Verhelst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2014</xref>). Some features of these engines that vary from traditional gasoline engines are the electronics unit control to properly manage the pressure in the injection and the hydrogen combustor.

Hydrogen can be produced at the station or elsewhere and delivered to the station and then stored for transfer to in-vehicle hydrogen units.

In Canada, for instance, less than one percent of the total hydrogen generated is electrolytically produced. For instance, a large Cominco water electrolysis plant in British Columbia produced hydrogen at the rate of about 3.6 tonne/day (Silverstein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">1982</xref>). Certain specialized processes require such hydrogen because of its high purity (over 99.5 % compared with 97–98 % for hydrocarbon-derived hydrogen). Water electrolysis is a mature technology, but subject to inefficiencies due to the generation of electricity, e.g., in thermal power stations. High-temperature electrolysis, which utilizes water in the form of steam, is under development (Bhandari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2014</xref>; Muradov and Veziroglu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2008</xref>; Turner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2008</xref>; Yildiz and Kazimi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2006</xref>). In these systems, a major part of the energy required for electrolysis can be supplied in the form of high-temperature heat instead of electricity, which is more expensive. However, at their current research and development stage, these systems face issues such as electrolyte aging and electrode deactivation. The near-term non-fossil option for hydrogen production is likely to remain water electrolysis mainly due to its easy integration with renewable energy sources such as hydropower, wind and solar (Ursua and Gandia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2012</xref>; Bhandari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2014</xref>). However, water electrolysis hydrogen production using renewable energies is currently limited to research and development projects.</p><p id="Par76">Thermochemical water decomposition (or splitting), which is comprised of a sequence of chemical reactions for which the net reaction is water decomposition, is a significant future candidate for large-scale hydrogen production (Funk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2001</xref>; Rosen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2010</xref>; Lewis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2009</xref>; Lewis and Masin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2009</xref>; Andress et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2009</xref>). The inefficiency of water electrolysis due to the conversion of heat to electricity in thermal power plants can be avoided through thermochemical cycles. Also, thermochemical water decomposition allows water to be decomposed at lower temperatures (around 850–1000 °C) than the temperature required for direct thermal decomposition of water to hydrogen and oxygen (over 2500 °C). Some drawbacks of these systems include the corrosion and heat exchange problems caused by both high temperatures and the chemicals used, and the difficulty to find the heat sources for the processes. Many hydrogen production processes based on thermochemical water decomposition have been proposed, potentially driven by heat from nuclear power plants (Schultz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2005</xref>; Naterer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2010</xref>; Utgikar and Ward <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2006</xref>; Forsberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2003</xref>; Forsberg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2007</xref>) and/or high-temperature solar thermal facilities (Kodama and Gokon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2007</xref>; Steinfeld <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2005</xref>) or a combination of both in an integrated hydrogen production system (Orhan and Babu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2015</xref>). Two examples are the copper–chlorine cycle, which requires heat at temperatures as high as 550 °C, and the sulfur–oxygen–iodine process, which requires heat at about 1000 °C.</p><p id="Par77">Photoelectrolysis is another developing technology that aims at obtaining hydrogen from the incidence of solar rays on semiconductors immersed in an aqueous solution that act as photocatalysts (Ursua and Gandia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2012</xref>). Photocatalytic processes are also being investigated as water-splitting paths to hydrogen production using solar energy (Preethi and Kanmani <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2013</xref>). In these processes, the development of photocatalysts capable of harvesting a wide range of visible light in long-term operation to achieve high hydrogen production rates is highly desirable and is the focus of research (Srinivasan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2015</xref>).

Such thermal processes for hydrogen production may prove less expensive than other options because heat is generally less expensive than electricity (Forsberg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2007</xref>). For instance, the cost of nuclear-based thermochemical hydrogen production has been estimated to be as low as 60 % of that for nuclear-based hydrogen production by electrolysis (Forsberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2003</xref>).

Where available, such acido-alkaline electrochemical cells are recognized as cheap hydrogen production methods that can have a distinct role for sustainable energy conversion and storage and waste utilization (Zeradjanin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Hydrogen storage and distribution</title><p id="Par90">One of the principal reasons hydrogen complements well electricity as an energy carrier is that hydrogen can be stored over long periods of time. Furthermore, hydrogen production from intermittent renewable energy sources, such as solar energy sources, is only viable with an integration of a hydrogen storage system with production. The reversible storage of hydrogen is a substantial challenge, especially for use of hydrogen as a fuel in automotive applications. Hydrogen has a low energy density on a volume basis compared to the other fuels, requiring a much larger fuel tank for a vehicle operating on hydrogen rather than petrol/diesel. Furthermore, hydrogen is the lightest of all elements and harder to liquefy than methane and propane. Due to its low density and also its small molecular size, it can leak from containment vessels. In addition, for hydrogen to be used in automotive applications, the storage system should have the ability to extract/insert hydrogen at sufficiently rapid rates. To date, only relatively small-scale storages have been developed; however, several large-scale storages are being developed to satisfy future storage requirements, which are expected to be much greater than present ones. New materials with improved performance, or new approaches to the synthesis and/or processing of existing materials, are highly desirable for use of hydrogen as a vehicular fuel. Desirable characteristics for hydrogen storage materials are investigated by Yang et al.

All hydrogen storage technologies involving heat absorption or release face issues in thermal management, and their performance remains limited. Pressurized storage systems such as liquid hydrogen and compressed hydrogen gas as well as some adsorption storage systems have efficiency losses during compression and cooling; up to 20 % of the energy content of hydrogen is required to compress the gas and up to 40 % to liquefy it (Edwards et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2008</xref>; Dalebrook et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2013</xref>). In addition, there are numerous unresolved safety issues related to use of pressured hydrogen (Dalebrook et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2013</xref>). Eberle et al.

They suggest liquid hydrogen and pressure storage to be the most viable solutions for large- and small-scale hydrogen storage at present, respectively. Chemical hydrogen storage systems appear to have much room for improvement as new materials are investigated (Eberle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2009</xref>; Dalebrook et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2013</xref>).

To compare present costs with cost predictions made in the past, we concentrate on the province of Ontario in Canada. Ontario, with a population of about 13 million, has many hydrogen activities and initiatives ongoing. Evaluations of the economics of hydrogen in Ontario were carried out 30 years ago by the Ontario Hydrogen Energy Task Force (Johnson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1981</xref>). Predicted costs of producing hydrogen are listed in Table <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref> for the period between 1980 and 2025, based on data provided in the Task Force’s report, for three hydrogen production methods: electrolysis using nuclear-derived electricity, catalytic steam-methane reforming and the steam-iron coal gasification. In Table <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>, low estimates and high estimates of costs are provided, with the ranges in unit costs intended to account for the primary uncertainties recognized at the time the estimates were made. A noteworthy observation is that the costs predicted in the past in Table <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref> are relatively consistent with actual costs in Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab7"><label>Table 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Predicted plant gate unit costs (in $/GJ)<sup>a</sup> of hydrogen supply<sup>b</sup> based on estimates from 1981 [adapted from Johnson et al.

In fact, it was expected that by 2000 the cost of hydrogen produced by electrolysis would be lower than the cost of hydrogen produced by either steam-methane reforming or coal gasification. This prediction was predicated mainly on the view that, during a transition era, the cost of electricity (derived from non-fossil sources) would escalate at a slower rate than the cost of fossil fuels. In Ontario, this seems reasonable since the province has a successful and large nuclear power program and Canada has large uranium reserves. Other economic assessments (Mitchell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">1983</xref>; Wallace and Ward <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">1983</xref>) also suggested that non-fossil-derived hydrogen would be competitive in Ontario before 2000. Although these predictions were not accurate in terms of timing, the expectation of higher costs for hydrogen from fossil fuels is likely to be valid at some time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Economics of hydrogen transport, storage and utilization</title><p id="Par112">The costs of bulk transport and storage of hydrogen are normally significantly less than production costs. For large volumes and large distances, transport of hydrogen as a compressed gas by pipeline is often the least expensive. However, this method requires large capital investment for infrastructure. Over short distances, small volumes of gaseous hydrogen can usually be transported most economically in tube tanks by truck (Ajanovic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2008</xref>). The transport cost of liquid hydrogen is much less than that for compressed gaseous hydrogen. However, the liquefaction process is very expensive, increasing the cost of hydrogen supply by approximately 60 % (Muradov and Veziroglu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2008</xref>; Bose and Malbrunot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2007</xref>; Penner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2006</xref>; Ball and Weeda <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2015</xref>). In lower hydrogen production capacity, on-site production is economically the best solution because the additional cost for hydrogen transport could be eliminated (Ajanovic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2008</xref>).</p><p id="Par113">There are several uses for hydrogen which are expected to be economic in the near future. The earliest large-scale application of electrolytic hydrogen is expected to be in the upgrading of refinery products, where hydrogen produced by steam-methane reforming can be replaced. There may also be an opportunity for hydrogen to be used in biomass-to-methanol conversion. A main thrust, however, has been and likely will continue to be to make the utilization of hydrogen as a transportation fuel economic.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Social and political implications of hydrogen energy</title><p id="Par114">If the world’s progress toward a hydrogen era is to proceed smoothly and rapidly, all issues surrounding the use of hydrogen energy must be addressed. As pointed out previously, hydrogen technologies must be developed to the stage where they are economically and commercially viable. This task includes overcoming any existing safety problems and building up the infrastructure, probably in a gradual manner, needed to support hydrogen energy systems. There are, however, many social and political issues surrounding hydrogen energy which must be understood (Ekins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2010</xref>; Kothari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2008</xref>). Several of these issues are now discussed.</p><p id="Par115">The numerous social and political implications of converting to a hydrogen era have been examined by governments, universities and private industries. In general, the entry of hydrogen is subject to the goals of a country, some of which are<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par116">healthy levels of employment</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par117">a reasonably good rate of economic growth</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par118">reasonable stability in prices</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par119">viable balance of payments</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par120">an equitable distribution of rising incomes.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par121">In line with these goals, there are several factors that are instrumental in forming a hydrogen policy for a country. For example, important issues in the development and establishment of a national hydrogen energy policy for Canada have been examined over many years (Slotin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">1983</xref>) and include the following:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par122">Canadian energy systems should be gradually directed away from hydrocarbons in the long term, which was a recommendation as long ago as 1981 of a Parliamentary Special Committee on Energy Alternatives (Lefebvre et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">1981</xref>).

In Canada, for instance, such studies were carried out by the Special Committee on Alternative Energy and Oil Substitution (discussed earlier) and provincial authorities in Ontario and Quebec. Several encouraging developments in the hydrogen energy field followed in Canada including, for instance, the establishment of a Hydrogen Industry Council comprised of representatives from users and manufacturers, and an Institute for Hydrogen Systems in Ontario.</p><p id="Par128">Public perceptions, often concerning costs and benefits, affect significant market and behavioral patterns for new technologies. Understanding public perceptions is therefore a crucial step in managing the transition to new technologies. Methodologies that can handle knowledge elicitation, representation and reasoning efficiently are needed to accomplish this task.</p><p id="Par129">Public support and public opposition influence the implementation of hydrogen technologies. Therefore, public perception toward a hydrogen economy is often analyzed to help policy makers devise strategies that could assist in improving the public perception and implementing hydrogen technologies. This is often done by using surveys and mathematical tools such as Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping to analyze cognitive structures underlying beliefs related to a low-carbon future (Kontogianni et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2013</xref>). Financial gains, environmental concerns, safety and knowledge about the new technology seem to be some of the factors that are often analyzed in studying public perception toward any new technology, including renewable and hydrogen technologies. One study shows that willingness to pay to participate in projects contributing to the use of fuel cell vehicles despite the vehicle’s current limitations (i.e., reduced range and limited refueling possibilities) seems to be driven mostly by users’ expectation of personal financial gains (i.e., reduced running costs). In such cases, a financially attractive package is essential for hydrogen promotion among users (Kontogianni et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2013</xref>; Mourato et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2004</xref>). There seem to be not much safety concerns among some users about driving hydrogen-fueled vehicles. It seems that in highly regulated industries where rigorous tests are conducted to ensure safety, users may not be as concerned as expected about safety of hydrogen use (Mourato et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2004</xref>). In some studies, environmental considerations are found to affect users’ willingness to pay for hydrogen technologies (Mourato et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2004</xref>). This could mean that improving public awareness of such technologies and air pollution promotes the use of these technologies in the future. In contrary, in some studies, users with better knowledge of the technology emphasize more the difficulties of the hydrogen future (Kontogianni et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par130">Huijts et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2014</xref>) examine psychological determinants of citizens’ supporting or opposing hydrogen fuel station technology. They suggest that policy makers should engage citizens in relatively effective, easy and appreciated supporting actions in order to receive support from users. They also show that users’ opposing actions occur when they have a lower trust in industry. Gaining and keeping trust therefore seems important in minimizing oppositions against hydrogen technologies (Huijts et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>When and where will hydrogen come?</title><p id="Par131">The arguments leading to the conclusion that the world is inevitably moving toward a hydrogen era are often uncertain about one important detail: time. It is useful to know when hydrogen will start to play the role of an energy carrier, and when it will become a principal chemical energy carrier. Based on the discussions in this chapter of the technical, economic, social and political factors affecting hydrogen energy and the world’s progress toward a hydrogen era, a question can be addressed, which was posed by Marchetti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">1985</xref>): When will hydrogen come?</p><p id="Par132">It is generally agreed that hydrogen energy will become important in different countries at different times. So, in answering the question of when hydrogen will come, one must also answer the question: Where will hydrogen come? Most of the predictions have been made for developed countries. This is because they will likely be the first countries to need hydrogen as an energy carrier (Sigfusson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2007</xref>; Penner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2006</xref>; Maack and Skulason <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2005</xref>; Scott <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2007</xref>; Johnson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1981</xref>). This is not to say that developing countries will not need hydrogen. To the contrary, they will likely need hydrogen as much as any developed country if they hope to continue developing. However, the entry of developing countries into the transition era is almost certain to follow that of developed ones. Hence, most of the following discussion pertains to developed countries.</p><p id="Par133">In trying to predict when and where hydrogen will come, many lines of reasoning, ranging from intuitive estimates to detailed calculations, have been used. In the early 1980s, many researchers predicted when they expect hydrogen to begin to become “important” as an energy carrier. This time would roughly correspond to the beginning of the transition era, following terminology used in this paper. In general, the values predicted for many different developed countries ranged from 1990 to 2020.</p><p id="Par134">Some of the most intriguing reasoning methods used to predict when hydrogen will important were presented by Marchetti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">1985</xref>). In his 1973 paper, Marchetti introduced the concept of an “energy island,” a small island on which massive amounts of nuclear energy would be generated. This energy would be distributed to the world’s users in the form of hydrogen. Using what he called “dreamy guesses,” Marchetti predicted that hydrogen energy will become important in 1991.</p><p id="Par135">Subsequently, Marchetti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">1985</xref>) developed two independent and more rigorous arguments which he used to predict when hydrogen would begin to penetrate the world’s energy markets. In the first argument, he showed that, in the course of time, the market has required more fluid fuels, fuels that have ever-increasing hydrogen-to-carbon atomic ratios (<italic>H</italic>/<italic>C</italic>). That is, wood (<italic>H</italic>/<italic>C</italic> = 0.1) was replaced by coal (<italic>H</italic>/<italic>C</italic> = 1), which was replaced by oil (<italic>H</italic>/<italic>C</italic> = 2), which was finally replaced by natural gas (<italic>H</italic>/<italic>C</italic> = 4). This evolution is illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, using the same plot format as in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. In Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, Marchetti plotted <italic>H</italic>/<italic>C</italic> in the world’s fuel mix as a function of time in and, after modeling the data, predicted <italic>H</italic>/<italic>C</italic> in the world’s fuel mix would eventually be greater than four. But as no other hydrocarbons have a hydrogen-to-carbon ratio greater than 4, Marchetti deduced that <italic>H</italic>/<italic>C</italic> &gt; 4 in the world’s fuel mix implies pure hydrogen must be used as a fuel. By extrapolating the curve on Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> to <italic>H</italic>/<italic>C</italic> = 4, Marchetti predicted that pure hydrogen will begin to penetrate the world’s market as a fuel around 2000.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Variation over time of the hydrogen-to-carbon atomic ratio (<italic>H</italic>/<italic>C</italic>) in the world’s fuel mix, in terms of the ratio <italic>H</italic>/(<italic>H</italic> + <italic>C</italic>) (adapted from Marchetti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">1985</xref>)).

Noting the existence of certain operating hydrogen-technology prototypes and applying this “relation” to them, Marchetti predicted hydrogen penetration of the market around 1995–2000.</p><p id="Par137">Slightly later, Scott (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">1987</xref>) used the arguments of Marchetti and others to predict that between the years 1990 and 2015, all developed nations will reach a point when at least 0.5–2.0 % of their energy transactions will involve non-hydrocarbon-derived hydrogen (using the terminology developed in this paper, this time would roughly correspond to the beginning of the transition era). By observing that in some developed countries, such as Germany, France and Japan, (a) nuclear-generated electricity is expected to saturate electricity markets, and (b) hydrogen energy systems’ technologies are actively being developed, Scott predicted that the most developed countries will begin production of non-fossil hydrogen by 1990. That is, they will enter the transition era by 1990. Scott then predicted that between 2000 and 2010, most other developed countries will enter the transition era and that, by 2015, all developed countries will have entered the transition era. However, he notes that the countries entering after 2000 may be using technologies imported from the leading hydrogen-technology countries.</p><p id="Par138">Other reports (e.g., Marchetti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">1985</xref>)) predicted in the early 1980s that over the following few decades Canada, Japan and several members of the European Community (e.g., Germany, France and Belgium) would likely introduce hydrogen technologies in special applications. Scott (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">1987</xref>) examined Canada in detail and concluded that some regions in Canada will enter the transition era by 1990. Some characteristics of Canada that support this conclusion include the following:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par139">a unique energy matrix, including a large nuclear power generation capacity;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par140">a large and not fully developed hydraulic power generation capacity;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par141">advanced electrolyzer technologies; and</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par142">some of the world’s most extensive, but hard to extract, hydrocarbon resources.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par143">Scott (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">1987</xref>) pointed out that of all regions of Canada, Ontario will probably be the first to enter the transition era, noting that Ontario’s electricity markets had been saturated by nuclear-generated electricity since 1980.</p><p id="Par144">Some argue that these predictions have been proven valid and that some countries or regions have entered a transition era. Others feel that it is not clear if the transition era has been reached. Certainly, the fluctuations in energy prices and concerns about the environment over the last four decades have affected the predictions. But their general premises and conclusions appear to remain valid qualitatively, even if the predictions of dates have not been precise.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par145">The world’s supplies of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and natural gas, are becoming scarcer, and concerns over the environmental impacts associated with their use are growing. Fossil fuels are gradually being replaced by non-fossil energy sources, such as solar, wind and nuclear energy. Whereas fossil energy sources are also energy carriers, non-fossil energy sources must be converted to energy carriers. Using present technology, non-fossil energy sources are converted almost exclusively to electricity. Although energy consumers need electricity to satisfy some of their energy demands, they also need a chemical fuel for certain applications, such as transportation. The logical choice for this chemical fuel is hydrogen because, among other reasons, it can be efficiently produced from non-fossil energy sources or from the electricity they currently can produce.</p><p id="Par146">The technologies needed for hydrogen energy systems are currently receiving much research and development effort. There are many commercial processes for producing hydrogen from fossil sources, such as steam-methane reforming and partial oxidation of heavy oils. As well, there are several processes for producing hydrogen from non-fossil sources existing or under development, such as electrolysis and thermochemical water splitting. Technologies for the storage and distribution of hydrogen are also receiving much attention. Hydrogen can be stored and transported as a compressed gas or as a cryogenic liquid, or using methods by which hydrogen is absorbed onto the surface, or permeates into, specially chosen substances. Technologies for utilizing hydrogen in certain industrial processes, such as upgrading of heavy oils and production of methanol and ammonia, are presently in place; technologies for utilizing hydrogen as an energy carrier, mainly in transportation applications, are being developed.</p><p id="Par147">Today, the cost of producing hydrogen is the most significant factor in the total cost of using hydrogen; the costs of utilization, storage and distribution are relatively small, except for liquefaction costs, which can increase the cost of supplied hydrogen by approximately 60 %. An economic assessment from several decades ago projected for Ontario that hydrogen produced from nuclear-generated electricity will be economically competitive with hydrogen produced by steam-methane reforming (the currently economic method) by 2000, while more recent assessments predict dates varying from 2020 to 2050. Thus, non-fossil-derived hydrogen may be used in the future in applications such as upgrading of refinery products, where it can replace hydrogen presently produced by steam-methane reforming.</p><p id="Par148">Many countries will benefit from the introduction of hydrogen energy technologies, primarily because these technologies will help stabilize the fossil-fuel supply problems of many nations today. These problems are expected to worsen in the future. For the benefits to be realized, however, policies for the introduction of hydrogen technologies into the energy infrastructure of a country must be developed and politically supported. In Canada, political efforts have been spent in developing such policies, and many regions of Canada, especially Ontario, stand to benefit through the introduction of hydrogen technologies.</p><p id="Par149">Most researchers agree that hydrogen technologies will be introduced in developed countries first. Although difficult to make, past estimates of when these countries will begin to use hydrogen as an energy carrier have ranged from 1990 to 2020. Countries such as Germany, France, Japan and Canada appear to be advanced the furthest down the path to hydrogen energy. These predictions, however, are subject to great uncertainty. Technological, economic, social and political factors will all continue to affect the prospects for hydrogen as an energy carrier. Nevertheless, it is likely that the world will eventually move toward an era when hydrogen and electricity are the world’s two dominant energy carriers.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abanades</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Rubbia</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Salmieri</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Thermal cracking of methane into hydrogen for a CO<sub>2</sub>-free utilization of natural gas</article-title><source>Int J Hydrog Energy</source><year>2013</year><volume>38</volume><fpage>8491</fpage><lpage>8496</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.08.138</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abbasi</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Abbasi</surname><given-names>SA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">‘Renewable’ hydrogen: prospects and challenges</article-title><source>Renew Sustain Energy Rev</source><year>2011</year><volume>15</volume><issue>6</issue><fpage>3034</fpage><lpage>3040</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.rser.2011.02.026</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ajanovic</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">On the economics of hydrogen from renewable energy sources as an alternative fuel in transport sector in Austria</article-title><source>Int J Hydrog Energy</source><year>2008</year><volume>33</volume><fpage>4223</fpage><lpage>4234</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.06.041</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Alazemi</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Andrews</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Automotive hydrogen fuelling stations: an international review</article-title><source>Renew Sustain Energy Rev</source><year>2015</year><volume>48</volume><fpage>483</fpage><lpage>499</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.rser.2015.03.085</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR5"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Andress</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>X</given-names></name><name><surname>Bequette</surname><given-names>BW</given-names></name><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>LL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">A systematic methodology for the evaluation of alternative thermochemical cycles for hydrogen production</article-title><source>Int J Hydrog Energy</source><year>2009</year><volume>34</volume><fpage>4146</fpage><lpage>4154</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.11.118</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR6"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Arnason</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Sigfusson</surname><given-names>TI</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Iceland: a future hydrogen economy</article-title><source>Int J Hydrog Energy</source><year>2000</year><volume>25</volume><fpage>389</fpage><lpage>394</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0360-3199(99)00077-4</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR7"><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Baker CR (1980) Production of hydrogen for the commercial market: current and future trends.
