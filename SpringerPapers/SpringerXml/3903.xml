Consequently, the D18:L8-BO based organic solar cell with double-phenanthroline-carbolong achieve the highest efficiency of 18.2%. Double-phenanthroline-carbolong with larger steric hindrance and stronger electron-withdrawing property confirms to suppress the interfacial reaction with norfullerene acceptor, resulting the most stable device. Double-phenanthroline-carbolong based device can sustain 80% of its initial efficiency for 2170 h in dark N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere, 96 h under 85 <sup>o</sup>C and keep 68% initial efficiency after been illuminated for 2200 h, which are significantly better than bathocuproin based devices. Moreover, superb interfacial stability of double-phenanthroline-carbolong cathode interface enables thermal posttreatment of organic sub-cell in perovskite/organic tandem solar cells and obtained a remarkable efficiency of 21.7% with excellent thermal stability, which indicates the potentially wide application of phenanthroline-carbolong materials for stable and efficient solar device fabrications.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Interfacial engineering is an effective strategy to improve efficiency of organic solar cells.

Due to broad absorption to red and infrared light and efficient electron transport, the nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) based OSCs boosted efficiency from 6.8% in 2015<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> to currently, over 19%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. However, the long-term stability under working conditions has always been a major obstacle for their further commercialization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The sequential improvement of OSCs has benefitted from the innovation of highly efficient polymer donors and low bandgap NFAs which can utilize more photons and maintaining a small voltage loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Different from the fullerene and its derivatives, NFAs normally have an acceptor-donor-acceptor (A-D-A) structure with a C = C linker between the donor and acceptor moieties to maintain the conjugated structure. However, the C = C bonds in the NFAs are vulnerable sites that are prone to react with low work function interlayers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and basic materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Generally, many classical and highly efficient cathode interfacial materials (CIMs) such as polyethylenimine (PEI), poly-ethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE) and poly[(9,9-bis(30-(N,N-diethylamino)propyl)−2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctyl-fluorene)] (PFN) contain amine groups in their structures. The lone-pair electron in amines can function as a nucleophile with NFAs through an addition reaction and eventually change the large-conjugated structure of the NFAs, resulting in failure of the photovoltaic characteristic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and stability of the corresponding device during the long-term operation. Considering the potential risk of efficiency loss arise from chemical structure altering of NFAs, the development of high-performance CIMs with improved chemical and structural stability is a feasible strategy to prolong device stability. Many efforts have been carried out to overcome this interfacial instability by developing more stable CIMs to minimize the reactivity of the amine groups in CIMs. Xiong et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. proposed a method to protonate the amine group in PEIE to discourage the interfacial reaction and achieved a flexible NFA OSC with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.5%. Qin et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> found chelation of PEI with Zn<sup>2+</sup> (PEI-Zn) can be realized by addition of zinc acetate dihydrate into the PEI solution. This allows strong chelation between Zn<sup>2+</sup> and amino groups, thus inhibiting the reaction between PEI and the IT-4F. In this way, chelation of metallic elements was shown to be another way to design and synthesize high-performance CIMs with good device efficiency and stability.</p><p id="Par5">Among all the efficient CIMs, the alcohol-soluble small molecular are the most popular due to the convenient synthesis route synthesis and easy functional group modification. Bathocuproine (BCP) is the first reported organic CIM to facilitate electron transport in OSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Subsequently, multiple studies of BCP and its derivatives have been reported to further improving the device efficiency and stability, because a wide-bandgap CIM with a deep HOMO energy level is favorable for OSCs due to the sufficient electron transport. BCP is mainly hampered by its structural instability and chemical reaction with NFAs as has been reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. 1,10-Phenanthroline (Phen), with its rigid and planar chemical structure is a versatile chelating agent which can stabilize low-valent metals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Consequently, the design and development of morphologically stable CIMs based on Phen can simultaneously improve electronic transport and simplify their synthesis.</p><p id="Par6">Interfacial engineering has been proven as an efficient strategy to improve the efficiency of OSCs. Moreover, the highly efficient interfacial materials with suppressed chemical reactivity with active layer and inherent stability not only benefits the lifetime of single junction solar cells, but can also work well as an interconnecting layer (ICL) in OSC-based tandem solar cells (TSC) that enable a thermal post-treatment process for top OSC photon-absorption layer, which is a process that researchers commonly tried to avoid in previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Herein, based on previous study of carbolong materials on solar cell field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, we demonstrate two highly efficient, alcohol-soluble CIMs, a single-phenanthroline-carbolong (SPC) and a double-phenanthroline-carbolong (DPC), with the same Phen core connecting one or two carbolong complexes, respectively. Both SPC and DPC exhibit decreased HOMO and LUMO energy levels and enhanced electrical conductivity than BCP, which are beneficial for efficiency enhancement of the corresponding devices. A work function shift of the Ag cathode closer to the LUMO of the acceptor was also observed. As a result, the DPC and SPC CIL based devices achieve excellent efficiencies of 18.2% and 17.8%, respectively, which are higher than the control BCP-based device (17.4%). More importantly, due to the strong electron-withdrawing property and the large steric-hindrance of DPC, the chemical reaction between CIL and acceptor (L8-BO in this work) is restrained. Meanwhile, the DPC with good structural stability can prohibit the diffusion of the photoactive material to the electrode for its robust structure. Therefore, the DPC OSC shows an enormous enhancement of device stability that retained 80% of initial efficiency (<italic>T</italic><sub>80</sub> lifetime) for 96 h after being heated at 85 <sup>o</sup>C while the BCP-based device fast decreased to almost 0% within only 1 h. Besides, DPC-based device maintained a <italic>T</italic><sub>80</sub> lifetime about 2170 h when kept in dark while the BCP contender device quickly dropped to 5% of its initial PCE within 195 h. Moreover, the DPC-based OSC showed significantly improved illumination stability that can maintain 68% after being illuminated for 2200 h. More than that, the DPC with improved photovoltaic performance and stability, can work well as an ICL for perovskite/OSC tandem solar cell and enable the top OSC cell undergo a thermal annealing post-treatment ultimately achieved a high efficiency of 21.7%. This work provides a universal methodology of CIMs design and synthesis utilizing the idea of chemical inserting between CIM and NFAs thus benefit for application in photovoltaic device.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials synthesis and characterization</title><p id="Par7">As outlined in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the compounds of SPC and DPC were synthesized according to an addition reaction of 3-ethynyl-1,10-phenanthroline (Phen-S1) or 3,8-bis(ethynyl)−1,10-phenanth-roline (Phen-D1) with a carbolong complex (S1), which yielded a productivity more than 90% in a one-step synthesis route.

The energy levels of each functional layer in the device are exhibited in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> and Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, meanwhile the energy level of other layers are derived from previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. When compared with BCP, the LUMO energy levels of SPC and DPC decreased by 1.33 and 1.57 eV, respectively, closer to the LUMO energy level of L8-BO acceptor and hence benefit the electron transportation at the active layer/ETL interface. Besides, the HOMO energy levels of SPC and DPC CIL are slightly less than that of BCP which can more efficiently block the injection of holes from the active layer to the cathode thus suppressing the recombination. We summarized the energy levels of highly efficient NFAs, commonly used CIMs as well as metal electrodes that have been reported in recent years (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). Both deep HOMO and LUMO energy levels of SPC and DPC are more suitable with the novel NFAs in current OSCs. For OSCs, the CIL is regarded as an exciton separation and charge transport layer at the cathode. To understand the carbolong substitution on conductivity of SPC and DPC which is directly relate to the device performance according to efficient electron transmission. The self-doping effect of CIMs were investigated by the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy that can been seen from Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14</xref>. We firstly investigated the sole component of BCP, SPC and DPC. Very weak signal around g value of 2 from unpaired electron were detected in BCP, SPC and DPC. To further resealing the self-doping effect happed between acceptor and CIM, we also tested the ESR spectra of L8-BO:CIMs. The sample was prepared by dissolving L8-BO and CIM with molar ratio of 1:1 in chloroform followed by drying in a vacuum chamber. From the result, the L8-BO:DPC inhabits the highest resonance peak, suggesting the most efficient electron transport when compared with L8-BO:SPC and L8-BO:BCP.

The reason the costly and highly efficient BCP rarely used in nonfullerene based OSCs is because the lone electron pair on nitrogen can react as a nucleophile with the C = C to modify the chemical structure of the A-D-A type NFAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref> shows the electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution of BCP, SPC and DPC. The positive ESP cover the most of these three CIMs while the electron-rich region is mainly located around the N atom of Phen. The much small ESP value around the N atoms of DPC indicates that the DPC has the weakest nucleophilic ability and thus greatly reduces the chemical reactivity between the acceptor at the interface. Therefore, to track the reaction degree of BCP or DPC with L8-BO in solution over heating time, we measured the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra of prue L8-BO, BCP, DPC and the mix solution of L8-BO:CIM at a molar ratio of 1 :1 in 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane-d<sub>2</sub> (C<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub>D<sub>2</sub>) which kept heating under 80 <sup>o</sup>C for 0, 2, 24, 48 and 96 h, respectively. The result is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">f</xref>, the red line is <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra of pure L8-BO and the single peak located at 9.18 ppm originates from the protons of the C = C. After the L8-BO:BCP mixed solution was heated for 2 h, the characteristic H signal in the C = C peak split to two peaks indicating that the chemical structure of L8-BO began to destroy during the heating process (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). To investigate the chemical reaction product of BCP and L8-BO, we heated the L8-BO:BCP mixed solution under 80 <sup>o</sup>C for 96 h then seperated the final reaction product according to a chemical sedimentation method. The structure of the reaction product was characterized by <sup>1</sup>H NMR and mass spectra as shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">17</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">18</xref>, indicating it was highly possible that the nitrogen atoms on the BCP react rapidly with the C = C double bond of L8-BO and then destroy its structure. However, such chemical reaction can be greatly suppressed by the DPC when the Phen core connects with two carbolong units in the structure. The same experiment was conducted for DPC and L8-BO as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>. Due to the electron-withdrawing properties and large steric hindrance of the carbolong substituents, DPC shows suppressive activity of the reaction with L8-BO, which is confirmed by the fact that the characteristic peak at 9.18 ppm of L8-BO was unaffected by heating at 80 <sup>o</sup>C for 96 h in a mixture solution.</p><p id="Par12">The outstading chemical stability of CIM benifites to the long-term stability of the corresponding device. We further tracked the degradation trend of OSCs by employing different CIMs aged with or witout a temperature of 85 <sup>o</sup>C in an N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. The results are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref> and  <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">h</xref>. The burn-in degradation trend of OSC we obtained includes two stages that are similar to those in previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>: the fast degradation at the initial stage is caused by the as-cast optimum morphology in the active layer when it is not at thermodynamic equilibrium and is followed by a slow linear degradation. Due to the excellent chemical stability when associated with L8-BO, the DPC-based device exhibits better thermal stability than SPC and BCP-based devices. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>, after being heated at 85 <sup>o</sup>C for 96 h in the dark, the DPC-based device still retained 80% of its initial PCE (the PCE dropped to 86% in the first 9 h but dropped only 6% in the last 87 h), while the BCP-based device immediately drops to 1% of its initial efficiency in the first 1 h. Because of a less protected reaction site, the efficiency of the SPC-based device quickly dropped to 58% at the first degradation stage. Subsequently, it maintained a very slow decay rate, similar to the DPC-based device. We also compared the thermally stability of DPC-based device with other widely used CIMs including PDINN, PNDIT-F3N and PFN-Br (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">19</xref>). The result shows that efficiency of device based on PDINN, PNDIT-F3N and PFN-Br fastly decreased below 80% of their initial PCE when heated under 85 <sup>o</sup>C for 8 h, and maintained only 62.3%, 19.9% and 17.3%, respectively, after being heated for 96 h. Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">20</xref> indicates that the better thermal stability of DPC and SPC-based devices, especially in the second degradation stage is due to the slow decay rate of <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> and FF. As a result, the best DPC-based device achieved excellent storage stability which maintained 80% of its initial PCE in the dark about 2170 h, which is about 53 times longer than the BCP-based device that rapidly dropped to 80% within 41 h (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3h</xref>). Compared with BCP CIL, the slow degradation rate of DPC and SPC, especially at the second stage, implies that the carbolong modification is an efficient strategy with which the CIM can diminish the chemical reaction with NFAs thus increasing the long-term stability of the device.</p><p id="Par13">As OSCs operate under illumination, the photon-degradation is an inevitable barrier to a genuinely stable device.

As discussed above, the efficiency aging tendency of device shows a fast degradation stage followed by a slow one. Because the morphology issue of the active layer mainly happens at the first stage, the efficiency of DPC and SPC-based device dropped to 79.83% and 49.0% of their initial PCE within 301 h, respectively, while that of BCP-based device quickly dropped to less than 5% of its original PCE in 195 h.

The characteristic N 1 <italic>s</italic> peak of fresh BCP is located at 398.5 eV while DPC shifted to 399.5 eV due to the two carbolong units with strong electron withdrawing property on the structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.

However, the peak of L8-BO/BCP film moved to 398.9 eV indicating that the chemical structural of BCP changed during the photon-oxidation process. The negligible influence of L8-BO on DPC CIL under long-term illumination can contribute to the slow PCE decay rate of DPC-based devices. Besides the better chemical stability of DPC which pacifies the interfacial reaction as discussed above, the DPC with its good structural stability benefits for the blocking of the diffusion of photoactive layer to metal electrode which is another efficiency damage issue occurring in OSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.

In order to further explore the exciton separation in devices with BCP, SPC or DPC CIM, we conducted transient photocurrent (TPC) measurement as shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">23</xref>. The fitted decay time of BCP, SPC and DPC-based devices are 0.55, 0.23 and 0.22 μs, respectively. The most reduced extraction time confirmed the superior charge extraction ability of DPC-based device.

From the result, more bimolecular recombination existed in the BCP and SPC-based device with lower <italic>α</italic> values of 0.983 and 0.992, respectively. For the DPC-based device, an α value of 0.999 reveals the high suppression of bimolecular recombination in the device.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Exciton separation and charge transportation study.</title><p><bold>a</bold> The PL measurement of D18:L8-BO blends film with or without being covered by BCP, SPC and DPC CIL, respectively. <bold>b</bold><italic>J</italic><sub><italic>ph</italic></sub><italic>-V</italic><sub><italic>eff</italic></sub> of devices with different CILs. <bold>c</bold><italic>J</italic><sub>SC</sub> values of the photovoltaic device <italic>vs</italic> light intensity on a double-logarithmic scale. <bold>d</bold> The EIS spectra of device based on different CILs.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2023_39223_Fig5_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par16">The improved charge dynamics in the DPC-based device can be further confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

In TSCs with inverted OSC as rear cell, thermal annealing during the deposition of organic active layer will trigger the reaction between the active layer and the fragile ICL, thus leading to significant energy loss in generation and dissociation of excitons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Therefore, inverted OSCs have higher requirements for CILs with thermal and structural stability. Robust DPC material with low chemical activity fits well for inverted OSCs and TSCs, the superb thermal tolerance, structural stability, and feasible orthogonal solvent usage of DPC enables the integration to the ICL in TSCs. We fabricated a monolithic perovskite/organic tandem solar cell with a structure of FTO/ZnO/SnO<sub>2</sub>/CsPbI<sub>2</sub>Br/PTAA/MoO<sub>3</sub>/Ag/ICL /D18:L8-BO/MoO<sub>3</sub>/Ag, and the ICL we used here were DPC and BCP. The cross-section SEM image of TSC can be seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>, where the proper controlled thickness of CsPbI<sub>2</sub>Br and organic bulk-heterojunction absorber facilitates the evenly distributed light absorption and current match of sub-cells in TSC device. For perovskite/OSC TSC, the ICL beneath active layer of rear cell should have a high optical transmittance to ensure more transmitted light can be utilized by rear cell. Therefore, we measured the transmittance of BCP and DPC film, with data depicted in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">25</xref>. Although BCP film has very high transmittance, the DPC film obtained with optimized concentration (1 mg/mL) shows a very high transmittance of more than 97% in the long-wavelength region from 400 nm to 1000 nm, which is good enough for the solar cell utilization. Consequently, the high transmittance of BCP and DPC can ensure adequate light-harvesting for photoactive layer of tandem solar cell. Then, we measured the conductivity of DPC and BCP-based ICL with or without a TA process under 85 <sup>o</sup>C. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>, DPC-based ICL achieves a higher conductivity than BCP, which can be ascribed to the distinct superior electric property as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>. More importantly, the conductivity of DPC ICL increased slightly while the BCP device remained unchanged after thermal annealing under 85 °C for 10 min. The improvement can be ascribed to the increased crystallinity and can serve better bridging the perovskite front cell and organic rear cell and as the recombination center.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Monolithic Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cells.</title><p><bold>a</bold> The crossing SEM image of perovskite/OSC tandem solar cell. <bold>b</bold> The conductivity of various CILs measured by <italic>I</italic>-<italic>V</italic> curves base on structure of MoO<sub>3</sub>/Ag/DPC and MoO<sub>3</sub>/Ag/BCP with or without a thermal annealing (TA) process at 85 <sup>o</sup>C. <bold>c</bold> The <italic>J-V</italic> curves of optional individual sub-cells and tandem solar cell, the detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>. <bold>d</bold> EQE spectrum of tandem solar cell. <bold>e</bold> The PCE statistic of DPC based tandem solar cells that obtained from 30 cells. <bold>f</bold> The thermal stability of BCP and DPC based TSCs under 85 <sup>o</sup>C.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2023_39223_Fig6_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par18">The photovoltaic parameters of individual single-junction sub-cells are summarized in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>.

Firstly, the BCP and DPC-based devices were prepared with an inverted structure of ITO/BCP (DPC)/D18:L8-BO/MoO<sub>3</sub>/Ag, that were exactly same as rear cell in the tandem device to fully simulate the performance.

As a result, the PCE of corresponding BCP-TSC only achieved 12.4%.

Besides, a high average PCE of 20.8% that obtained from 30 cells in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref> indicates the high repeatability of DPC-based TSC.

The synthesized CIMs with carbolong substituents exhibit enhanced electron-transport properties and modified work function capability for electrodes, resulting in a high device efficiency of 18.2% based on DPC CIL. More importantly, the introduction of carbolong metallic units in DPC can greatly suppress the reaction with the C = C of nonfullerene acceptor material (L8-BO in this work) and can block the diffusion of photoactive materials at the cathode, which is commonly seen in other amine-containing CIMs. Due to the suppressed chemical activity and inherent stability, DPC maintained excellent device stability when compared to BCP-based device. The best DPC-based device exhibits a storage <italic>T</italic><sub>80</sub> lifetime of about 2170 h in an N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere which is about 53 times longer than the BCP-based device. Meanwhile, the DPC can slow down the device degradation rate and can maintain 68% of its initial PCE after being aged under continuous illumination for 2200 h and retains 80% of its original efficiency after being heated at 85 <sup>o</sup>C for 96 h. DPC can work well as an interconnecting layer in perovskite/OSC tandem solar cells and achieved a high efficiency of 21.7% which is higher than that of BCP-based device. The DPC-based TSC also can maintain 80% of its initial PCE after being heated under 85 <sup>o</sup>C for about 90 h. The carbolong based CIM with efficient photovoltaic performance and a stable structure can ensure the long-time stability and high efficiency of OSCs based on both NFAs and tandem solar cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Materials and synthesis</title><p id="Par20">Unless special statement, all materials directly use after purchase including: D18 (Derthon OPV Co LTD), L8-BO (Solarmer materials), BCP (Adamas) and PEDOT:PSS (CLEVIOS™ P VP AI 4083).
