However, measuring this morphology is challenging because of the small length-scales and low contrast between organic materials. Here we use nanoscale photocurrent mapping, ultrafast fluorescence and exciton diffusion to observe the detailed morphology of a high-performance blend of PTB7:PC<sub>71</sub>BM. We show that optimized blends consist of elongated fullerene-rich and polymer-rich fibre-like domains, which are 10–50 nm wide and 200–400 nm long. These elongated domains provide a concentration gradient for directional charge diffusion that helps in the extraction of charge pairs with 80% efficiency. In contrast, blends with agglomerated fullerene domains show a much lower efficiency of charge extraction of ~45%, which is attributed to poor electron and hole transport. Our results show that the formation of narrow and elongated domains is desirable for efficient bulk heterojunction solar cells.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">The morphology of organic solar cells is crucial to their performance but is difficult to measure.

Light absorption in each of these materials generates excitons that have to diffuse to an interface with the other material, where there is an offset in energy that can split them into electron–hole pairs. These pairs then have to overcome Coulombic attraction in order to dissociate into free-charge carriers and to be extracted to the corresponding electrodes via percolation pathways. Critical to all of these processes is the morphology of the blend—how the two materials mix together or segregate. It is a pressing challenge in the science of OPV materials and devices to be able to determine the optimum morphology of blends<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Recently, single layer OPVs with a record power conversion efficiency of 9.2% were reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> using a blend of the fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl-C<sub>71</sub>-butyric acid methyl ester (PC<sub>71</sub>BM) and a polymer with alternating units of thieno[3,4–b]thiophene and benzodithiophene, commonly denoted as PTB7 (chemical structures shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>) and so consequently this system is of great interest. In this Article, we investigate the nanoscale morphology of such blends, their ultrafast photophysics and performance in devices. We use advanced scanning probe techniques and also exciton diffusion in PC<sub>71</sub>BM as a nanoscale ruler to determine the domain sizes. We investigate the exciton dissociation dynamics with a femtosecond time resolution, which allows us to get information on the domain composition. Blends were prepared with and without the high boiling point additive diiodooctane (DIO). Addition of DIO improves the device’s internal quantum efficiencies by a factor of 2, which we determine is mainly because of improved charge extraction. We show that blends prepared with DIO have a fibre-like morphology of polymer-rich and fullerene-rich domains. We suggest that a concentration gradient between these domains helps in the dissociation of geminate pairs by charge diffusion and that charge extraction is enhanced with a fibrous morphology. We conclude that a fibrous morphology of polymer-rich and fullerene-rich domains is highly advantageous for OPVs.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Chemical structures and device characteristics.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Chemical structures of PTB7, PC<sub>71</sub>BM and the additive DIO.

The electrode structures were not optimized for the highest possible power conversion efficiencies. It should be noted that the efficiency of our device is comparable to the reported value of 7.4% with the same architecture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The world record 9.2% efficient device was fabricated in an inverted geometry with optimized electrode work-functions that increased the photocurrent. However, the active layer deposition process of the record cell (blend ratio, solvent, use of additive, spin-coating speed) was identical to the deposition parameters we have used to make films. Thus, the morphology and photophysics of our blend films, and the conclusions we deduce, are transferable to devices with the highest reported efficiencies. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) increased by a factor of 2 in devices prepared with DIO and is consistent with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The internal quantum efficiency (IQE)—corrected for the number of photons absorbed in the active layer—is determined by optical modelling of the device stack and also increases by a factor of 2 in devices prepared with DIO. The IQE is &gt;90% with DIO in the polymer absorption region and is slightly lower in the region of fullerene absorption.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Blends prepared without additive</title><p id="Par6">We have combined time-resolved PL (TRL) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to provide complementary information on phase separation of the fullerene and polymer. Previous studies reported large domains of fullerene of 100–200 nm in diameter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> in blends prepared without additive. With scanning electron microscopy (SEM) we indeed see large domains (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). To extract more information, we made a score through the film to enable the profile of the domains to be imaged. Visible in the same SEM image is a top ‘skin’ layer of material that can be clearly seen to have been pulled back from the domains at the score, enabling us to observe the material beneath. Then we removed 30–40 nm of material by plasma-ashing to take away the top skin and measured the AFM topography (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>), which shows the large 100–200 nm diameter domains but with fine structure inside them. In an AFM-phase image (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>), the fine structure is better resolved and shows small sphere-like objects of 20–60 nm diameter. We have then employed TRL measurements to learn about the composition of the blend.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Results of PTB7:PC<sub>71</sub>BM blends prepared without additive.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) SEM image of the blend viewed from an angle of 52° with a score made across the film showing large domains and a skin of material on top, the black scale bar is 250 nm.

Neat films of PTB7 are fluorescent; however, it is important to note that even with selective excitation of PTB7 in the blend (<italic>λ</italic><sub>ex</sub>=670 nm) no polymer fluorescence was observed, even at timescales as short as 2 ps; thus with 400 nm excitation we look at solely PC<sub>71</sub>BM emission. Previously, Kazaoui <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> have reported that with high-energy photoexcitation it is possible to excite intermolecular charge transfer states in neat films of C<sub>70</sub>, directly producing charge pairs from an absorbed photon. To confirm that we were not generating significant amounts of charge pairs directly, we measured the PL excitation spectra and compared it with the absorption spectrum of the film (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM863">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>) and find that at 400 nm, ~90% of the absorbed photons produce excitons, with ~10% producing charge pairs. The discrepancy between absorbed photons and emitted photons only becomes significant below 375 nm. The decay of PL is observed on femtosecond (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>) and picosecond–nanosecond (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>) timescales. Decay of the PL in the blend is faster than in films of only PC<sub>71</sub>BM (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>), indicating dynamic quenching by the polymer. The ultrafast decay of PC<sub>71</sub>BM emission in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref> indicates a 330-fs quenching with 0.8 amplitude of fullerene excitons by PTB7. This can occur by hole transfer to PTB7 or resonant energy transfer (RET) to the polymer. The Förster radius for RET from PC<sub>71</sub>BM to PTB7 was calculated to be 2.17 nm from the spectral overlap as described in the Methods. From this value we conclude that the fast quenching has to be short ranged in nature (&lt;10 nm) and is consistent with a large number of small spheres of fullerene, presenting a large surface area for quenching by the polymer.</p><p id="Par8">The slower part of the TRL decay (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>) is mediated by exciton diffusion to an interface with the polymer and can give us the size of the pure fullerene spheres if the exciton diffusion coefficient in PC<sub>71</sub>BM is known. Measurement of the exciton diffusion coefficient is described in the next section, and gives a value of 1.6 × 10<sup>−4</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup> in PC<sub>71</sub>BM. This enables us to describe the dynamics observed in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref> based on the information obtained in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a–c</xref>. The most obvious model is spheres of PC<sub>71</sub>BM surrounded by a matrix of PTB7. We assume that excitons diffuse inside the spheres by a random walk and are instantaneously quenched at the surface with PTB7. The diffusion equation was solved analytically with these boundary conditions following Crank<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, and the number of fullerene excitons in a sphere is given by:<disp-formula id="Equ1"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2013_Article_BFncomms3867_Equ1_HTML.gif"/></disp-formula></p><p id="Par9">where <italic>a</italic> is the radius of the sphere and <italic>D</italic> the diffusion coefficient which we set to the measured value stated above. Equation 1 was multiplied by the fluorescence intensities in the absence of quencher and convoluted with the instrument response to fit the PL decay.</p><p id="Par10">The simulated decay using a pure 150-nm-diameter sphere of PC<sub>71</sub>BM is displayed in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref> as the green dashed line and is slower than the measured decay. The best fit with a single sphere model gives a fullerene sphere with a diameter of 60 nm (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>, solid blue line), agreeing well with the AFM data (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b,c</xref>). The good agreement between the directly observed morphology of domains 20–60 nm in diameter with AFM and the deduced fullerene domain size with TRPL indicates that using the decay of PL in combination with the exciton diffusion coefficient in the bulk to model the morphology is valid.</p><p id="Par11">To further test this validity, we turn our attention to the ‘pureness’ of the small spheres of PC<sub>71</sub>BM. We can modify our model by including a small percentage of PTB7 uniformly distributed inside the 60-nm-fullerene spheres (a fuller description is provided in the Methods). We find that even a very small amount (0.2 wt%) of PTB7 mixed into the spheres renders the decay faster than is measured, shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref> as the orange dotted line, giving strong evidence that the small 60 nm spheres are comprised of pure fullerene. To explore this further, we have performed differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) on similar blends of PTB7:PC<sub>71</sub>BM. With DSC, we can monitor the phase transitions of the fullerene in the blend. Such phase transitions (for example, melt temperature) would be modified if significant amounts of the fullerene were in a mixed phase with the polymer, indicating purity. The melt temperature of the fullerene would be the best feature to observe and was found to be at 315–320 °C (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM863">Supplementary Figs S3,S4</xref>), consistent with published values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. This fullerene melt cannot be observed in the blend with DSC because of overlapping melt crystallization in PTB7 at this temperature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM863">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). Information on the fullerene purity can instead be derived from the melt crystallization peak (205 °C)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, where there is no overlapping polymer phase transition.

Dark current in the same area was at least five times lower than with 670 nm light. Details of the pc-AFM experiments and photocurrent maps with negative tip bias as well as maps at different positive tip bias are given in the Methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM863">Supplementary Figs S13,S14</xref>. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4g</xref> shows typical photocurrent–voltage curves of high and low current regions. Without an applied bias, photogenerated electrons cannot flow to the gold tip owing to a Schottky barrier but they can be extracted to the indium tin oxide (ITO), while holes can be extracted to the gold tip, generating a negative photocurrent. With a positive tip bias higher than the open circuit voltage (<italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub>) of ~0.7 V, electrons overcome the Schottky barrier and are extracted to the tip, whereas holes flow to the ITO and the photocurrent is positive. The absolute value of the negative photocurrent is about 5–10 times lower for the same voltage, which can be explained by a barrier to extract photogenerated holes from the tail of the density of states of the polymer into the gold tip. The 670-nm light preferentially excites the polymer; therefore, high photocurrent is likely to correspond to polymer-rich regions. This is confirmed by the observation that photocurrent maps obtained at negative tip bias correlate with positive tip bias maps (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM863">Supplementary Fig. S13</xref>) as well as confirming that the measured quantity is photocurrent. Consequently, lower photocurrent is from fullerene-rich regions of the sample. The first thing to notice in the photocurrent map is that the domains of high and low photocurrent are smaller and more elongated than those without the additive, which indicates that polymer-rich and fullerene-rich domains have a high aspect ratio, with their lengths being longer than their widths. The regions of the blend with the highest and lowest photocurrents are narrow and resemble elongated thin fibre-like strands or swirling ‘brushed fibres’, with the close-up image shown in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref> indicating that these richest domains are typically 10–50 nm wide and 200–400 nm long.

The same regions of high photocurrent are observed in the range of +1.5 to +6 V (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM863">Supplementary Fig. S14</xref>), which indicates that photocurrent contrast is not affected by charge extraction; thus, the photocurrent contrast is dependent on the polymer concentration as it is absorbing the 670-nm tip light. Therefore, a continuous change of photocurrent in the pc-AFM map implies that the mixing ratio of the polymer and fullerene also changes gradually.

This domain size was unable to determine any spatial organization of the domains, and so our work observing the elongated fibre-like alternating phases of polymer-rich and fullerene-rich domains enables the lengths observed by Collins <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> to be placed in a spatial context.</p><p id="Par28">It should be noted that while the pc-AFM image shows the morphology in-plane, and that in a working device charge transport will be perpendicular to the plane (towards the contacts), our understanding is that the concentration gradient of each material that forms between the polymer-rich and fullerene-rich regions helps the dissociation of geminate charge pairs by diffusion as positive/negative charge diffuses preferentially towards the polymer-rich and fullerene-rich domains, respectively. In pc-AFM, the charges are extracted by a strong electric field, whereas in working OPVs the built-in field is much weaker and charge diffusion has an important role in separation of Coulombically bound charge pairs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Directional charge diffusion driven by a concentration gradient is expected to lead to more dissociation than a random walk. The separated charges are then transported in the fibre-like polymer-rich and fullerene-rich domains with low probability of recombination. The overall morphology is thus beneficial for exciton dissociation into a charge pair, geminate pair dissociation into free charges and charge extraction, all of which are consistent with the observed high IQE of 80–90%. Rather than simply being an agent to ensure that the materials are well mixed, the solvent additive creates an environment where the optimum morphology for a working device is created.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par29">The results presented have enabled significant new nanoscale morphology of the high-performance PTB7:PC<sub>71</sub>BM blends to be observed for the first time, determining how the morphology of the blend affects the efficiency of charge carrier generation, extraction and the quantum efficiency of OPV devices. We show that blends prepared from solutions without any processing additive form large (100–200 nm) fullerene-rich domains comprised of small 20–60 nm pure fullerene spheres. The exciton dissociation efficiency is high (90%) in these blends but the IQE is only 40–60%, limited by charge extraction. This indicates that large fullerene- and polymer-rich domains give poor charge extraction and high recombination, leading to low quantum efficiencies. By using the additive DIO, narrow and extended fibre-like polymer-rich and fullerene-rich domains are created, with fibres 10’s of nanometres wide and 100’s of nanometres long for both materials. Exciton dissociation in the blends prepared with DIO is very fast, with 95% of exciton decay amplitude occurring on a sub-picosecond timescale. The fibre-like polymer-rich and fullerene-rich domains form part of a continual change in the polymer-fullerene mixing ratio when going from one to another, implying a concentration gradient that is favourable for charge pair dissociation and minimizes geminate recombination, thus giving high extraction efficiency (80%) of photogenerated charges. Consequently, our study of the PTB7:PC<sub>71</sub>BM system tells us about the optimum morphologies that are required, and in this system created, for efficient OPV devices.</p><p id="Par30">Although our study has looked specifically at PTB7:PC<sub>71</sub>BM blends, parallels and contrasts in the morphology can be drawn with other high-performance OPV blends. Charge transport modelling indicates the importance of continuous phases of the donor and acceptor materials and good connectivity to the appropriate electrodes, whereas the domain size has been found to be less important<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. The extended fullerene-rich and polymer-rich domains observed in our work give efficient charge extraction, indicating that they are well connected, despite being only 10–20 nm wide. We note that fibrous morphology has been observed in P3HT- (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>), PCDTBT- (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>) and PCPDTBT (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>)-based blends with PCBM. However, fibres were observed only in the polymer phase. We see that not only the polymer but also the fullerene show this kind of spatial organization, giving bi-continuous networks for both electron and hole transport. Short-range ordering of PTB7 has been explored with grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and indicates that in the blend ~20% of the polymer can be considered crystalline. We are therefore left to consider that bundles of extended PTB7 chains form a template that helps self-organization of fullerene molecules around them, forming fibrous strands of both the donor and acceptor materials, which are advantageous for efficient OPV performance. Owing to the spatial resolution of pc-AFM, it is also possible that both polymer-rich and fullerene-rich domains contain regions of a few nanometres in width of pure material, which are too small for us to observe. The optimum morphology in PTB7:PC<sub>71</sub>BM is substantially different from previous generations of BHJ blends and suggests that the properties of PTB7 are different from other conjugated polymers used in OPVs and can be exploited in future material development.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Sample preparation</title><p id="Par31">PTB7 was purchased from 1-Material and had a molecular weight of 92,000 Da with a polydispersity of 2.6.

The substrates were then dried with nitrogen and treated in an oxygen plasma asher for 5 min. Poly(3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene:poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)(Clevios AI4083) was spin-coated at 4,000 r.p.m. The PEDOT:PSS-coated ITO substrates were annealed on a hotplate at 120 °C for 20 min before being placed in a nitrogen-filled glovebox and PTB7:PC<sub>71</sub>BM spin-coated on top with the same conditions as noted above. The substrates were then inserted into an evaporator for top electrode deposition. An ~20-nm calcium layer and an ~200-nm aluminium cathode were thermally evaporated at a pressure of 2 × 10<sup>−6</sup> mb. Immediately after top electrode deposition, the devices were removed from the evaporator and encapsulated with a UV optical adhesive and a glass coverslip.
