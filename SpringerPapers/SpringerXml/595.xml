Literature suggests a wide range of organic corrosion inhibitors with high inhibition efficiency, barrier properties, and adsorption mechanisms. However, the long-term durability and protectiveness of an organic inhibitor film need to be understood with in-depth insights on its interaction with heterogenous alloy surfaces like AA6xxx, reduction of galvanic activities and time-resolved degradation due to ionic diffusion. The present article is focused on the time-resolved adsorption and degradation of 2-mercaptobenzimidazole (2-MBI)-induced inhibitor layer/film over AA6061 in 0.1 M NaCl solution. Electrochemical and surface analysis data indicate that the presence of 2-MBI drives the rapid formation of a 20–30 nm thick protective film comprised of constitutional elements of C, S, and N from 2-MBI upon the surface of AA6061 substrate. This film mitigated the corrosion cells associated with nano- and micro-sized Fe and Si-rich intermetallic particles (IMPs) in AA6061. XPS reveals two distinguished bonding states of S and N in the inhibitor film and chemical interactions between 2-MBI and the surface of AA6061. The protective film maintained 65% inhibiting efficiency after 1 day, which progressively degraded due to electrolyte ingress and eventually with a drop in inhibition efficiency down to 21% after 14 days. Inhibitor-induced film over AA6061 reduced the corrosion susceptibility of Fe, and Si-rich IMPs up to 1 day given the subsequent adsorption by S and N heteroatoms. However, this film became thick and defective after 1 day, which undermined its barrier properties against ingress of aggressive ions and facilitated water adsorption.</p></sec><sec

popular with coating technologies for their rapid adsorption over metal surfaces. Over the last decades, these have been extensively studied to protect heterogenous Al alloys as conventional chrome conversion coatings are hazardous to human health and the environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, a limited number of studies reported the inhibitory efficiency of corrosion inhibitors on high-strength Al alloys 6xxx (AA6xxx) series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and the adsorption and durability of organic corrosion inhibitors in corroding environments need to be well understood. Comprehensive and in-depth investigation of film-forming organic inhibitors is required to understand film thickness, film chemistry, and the consequent barrier properties of an inhibitor film over an extended period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It is critical to understand inhibitor interactions with an oxide layer and other available surface species, the breakdown mechanism of established inhibitor film and the role of ionic diffusion therein, and the changing coverage IMPs of inhibitors and the impact of such coverage on micro galvanic or nano galvanic couplings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Systematic studies on the long-term behavior of such inhibitor systems in terms of film stability, durability, and breakdown should address existing knowledge gaps and develop sound systems with inhibitor layers promoting sustained inhibition efficiency.</p><p id="Par4">AA6xxx possesses better corrosion resistance than their high-strength Al alloy counterparts, even given the presence of several IMPs within the Al matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These IMPs are categorized as coarse constituent AlFeMnSi (α-phase), metastable or stable precipitates of Mg<sub>2</sub>Si (β-phase), pure Si particles, Al<sub>5</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>Mg<sub>8</sub>Si<sub>6</sub> (Q-phase), Al<sub>2</sub>Cu (θ-phase), and Al<sub>2</sub>CuMg (S-phase), respectively. Most of these IMPs are either cathodic or anodic to the surrounding Al matrix and can initiate pitting in the adjacent matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It has been reported that Mg<sub>2</sub>Si acts as an "anode" owing to the anodic corrosion potential to Al. Therefore, these IMPs preferentially dissolve with respect to the Al matrix in neutral and acidic NaCl solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In alkaline NaCl solutions (pH &gt; 12), Mg<sub>2</sub>Si exhibits passivity and turns into "cathode", and Al matrix becomes anode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Cathodic partial reactions could facilitate OH<sup>−</sup> (hydroxyl ion) generation and subsequent rise in pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Given the amphoteric nature of aluminium oxides, high pH values degrade oxide layers and thus expose bulk Al for further anodic dissolution. Therefore, Al matrix preferentially dissolves at the periphery of Mg<sub>2</sub>Si in AA6xxx. A good number of publications have confirmed that Mg<sub>2</sub>Si dissolves by preferential Mg dissolution, which leaves Si-rich remnant that is immune to further corrosion reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Therefore, providing a barrier effect could be helpful to reduce the galvanic activity of IMPs where film-forming organic corrosion inhibitors could play a key role by rapidly adsorbing over IMPs in corrosive environments and mitigating the overall corrosion rate of AA6xxx. Limiting IMP activities by organic inhibitor adsorption has been minimally reported in the literature for AA6xxx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">The critical issues addressed in most inhibitor studies include reducing corrosion current density, enhanced polarization resistance, and the existence of non-ideally behaved capacitance of inhibitor films/layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The electrical parameters associated with an inhibitor-induced protective layer could provide a quantitative view of the corrosion resistive properties of an applied inhibitor. Alterations of these parameters in long durations tests (up to 14 days) could be crucial in understanding the surface reactions occurring on the substrate surface. The resistance offered by an inhibitor-derived layer could be represented by multiple resistive elements that are summed up to calculate the polarization resistance of the system, which is one of the indicators of long-term durability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Therefore, time-resolved changes of polarization resistance coupled could provide critical information about the inhibitor coverage above the substrate surface and subsequent diffusion of aggressive ions through an inhibitor layer/coating. The constituent parameters of polarization resistance need to be discussed individually for a deeper understanding of the durability of corrosion inhibition. For instance, a barrier against charge transfer of a working electrode refers to the resistance of a metal-coating interface against ionic diffusion and desorption of water molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Charge transfers resistance (<italic>R</italic><sub>ct</sub>) is one of the important parameters to look at during electrochemical analysis over the long-term, which has been minimally reported for AA6xxx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Moreover, capacitive elements of an electrochemical system represent the homogeneity of its coverage over a substrate surface. It could be predicted to some extent by the ideality of respective quantified parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Therefore, the deviation of capacitive elements from the behavior of an ideal capacitor with time needs to be taken into consideration during electrochemical analysis.</p><p id="Par6">A large number of literatures on corrosion inhibition focused on the exposure of metal substrate directly to inhibited electrolyte and then measured electrochemical parameters at different periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In most of these studies, the working electrode was exposed to inhibited electrolyte, and electrochemical data were acquired at different time intervals to evaluate any inhibitor-induced layer's inhibition effect and barrier properties. However, the interactions of inhibitor molecule with working electrode could be different if it is exposed inhibitor-treated corrosive electrolyte without any external electrical connections, <italic>i.e.</italic> three cell electrode arrangements. Therefore, time-resolved growth monitoring could be more reliable if alloy substrate is exposed to inhibited electrolyte solution and then pulled out from that environment periodically, followed by electrochemical measurements using an electrolyte solution without inhibitor. Remarkably, this aspect has not been well reported in the open literature. Furthermore, the electrochemical properties of an inhibitor layer/coating critically depend on the adsorption criterion of inhibitor molecules, its influence on reducing the nano and micro galvanic activities around IMPs, and time-dependent change in the coating/layer thickness and composition.</p><p id="Par7">Heterocyclic organic compounds have been numerously reported for corrosion mitigation of Cu, Au, and Fe alloys. The adsorption mechanisms have been explained by the interaction of electron-rich ligands with bulk metal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Azole-based heterocyclics, especially 2-MBI, have attracted corrosion researchers' interest due to their rapid film-forming behaviour over Cu-rich IMPs of aerospace-grade AA2024 alloy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The growth and stability of 2-MBI film that forms over a metal or alloy substrate could vary as a function of the chemical nature of the electrolyte, interactions between inhibitor molecules with substrate oxide, and exposure time. Cu-free AA6xxx alloys constitute Fe, Si, and Mn-rich intermetallic phases. Therefore, the adsorption of 2-mercaptobenzimidazole (2-MBI) molecules could be investigated for any distinguishable change in bonding from the topmost inhibitor layer to the innermost metal-inhibitor layer interface. Previously, inhibitor adsorption mechanisms on AA6xxx alloys and the influence of IMPs have been explored with an exposure time ranging from 0 to 168 h. However, those studies were confined mainly to inorganic inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. In addition, limited studies have been conducted on organic inhibitors at shorter exposure times (less than 168 h) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It is unclear about the growth of a barrier layer by 2-MBI in a corrosive environment. A deep understanding of the mechanisms of inhibitor film growth, stability, and breakdown is beneficial to develop and optimize inhibitor systems for extended use and enhanced durability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Quantum chemical calculations postulate that 2-MBI inhibitor film could have a thickness of 0.75–1 nm when attached to a Cu substrate in a perpendicular orientation within a single layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. However, in real-time conditions, adsorption of organic inhibitor molecules may result in a complex film over a metal substrate due to the presence of a metal oxide layer and electrolyte ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">An inhibitor film could be a combination of available surface species like oxygen or ions from dissolved IMPs, metal matrix, electrolyte, etc<italic>.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Available knowledge on 2-MBI inhibitor layer is insufficient to address some key factors when applied on AA6xxx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. These key factors could be the growth of a protective layer in the presence of 2-MBI molecules or barrier properties of that layer against diffusion of electrolyte. Additionally, desorption/adsorption of 2-MBI molecules calculated on relevant electrical parameters and the durability of inhibition due to degeneration of the protective layer could also be useful.</p><p id="Par9">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> hypothetically represents the film formation by an organic inhibitor molecule with a metal surface by interacting with heteroatoms and its breakdown at a longer exposure time. The left-hand side of the figure tentatively depicts the bond formation of an organic inhibitor molecule with a metal surface where the first interaction has been predicted through the bond formation by heteroatoms simultaneously with the metal or metal oxide. A second interaction could also be possible by the physical adsorption of inhibitor molecules, resulting in a complex multilayer film structure. Heterocyclic organic inhibitor molecules have different heteroatoms that could draw the benzene ring's electron clouds towards them and act as charge centers (<italic>X</italic>, <italic>Y</italic> &amp; <italic>Z</italic> from Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). These charge centers then facilitate weak electrostatic interaction with the underlying metal or oxide, resulting in physical adsorption of inhibitor molecules through Vander walls force [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Subsequent chemical and physical adsorption of inhibitor molecules could result in a complex, multilayered structure over the substrate surface that may vary over time in bonding environments of heteroatoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. This inhibitor film/layer could act as a barrier against charge transfer, <italic>i.e.</italic> higher polarization resistance, better hydrophobicity, etc. Mechanism of film formation and its structure could be predicted through the micro and nanoscopic surface analysis techniques with complementary electrochemical data. The structure of this film could be varied due to the chemical environment, charge density, and electrostatic interactions between an organic inhibitor molecule and substrate surface. This film/layer (right-hand side) could be porous and defective at longer exposure times due to breaking bonds with metal or oxide. It can be investigated through the quantitative analysis of electrochemical parameters. The available aggressive ions could penetrate this defective layer and accelerate further corrosion reactions at longer exposure times to corrosive electrolytes. In the case of a heterogeneous alloy surface, the formation of an inhibitor film/layer and its degradation with time could be critical due to inhomogeneous surface potential distribution across the surface. Therefore, the knowledge on the mechanism of inhibitor film formation over AA6061 and its durability in a corrosive electrolyte for a longer time could be valuable to current literature.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic illustration of inhibitor film formation and breakdown inhibitor film/layer over a metal surface in a corrosive electrolyte.

This high-frequency shoulder found to be absent in 7 and 14 day. This could be attributed to the gradual diffusion of aggressive ions through the thick inhibitor layer penetrating with time. Aggressive ions might have diffused to the oxide layer (protected beneath absorbed inhibitor molecules), reaching the alloy surface and facilitating its break down. In later stages, the oxide layer could be partially repaired by the inhibitor layer as the Warburg resistance values were higher at 7 day (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) i.e. better resistance to ionic diffusion. Therefore, after 14 days, the substrate surface had a more complex mixed layer and high-frequency shoulder region of the phase angle curve found to be absent. The absence of a high-frequency shoulder region in the phase angle plot could be associated with low pore resistance. This later process also allows more water and aggressive ions to diffuse through to the surface, altering both <italic>R</italic><sub>pore</sub> and <italic>R</italic><sub>charge-transfer</sub> along with the capacitance of both layers. <italic>R</italic><sub>pore</sub> values were found to decrease from 943,922 to 26,025 Ω cm<sup>2</sup> after 14 days inhibited sample (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), indicative of time-dependent transportation of aggressive ions thought the pores generated inside the coating structure. These findings postulate the porous nature of the inhibitor film after 14 days with a complex chemical composition comprised of oxides and inhibitor elements.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Influence of inhibitor layer on electrochemical parameters and its barrier properties</title><p id="Par53">Nyquist plots have divulged the better <italic>R</italic><sub>pol</sub> (<italic>R</italic><sub>pol</sub> = <italic>R</italic><sub>pore</sub> + <italic>R</italic><sub>charge-tranfer</sub> + <italic>R</italic><sub>solution</sub>) values for the inhibited sample that could be associated with the emergence of 2-MBI induced protective layer or coexistent inhibitor–oxide mixed layer. The nyquist plot could consist of two semicircles in an inhomogeneous coating system. The semicircle at high-frequency is related to the coating response and the low-frequency semicircle is related to corrosion processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. The equivalent circuit diagram (EEC) presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c suggests two related effects occurring on the AA6061 surface. Firstly, a coating builds up over AA6061, and secondly, the active metal surface is gradually covered by inhibitor molecules. The coating layer affects the resistive (<italic>R</italic><sub>pore</sub>) and a capacitive element (<italic>Q</italic><sub>inhibitor-oxide</sub>) which attributes to high-frequency responses of Nyquist plots in the inhibited conditions. Tweaking of <italic>R</italic><sub>pore</sub> values (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) from 54.8 × 10<sup>6</sup> Ω cm<sup>2</sup> (uninhibited) to 72.1 × 10<sup>6</sup> Ω cm<sup>2</sup> (inhibited) confirms the barrier effect of inhibitor layer/film against water adsorption, charge transfer, ingress of aggressive ions. It is also indicative of surface coverage inhibitor molecules after 1 day. However, a drop in <italic>R</italic><sub>pore</sub> values at 7 and 14 days immersed sample indicates gradual loss in protective nature of the inhibitor-induced film/layer due to either ingress of aggressive ions or adsorption of water molecules through the inhibitor-metal interface or both. Another aspect of protectiveness of an inhibitor-induced layer could be the surface coverage of the inhibitor molecules. This could help retract water molecules and counter-ions, declining the double-layer capacitance (<italic>Q</italic><sub>dl</sub>) and concurrently enhancing the charge transfer resistance. With the inhibitor addition, the available surface area for charge transfer activities decreases, and thus <italic>R</italic><sub>charge-transfer</sub> increases at 1 day and then reduces drastically after 7 days (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Additionally, after 7 and 14 days the double-layer capacitance (<italic>Q</italic><sub>dl</sub>) has increased more than 10 times. The progressive rise in the (<italic>Q</italic><sub>dl</sub>) double-layer capacitance values at 7 and 14 days could indicate water adsorption over AA6061 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>].</p><p id="Par54"><italic>R</italic><sub>charge-transfer</sub> values are a useful indicator for the inhibitor performance that ultimately influence the overall corrosion rate. This could be illustrated by exchanging positive and negative charges during the electron-donation and back-donation from the substrate surface and subsequent substrate diffusion into the corrosive electrolyte. A Higher <italic>R</italic><sub>charge-transfer</sub> value is associated with the resistive behavior of the metal, implying the effectiveness inhibitor against charge transfer processes. In addition to that, it could also be an area effect, <italic>i.e</italic>. the higher active surface area will provide higher <italic>R</italic><sub>charge-transfer</sub> values. However, the decrease in <italic>R</italic><sub>charge-transfer</sub> values after 1 day in the inhibited condition might have emerged because of the broadening pores on the inhibitor-induced protective layer that possibly decreased the inhibitor coverage over AA6061. The progressive drop of the <italic>Q</italic><sub>dl</sub> (double-layer capacitance) in the inhibited sample could be attributed to the adsorption of 2-MBI and subsequent water displacement from AA6061 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">The higher <italic>R</italic><sub>charge-transfer</sub> and lower <italic>Q</italic><sub>dl</sub> values reveal the stabilizing effect of 2-MBI on the oxide layer on the AA6061 substrate. This behavior indicates the rapid formation of a protective layer on the substrate, followed by gradual densification of this layer with reduced porosity, overall increasing the oxide resistance while maintaining its thickness, as reflected by the FIB-SEM studies. Visser et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] have reported such an identical stabilizing effect of 2-mercaptobenzothiazole on AA2024 substrate, which includes the coverage of Fe or Cu rich intermetallic particles and subsequent higher <italic>R</italic><sub>pol</sub> values being reported. In comparison to uninhibited samples, <italic>R</italic><sub>charge-transfer</sub> for 2-MBI treated samples increased by a factor of 1.5 times (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This implies that 2-MBI stabilizes the aluminium oxide up to 1 day, the time period where the highest <italic>R</italic><sub>charge-transfer</sub> values were observed. A gradual reduction in the <italic>R</italic><sub>charge-transfer</sub> can be observed upon exposure up to 14 d. Time-dependent desorption of the inhibitor molecules from the substrate surface, due to the presence of a porous and defective complex inhibitor layer, could be responsible for this phenomenon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Shi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>] reported time-dependent delamination of a protective inhibitor layer on AA2024. They observed intensive corrosion of AA2024 substrate due to degeneration of the cerium cinnamate inhibitor layer in saline solution after 13 days.</p><p id="Par56">LPR and PDS results identified the barrier properties of the inhibitor complex layer and its stability for longer immersion times. For the inhibited system, a decrease in <italic>R</italic><sub>pol</sub> values can be attributed to possible porosity within the complex protective layer that allows ingress of the electrolyte and contributes to enhanced <italic>i</italic><sub>corr</sub> values. These findings also corroborate the EIS results as the <italic>R</italic><sub>pol</sub> values calculated from EECs (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) differentiate within a reasonable limit. Polarization resistance values evident for the 1d inhibited sample by LPR measurement was ≈3.1 × 10<sup>6</sup> to 4.2 × 10<sup>6</sup> Ω cm<sup>2</sup> which was calculated 7.2 × 10<sup>6</sup> Ω cm<sup>2</sup> from EEC (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). <italic>R</italic><sub>pol</sub> values found to be almost identical for 7 days and 14 days inhibited samples by both EIS and LPR techniques. These findings support the argument that with increasing time, the inhibitor-induced layer developed pores and reduced its surface coverage that favors the charge transfer processes, <italic>i.e.</italic> higher <italic>i</italic><sub>corr</sub> values. A gradual rise in current density from 0.012 to 0.028 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> after 14 days is also supported by the explanation of the increase in charge transfer activities in the coating-substrate interface. Additionally, these findings agree with the PDS results as <italic>R</italic><sub>pol</sub> significantly increased for inhibited conditions, compared with uninhibited conditions, that resulted in reduced current density.</p><p id="Par57">The PDS curves showed lower <italic>i</italic><sub>corr</sub> value for the inhibited system in 1 day immersed sample (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). This could be assigned to the emergence of a porous inhibitor film, offering a passable barrier to corrosion after 1 day immersion. Higher <italic>i</italic><sub>corr</sub> values could be attributed to the filling up of porous cathodic sites with corrosion products, thus facilitating re-passivation processes and lowering the current density overall. Aballe et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>] have provided similar observations for AA5083 alloy in 3.5% NaCl solution. They reported substantial oxide film growth with immersion time that contributed to the re-passivation process. Rapid film formation in the inhibited system possibly contributed to the low <italic>i</italic><sub>corr</sub> values, initially observed at 1 day. However, the likelihood of a time-dependent degradation of the inhibitor-induced film/layer resulted in lower <italic>i</italic><sub>corr</sub> values at 14 days. The shift of Tafel curves to more negative E<sub>corr</sub> values in inhibited conditions with time indicates a predominant cathodic character of 2-MBI on AA6061.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Tentative correlation between pH and changes of electrochemical parameters</title><p id="Par58">The steep rise of pH in the uninhibited system and moderate rise in inhibited condition could be attributed to the degree of dissolution of aluminum oxide layer/protective inhibitor layer due to micro galvanic coupling between the aluminum matrix and intermetallic particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>]. It has been postulated in earlier studies that the cathodic partial reactions facilitate the oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions on the alloy surface. It could increase the solution pH and promote anodic dissolution of Al and Mg from different IMPs comprised of Cu or Fe. Hydroxyl ion (OH<sup>−</sup>) generation enables a high pH environment that favors the dissolution of the aluminum oxide layer, gradually exposing the underneath alloy surface to the corrosive environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In this study, <italic>E</italic><sub>corr</sub> values were found to be more positive for the inhibited conditions than uninhibited conditions. Pyun et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>] have suggested more negative <italic>E</italic><sub>corr</sub> values for the uninhibited system than the inhibited system, referring to the loss of passivity of the AA6061 substrate. It could be related to thinning of the surface oxide layer by hydroxide ion (OH<sup>−</sup>) attack (alkaline chemical dissolution) or to the absence of the primary oxide film [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>]. In the current study, the presence of inhibitor molecules could have provided a barrier effect that delayed the onset of micro galvanic coupling, <italic>i.e</italic>. lowering the dissolution of the oxide layer and stabilizing it further.

This refers to the escalation of the dissolution activity of the system. This could result in unstable pH of the solution after 7 days and steeply displaced to more alkaline values at 14 days.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Coverage of Fe and Si-rich IMPs, protection of the bulk, and tentative mechanism of inhibition</title><p id="Par60">Surface and electrochemical analysis results have postulated that in the inhibited sample, the protective film/layer over Fe and Si-rich IMPs supposedly prevented Al and Mg dealloying from these IMPs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c). It has been postulated that localized corrosion is usually initiated by a dealloying attack on IMPs but stabilizes (continuous corrosion) through nano galvanic interactions between regions rich in nobler metals and the IMPs. This phenomenon gradually promotes localized solution chemistry, diminishing the protective layer covering the nearby alloy matrix, leading to selective dissolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>].</p><p id="Par61">Adsorption of an organic inhibitor film could limit the activity of cathodically active nobler IMPs and restrain the anodic dissolution of active metals like Al and Mg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>]. Kharitonov et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] have investigated inorganic Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub> (sodium orthovanadate) in saline solution on AA6063-T5 for 24 h. They have and postulated corrosion inhibition mechanism by rapid film formation over the local cathodic sites created by Mg-rich intermetallic that suppressed the dissolution of Mg and protected the bulk from pitting corrosion. The inhibition process started with the reduction reaction of NaVO<sub>3</sub> on the AA6063 surface. This reduction reaction helped form protective films of insoluble oxides and hydroxides over cathodic IMPs and slowed down anodic dissolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>]. Similar but limited, studies for AAxxx alloys with organic inhibitors are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Uncorroded Si-rich IMPs in the subsurface region of AA6061 were identified beneath the protective inhibitor layer (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b and d). The Fe and Si-containing IMPs concealed by the protective layer exhibit no significant indication of trenching, confirmed by the absence of selective dissolution of Al or Mg. The presence of weak Cl or O signals near the thick inhibitor layer further confirms that bulk Al was unaffected from anodic dissolution and cathodic reduction of O or Cl. The continuity of the inhibitor layer remains unchanged up to 7 days, with the identical chemical composition observed at 1 day. However, the inhibitor layer's continuity was reduced at 14 days, which confirms the time-dependent degradation of protectiveness of 2-MBI and supports the findings of electrochemical data.</p><p id="Par62">The thickness of the protective layer over AA6061 is much thicker (~ 3.3 nm from XPS etching) than the monolayer thickness of 2-MBI molecules and the thickness of the naturally occurring oxide layer of aluminum alloys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. In addition, the layer is comprised of atom species from 2-MBI inhibitor with traces of O. Therefore; this layer could be a complex of physically absorbed 2-MBI molecules or a complex layer formed through the interaction of inhibitor molecules with available surface oxygenated species. Moreover, instead of a mono layer, multiple layers of a complex inhibitor system have formed. The EDS results are consistent with the findings of EIS results regarding the presence of a thick protective/barrier layer that has delayed the ionic diffusion process and protected IMPs from corrosion attack [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In the latest study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>], 2-MBI film formed over Cu surface has been investigated by density functional theory, and in-situ surface characterization was employed to strengthen the findings of molecular-level modeling. It has been proposed that 2-MBI could interact with oxide-covered Cu surface by S in the form of thione or thiolate, whereas N could interact in the form of pyrrole and pyridine. A multilayer film structure has been proposed where the first layer is chemically absorbed, followed by multiple layers of the Cu-MBI complex. Our results are slightly aligned with these findings as the XPS has revealed oxide and metal peaks of Al in the inhibitor-induced layer. The chemical shifts of the S and N environment from outermost to innermost layer also presumably corroborates the existence of the Al-2MBI complex in the coating-solution interface, which gets thicker and porous with time.</p><p id="Par63">The changes of N 1 s and S 2p XPS spectra for the inhibited AA6061 confirms the chemisorption of 2-MBI molecules in the innermost layer. It could be rational to predict that N and S atoms have participated in the attachment of 2-MBI to the substrate surface. Based on previous articles, the tentative mechanism revealed from the XPS etching results could be expected. It was reported that S could be firmly adsorbed to the substrate surface (S-Al) and masked the bulk from corrosion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. It has been reported that 2-MBI in thione form could be adsorbed on Au surface in a solution having pH &gt; 2 with an upward geometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, the molecular orientation is beyond the scope of the current study as angle-resolved XPS has not been performed. Moreover, this arrangement is improbable for this study as N atoms (one or both) could be attached with AA6061 substrate. On the contrary, C atoms from the benzene ring were not observed to participate in the molecular attachment of 2-MBI with AA6061. Gas cluster ion beam sputtering associated with XPS measurements indicated two different 2-MBI molecules bonding in the surface layer, i.e. the topmost position contains 2-MBI molecules, <italic>i.e</italic>. physically absorbed ones. Later, the organometallic complexes have been thought to be formed via S and N interactions with Al.</p><p id="Par64">The chemical interaction of an inhibitor molecule with a heterogeneous alloy surface and its durability in a corrosive electrolyte were the focus of this study, according to the thematic illustration of Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Results have suggested that 2-MBI primarily interacted with AA6061 with S and N atoms in two different bonding environments to form a multilayer film, varying structurally from coating-solution interface to metal-coating interface. 2-MBI could simultaneously interact with metal or oxide layer and adsorb over AA6061 to enhance the protectiveness of the alloy surface up to 1 day against ionic diffusion, water adsorption, etc. The existence of this layer has masked the activity of IMPs to form localized corrosion cells and retarded the anodic dissolution of bulk Al. Adsorption of 2-MBI has resulted in higher polarization resistance.

The moderate rise in pH values indicates a possibility of a higher oxygen reduction rate at longer exposure times which may result in the quick breakdown of the oxide layer or any protective layer. However, the exact reasonings of time-dependent degradation of the 2-MBI film are worth deeper in-situ experimental investigations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par66">This study elucidates the role of 2-MBI molecules in forming a protective layer over AA6061, identifying barrier properties of 2-MBI against electrolyte diffusion and the durability of inhibition over an exposure period of 14 days. EIS and LPR results indicated the emergence of a complex protective layer in the presence of the inhibitor, confirmed by the broad phase angle maxima at the middle-frequency range. This protective film/layer was stable up to 1 day, which became defective with a gradual drop in <italic>R</italic><sub>charge-transfer</sub> and <italic>R</italic><sub>pore</sub> values. A gradual reduction in inhibition efficiency from 64.7 to 21.0% after 14 days further confirms the ingress of electrolyte through the complex inhibitor layer. FIB-SEM and high-resolution TEM unveil the formation of a complex and multilayered structure of the protective film that consists of species associated with the inhibitor, <italic>i.e</italic>. S, N, and C, in addition to surface oxygen. It has covered the nobler IMPs (Fe &amp; Si) and reduced the propensity of anodic dissolution of bulk Al. XPS etching results confirm the changes in bonding states of S to attach with Al and N have also been found in two different chemical environments. XPS results indicate the chemical and subsequent physical adsorption of 2-MBI molecules over AA6061, where the first interaction thought to be occurred by S and N from 2-MBI molecules. The latter could be a complex of Al-2MBI, or only the physically absorbed 2-MBI molecules coexisted with surface oxides. In summary, 2-MBI molecules formed a complex layer of ~ 3 nm over AA6061 substrate with the available surface oxygenated species that successfully protected the bulk from corrosion attack up to 1 d, beyond which this layer becomes more defective and less protective, over time due to diffusion of aggressive ions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful
