However, a quantitative and rigorous evaluation of the environmental impacts of the results obtained by different design strategies used to implementing CE is missing in the literature. Those available only evaluate certain aspects of the life cycle of few products, belonging to specific application fields, in a qualitative way or they refer only to the global warming potential. This study provides a quantitative assessment of the environmental impacts reductions arising from the application of some common design strategies for implementing different CE options (e.g. reuse, waste to energy, remanufacturing), by using some standard indicators. The results were obtained by manually analysing 156 selected case studies of comparative life cycle assessment (LCA), extracted from 136 scientific articles. In them, the environmental impacts of design solutions for CE are compared with those of other solutions were wastes are not exploited. The obtained results have been used to evaluate the different design strategies for CE and to hierarchize them based on environmental sustainability of the solutions associated with them. In addition, an economic evaluation of the strategies, based on the life cycle costing methodology and exploiting the data available in the same articles, was also provided. Among the main achievements, it was found that the hierarchy of the CE options, pursued by the design strategies, to improve environmental sustainability is different from that provided by other studies. In addition, the environmental benefits associated with the different CE options strictly depend by the applied design strategies and the considered products.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"

fundamental requirement to be achieved during product design. As a result, the evaluation of the design solutions is significantly changing too in this direction and new aspects are considered. Products should be more robust to increase the operative life and reduce maintenance interventions (e.g. Van den Berg &amp; Bakker, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">2015</xref>). The same components must be more durable to be reused in new product after the disposal (e.g. Marino &amp; Marrone, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2020</xref>). Any intervention on the product, during maintenance and disassembly, must be carried out by reducing the required energy and auxiliary materials. For this reason, the products should also be designed for the disposals as well as to guarantee the functioning (e.g. Rios et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2015</xref>). During the design, every aspect of the life cycle of a product must be seen as an opportunity, looking for its value. Consequently, an unusable product must be recycled as much as possible and energy must be obtained from the disposal of non-recyclable parts, by creating new synergies with the supply chain of the same and other products (e.g. Habagil et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2020</xref>; Yuan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">In the literature, some authors identified and classified strategies, methods and tools supporting product design to favour the transition to CE. These works highlighted the numerosity and the heterogeneity of the many supporting approaches and the criteria to be consider for selecting the most suitable ones (e.g. Bocken et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>; Mestre &amp; Cooper, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2017</xref>). Among them, there are the type of waste to be recovered, the type of product that generates or becomes the waste and the CE option to implement (e.g. reuse, recycle, remanufacturing). The pros and cons of different design approaches, emerged from these studies, also highlighted that an eco-design method cannot be considered better than a generic design method in absolute terms, and vice versa, in proposing solutions for CE—this despite the fact that the implementation of the CE requires to solve many of the problems that eco-design methods typically face (Den Hollander et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">Thus, these studies, through environmental assessment, showed that merit of the higher sustainability of CE options depends by the application of the supporting design strategies. In fact, some preferential hierarchies between the different CE options regarding sustainability were provided (e.g. Behrens et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2007</xref>), but the application of different design strategies could make a CE option more sustainable than others, by reversing the hierarchy (Bocken et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>). For this reason, the evaluation of the environmental benefits that the application of the different design strategies for CE can guarantee is therefore fundamental for eco-design and for implementing the same CE.</p><p id="Par6">However, the studies supporting this assessment (see “<xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">State of the art</xref>”) have some limitations. The number of design strategies compared in each study is generally reduced. The considered scenarios and boundary conditions are too different, by making it difficult the normalization of the results. Because of the reduced number of considered case studies and their homogeneity, the design strategies are difficult to be evaluated in a domain-independent manner. The analyses have not always been carried out by rigorously following the reference standards. In many cases, the provided assessment is subjective and, consequently, they are difficult to compare. Finally, the impacts are usually expressed only through the carbon footprint.</p><p id="Par7">This study proposes an evaluation of the environmental benefits arising from different products as a result of the application of different design strategies to support CE, which have been carefully selected in the literature. This assessment was conducted on 156 case studies from scientific articles based on life cycle assessment (LCA) according to ISO 14040 (ISO, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2006a</xref>) and ISO 14044 (ISO, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2006b</xref>). LCA methodology was considered due to its reliability in quantitatively evaluating the sustainability of the current technologies, critically discussing the choices to implement during eco-design and evaluating the environmental performances of new developed technologies (Hauschild et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">The research questions to which this study aims to answer are the following:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par9"><bold>RQ. 1:</bold><italic>Is there a preferred hierarchy among the different CE options in terms of environmental sustainability, or does the hierarchy depend on the application of the different design strategies?</italic></p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par10"><bold>RQ. 2:</bold><italic>Can indications about how to apply the design strategies to obtain the greatest environmental benefits according to the addressed problem be isolated?</italic></p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par11">The novelty and the importance of this studies lie in the method used to answer these questions. Compared to other studies in the literature, the evaluation of the design strategies, provided in this study, is less influenced by the specific features of the application fields. This is because more case studies, referring to a greater number of application fields, and with greater heterogeneity, were analysed. In addition, to reduce the influence of the design approach, followed to implement a CE option, alternative design strategies to achieve some of them were compared. The provided environmental assessment was improved, compared to the previous contributions from the literature, by expressing the environmental impacts through different standard categories and considering the entire life cycle of the analysed products.</p><p id="Par12">These aspects allow to provide reliable and rigorous answers to the research questions and to confirm some considerations previously formulated by other studies in the literature. One of them is the official “waste hierarchy”, supported by studies (e.g. Zunft &amp; Fröhlig, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">2009</xref>) and reference bodies (e.g. European Union Council Directive 2008/09/EC). According to it, the CE options “reduce waste”, “reuse”, “remanufacturing”, “recycle” and “waste to energy” can be ordered on the basis of the environmental sustainability regardless of the application field. On the contrary, the obtained results could confirm if the same hierarchy is instead dependent on this latter and on the followed design strategies (e.g. Behrens et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2007</xref>). In addition, extended quantitative results about design strategies for CE can provide the knowledge base required by those studies that drawn the plan to teach CE (e.g. Saidani et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>State of the art</title><p id="Par13">Several studies about the assessment of environmental sustainability achievable in a product through the application of design strategies for CE can be retrieved in the literature. By analysing those collected through the keywords “eco-assessment”, “product design”, “circular economy” and synonyms in Google Scholar and SCOPUS, the following differences emerge.</p><p id="Par14">Some studies consider only the design strategies explicitly referred to CE. The most diffused ones suggest how to design a product to reduce waste, improve disassembly and recycle. Such strategies generally derive from generic design strategies (e.g. Cayzer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2017</xref>) or from eco-design methods (e.g. Smol et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">2017</xref>). Other studies (e.g. Boavida et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2020</xref>) analyse the effectiveness of design strategies, e.g. TRIZ, in the context of environmental sustainability but without referring to CE, although their insights can be used to implement it. Furthermore, depending on the case, the considered design strategies may refer to routine design (e.g. Garcia-Muiña et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2019</xref>), suggesting structural optimization and material replacement, or innovative design (e.g. Ozkeser, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2018</xref>), suggesting disruptive modalities to modify the product.</p><p id="Par15">The design strategies were applied in different ways in these studies. In some cases, only a single one, while in other cases, at least a design strategy is considered for each CE option (e.g. Lieder et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2017</xref>). The main limitation of both these approaches is the comparison between the different design strategies. In contrast, the studies comparing multiple design strategies for each CE option do not have this limitation (e.g. Cayzer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par16">The number of case studies considered during the evaluations varies in the different contributions from the literature. Many papers provide a single case study about a specific application field (e.g. Moussa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2019</xref>; Santagata et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">2020</xref>); others consider more case studies but generally no more than ten, except for Spreafico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">2021</xref>). The most difficult studies to compare are the ones they propose a single case study and a single design strategy (e.g. Liu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par17">The evaluation of the environmental benefits guaranteed on the product by the application of the design strategies can be carried out following a rigorous method, such as the LCA, by following its related standards (e.g. Garcia-Muiña et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2019</xref>), or other qualitative approaches of evaluation (e.g. Feniser et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par18">Not always, the provided environmental impacts are expressed through standard categories. In the case, CO<sub>2</sub> eq. (e.g. Smol et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">2017</xref>) is the most common, although the use of this single indicator has been considered a limitation in quantifying the actual benefits of CE (Bocken et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>). Non-standard categories are instead the reduction of the mass of the product and the produced waste (e.g. Boavida et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2020</xref>), the reduction of energy consumption (Ozkeser, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2018</xref>) and the reduction of the polluting emissions (Bersano et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par19">Finally, regardless of the considered approach and environmental impact indicators, the provided assessment can be quantitative or qualitative. For instance, Cayzer et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2017</xref>) interviewed several managers of companies that had triggered a successful transition to CE by applying design strategies and provided their qualitative assessments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Tested design strategies for circular economy</title><p id="Par20">With the aim of providing a broad overview of the many design strategies that can be used to implement the CE, in this study, a selection of those most discussed in the literature, for each CE option, was analysed. The considered CE options are reducing waste, using renewable energies, reuse, remanufacturing, recycling, product waste energy recovery, disposal, transforming waste into energy. In the following, a brief description of each strategy is proposed, along with the presentation of some sub-strategies with which these strategies can be declined. The starting point for retrieving the considered strategies was the work of Den Hollander et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2017</xref>). In that study, the authors collected generic design strategies and showed how their application can change in linear economy and in CE contexts, while the order of presentation of the design strategies is consistent with the hierarchy of EC directive 2008/09/EC (Zunft &amp; Fröhlig, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">2009</xref>) concerning the environmental sustainability of the different CE options (in descending order) to which the design strategies refer.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design for reducing wastes</title><p id="Par21">Design for reducing wastes aims to ensure that the wastes generated from the product (i.e. exhaust components and auxiliary materials/consumables) during use and end of life are limited (Keys et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2000</xref>). In the literature, this strategy has been declined in different ways, which have also been considered in this study. Structural optimization (e.g. Russo &amp; Rizzi, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">2014</xref>) is used to reduce product mass through structural rearrangement, (acting on the shape) or microstructural rearrangement (acting on the internal organization) of the structure. Fluid dynamic optimization (Cheshmehzangi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2017</xref>) is used to reduce the mass of a fluid by modifying its local or global fluid dynamic conditions (e.g., pressure, temperature, flow rate, turbulence, spatial distribution) while ensuring its functions (e.g., heat transfer, thrust). Finally, dematerialization is a more innovative way to solve the problem and it is also counted among the principles of TRIZ (Russian acronym for Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) (Altshuller, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1984</xref>), one of the best known methods to support technical problem-solving. Its objective is to eliminate the components of a product, delegating their functionality to other ones or to the external environment, or to replace them with a field. Two typical examples are self-cleaning glasses, exploiting catalytic elements activated by sunlight to avoid detergents and laser cutting to replace a sawcut.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Design for using renewable energies</title><p id="Par22">The goal of this strategy is to improve the product functioning by introducing dedicated technologies able to exploit renewable energy, by reducing the consumptions (e.g., Nakata et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2005</xref>). The prerequisites of this activity are the research of the renewable energy source and the definition of its compatibility with product functioning rhythms, e.g. the hourly profile in the case of solar energy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Design for reuse</title><p id="Par23">Reuse is the simplest way to satisfy one of the three macro-objectives of the CE, i.e. keeping products and materials in use, by reusing the product and its materials, after the operative life, without transforming them. To put this strategy into practice, however, it may be necessary to intervene appropriately on the product, even redesigning its structure, through “<xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">Design for reuse</xref>” rules and suggestions. This activity within CE has the objective of encouraging the user to reuse the product for the same or other uses, by improving the resistance of the product’s structure (Hooton &amp; Bickley, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2014</xref>). Alternatively, the structure can be improved to be more easily reconverted to possible future users’ needs (Torroja et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">1997</xref>). From the environmental point of view, the product must also be designed to encourage the reuse on site in order to reduce the impacts of the relocation (Friedler, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Design for remanufacturing</title><p id="Par24">The goal of this strategy is to encourage the remanufacturing of a product after the operative life, so that it can be perform its functions again or perform other functions. According to this strategy, the remanufacturing operations are also improved by reducing energy and resource consumption to increase environmental sustainability (Nasr &amp; Thurston, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2006</xref>). At the application level, the same strategy is implemented with the choice of the most appropriate technology to perform remanufacturing and the definition of the use modality (e.g. Haziri &amp; Sundin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Design for recycling</title><p id="Par25">The task of this strategy is to identify materials that can be recycled and use them to realize the product, without affecting its functionality, and facilitating at the same time product recycling, disassembly and other preliminary operations (Kriwet et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">1995</xref>). At a general level, this strategy can be obtained in two different modalities, both evaluated in this study. They depend on the output of the recycling and the involved technologies. In the case of ecosystem restoration, the objective is to regenerate the biological cycles of various ecosystems (e.g. forests, fresh water, inland wetlands) through different processes (e.g. extraction of biochemical feedstock, farming and anaerobic digestion) (De Groot et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2013</xref>), while, in the case of technical recycling, the objective is to regenerate the technical cycles, by reproducing the product constituent materials (EC directive 2008/09/EC), such as in the case of recycled paper and plastic.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Design for energy recovery</title><p id="Par26">This strategy aims to improve the product by reducing the wasted energy through the introduction of devices dedicated to its recovery and reuse within or without the same product (Den Hollander et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2017</xref>). To implement the strategy, the modalities and the technologies to recover energy must be determined and implemented. Some examples are the heat exchangers for the hot fumes and the kinetic energy recovery system (KERS) for the recovery of kinetic energy in vehicles during braking.

In general, the design directions starting from this strategy are the reduction of the quantity of material to be disposed and its replacement with a more easily disposable material.

Both these reductions are primarily due to the use of solar and wind energy in large plants (e.g., Tannous et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">2018</xref>; Yan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">2018</xref>), while, in smaller installations such as hydrogen-powered vehicles (e.g., Lajunen &amp; Lipman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2016</xref>) and biogas production by anaerobic digestion activated by sun (e.g., Wu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">2020</xref>) the impact reductions associated with this strategy were lower. In the analysed case studies, the reason provided about this influence of the scale factor are the higher impacts of the realization of technologies for exploiting renewable energies compared to fossil-fuelled plants.

These values are therefore comparable or greater than Design for Recycling. However, the data extracted from some other case studies lowered the average reductions in all impact categories. The reason is the considerable amount of energy required to transport water to be reused, not present in freshwater systems. In these cases, the average environmental impact reduction is 17%. This conclusion provides quantitative evidences to the more qualitative observations provided by Voulvoulis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Design for remanufacturing</title><p id="Par69">The good results in reducing the environmental impacts in the case studies associated with Design for remanufacturing depend on the type of performed processing. This aspect clearly emerges by classifying the case study two sub-classes about conventional remanufacturing (14 case studies) and innovative remanufacturing (8 case studies), as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. Conventional remanufacturing mainly involves processes carried out with traditional machine tools for chip removal (e.g. Zhang &amp; Chen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">2015</xref>). While innovative remanufacturing is based on laser processing (e.g. Leino et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2016</xref>) or on additive manufacturing (e.g. Wilson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">2014</xref>) to allow more focused repairs by reducing filler material and energy consumption.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Percentage reductions of each environmental impact category associated with the two sub-strategies of Design for remanufacturing</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10661_2022_9803_Fig4_HTML.png" id="MO5"/></fig></p><p id="Par70">Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> clearly shows the advantages of innovative remanufacturing over conventional remanufacturing in reducing environmental impacts, especially of AP, EP and PMF. On the other hand, the impact reduction of WC (−34%) was against the trend and contributed to reduce the margin of advantage of the average impact (5%). At the application level, the two ways of proceeding clearly influence the Design for remanufacturing, by providing different solutions depending on the two cases, in all five phases of this discipline, i.e. design for reverse channel, design for environment, design for dismantling, design for lifecycle extension, design for improvement and design for appraisal (Charter &amp; Gray, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2008</xref>). The results obtained with this classification provide quantitative evidence to the same theoretical comparison, previously discussed in Singhal et al.

The main advantages of the first sub-strategy, compared to the second, were found above all regarding AP (+ 50%), RD (+ 21%) and PMF (+ 8%). From the analysis of the case studies emerged the role of the recycling process. Both the sub-strategies are convenient for environmental sustainability, avoiding the introduction of virgin materials, but the technical recycling processes are generally more impactful than the others. This is because, in the second case, a more radical transformation of the waste, and also more energy-intensive, is required (e.g. de Souza Junior et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2020</xref>; Pintilie et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2016</xref>). However, this result is partial, because some authors in the literature (e.g. Convertino et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2013</xref>) highlighted other parameter to consider (e.g. local species richness, river basin extension, hydroperiod). Therefore, the provided assessment is starting point to be integrated with a more comprehensive analysis, even if still lacking in the literature.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Design for energy recovery</title><p id="Par73">To discuss the results that have been associated with Design for energy recovery in this study, a further subdivision between systems that propose pure energy recovery (6 case studies) (e.g. Feng et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2014</xref>) from those that also introduce phase transition (13 case studies) (e.g. Cánovas et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2013</xref>) was provided (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Percentage reductions of each environmental impact category associated with the two sub-strategies of Design for energy recovery</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10661_2022_9803_Fig6_HTML.png" id="MO7"/></fig></p><p id="Par74">Through the classification, both the sub-strategies were found to be beneficial for all the environmental impact categories (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In addition, the phase transition in energy recovery was better for GWP, EP and RD. This result is useful for extending the advantages of this sub-strategy in environmental sustainability, previously provided by Spreafico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">2021</xref>) also to implement CE. Liu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2019</xref>), Boavida et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2020</xref>) and Vinodh et al.

However, in all these studies, the proposed evaluation is too aggregated, since different inventive principles are considered altogether and the considered case studies are few and too specific.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Design for disposal</title><p id="Par75">To adequately discuss the results obtained for the Design of disposal, the case studies referring to this strategy were further divided into its two sub-strategies, i.e. using natural materials (14 case studies) (e.g. Liu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2019</xref>) and using natural-based materials (8 case studies) (e.g. Razza et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">2015</xref>). The reductions in environmental impacts associated with these two sub-strategies were determined and reported in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Percentage reductions of each environmental impact category associated with the two sub-strategies of Design for disposal</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10661_2022_9803_Fig7_HTML.png" id="MO8"/></fig></p><p id="Par76">The distinction between the sub-strategies proved to be useful for better understanding the relationships between Design for disposal and the resulting reduction in environmental impacts (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). The greatest environmental advantages associated with this strategy were obtained in the case studies where natural materials have been introduced. They proved to be more sustainable than natural-based materials in reducing the average impact (+ 31%) and in almost all impact categories, except GWP (−5%), EP (−13%) and RD (−2%). In addition, the negative result obtained by natural-based material in WC (−54%) was also highlighted.</p><p id="Par77">These results therefore confirm on a quantitative level some observations that have been made in the literature about the sustainability of the disposal of natural-based materials and to the tendency to prefer materials as natural as possible during this phase, although these observations are based on restricted application fields. For example, Hottle et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2013</xref>), with a review of LCA studies on bio-polymers, show that such materials are sustainable during production, while during disposal have some impacts similar to synthetic polymers. The conclusion is therefore to prefer biodegradable materials. This trend is recently being sought in food packaging, both for the realization of the packaging with natural materials such as chitosan, and with the increasing use of vegetable oils and acids as bactericides (Spreafico &amp; Russo, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">2021</xref>). Another field of application is in the construction of asphalts for road repair, where the use of unprocessed natural materials such as gravel and rocks in larger portions and the limitation of natural-based materials to targeted infill during maintenance are preferred (Landi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Design for recovering energy from waste</title><p id="Par78">The results associated with this strategy confirmed the advantages of the implementation of CE and the research about the supporting design strategies. The analysis of the considered case studies also showed that the result does not change much when discriminating between different types of waste treatment. Pyrolysis (e.g., Vocciante et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">2019</xref>) environmentally performed better than traditional incineration (e.g., Hossain &amp; Poon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2018</xref>), although the latter is significantly more widespread worldwide (Spreafico et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">2021</xref>).

Considering the average of all impact categories, Design for remanufacturing produced the best options with impact reductions by 53%, followed by Design for recycling (45%), while Design for recovering energy from waste was the worst option, increasing the impacts by 83%. Considering instead the different impact categories, a certain variability emerged, as well as between the results of the different case studies and those within the Design strategies (with standard deviations between 21 and 81%). Finally, the economic sustainability of the solutions arising from the Design strategies for CE is also considered, although considering a smaller number of case studies.</p><p id="Par87">Nevertheless, by deeply analysing the considered case studies, some motivations for the advantages and disadvantages for environmental sustainability of the different Design strategies for CE were also identified.
