Because of their adjustable optoelectronic properties they can be applied in e.g. field-effect transistors, sensors, light-emitting diodes or photovoltaic cells. In order to develop high-performance systems, it is important to understand the relationship between the structure and the photophysical properties of the material used. One of the employed strategies is to decrease the band gap of conjugated compounds, often achieved through a “donor–acceptor” approach. One of the popular groups applied as an electron-accepting unit are benzothiadiazoles, while diphenylamine exhibits good electron-donating ability. The functional groups can affect the energy levels of materials, influencing the color of the light emitted. This work presents a review of research focused on the structure-properties relationship of diphenylamine and benzothiadiazole derivatives with optoelectronic applications.</p></abstract><kwd-group

as field effect transistors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], photovoltaic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr"

ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and others. Understanding the relationship between the structure and optoelectronic properties of organic semiconductors is essential when designing the architecture of the above-mentioned devices in order to achieve their optimal parameters, including high efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The most advantageous solution in optoelectronics design strategies is a "donor–acceptor" (D-A) or "push–pull" structural motif in organic semiconductors, due to the ability to control the band gap width [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. So far, various groups of donors, acceptors, and π bridges have been combined in the research, e.g. diphenylamine (DPA), carbazole, and benzothiadiazole (BTD) groups, which serve as D-A electron pairs, and benzene and thiophene rings act as π bridges. Benzothiadiazoles are a popular electron-accepting unit in D-A copolymers, especially with non-functionalized or functionalized oligothiophene units, that also exhibit electrochromic and electrofluorochromic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole derivatives are promising candidates for efficient solid-state emitters due to their strong electron-withdrawing effect, highly polarized properties, and easy crystallinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. On the other hand, diphenylamine groups, due to the lone pair of electrons in nitrogen, have a high electron donation ability, thanks to which these derivatives are widely used in optoelectronics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. DPA as an electron donor increases the HOMO energy, while the use of an electron acceptor unit (e.g. BTD) can lead to a decrease in both HOMO/LUMO (HOMO-Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital; LUMO-Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital). For this reason, with the help of individual units in the structure of the entire semiconductor system, we can manipulate the ground state energy level in materials and thus influence the color of the emitted light and the mobility of electrons/holes.</p><p id="Par3">Organic chemistry deals with the synthesis of polymers used in widely understood consumer electronics. The electronics market is growing steadily, and its most promising area is OLEDs (organic light-emitting diodes). Their commercialization is displacing standard displays and they are considered excellent candidates for new lighting technology. The structural core of such diodes is the emission layer. It determines the color that will be emitted and the light flux. In addition, the electrode contains a transparent anode and a metal cathode, a hole injection layer, a hole transport layer, an electron transport layer, and an electron injection layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The disadvantage of OLEDs is the low external quantum efficiency of 20–25% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], so reducing the amount of light trapped inside the device is a task for future years of optoelectronics research.</p><p id="Par4">This review provides an overview of the diphenylamine and benzothiadiazole derivatives that have been reported over the past decade and focuses primarily on the dependence of the physicochemical properties on the structure of the above-mentioned systems.

Previous reports confirm many properties of DPA derivatives that account for their use in optoelectronics. Diphenylamine is a rigidly structured compound, which increases its solubility in organic solvents. It is also thermally stable. DPA, as an electron donor unit, is combined in many experiments with various electron acceptors, thanks to which the resulting structures show fluorescence and non-linear optical properties. Electron transport in chemistry is extremely important, so DPA is an ideal candidate for the synthesis of optoelectronic materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Structure of diphenylamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10965_2022_3266_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Structure modifications in the design strategy of conjugated polymer materials</title><p id="Par6">The design strategy of conjugated polymer materials with a narrow band gap should focus on an appropriate molecular energy level of the compounds, an effective π-conjugated system, a good coplanar backbone structure, good solubility, etc.</p><p id="Par7">Obtaining a low-energy gap is a challenge during the synthesis of DPA derivatives.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] managed to develop polymer dots based on benzothiadiazole with high efficiency for solar cells. Two polymers: poly[N-9"-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4',7'-di-2-thienyl-2',1',3'-benzothiadiazole) (<italic>PCDTBT</italic>) and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]-phenylC<sub>71</sub> butyric acid methyl-ester (<italic>PC</italic><sub><italic>71</italic></sub><italic>BM</italic>) were doped with another pair of polymers: poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene)-co-(4,7-di-2-thienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole) (<italic>PF-5DTBT</italic>) and poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride) (<italic>PSMA</italic>) as the active layer of organic solar cells. Molecular structures of the polymers are represented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">15</xref>. Thanks to polymer dots, it was possible to increase power conversion efficiency by 29%. High efficiency is achieved by increasing the short-circuit current and the fill factor.<fig id="Fig15"><label>Fig. 15</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Molecular structure of PCDTBT, PC<sub>71</sub>BM, PSMA, and PF-5DTBT polymers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10965_2022_3266_Fig15_HTML.png" id="MO17"/></fig></p><p id="Par48">The chemical synthesis of PF-5DTBR was based on the 2004 work of Hou et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Two polymers were prepared with THF and reacted under the action of ultrasound in deionized water for 5 min. After removing THF with nitrogen gas, mixtures were concentrated under heating and filtered to remove large particles. Dots were added to the PCDTBT:PC71BM solution and a special device was made. The device consisted of several layers: nanocrystals of Indium Tin Oxide, titanium oxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>), an active layer (PCDTBT and PC<sub>71</sub>BM in a solution of dichlorobenzene with dots of different sizes), molybdenum oxide (MoO<sub>3</sub>), and silver. The average size of the dots on the active layer was 5 nm. This device, along with the same one but without the dots, was further investigated for photovoltaic properties.</p><p id="Par49">In the course of experiments and based on other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], it was observed that the addition of polymer dots can increase the short-circuit current. The results of the photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra showed that the maximum value of a standard device is about 65% at 490 nm, while the manufactured one is 15% higher at 500 nm, which means more efficient use of photons. Also, after conducting reflection studies, it turned out that the addition of dots reduced the reflectivity, which favorably affected the absorption of photons by the active layer. To better understand the influence of dots, the researchers traced the dependence of photocurrent density (J<sub>ph</sub>) on effective voltage (V<sub>eff</sub>). After receiving the results, it was found that J<sub>ph</sub> increases faster for devices with dots on the active layer at low V<sub>eff</sub>. This proves the effect of changes on charge generation by increasing the efficiency of solar cells. Thus, the researchers increased the low power conversion efficiency from 5.73% to 7.40% and believe that their work will contribute to the development of OSCs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Carbazole-benzothiadiazole based polymer</title><p id="Par50">Continuing to develop the OSCs industry, Franco [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] decided to find the effect of the length of different alkyl side chains on the optoelectronic properties of the polymer.

Firstly, it was important to investigate the influence of dihedral angles and bond-length alternation (BLA), because their changes can affect optoelectronic properties. Using computer calculations, it was found that all alkyl side chains are far from the benzothiadiazole and thiophene rings, regardless of the length of the alkyl chain, which proves that the dihedral angles do not depend on the length of the alkyl side chain. The values of BLA for all variants of side chains were confirmed by calculating the binding energies of the alkyl-carbazole unit with neighboring thiophene units. Calculations have shown that their binding energies are constant and range from 5.35 to 5.37 eV. Structural studies have shown that there are no particular differences in the main chain when the side chain changes. When studying optoelectronic properties, such parameters as E<sub>HOMO</sub>, E<sub>LUMO,</sub> and E<sub>gap</sub> were considered. The calculated energies turned out to be the same as in the work of Wu et al. with another similar polymer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].</p><p id="Par52">The results of the theoretical study suggest that the use of shorter alkyl side chains does not particularly affect the structural and optoelectronic properties of the carbazole-benzothiadiazole polymer.

UV–vis measurements have shown that both copolymers exhibit strong and wide absorption in the range of 300 nm to 900 nm. The results also showed that PBTBD2 has a smaller band gap than PBTBD1, which is a useful property for increasing the short-circuit current in polymer solar cells. Compared with simple benzothiadiazole derivatives, the bandgaps of copolymers are smaller, indicating that increased absorption in the entire visible wavelength region was achieved due to the side chains of diphenylamine-vinylene, implying that such an improvement is effective.</p><p id="Par67">Experiments on the electrochemical properties of substances were also carried out. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were measured by cyclic voltammetry experiments and further confirmed using theoretical methods (DFT at the B3LYP/6-31G*level).

For this purpose, individual groups are most often mentioned in the push–pull or donor-link-acceptor systems and the changes in the optoelectronic properties of the entire system are checked. Numerous research centers conduct a series of syntheses, often preceded by quantum-chemical calculations, to obtain heterocyclic structures with appropriate parameters. An example is a group change in bithiophene-substituted compounds (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>; BT-1, BT-2, and BT-3), which show higher absorption, the lowest HOMO–LUMO energy gap, and higher λ<sub>max</sub> compared to other π-acceptors (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The reason for such results is that bi-thiophene abolishes the maximum contribution to LUMO and additionally maintains the balance between planarity and π delocalization. It allocates 83% of its LUMO to π-delocalization and outperforms other π-acceptor units in this regard.</p><p id="Par71">Moreover, the compounds studied whose biphenyl group was replaced by a bi-pyrrole group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) exhibited a wide bandgap, a desirable feature for supercapacitor electrode applications, and were classified as promising compounds in this area.</p><p id="Par72">Also important for optoelectronic studies is the type of bond present in the molecule, e.g. cyano-vinylene bonds in compounds DPA-PA 1–3 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), which increased the flexibility of energy levels and improved the optoelectronic properties. As the system was strongly conjugated, it exhibited a high degree of polarity in the ground state. Also, the electron distribution in the HOMO orbital is uniform, which translates to a uniform distribution of hole density in both the excited molecule and the charge-separated hole carrier. The energy of this orbital is high (-5.08 eV) due to the presence of methoxy groups.</p><p id="Par73">Furthermore, it is confirmed that for the fluorescence to be as high as possible and the electrochemical bandgap to be as small as possible, DPA must be coupled to a good electron acceptor. The use of DPA as an electroactive unit along with TPE afforded a polymer with a high fluorescence contrast. DPA, as an electrodonor group, acted as a strong fluorochrome and greatly improved the fluorescence of the diphenylamine TPE.</p><p id="Par74">Another important parameter, e.g. in the design of biosensors, is to obtain a compound showing high thermal stability. An example could be the diphenylamine derivative, polydiphenylamine (PDPA) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>a). PDPA has a high sensitivity to many bioanalytes, which is an advantage in the design of biological sensors used in medicine and industry.</p><p id="Par75">An interesting example of the dependence of optoelectronic properties on the structure is that of flexible benzothiadiazole derivatives. In the crystalline state, DBBT shows its elasticity, even though organic crystals are usually inflexible, and flexible polymers are not crystalline. The balance between elasticity and crystalline state is a big problem in organic materials. The study of flexible crystals with optical abilities can change the view of electronic devices and solve this problem. The results showed that the dense packing of the material should improve charge extraction and mobility in photovoltaic devices, therefore, the use of polymers with shorter chains like in PP<sub>EH</sub>-DTBT and PP<sub>EH</sub>-DTffBT is recommended.</p><p id="Par76">Moreover, in subsequent research, it was noticed that the addition of dots can favorably affect the increase in the short-circuit current density. The addition of dots reduced the reflectivity, which favorably affected the absorption of photons by the active layer.</p><p id="Par77">Structurally well-defined DPA and benzothiadiazole derivatives display a wide range of interesting physical properties, including good charge transport, electroluminescence, and improved thermal and morphological stabilities. DPA, as an electrodonor group acting as a strong fluorochrome, and benzothiadiazole, as an efficient solid-state emitter, are promising materials for different optoelectronic devices. The full potential of the materials will certainly be studied in future years.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>Conceptualization: Dorota
