Firstly, opaque PSCs up to 19.7% were fabricated. Then, the rear metal contact was replaced by a highly transparent and conductive indium tin oxide (ITO) film, directly sputtered onto the hole selective layer, without any protective layer between Spiro-OMeTAD and rear ITO. To the best of our knowledge, this corresponds to the most efficient buffer layer-free semitransparent PSC ever reported. Using time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) technique on both sides of the semitransparent PSC, Spiro-OMeTAD/perovskite and perovskite/TiO<sub>2</sub> interfaces were compared, confirming the great quality of Spiro-OMeTAD/perovskite interface, even after damage-less ITO sputtering, where degradation phenomena result less important than for perovskite/TiO<sub>2</sub> one. Finally, a 4-terminal tandem was built combining semitransparent PSC with a commercially-available Aluminium Back Surface Field (Al-BSF) silicon wafer. That silicon wafer presents PCE = 19.52% (18.53% after being reduced to cell size), and 5.75% once filtered, to generate an overall 4 T tandem efficiency of 21.18% in combination with our champion large semitransparent PSC of 15.43%. It means an absolute increase of 1.66% over the original silicon wafer efficiency and a 2.65% over the cut Si cell.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Perovskite Solar Cells (PSC)</kwd><kwd>Time-resolved Photoluminescence (TRPL)</kwd><kwd>Tandem Device</kwd><kwd>Perovskite Absorber</kwd><kwd>TiO2 Side</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Programme d&amp;apos;Investissement d&amp;apos;Avenir - ANR-IEED-002-01 IPVF, Ile-de-France Photovoltaic Institute (IPVF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2018</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2018</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2018</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>10</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>19</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2018_Article_34432.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">In the last five years, hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSC) have emerged as one of the most promising photovoltaic (PV) technologies. This remarkable development is principally related to the high absorption coefficient and carrier diffusion lengths larger than the film thickness needed to absorb the solar spectrum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. With a careful growth of perovskite film, structural and optoelectronic properties have been successfully controlled, permitting to obtain power conversion efficiencies (PCE) over 22% at lab scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Moreover, these materials showed an easily tunable bandgap by modifying its composition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. This property, together with a remarkably low sub-bandgap absorption make perovskite materials interesting candidates for top cell absorbers in tandem devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Generally speaking, a tandem solar cell is composed by a stack of two or more subcells with bandgaps decreasing from top to bottom device, where the most energetic part of the solar spectrum (short wavelengths) is absorbed by the top cell while larger wavelengths are collected by the bottom one. Recently, PCE up to 26.4% have been achieved by the combination of a perovskite top cell with a crystalline silicon bottom one<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. For the production of a tandem solar cell with two absorbers, two main connection approaches are proposed in the literature: 2-terminal (2 T) and 4-terminal (4 T) geometries, presenting each one their own advantages and weaknesses.</p><p id="Par3">For 2 T geometry, carriers from the top cell have to recombine with those ones with opposite charge coming from the bottom one at the tunnel junction, without creating too high electrical or optical losses. For this purpose, indium tin oxide (ITO) has been the most explored material in literature leading to efficiencies up to 23.6% for perovskite/Si 2 T tandem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Moreover, in the case of 2 T perovskite/Si tandem geometry, a careful current matching between top and bottom cell is essential, since the overall tandem efficiency resulted extremely sensitive to photocurrent fluctuations between top and bottom cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The required 2 T current matching can be achieved for a fixed AM1.5 G spectra either by tuning the perovskite bandgap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> up to an ideal value of ~1.75 eV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> or by reducing the thickness of the perovskite absorber, allowing certain wavelengths (normally between 650–800 nm) to pass through perovskite and being absorbed by the silicon underneath. The former option is reasonably feasible due to tunable bandgap of perovskite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, while the latter one seems to be harder to accomplish since the extremely high absorption coefficient of perovskite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> would force to control the thickness of absorber film with an exceptionally high precision. Anyway, independently from the current-matching approach chosen, it would be optimized for a particular spectrum (normally AM1.5 G at 1 sun intensity) and the global tandem PCE would be significantly reduced when the incidence spectrum was varied due to daytime or seasonal changes.</p><p id="Par4">On the contrary, recent simulation studies have also demonstrated a maximum PCE for a 4 T perovskite/Si tandem cell with a large band gap perovskite absorber <italic>ca</italic>. 1.75 eV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. However, in this case, the decrease of the performance related to spectral changes and current-mismatching resulted poorly important in comparison with 2 T configuration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Moreover, with this tandem architecture, a semitransparent PSC can be mechanically stacked in an easy manner over a silicon solar cell or panel without any change in the production process and being applicable for any type of bottom cell architecture. For example, 4 T Tandem devices have been built with amorphous silicon/crystalline silicon heterojunction (SHJ)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and Interdigitated Back Contact (IBC) silicon solar cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> as bottom cell. However, for 4 T tandem cells, the introduction of a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) as rear electrode in the semitransparent perovskite top cell is required to be wisely optimized in order to minimize parasitic optical losses, mainly in the near infrared region (NIR) due to free-carrier absorption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Here, we report the association of a semitransparent PSC with a silicon bottom one for the assembly of a 4 T tandem device. Silicon material on bottom consisted on a commercially-available Aluminium Back Surface Field (Al-BSF) silicon wafer (PCE = 19.52%), which is the current dominant installed PV technology, conveniently reduced to the desired size by laser cutting (18.53% of PCE after cutting). Regarding the preparation of semitransparent top perovskite cell, the first step was the fabrication of a highly efficient opaque PSC (PCE = 19.7%) to be used as reference, followed by the selection of the most convenient sputtered-ITO properties as a trade-off between transmission and resistivity. For semitransparent PSC fabrication, to prevent any additional fabrication step, ITO layer was directly deposited onto Spiro-OMeTAD by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering without any extra protection layer such as the usually reported molybdenum oxide (MoO<sub>x</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. It is noteworthy that the fabrication of semitransparent PSC without buffer layer between extraction layer and rear TCO has been a topic not sufficiently explored in literature, since damage issues on the substrate linked to the highly energetic nature of sputtering technique are difficult to circumvent. One notable exception was the work reported by Jaysankar <italic>et al</italic>. where ITO was directly sputtered onto Spiro-OMeTAD by direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. However, the efficiencies obtained remained not too high for semitransparent PSC (14.4% for 0.13 cm<sup>2</sup> devices and 12% for 4 cm<sup>2</sup> ones), with a significant reduction of <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>SC</italic></sub> during upscaling. Wahl <italic>et al</italic>., proposed indium zinc oxide (IZO), as semitransparent rear contact deposited onto bathocuproine/[6,6]-Phenyl-C<sub>61</sub>-butyric acid methyl ester (BCP/PCBM) with an inverted semitransparent PSC configuration improving the transmission in the infrared part of the spectra (800–1300 nm) and getting 13.3% also using a DC system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Although the employment of RF magnetron sputtering for the fabrication of buffer layer-free semitransparent PSCs remained unexplored, RF technique has been widely reported in PSCs not only to grow different carrier transport layers such as TiO<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> or SnO<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, but also to prepare a PbS that can be easily transformed into PbI<sub>2</sub> for the fabrication of the perovskite layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Moreover, RF technique showed certain advantages over DC for ITO deposition, since lower resistivities, higher mobilities and larger grain sizes were achieved for oxygen-free ITO sputtering at low temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Furthermore, ITO-sputtered films were demonstrated to enable long-term and thermal stability for perovskites in tandem applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, diminishing a concern that has focused important efforts for the research community<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Hence, by introducing a RF sputtering and controlling the annealing conditions of ITO after deposition, we were able to control with precision ITO properties and to avoid any damage both in Spiro-OMeTAD and in the rest of the PSC, achieving a maximum PCE of 15.7% for small (0.16 cm<sup>2</sup> active area) and 15.43% for larger (0.64 cm<sup>2</sup> active area) semitransparent PSC with good absorption in UV-Vis and transmittance in NIR. Up to our knowledge, these results imply the best performing buffer-free semitransparent PSC ever reported for tandem purposes. By bifacial time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) Spiro-OMeTAD/perovskite and perovskite/TiO<sub>2</sub> interfaces were compared. Using a numerical model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, optoelectronic properties of the bulk perovskite as well as interfaces were analysed to evaluate diffusion and recombination phenomena in the device<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, revealing the great quality of Spiro-OMeTAD/perovskite interface where degradation phenomena are less marked than for perovskite/TiO<sub>2</sub> one. Finally, a 4 T tandem device was prepared, reaching a remarkable efficiency of 21.18% that corresponds to a maximum absolute efficiency improvement of 1.66% of the commercially-available silicon Al-BSF wafer here employed, and a 2.65% boost when is compared to the Si cell once cut.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Optimization of a high efficient opaque perovskite solar cell</title><p id="Par7">The first part of this study is focused on the growth of high quality perovskite films and particularly on the influence of the caesium addition in the perovskite formula.

Top view Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images of these perovskite layers are presented in Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref> (Supporting information). As the impact of caesium on grain size distribution was not obvious, SEM images were analysed using <italic>ImageJ</italic> software in order to determine the surface occupied by each grain. The grain size distribution for the different perovskites prepared is shown in the frequency histograms (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). Two main effects are evidenced: as Cs content was increased, the grain size distribution was narrower and the mean value was decreased from 190 nm (0% Cs) to 155 nm (10% Cs). Consistently, the crystallite size evaluated with the main diffraction peak of the perovskite phase located at 2<italic>θ</italic> ≈ 14° on the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>) using the Debye-Scherrer formula also decreases with the addition of caesium (123 nm for 0% Cs, 114 nm for 5% Cs and 80 nm for 10% Cs). These results seem to be caused by a faster crystallization, in agreement with the findings reported by Gratia <italic>et al</italic>., where a quantity of Cs higher than 3% permits to circumvent the crystallization via environmentally sensitive and defect-predisposed intermediate hexagonal phases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the presence of PbI<sub>2</sub> (diffraction peak located at 2<italic>θ</italic> ≈ 12.6°) is clearly identifiable for the 0% Cs compound and can be associated with the excess of lead and halogen species present in the precursor solution compared to the total monovalent cation concentration. This diffraction peak disappears when enough Cs is introduced in the precursor solution for fresh devices. On the other hand, it is worth noting that even for the highest Cs content, no specific peak of CsI were observed. Cross-section SEM image (taken after focused ion beam polishing, FIB) of a complete opaque PSC is presented in Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>. It is composed of a perovskite absorber layer grown with 5% Cs, using FTO as TCO, a compact TiO<sub>2</sub> and a mesoporous TiO<sub>2</sub> as electron selective contact, Spiro-OMeTAD as hole selective contact and Au as rear cathode. The best efficiency has been obtained with a submicrometre perovskite film that ensures a proper light harvesting together with an effective charge collection.

A summary of <italic>J-V</italic> characteristics of opaque cells for the different absorber formulations is presented in Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref>.

Therefore, average PCE was increased significantly with a champion cell reaching PCE = 19.7% with a steady-state PCE = 19.5% (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S5</xref>). However, in literature a 10% Cs concentration led to results very near to the record ones obtained at 5% Cs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, while, in our case, the introduction of 10% Cs resulted excessive, reducing very significantly the <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>SC</italic></sub> and FF regarding 5% Cs concentration and not presenting PCE enhancement in comparison with Cs-free perovskite absorber.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Optimization of the ITO deposition process</title><p id="Par8">In most of the reported fabrication procedures for semitransparent PSC, a thin protection layer, typically molybdenum oxide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> is deposited on the Spiro-OMeTAD prior to the deposition of transparent conductive oxide in order to protect the organic material during the sputtering process.

Then, the procedure described in the experimental part leads to ITO films with mobility and carrier concentrations of 46 cm<sup>2</sup> V s<sup>−1</sup> and 3.6 × 10<sup>20</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup> respectively.

According previous results, two different ITO thicknesses (130 and 230 nm) were tested as rear transparent contact for these perovskite solar cells in substitution of metallic Au cathode. Although 230 nm thick samples showed <italic>a priori</italic> the most adequate opto-electronical properties since good transmittance in NIR and low resistivity, 130 nm thick samples were also tested at the same time to reduce the sputtering time of ITO in order to limit or prevent possible damages. The morphology of this device is shown in cross sectional FIB-SEM figure (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) for a complete semitransparent PSC containing 230 nm thick ITO as rear contact, observing similar morphology and thickness for the different layers employed regarding the opaque PSC previously detailed, with a dense ITO film, well-attached to Spiro-OMeTAD and without revealing any remarkable degradation or damaging driven by sputtering deposition of ITO rear contact. In addition, the annealing of ITO resulted an important parameter to keep under control. Thus, photovoltaic parameters as a function of ITO thickness and with/without annealing at 100 °C are summarized in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. Solar cells were systematically built for each condition and the illumination of the cell was carried out from the glass side through FTO. Before annealing, PSC prepared with 130 nm thick ITO layer did not show performances superior to 6.8%, with <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>SC</italic></sub> that drastically vary from one cell to another and FF not exceeding 30%. Performances are strongly improved with a thicker ITO film (230 nm), detecting samples with <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>SC</italic></sub> higher than 20 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> as a result of an excellent transmittance of ITO layer, with a coherent enhancement of FF and <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>OC</italic></sub> principally related to the reduction of ITO sheet resistance for a final maximum PCE of 11.8%. However, a thermal post treatment was found necessary to further increase the device performances by reducing series resistance issues (from 24.40 to 12.64 Ω cm<sup>2</sup>), exhibiting a great impact mainly on FF independently the ITO thickness, leading to a maximum PCE of 14.2% for the semitransparent PSC with 230 nm thick ITO. This reduction of series resistance on annealed samples can be associated to a better lateral collection and presumably to a better connection between Spiro-OMeTAD and ITO. The evolution of <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>OC</italic></sub> can be related to the reduction of the recombination losses. As the Spiro-OMeTAD/ITO interface is the most temperature sensitive part of the photovoltaic device, the decrease of trap density located at this interface and acting as non-radiative recombination centres could explain the improvement of this parameter by a better intimate contact of both materials as well. Anyway, as the fill factor still remains the limiting parameter due to high series resistance, a gold metallic grid was thermally evaporated onto ITO in order to enhance the lateral collection of the photogenerated carriers (see Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S7</xref>). As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, the collection grid further diminished series resistance (up to 5.79 Ω cm<sup>2</sup>) and permitted to attain a FF of 73.4% for an overall efficiency of 15.7% (15.6% in steady-state).

However, heating protocols were found not directly transferable on a larger device, since annealing at 100 °C during 10 min dramatically reduced the efficiency in larger PSC. Consequently, thermal treatment conditions were adjusted to circumvent undesirable damaging of samples and so avoiding reduction of PCE. Thus, in the case of 0.64 cm<sup>2</sup> semitransparent PSCs, consecutive annealing steps had to be carried out at 60, 70 and 80 °C during 5 minutes to improve the performance of the samples.

Resulting transient signal was fitted using a model including shallow traps, interface recombination and in-depth diffusion of charge carriers, remaining valid for the interval of charge carrier concentrations here considered. Consequently, diffusion lengths and lifetimes at solar concentration were successfully determined using the equations derived in the supporting information.</p><p id="Par13">By an optical excitation (LASER pulse) on both sides of the record big semitransparent PSC (glass/FTO/bl-TiO<sub>2</sub>/mp-TiO<sub>2</sub> abbreviated as TiO<sub>2</sub> side, and ITO/Spiro-OMeTAD coded as Spiro-OMeTAD one), the differences on TRPL response between both illumination sides were investigated. This process is sketched in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, where experimental photoluminescence (PL) transients acquired at photon flux <italic>Φ</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> = 1.2 × 10<sup>12</sup> pulse<sup>−1</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup> are shown for a fresh device (solid lines) and after 20 days ageing (dotted ones). Decays at TiO<sub>2</sub> side are coloured in blue while pink was employed for Spiro-OMeTAD side. For all cases, PL decay was accelerated at shorter times after the optical pulse, when charge carriers recombine faster. This is due to their higher concentration next to the interface, which can be explained through the combination of a high absorption coefficient (<italic>α</italic><sub><italic>532</italic></sub> = 10<sup>5</sup> cm<sup>−1</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, with a slow in-depth diffusion in bulk perovskite. No significant changes were detected with ageing for semitransparent PSC samples when they were illuminated through Spiro-OMeTAD side, which indicates not only a relatively quite stable Spiro-OMeTAD/perovskite interface but also a damageless ITO sputtering process since the behaviour of the cell in terms of generation and collection of charges is not limited or reduced when Spiro-OMeTAD side illumination was applied. In contrast, the TRPL decay is slightly accelerated after ageing for TiO<sub>2</sub> side illumination. This points out a better quality and stability of Spiro-OMeTAD/perovskite interface than perovskite/TiO<sub>2</sub> one despite the potentially damaging ITO sputtering process. In addition, the stability of PSC has been reported to be limited by TiO<sub>2</sub> interface due to ultraviolet light-induced instability of titania<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. In order to quantitatively compare the diffusion and recombination processes in the fresh and aged device, a kinetics model combining trap-assisted recombination and in-depth diffusion of charge carriers has been developed (briefly described in supplementary information). It leads to an accurate reconstruction of experimental transients acquired for different orders of magnitude of <italic>Φ</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> using both illumination directions, providing a precise estimation of the physical properties linked to recombination and diffusion processes. More precisely, the weight of different recombination pathways by determining the external radiative recombination rate <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>eh</italic></sub> and the shallow trap concentration <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>T</italic></sub> was assessed. Also, the diffusion coefficient <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> for holes and electrons and the recombination velocity associated to ETL/perovskite and HTL/perovskite interfaces was evaluated. As stated before, these parameters were independent from the injection level considered, on the contrary to the lifetimes frequently determined with a bi-exponential model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Parameters resulting from the fitting procedure are displayed in the inset table in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, along with their confidence intervals. Consistently with the fact that the illumination on the TiO<sub>2</sub> side led to faster PL decay at short times, a higher concentration in recombination sites at the interface formed with TiO<sub>2</sub> was obtained. This can be explained by a poor intimate contact between TiO<sub>2</sub> and perovskite, but also by the significant larger surface area of the mesostructured TiO<sub>2</sub>, so reducing the electronic quality of the interface. In any case, the effective amount of recombination at this interface resulted higher than at the Spiro-OMeTAD/perovskite one. Concerning the effect of ageing, fitted values for S<sub>TiO2</sub> and S<sub>Spiro</sub> confirmed the abovementioned analysis on the better stability of Spiro-OMeTAD/perovskite interface in comparison with perovskite/TiO<sub>2</sub> one. Although the observed faster decay could be related with a better injection towards the charge transport layers, it doesn’t seem to play a predominant role in this case since this injection generally takes place at the ps scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> and is frequently observed at short circuit conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, which doesn’t apply here. Regarding bulk perovskite, estimated external radiative recombination coefficient values were close to previously reported ones, indicating the negligible impact of deep defects on charge carrier transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. However, the shallow trap concentration valuates around 10<sup>16</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup>, which is remarkably higher than the one measured for a half-cell (<italic>N</italic><sub><italic>T</italic></sub> = 4.2 × 10<sup>14</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup> on FTO/bl-TiO<sub>2</sub>/mp-TiO<sub>2</sub>/perovskite) with the same chemical composition for the absorber<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. This might be a consequence of the deposition of the Spiro-OMeTAD/ITO structure upon the perovskite. Therefore, diffusion coefficient <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> by simply using Einstein relation (<italic>D</italic> = <italic>μkT</italic>/<italic>q</italic>), provided a mobility of <italic>μ</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> = 0.35 cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, inside the range of the reported values for polycrystalline solution-processed perovskites but relatively distant from the record values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Furthermore, charge collection remains being effective as previously determined recombination parameters correspond to a lifetime of <italic>τ</italic> = 340 ns at 1-sun illumination. Generally speaking, ageing process mainly reduced the diffusion coefficient (<italic>D</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub>), consequently reducing <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>sc</italic></sub> by collection issues.

With the optimization of perovskite composition and ITO properties (thickness, transmission, sheet resistivity and annealing time), record efficiencies up to 15.7% on a 0.16 cm<sup>2</sup> and 15.43% on 0.64 cm<sup>2</sup> have been achieved with semitransparent perovskite cell containing rear ITO cathodes deposited by RF magnetron sputtering without any MoO<sub>x</sub> intermediate film between Spiro-OMeTAD and ITO. Up to our knowledge, it constitutes the record efficiency for buffer layer-free semitransparent PSCs. Moreover, the tandem device built in combination with a commercially-available Al-BSF silicon leads to a substantial enhancement of the original silicon performance: up to 1.66% in absolute PCE regarding the wafer, even 2.65% when the reduced Si solar cell size is taken into account, since 21.18% efficiency has been obtained for the abovementioned perovskite/silicon 4-T tandem device. This result can be further improved by working on the infrared transmission in the PSC as well as minimizing the losses related to the Si wafer cutting. Additionally, the main physical properties linked to recombination and diffusion processes of the semitransparent cell have been evaluated from time-resolved-photoluminescence (TRPL) imaging measurement carried out on both sides of the semitransparent cell. This characterization shows that Perovskite/TiO<sub>2</sub> interface was generally the most critical part of the final semitransparent device from a recombination point of view, revealing that the introduction of a transparent high-quality sputtered-ITO as cathode onto Spiro-OMeTAD without any buffer layer in between does not constitute a bottleneck for semitransparent PSC fabrication.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Perovskite Solar Cell Fabrication</title><p id="Par17">FTO-coated glass substrates (TEC 10, 3 mm thick) purchased from Ossila were chemically etched using Zn powder and HCl (4 M).

In this system, the targets are positioned in confocal geometry over the substrate, the inter-electrode distance is approximately 10 cm in balanced magnetron mode and substrates are mounted on a stainless steel rotating disk. The indium oxide and tin oxide fluxes are generated by RF (13.56 MHz) magnetron sputtering from an ITO (90% In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> − 10% SnO<sub>2</sub>) target. It is important to remark that for this process only one target was used and RF system was chosen to reduce physical impact in comparison with direct-current sputtering.</p><p id="Par20">Prior all depositions, the sputtering chamber was evacuated to P &lt; 5 × 10<sup>−7</sup> mbar and the ITO target pre-sputtered for at least 10 minutes in Ar plasma at 2.5 × 10<sup>−3</sup> mbar to remove the surface pollution. For the analysis of transmission spectra of ITO films onto glass, 2 mm thick borosilicate glass was used as substrate. When ITO films were applied to semitransparent PSC, both glass substrates (for control purposes) and semitransparent perovskite devices were introduced in the deposition reactor, where the working pressure and RF power were fixed to 2.5 × 10<sup>−3</sup> mbar and 50 W respectively. ITO annealing was made at 100 °C during 10 minutes for small semitransparent PSCs; whereas, for larger devices, the annealing procedure was design with consecutive heating steps at 60, 70 and 80 °C for 5 min onto a hot plate separated by a cooling down to room temperature in air in between heating steps.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Photovoltaic Characterization</title><p id="Par21">In order to analyse the photovoltaic properties of the solar cells, an AAA sun simulator (Oriel Sol3A) was employed as light source using an AM1.5 G spectra and 1 Sun (100 mW cm<sup>−2</sup>) intensity. A digital source meter (Keithley Model 2400) was used to apply a voltage to the cell while photocurrent was registered in order to record <italic>J</italic>-<italic>V</italic> curves. The voltage sweeping rate was fixed to 80 mV s<sup>−1</sup> unless other one was specified.

For quantum efficiency measurements, an Oriel IQE200 system in connection with a source meter (Keithley 2400) were utilized to record the performance using a digital lock-in amplifier (Oriel Merlin). Both opaque cells and small semitransparent ones presented an active area of 0.16 cm<sup>2</sup>, using a black metal laser-cut mask to illuminate 0.09 cm<sup>2</sup>.

The cell was down-sized by creating shallow patterned lines at the cell back side with a Nd:YAG laser operated at 10 kHz with a 1064 nm wavelength. The weakened lines were then cleaved so as to create smaller pieces with 1 cm² active area (including 6 metallic fingers). Then, two electrical wires were soldered on the front and back of the reduced Si cell to keep bottom cell contacts when top cell was stack over. In order to evaluate the performances of the perovskite/silicon 4 T tandem device, 2 × 2 cm blank perovskite devices were fabricated to be used as top filters for the 1 cm<sup>2</sup> Si Al-BSF bottom solar cell, enabling to measure the whole Si area. An index matching material was placed between filter and Si bottom cell. Those blank perovskite devices used as filters consisted in real functional semitransparent PSC, optically identical to the ones reported in this work, with the only absence of the U-shape Au contact evaporated on the surroundings of the ITO area designed to reduce the series resistance. Perovskite filters of larger size than Si bottom cell were intentionally used to ensure the absence of unfiltered light incident onto Si bottom cell that would artificially increase the photocurrent. Moreover, blank perovskite devices were fabricated exactly under identical conditions than the here reported semitransparent PSC to ensure the reliability of the method: during the same day, in the same batch and employing the same solutions and deposition conditions. Consequently, the overall performance of 4-T perovskite/Silicon tandem solar cell was calculated by adding the efficiencies of the semi-transparent PSC and the filtered silicon bottom one. In order to accurately determine the EQE of bottom cell, the Si cell was illuminated through our champion semitransparent PSC with 0.64 cm<sup>2</sup> active area.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>TRPL Imaging</title><p id="Par23">The main components of the Time-Resolved Photoluminescence (TRPL) setup are a pulsed laser (TALISKER, Coherent) delivering 15 ps wide pulses (<italic>λ</italic> = 532 nm, repetition rate <italic>f</italic><sub>0</sub> = 40 kHz) and triggering an intensified electron-multiplied CCD (em-ICCD) time-gated camera (PIMAX4, Princeton instruments).
