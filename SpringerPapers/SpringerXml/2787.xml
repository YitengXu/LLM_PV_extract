Cumulatively, by 2050, estimates project 78 million tonnes of raw materials embodied in the mass of EOL photovoltaic (PV) modules, 12 billion tonnes of wind turbine blades, and by 2030, 11 million tonnes of lithium-ion batteries. Owing partly to concern that the projected growth of these technologies could become constrained by raw material availability, processes for recycling them at EOL continue to be developed. However, none of these technologies are typically designed with recycling in mind, and all of them present challenges to efficient recycling. This article synthesizes and extends design for recycling (DfR) principles based on a review of published industrial and academic best practices as well as consultation with experts in the field. Specific principles developed herein apply to crystalline-silicon PV modules, batteries like those used in electric vehicles, and wind turbine blades, while a set of broader principles applies to all three of these technologies and potentially others. These principles are meant to be useful for stakeholders—such as research and development managers, analysts, and policymakers—in informing and promoting decisions that facilitate DfR and, ultimately, increase recycling rates as a way to enhance the circularity of the clean energy economy. The article also discusses some commercial implications of DfR.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Graphical Abstract</title><p><fig id="Figa" position="anchor"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40831_2020_313_Figa_HTML.png" position="anchor" id="MO10"/></fig></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>DfR</kwd><kwd>Circular economy</kwd><kwd>Renewable energy</kwd><kwd>Photovoltaics</kwd><kwd>PV</kwd><kwd>Batteries</kwd><kwd>Wind</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006134</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">DE-AC36-08GO28308</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>24</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Minerals, Metals &amp;

In contrast, a circular economy optimizes energy and material use over product life cycles by remanufacturing, refurbishing, repairing, or reusing EOL products. When products can no longer be remanufactured, refurbished, repaired, or reused, recycling is the final circular option. Yet many products comprise a complex mix of materials that are difficult to recover during recycling. One approach to bringing such products into the circular economy is to design them from the beginning with recycling in mind. Design for recycling (DfR) holds potential to increase the quantity and value of materials recovered and reused from EOL products.</p><p id="Par3">Researchers have proposed engineering practices that resemble DfR under a variety of other names and classifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. For example, the classification by Fiksel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] identifies common pathways and methods among different design for the environment (DfE) strategies, where DfE encompasses DfR under the category of design for revalorization; other DfE categories include design for dematerialization, design for detoxification, and design for capital protection and renewal.</p><p id="Par4">DfR is optimally applied when looking beyond just the recycling process itself to the facets of the larger system in which it fits (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Knowledge of the kind of recycling process that will be applied to a product (e.g., hydrometallurgical, pyrometallurgical) can affect the design choices that enhance recyclability (DfR), elaborated further below. Recycling often consists of multiple processing stages. In ideal (but uncommon) situations, DfR can enable direct reuse of disassembled, intact, recovered components (denoted by the dashed blue line in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), which minimizes intermediate losses and overall recycling energy use.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The role of DfR within a circular system.

Others provide broad DfR strategies and comment on DfR’s relationship within broader sustainability practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This article synthesizes and extends identified DfR principles based on a review of published industrial and academic best practices as well as consultation with experts in the field; these experts are listed in the Acknowledgements. The resulting high-level DfR principles are meant to be useful for stakeholders—such as research and development (R&amp;D) managers, analysts, and policymakers—in informing and promoting decisions that facilitate DfR.</p><p id="Par6">We focus on the application of DfR to several clean energy technologies because of their recent and projected growth (e.g., to fulfill renewable portfolio standards,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> 100% renewable energy targets,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> and other initiatives<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3">3</xref>) and to help avoid future waste-management challenges. Cumulatively, by 2050, estimates project 78 million tonnes of raw materials embodied in the mass of EOL photovoltaic (PV) modules (which are ~ 95% crystalline-silicon modules), 12 billion tonnes of wind turbine blades, and by 2030, 11 million tonnes of lithium-ion batteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Thus, we provide DfR principles specific to crystalline-silicon PV modules, batteries like those used in electric vehicles (EVs), and wind turbine blades, along with a set of broader principles applicable to all three of these technologies and potentially others. These principles are based on the current state of knowledge and technologies, and revisions will be needed as the field continues to evolve. The article concludes with a discussion of commercial DfR applications in clean energy and a summary of the principles.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Principles Applicable to All Three Selected Clean Energy Technologies</title><p id="Par10">Based on our literature review—see the Supplementary Information (SI)—and consultation with experts, we identify nine DfR principles that broadly apply to crystalline-silicon PV modules, EV batteries, and wind turbine blades, as described below. Readers could consider whether these broad principles might also apply to other clean energy technologies. Principles specific to the selected clean energy technologies are provided in “<xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">PV DfR Principles</xref>” section (crystalline-silicon PV), “<xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">EV Battery DfR Principles</xref>” section (EV batteries), and “<xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">Wind Turbine Blade DfR Principles</xref>” section (wind turbine blades).</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Product Requirements Such As Functionality, Longevity, Reliability, and Cost Are Critical for Market Acceptance; DfR Should Support or Enhance These Aspects but May Result in Trade-Offs Between Recyclability and Product Performance and Cost</title><p id="Par11">DfR products must be accepted in the market for the recycling benefits to be achieved, which requires that the function, reliability, and cost be acceptable to consumers. In some cases, improving a product’s recyclability may also improve its performance and/or cost, but in some case these different objectives conflict. If a high degree of recyclability impairs a product’s commercial viability, designing for less recyclability may be necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. “<xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec">Crystalline-Silicon PV DfR Principles</xref>” section (Principle 4) provides an example of such a trade-off, in relation to the laminate-free NICE-PV module that sacrifices some efficiency to facilitate disassembly and recycling. Conversely, if a product is subject to recycling targets (e.g., due to government policies), lower performance or higher cost may be trade-offs for greater recyclability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Material Choice and the Ability to Liberate Separate Materials Are Critical to DfR Outcomes</title><p id="Par12">DfR outcome metrics like material recovery rate and purity of recovered materials depend on the choice and distribution of materials within the product as well as use of adhesives (see Principle 6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Materials entering secondary material markets must meet purity specifications. If incompatible materials are used in a product, but are not adhered together, they can sometimes be adequately separated to avoid commingling of the recycling output streams—for instance, when the incompatible materials are isolated in easily separable components. However, even if incompatible materials are in the same component, they might be separable during a recycling process. For example, shredding might be able to liberate and separate copper (Cu) and iron sufficiently from a product to provide a steel mill with a stream of recycled iron that is acceptably uncontaminated with Cu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recycling Outcomes Can Be Enhanced by Minimizing Hazardous Materials in Products or Making These Materials Completely Recoverable via DfR</title><p id="Par13">Hazardous materials should be avoided when possible (e.g., when not contrary to Principle 1) so the product is not classified as hazardous waste at EOL, to reduce the cost of recycling (for handling and treating hazardous materials), and to reduce environmental impacts. When hazardous materials must be used, DfR that enables full and separately controlled recovery of these materials can avoid contamination of recycling outputs and characterization of the outputs as hazardous waste. For example, recycling rates for lead-acid car batteries exceed 90%. Most of the lead (Pb) is recovered and used in new battery applications, which keeps this hazardous material out of landfills and avoids contaminating other waste streams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Similarly, cadmium telluride (CdTe) PV modules are subject to a specialized process that recovers Cd and Te, which prevents environmental and human health hazards related to Cd [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Minimizing and Managing Hard-to-Recycle Materials Can Improve Overall Recycling Yield</title><p id="Par14">Hard-to-recycle materials vary by recycling situation and may include materials degraded by recycling or those not recyclable more than a few times, such as treated wood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. When such materials must be used, DfR that makes them easy to isolate early in the recycling process can facilitate recycling of the product’s other materials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Minimizing Non-Reversible Adhesives or Similar Bonds, Especially Over Whole Surfaces and for Dissimilar Materials, Can Facilitate Disassembly and Material Liberation</title><p id="Par15">Non-reversible adhesives or similar difficult-to-break bonds may impede product disassembly and material liberation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This is especially true when two dissimilar and incompatible materials are bonded together; however, in some cases, such bonds can facilitate recycling, such as when strategically placed welds (non-reversible) provide a better path of preferential breakage and liberation during shredding, compared with using bolts (reversible).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Design for Disassembly (DfD) Can Improve Recyclability</title><p id="Par16">DfD promotes modular product construction, which can facilitate separation and then recycling of individual component groups at EOL (as well as repair of components individually, as opposed to needing to disassemble a whole device to repair the faulty component). In addition, product disassembly trials by manufacturers can reveal implications of various aspects of the product’s design with regard to DfR, such as choice and location of fasteners and joining methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and these insights can be applied in designing a recycling process. Design for remanufacturing exhibits similar synergies with DfR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Being Able to Estimate Improvements in Recyclability and Economic and Environmental Impacts Due to DfR Is Important for Continuous Improvement, Identification, and Weighing of Trade-Offs and Communicating Value</title><p id="Par17">In recent years, methods designed to quantitatively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] or qualitatively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] analyze product recyclability have emerged. These methods, which vary in complexity and ease of use, are most useful when validated with experimental observations, and they can continue to be improved. DfR can be beneficial even if product designers can only assess its impacts at an informal level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Benefits from analyzing effects of recycling include the ability to learn and continuously improve, to identify trade-offs and weigh their effects for future redesign, and to enable communication about the value of DfR to internal and external stakeholders.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Using Labels to Identify Recyclable and Non-Recyclable Materials Helps Recyclers Classify Feedstocks; Labeling Standardization Is Important for Uptake and Utilization</title><p id="Par18">Product labeling options include stickers with identifying information, symbols, embossed or engraved information, bar codes, radio-frequency identification (RFID), blockchain,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn4">4</xref> material passports,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn5">5</xref> or other methods. The label composition, placement, and application method can have positive or negative recycling implications, but the label’s information is most important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Clear labels help recyclers classify feedstocks and thus facilitate their entire recycling operations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Standardization is key to efficiency of use, degree and ease of uptake, and broad utilization. Confidential or proprietary information can be maintained in some systems, with potential trade-offs in ease and speed of identification by multiple parties. Labels that provide information beyond material composition—such as appropriate handling, repair, remanufacturing, and recycling strategies—can also be helpful.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Designing Products to Use Recycled Materials Promotes Circular Manufacturing</title><p id="Par21">Although using recycled materials in a product does not inherently improve that product’s recyclability, doing so bolsters the circularity of the manufacturing system and encourages DfR; building markets for recycled materials gives impetus to companies and R&amp;D managers to enhance design of products for recycling, because the materials within the products will have greater value at EOL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In turn, increasing the prevalence of DfR may lead to higher-quality recycled feedstocks and greater utilization of these resources.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>PV DfR Principles</title><p id="Par22">This section starts with principles focused on the world’s dominant PV technology, crystalline-silicon PV modules (“<xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec">Crystalline-Silicon PV DfR Principles</xref>” section), followed by a short discussion of DfR considerations for thin-film PV modules, which hold the remaining market share (<xref rid="Sec19" ref-type="sec">“Discussion of Thin-Film PV</xref>” section). Various crystalline-silicon PV module recycling concepts exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], including three that have achieved pilot scale or larger: the hot-knife (thermal) glass separation process offered by NPC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], a mechanical-only process run by Veolia in France [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and a mechanical-chemical process designed in the Full Recovery End Life Photovoltaic (FRELP) research project—see the SI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The basic design of crystalline-silicon modules has not changed for decades, although manufacturers have created thousands of variations. Such variability presents a challenge to recycling systems and PV DfR. In addition, PV systems are expected to perform with high reliability for warranty periods of 2–3 decades under extreme outdoor environmental conditions. Such stringent performance requirements have incentivized a design philosophy leading to a sealed, durable, sandwich-like module structure that hinders separation and liberation of constituent materials.

Known composition could also facilitate batch processing of categorized groups, enable isolation of problematic or incompatible chemical compositions, and avoid contamination of recycling products. Because modules may outlive their manufacturers, it would be helpful for labeling to be durable (on the scale of decades) and for any linked databases of construction or composition to remain accessible after a manufacturer goes out of business. Steps in this direction are being taken. Although currently limited, a new voluntary sustainability certification standard, NSF-457, includes provisions for identifying PV module compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

One important issue relates to backsheets containing fluorinated polymers, which produce hazardous fluorine (F) gases under thermal processing and thus increase thermal recycling costs or restrict treatment options. For example, use of pyrolysis is challenged because the pyrolysis oil becomes contaminated with F [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].

Recently, recyclability has become a driver of F-free backsheet manufacturing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], particularly for higher-end modules. Transparent backsheets exist in both fluorinated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and F-free [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] varieties. If thermal processing is not used, backsheet composition has less effect on recyclability.</p><p id="Par25">If fluoropolymers must be used in backsheets for a particular module design, lower F content is preferable for three reasons. First, air emissions from thermal processing can be controlled at lower cost owing to lower use of reagent to neutralize F. Second, the resulting gases will be less corrosive. Finally, Cu smelters will pay more for recovered materials with lower levels of F contamination.</p><p id="Par26">The cost implications of recycling fluorinated backsheets have been debated. Some stakeholders say the incremental cost impact is limited, particularly where regionally available thermal treatment infrastructure is already equipped for fluoropolymers. However, the incremental cost could reach 1 U.S. dollar (USD) per module when a primary Cu smelter treats an F-bearing backsheet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], which could be roughly equivalent to the recovered Cu value per module [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], thus reducing the economic feasibility of recycling.

In such a process, designs that minimize fluoropolymer coatings on the inner layers of the module would likely be easier to treat. If a future recycling option can remove and isolate a thin (~ 50 μm) layer from the exterior of a backsheet (of fluoropolymer and/or non-fluorinated base layer materials), this could improve the tolerance of recycling systems to the use of exterior fluoropolymer layers in future module designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The SI contains descriptions of R&amp;D aimed at mitigating recyclability problems due to fluorinated backsheets. Glass/glass or double-glass PV modules that eliminate the backsheet in favor of a second layer of glass would likely bypass the F issue.</p><p id="Par28">Beyond F content, other backsheet attributes can affect module recyclability.

Ag, one of the largest sources of module recycling revenues, is also one of the most resource-constrained PV feedstocks. Reducing Ag use in modules may be necessary to sustain rapid global PV growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Partial substitution with Cu/Ni is less favorable than total substitution in recycling processes that use leaching, such as FRELP, owing to the additional complexity of handling both Ag and Ni in the leach solution. The presence of Ag makes the mixture unsuitable to alternative and less expensive leaching chemistries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Costs for recycling processes without leaching, such as the hot-knife/Cu smelter process, likely would be less affected by partial or total substitution of Ag with Cu/Ni.

Cu or Ag could increase recycling revenues, although using Ag may strain feedstock availability and increases cost. Tin (Sn) is effectively interchangeable with Pb in terms of recycling impacts; Sn is scarcer and more expensive than Pb, but less so than Ag. Bismuth (Bi) presents the most recycling problems among Pb-replacement candidates. Bi can result in higher penalties when selling Cu-bearing recycling outputs to a Cu smelter, reaching 3–10 USD per tonne of smelter feed per 0.1% of excess Bi for a typical feed consisting of 22%–30% Cu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. In contrast, Sn and Pb are tolerated at much higher concentrations (3%–5% Pb + Sn + zinc) and incur lower penalties (1 USD per tonne per 1% mass) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Bi interferes with downstream electro-refining of smelter Cu outputs, increasing complexity and cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].

Cu refiners rely on a sulfuric acid process, but the same issues may manifest in more sophisticated PV recycling flowsheets, such as FRELP’s nitric acid-based process, and could require further recycling stages. In addition, not all Bi-isolation methods yield salable Bi outputs, so circularity of Bi is not assured. Pb and Sn interfere much less with such circuits and can be readily managed in FRELP’s nitric acid-based process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Should Bi be required in crystalline-silicon PV applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], some portion of the recycling impacts could eventually become more tolerable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].

The Veolia process separates materials laminated together through a complex mechanical process. This process may have more tolerance for existing laminates but would likely perform better without them owing to reduced cross-contamination of recycling products, improved liberation, and more homogenous plastic outputs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">The manufacturers of the NICE-PV module offer a laminate-free design that facilitates disassembly and recycling, but module efficiency declines because of the air gap and electrical connections held together by internal module vacuum pressure; changes in temperature and altitude would change the electrical efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. One study demonstrated that the NICE design also enabled relatively easy recovery of intact wafers and glass panes from a simulated EOL module, which is currently infeasible for modules with laminates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. TPedge is another laminate-free module design. It uses adhesive pins, which cover only 0.02% of the cell surface, and soldered electrical connections that require no specific under-pressure but might exhibit some sensitivity to temperature or altitude. Both NICE and TPedge eliminate laminate from the face of the cells with the help of edge-sealing methods like silicone. Still, some glue-like material is required on portions of the front glass and rear materials.

Frameless modules are one trend. PV modules are typically designed with frames, but they can be designed without frames. Framing helps protect the module during transportation, installation, and EOL removal while easing the installation process and providing torsional rigidity throughout the life cycle. Frameless modules are more prone to breakage, although certain transportation strategies and, for instance, reusable corner protectors can reduce breakage. On the other hand, frameless modules simplify recycling. De-framing a module adds a recycling step and increases the potential for glass and cell breakage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]; however, the frames are relatively easy to recover, and the aluminum (Al) can add more than 2 USD/module in recycling revenue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Thus, the frame’s impact on recycling economics is comparable to module Ag content (~ 2.70 USD/module [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]), particularly for recycling processes such as FRELP and hot-knife [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. As yet another trade-off, frameless modules are lighter and more compact and can cost less to transport at EOL. Removing the frame (whether in design as frameless or through frame removal at EOL) can increase up to sevenfold the number of modules that fit in the same container [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">Glass/backsheet versus glass/glass module designs present other trade-offs. Glass/glass designs increase the potential glass cullet revenue per module and eliminate use of a backsheet, which is often fluorinated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. If the rear and front glass are of different grades and are not isolated from each other throughout the recycling process, introducing the multiple grades into outputs may degrade the glass recycling economics. Experimental recycling data are sparser for glass/glass modules than for the typical glass/backsheet varieties. Because the mechanical properties of glass differ from those of polymer backsheets, recycling processes that intentionally or coincidentally exploit such attributes could be impacted in unpredictable ways. The mechanical Veolia process has undergone preliminary testing with glass/glass modules, and future glass/glass recycling is possible with some retrofitting, according to a La Mia Energia representative (personal communication, 2019).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Discussion of Thin-Film PV</title><p id="Par36">The crystalline-silicon PV DfR principles pertaining to structural aspects of a module generally remain valid for a range of thin-film module chemistries; however, the metal-recovery stages of the recycling process may vary as a function of underlying module chemistry.

Additionally, raw material values are higher for CdTe than for crystalline silicon, inducing interest in enhancing the security of their supply chain by participating directly through EOL recovery of precious metals like Te.

This section lists several principles applicable to current and next-generation EV batteries. These principles focus on the battery exterior housing, because they can be applied well to the range of different battery types. Overall, standardization of product size and design can help streamline and optimize operations for battery recyclers, but it is not the current reality. Internal configuration and material choices are also important recyclability considerations, but the variability of these characteristics hinders identification of broadly applicable principles.

The principles are generally less applicable to large-scale vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs); performance, durability, and recyclability are complementary, rather than competing, criteria in this application—at least with regard to the vanadium (V) electrolytes.

Recent advances in sensor-based sorting technology may help battery recyclers use such identifiers to reject incompatible batteries early and cost-effectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].

Recycling and DfR are important aspects of this effort, but they should be considered after other circular approaches—such as design for reuse, product longevity, and remanufacturing—that provide better material value retention (shown as tighter circles in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). DfR is inherently challenged by the time that elapses between manufacturing of a product and the product’s EOL. A conservative approach is to design products with some assurance of the recycling system’s ability to handle the materials at EOL. Manufacturers can take calculated risks based on knowledge of potential future recycling methods, and they can mitigate risk further by becoming directly involved in planning future recycling capabilities or even operating their own recycling operations for their products (such as with the First Solar example above). The market for materials and the supply and demand will drive the success of recycling. Economics, product performance, and environmental impacts must be considered; recycling at EOL may not always be the best solution for the existing manufacturing and recycling ecosystem. Ultimately, DfR is desirable to achieve system-wide goals, such as ensuring material supply, maximizing material value, or minimizing life cycle impacts. There is a need for analytical tools to better evaluate the impacts of recycling, DfR, and other circular-economy strategies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors wish to thank reviewers from the research, R&amp;D management, and industrial communities, including K.
