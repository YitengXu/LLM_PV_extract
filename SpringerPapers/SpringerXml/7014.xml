Conventional thermal photovoltaics has a high theoretical efficiency limit (84%) but in practice cannot be easily miniaturized and is limited by the engineering challenges of sustaining large (&gt;1,000 K) temperature gradients. Here we show a hot-carrier-based thermophotonic solar cell, which combines the compact nature of photovoltaic devices with the potential to reach the high-efficiency regime of thermal photovoltaics. In the device, a thermal gradient of 500 K is established by hot electrons, under Stokes illumination, rather than by raising the temperature of the material itself. Under anti-Stokes (sub-bandgap) illumination we observe a thermal gradient of ∼20 K, which is maintained by steady-state Auger heating of carriers and corresponds to a internal thermal up-conversion efficiency of 30% between the collector and solar cell.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">The efficiency of single junction solar cells is limited by their inability to absorb photons with an energy smaller than the bandgap.

Thermophotovoltaic (TPV) energy converters on the other hand have a much higher limiting efficiency of 85% (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>). In TPV, concentrated sunlight heats an external solar collector, which emits a broad thermal spectrum towards optimized low-bandgap solar cells. An interesting conceptual extension of TPV is thermophotonics (TPX), in which the emission rate between the solar collector and the solar cell is enhanced by the presence of both an electrochemical potential and a thermal gradient in the collector<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Here we demonstrate a thermophotonic device in which the thermal gradient is maintained by hot electrons in a quantum-well-based solar collector that is directly integrated into the device structure. Light emission from the hot electrons in the quantum wells provides additional optical power to the solar cell and thus boosts its efficiency.</p><p id="Par4">The traditional ‘single-source’ configuration for a TPV or TPX device consists of a thermal collector facing the Sun, followed by filters and then a solar cell. The filters prevent any below-bandgap light from entering the solar cell and reflect it back towards the thermal collector where it can be reabsorbed.</p><p id="Par5">Here we consider an alternative ‘two-source’ configuration in which the solar collector is located behind the solar cell (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). In this configuration the solar cell plays the role of the filter: sunlight illuminates the solar cell directly, below-bandgap light is transmitted and raises the temperature of the thermal collector located at the rear. This configuration relies on thermal up-conversion in the solar collector to increase carrier energy such that some radiative recombination will occur with energy above the bandgap of the solar cell (the blue region in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>) and thus contribute to additional photocurrent generation. In this way the solar collector becomes the second source of photons and the device concept can achieve an efficiency above that of the Shockley–Queisser limit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Thermal up-conversion with hot carriers: concept and implementation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Energy flow showing solar photons entering the solar cell (<italic>N</italic><sub>sun</sub>) and sub-bandgap photons (<italic>N</italic><sub>IR</sub>) entering the solar collector. The solar collector generates hot carriers and emits broadened PL (<italic>N</italic><sub>up</sub>) towards the solar cell. The additional flux of above-gap photons, which have been thermally up-converted in the solar collector, boost the efficiency of the solar cell.

This layer acts as a solar collector and emits thermally broadened PL to the solar cell.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2015_Article_BFncomms9685_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p id="Par6">Using hot electrons for light emission means that the optical behaviour is identical to conventional thermal collectors, but without the engineering challenges of maintaining a large temperature gradient (1,000 K) in close proximity to a temperature-sensitive solar cell. In our device, the lattice temperature of the solar cell and thermal collector remain at room temperature at all times—only the electrons in the collector are hot.</p><p id="Par7">Integrating the collector with the solar cell has several practical and fundamental advantages. The all-solid-state approach has a simple flat plate form factor allowing the solar absorber layer to be added in a single growth process. Also, the collector emits into the internal optical modes of the solar cell, thus enabling a <italic>n</italic><sup>2</sup>∼12 × enhancement above the radiative transfer rate for an externally located collector (this is the reason for the discontinuous spectrum shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">The main challenge of hot-carrier approaches is the rapid electronic cooling that occurs in semiconductor absorbers. However, recently some remarkable demonstrations of slowed electron cooling in nanostructures have been published. Pandey <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> showed a specially designed colloidal nanostructure with an excited state electron lifetime extended from 1 ps to 1 ns. A number of experiments with multi-quantum wells (MQWs) have revealed anomalously slow ensemble cooling rate of 5 ns and also the ability to maintain very large electronic-lattice temperature gradients; carrier temperatures of 600 K have been recently reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>; here we report temperatures slightly below 800 K.</p><p id="Par9">In the following, we highlight the opportunity to use hot carriers as novel spectral converters. This approach differs from that of the hot-carrier solar cell: it is simpler, it removes the requirement for hot-carrier transport and energy selective extraction, and can capitalize on recent developments in nanophotonics to tune absorption and emission characteristics. The main results we present are Stokes, anti-Stokes and photocurrent power-dependence measurements of a solar cell with an integrated hot-carrier solar collector. Under Stokes illumination we show very large hot-carrier temperature gradients of ∼500 K can be maintained. Under anti-Stokes illumination we show a modest temperature gradient (∼20 K) can be maintained and by analysing the power-dependence postulate that this is caused by Auger heating of carriers. The photocurrent results show a non-linear power dependence from entering the themophotonic operating regime.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Experimental set-up</title><p id="Par10">In the experiments that follow, the two-source configuration has been chosen to explore the thermophotonic properties of the solar collector. This is because a high intensity infrared (IR) laser (which is below the bandgap of the solar cell) can be used to simulate the truncated spectrum received by the solar collector. The usefulness of the two-source configuration is that any photocurrent recorded by the solar cell can be directly correlated to hot-carrier light emission received from the solar collector. This configuration prevents a situation in which direct generation of carriers in the solar cell could mask the signal originating from the thermal up-conversion process.</p><p id="Par11">In principle a similar single-source configuration, in which the solar cell is placed behind the solar collector, is also possible with this scheme. However it would require a very high reflectivity filter (possibly a dielectric stack) to also be integrated into the device structure. In addition the filter’s angular response would be critically important because of the angular spread of focused laser light. We believe that for the first set of experiments in this area the two-source configuration provides a simpler route to explore this concept. In addition it will also allow the role of thermal up-conversion and the efficiency of the process to be quantified experimentally.</p><p id="Par12">For Stokes and anti-Stokes measurements a (50 mW) 808-nm laser diode and (500 mW) 1,064-nm diode-pumped solid-state (DPSS) laser are used, respectively. The 808-nm diode allows hot carriers to be generated directly in the MQWs and from these measurements the cooling coefficient of hot carriers can be measured. However, experiments with the 1,064-nm laser do not directly generate hot carriers, instead electrons and holes are directly generated in the ground state of the MQW absorber. Therefore, any observed increase in carrier temperature must originate from a self-heating mechanism: one possible mechanism is Auger recombination. Würfel has previously established the importance of Auger recombination and impact ionization in reaching equilibrium between a hot electron–hole plasma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Auger recombination reduces particle number in the solar collector but allows the average energy per particle (the carrier temperature) to increase because the recombining electron and hole transfer their energy back into the electronic system by scattering a third electron (or hole) into a high-lying energy state.</p><p id="Par13">The device structures considered here allow the temperature of Auger-heated carriers to be measured. Furthermore, because the integrated solar cell becomes a very sensitive photodetector, for light emitted by the solar collector, the total up-conversion efficiency can be directly measured.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Thermodynamic efficiency limits</title><p id="Par14">The thermodynamic efficiency limits of TPV and TPX are well-known<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and the thermodynamics of thermal up-converters have also been investigated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.

To reach the high-efficiency regime shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, lower bandgap materials are needed, which allow the solar collector to absorb much more solar energy.</p><p id="Par18">However, under laboratory conditions it is possible to probe different regimes of operation, which cannot be achieved with solar illumination.

This has been shown through a series of spectroscopic and photocurrent measurements, which push the solar collector into a regime of efficient thermal up-conversion. Under laser illumination electron–hole pairs are generated in an MQW absorber, which establishes an electro-chemical potential gradient. As the pump intensity is increased, a thermal gradient is also established in the collector, this enhances the overall emission rate. The measurements performed show the enhancement of the emission rate is due to the dual nature (photovoltaic and thermal) of the emitter material.</p><p id="Par35">The novel aspect of this work is that the thermal gradient is maintained by hot electrons in an otherwise room temperature absorber material; this was confirmed through Stokes and anti-Stokes spectroscopy and by a high-energy tail-fitting procedure. Under resonant excitation with the ground state hot carriers are generated through an Auger-heating process. However, in III–V materials Auger processes are inefficient and electronic cooling is very rapid, and for these reasons a very high illumination intensity, of at least 100 kW cm<sup>−2</sup>, was needed to maintain a modest thermal gradient of Δ<italic>T</italic>=20 K. Unlike conventional thermophotovoltaic approaches, where the collector is located externally, the hot-carrier approach allows the collector to be integrated directly into the solar cell without degrading the cell performance. The internal location enhances the radiative transfer rate by <italic>n</italic><sup>2</sup>≈12 × , compared with an externally located emitter. Furthermore, our device uses the same growth techniques and has the same form factor and the same efficiency limit (around 60%) as conventional concentrating multijunction solar cells. Therefore, in principle, it could be used as a substitute for these devices, without the need for changes to existing infrastructure.</p><p id="Par36">The device design presented here was chosen because it promised the clearest route to demonstrate and quantify the thermophotonic approach. However, it is unlikely to be the final iteration of the device concept. Lower bandgap materials with better up-conversion characteristics are needed. In the near-term optical cavities with high <italic>Q</italic>-factors can improve the absorption and concentration of light above the 46,200 × limit over small volumes and wavelength ranges. Furthermore, control of the optical density of states can also be used to tailor the emission spectrum, and this will enhance the efficiency of the device<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. By considering these options it is very likely that thermal up-conversion can be observed at more realistic concentration levels over the next few years. A complementary and potentially more practical approach is thermal down-conversion using the single-source configuration. With the hot-carrier collector placed first, it receives the full (non-truncated) solar spectrum, enabling significantly higher thermal gradients to be established; beyond which can be achieved with Auger heating. The success of all hot-carrier approaches hinges on the ratio between the cooling rate and generation rate. In this context, provided that the cooling is slow enough, the opportunity exists for a number of interesting high-efficiency devices, from solar cells to novel spectral converters. As shown here, spectral converters have the advantage that they can augment conventional solar cells to boost their efficiency when used in combination with high optical concentration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Photoluminescence microscope</title><p id="Par37">A PL microscope was designed and built with the dual purpose of focusing a laser beam to a diffraction-limited spot on the sample surface, and also to collect PL from the illuminated area. The beam path of the PL microscope is shown in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>. A laser beam is first mechanically chopped, attenuated by neutral density filters (ND1) and steered towards the 90:10 beam splitter (BS1) by beam-steering mirrors M1 and M2. The two mirrors allow axis-independent adjustments of the beam path such that it can propagate along the optical axis of all the optical components. The high reflectance ratio of BS1 was chosen to keep the laser power on the sample as high as possible. After reflection from BS1, the beam enters the microscope objective and is focused to a diffraction-limited spot on the sample surface. PL and reflected and scattered laser light are collected by the objective and collimated. The beam enters BS1 again, and the transmitted component (around 10%) is directed along the imaging path or detection path by a removable mirror (M3). The imaging path consists of a 150-mm plano-convex lens (L1), which focuses the collimated PL on a charge-coupled device to form an image (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). Along the detection path, the PL first passes through a focusing lens (L2) with f-number matched to the entrance of a single-grating monochromator. After the lens, a laser blocking filter (F1) is used to prevent laser light entering the detector. For the 808-nm laser, a low-pass (that is, long wavelength passing) filter is used, and for the 1,064-nm laser a holographic notch filter (HSPF-1064.0-1.0 with optical density of six from Kaiser Optical Systems) is used. At the exit of the monochromator, a calibrated Newport 818-SL (Ge) photodiode collects the monochromatic signal (D2).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>PL microscope for high-intensity illumination and measurement of laser spot size.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The beam paths for the illumination laser and PL are shown in red and orange, respectively.

This ensures that the beam is as large as possible on the entrance aperture of the microscope objective, which in turn allows the objective to focus the laser to a small diffraction-limited spot. Two lasers were used: a 808-nm diode laser and 1,064-nm DPSS laser. The 808-nm beam is first collimated by an aspherical lens, then astigmatism correction is applied using a lens pair of cylindrical lenses, which expand the slow axis. This increases the beam area to fill the entrance aperture of the objective without clipping the beam. Although the beam shape is improved, it remains noticeably asymmetric with approximate dimensions of 4 × 1 mm at the entrance aperture of the microscope objective. The 1,064-nm DPSS laser generates a high-quality TEM00 Gaussian beam, and for this reason beam expansion is easily achieved by a pair of plano-convex lenses.

Trimethylgallium, trimethylindium, tertiarybutylarsine and tertiarybutylphosphine were used as metal-organic sources for Ga, In, As and P, respectively. The reactor temperature and pressure during growth were nominally 610 °C and 100 mbar, respectively. The V/III ratio and growth rate were, respectively, 15 and 10 nm min<sup>−1</sup>; except for n-GaAs contact and base layers where the values of 10 and 40 nm min<sup>−1</sup> were used. <italic>In situ</italic> wafer curvature measurement (Epicurve from LayTec) was used to monitor strain accumulation during growth and optimize the wafer bowing of the InGaAs and GaAsP regions for zero net strain.

This is required to electrically isolate the up-converting MQW layer grown directly below the solar cell. The procedure for exposing the rear contact layer (n-GaAs) follows an involved multi-step process. First, a photoresist mask was deposited then photolithography was used to create a metal grid pattern. A Ti/Au (20/250 nm) contact was then deposited using an electron beam evaporator followed by lifting-off of the photoresist. Next, a 1-μm thick layer of SiO<sub>2</sub> was sputtered as an etching mask. Photolithography and chemical etching were used to pattern square areas on the SiO<sub>2</sub> mask followed by inductively coupled plasma dry etching of the n-GaAs contact layer. An AuGe/Ni (350/25 nm) metal contact was deposited by a thermal evaporator using a lithography lift-off technique. This contact was annealed at 380 °C for 5 min by a rapid thermal annealing system. The SiO<sub>2</sub> mask was then removed by buffered hydrofluoric acid solution. Last, the p-GaAs contact layer (located under the Ti/Au metal) was protected from a H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>:H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> etch solution whilst other areas were etched away.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Power dependence of Auger-driven thermal up-conversion</title><p id="Par45">Auger recombination is a three-particle process, therefore its rate scales with the cube of electron (<italic>n</italic>) and (<italic>p</italic>) hole density.
