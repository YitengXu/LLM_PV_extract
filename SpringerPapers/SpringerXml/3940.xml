The status and needs relating to the optimal design of community seasonal energy storage are reported. Thermal energy storage research has often focused on technology development and integration into buildings, but little emphasis has been placed on the most advantageous use of thermal storage in community energy systems. Depending on the composition and characteristics of a community, the most appropriate community thermal storage may differ from that for a single building. District energy systems usually link thermal users to cold supplies and/or heat supplies (e.g., solar thermal energy, geothermal energy from ground-source heat pumps or geothermal hot zones, industrial waste heat, thermal energy from cogeneration or trigeneration). It is demonstrated that the optimal integration of these technologies can be enhanced through the use of appropriate seasonal thermal energy storage and that community-level seasonal storage can facilitate the development of smart net-zero energy buildings and yield efficiency, economic and environmental benefits. Issues that need to be resolved to allow optimal solutions to be attained are described. Advanced tools are required for modeling, simulation, analysis, improvement, design and optimization, which incorporate advanced methods like exergy analysis. The most appropriate scale, number and type (e.g., sensible, latent, thermochemical) of thermal storages in a community need to be better assessed, and the appropriate time duration capacities for each determined in an optimal manner. This is particularly important since a combination of short-, medium- and long-term storage is sometimes required to yield the most benefits from community energy systems.</p></abstract><kwd-group

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">As research aimed at nearing or achieving net-zero energy buildings and communities intensifies, governments are promoting the adoption of renewable energy sources in buildings in the commercial, institutional, industrial and residential sectors. Thermal energy storage (TES) is a useful technology for storing thermal energy (heat or cold) between periods when it is available and periods when it is needed and thus facilitates the integration of renewable energy into communities (on the generation side) and acts as a buffer that permits the user-demand variability in communities to be satisfied (on the demand side).
</p><p id="Par3">Although much research on thermal energy storage often focuses on the development of storage technologies and some focuses on the integration of storages into buildings, much less emphasis has been placed on the most advantageous use of TES in community energy systems. Depending on the composition and characteristics of a community, the most appropriate thermal storage for a community may differ from that for a single building.</p><p id="Par4">A community-level thermal storage can be integrated into a community serving many users and multiple thermal energy suppliers of thermal energy. The thermal energy can be above environmental temperatures (i.e., hot) or below environmental temperatures (i.e., cold). Thermal energy users can be in the form of a wide range of building types (Heier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2015</xref>). Heat suppliers can include solar thermal energy, geothermal energy from ground-source heat pumps or geothermal hot zones, industrial waste heat, thermal energy from cogeneration or trigeneration systems and others. Cold suppliers usually include dedicated cooling facilities.</p><p id="Par5">The linkages between thermal energy users (buildings) and thermal energy suppliers are often accomplished using thermal grids, i.e., district heating and/or cooling systems. Various heat users (i.e., commercial, industrial and residential buildings) require heat at a range of temperatures depending on the indoor temperature demands as well as the heating technologies used in the building. TES systems are selected according to such specific applications. For example, underground thermal energy storage (UTES) systems operate more efficiently with lower-temperature requirements for space heating and higher-temperature requirements for space cooling. In commercial and institutional buildings that use thermo-active building systems (TABS) or in residential buildings that use floor heating systems, UTES systems can be an appropriate choice to be integrated with such low-temperature heating/high-temperature cooling technologies. A schematic representation is presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> of a community energy system incorporating TES and highlighting the various components of such an energy system.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic of a community energy system incorporating TES and various types of buildings. Buildings are linked to one or more seasonal thermal energy storages (STES) and to each other via district energy grids</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40974_2017_51_Fig1_HTML.gif" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par6">The optimal integration of all of these technologies can be enhanced through the use of appropriate TES and often seasonal storage. But a better understanding is needed of optimal community-level seasonal storages, i.e., TESs that meet the needs of a group of buildings and that operate over long time frames (seasonal or annual). This article aims to address that need in part and seeks to improve understanding of the characteristics of community-level TES. The main objective is to describe the status and needs relating to the optimal design of community seasonal energy storage.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Community-level Seasonal Energy Storage: Status and Research</title><p id="Par7">Thermal storages that can be applied in various settings, including at the community level, have been investigated recently. For instance, an operating borehole thermal storage system for a solar community of several buildings has been examined (Rad et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2017</xref>), as has a seasonal solar thermal storage that was converted into an innovative multifunctional storage (Schmidt and Mangold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2010</xref>). A research oriented book on thermal storage was recently published (Dincer and Rosen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2010</xref>), which covers many community-level applications.</p><p id="Par8">Much research has been reported in recent years on systems for TES and enhancing their understanding. Relevant developments include improved modeling of thermal storage systems and predictions of their performance and operating characteristics. Also, efforts have been reported on the integration of thermal storages into buildings, their component parts and related energy systems (Guadalfajara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2014</xref>). Relevant developments include enhanced modeling and design.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Technologies</title><p id="Par9">Thermal energy storage methods, technologies and applications have been examined in detail [see chapter 9 of Dincer and Rosen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2010</xref>)] and several reviews published recently (Heier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2015</xref>; Soares et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2013</xref>; Tatsidjodoung et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">2013</xref>; Waqas and Din <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">2013</xref>). For example, advanced storage concepts for active solar energy being carried out through the IEA (Task 32) were recently reviewed (Hadorn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2008a</xref>), as were relevant applications with solar energy (Sharma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2009</xref>; Singh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">2010</xref>). An overview has been presented of TES technologies and their status for solar heat (Hadorn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2008b</xref>). Reviews on solar TES in building heating and cooling supply are available (Lee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2010</xref>; Novo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2010</xref>). The principal methods available for seasonal storage of solar thermal energy are provided by Pinel et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2011</xref>), concentrating on residential scale systems, particularly existing examples which mostly store energy in the form of sensible heat, and briefly discussing newer methods such as chemical and latent storage. A good example of systems utilizing TES in solar buildings is the Drake Landing Solar Community in Okotoks, Alberta, Canada, which incorporates a borehole seasonal storage to supply space heating to 52 detached energy-efficient homes through a district heating network. The system and its operation are described by Sibbitt et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2012</xref>), and five-year performance data are presented.</p><p id="Par10">Thermal storage systems that incorporate PCMs in the building envelope (e.g., in walls, floors, ceilings and windows), including basic principles, candidate PCMs and their thermophysical properties, incorporation methods and heat transfer enhancement, are also reviewed (Soares et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2013</xref>; Pomianowski et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2013</xref>; Navarro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2016</xref>; Palomo del Barrio et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2017</xref>). A review on developments during the last four decades on seasonal TES in the ground, considering various storage concepts and natural and renewable energy sources, is provided by Pavlov and Olesen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2012</xref>) and new intelligent seasonal TES possibilities for use in combination with space heating, space cooling and domestic hot water systems are described.</p><p id="Par11">Large seasonal heat storages for buildings often use storage mediums in the vicinity of the buildings as opposed to storage in the building structure. Some of these technologies include aquifer, borehole and snow storage as well as storage in pits or buried tanks. The state of the art and outlook for latent thermal storage in buildings have been presented (Heier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2015</xref>; Soares et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2013</xref>). Seasonal heat storages in large basins like tanks and gravel-water pits have also been reviewed (Novo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2010</xref>), as have phase change materials for thermal storage (Shukla et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2009</xref>; Agyenim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2010</xref>; Kenisarim <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2010</xref>; Desgrosseilliers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2013</xref>). Applications of STES, often including community-level examples, have been reviewed in some regions and countries, e.g., Germany (Schmidt and Mangold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2008</xref>).</p><p id="Par12">A summary of the articles reviewed in this section, indicating the focus as well as the energy storage mechanism and type used, is provided in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Summary of selected articles that mainly focus on thermal energy storage technologies</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Focus of study</p></th><th align="left"><p>References</p></th><th align="left"><p>Energy storage mechanism/system type</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Solar heating system for community</p></td><td align="left"><p>Rad et al.

Modeling is important for performance prediction and design of seasonal thermal energy stores due to their long-term effects (Allegrini et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2015</xref>). For instance, modeling activities using analytical and numerical techniques have been reported for a range of thermal storages, including underground hot water systems (Ochs et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2010</xref>), ground buried sand beds (Terziotti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">2012</xref>), borehole energy storage (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2012</xref>; Rad et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2013</xref>; Koohi-Fayegh and Rosen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2014</xref>; Cui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2015</xref>; Eslami-nejad and Bernier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2013</xref>), aquifer thermal energy storage (Réveillèrea et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2013</xref>), cold storage (Yan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">2016</xref>; Alawadhi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2008</xref>), phase change thermal storage (Verma and Singal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2008</xref>; Dutil et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2014</xref>) and thermochemical storage (Kerskes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2010</xref>). Models for seasonal storage in water tanks or gravel pits are available in some software tools such as TRNSYS (Dickinson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2013</xref>). A hybrid solar ground-source heat pump system for heating and cooling of an office building (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2012</xref>) and a house (Rad et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2013</xref>) is also modeled in TRNSYS. Ground energy storage using boreholes is the most widely used method of seasonal energy storage. Models of ground heat exchangers and their applications are reviewed by Soni et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2015</xref>). Aquifer thermal energy storage systems use natural water in a saturated and permeable underground layer as the storage medium (Lee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2010</xref>). Information on the operating principles, design and construction of these systems can also be found (Lee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2010</xref>). Developments in using underground spaces for sensible heat storage are also described in several studies (Lee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2010</xref>; Novo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2010</xref>). Alternatively, large water tanks and gravel-water pits can be used as storage media for sensible TES (Novo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2010</xref>). Modeling and simulation to estimate ground energy storage long-term performance have been the focus of various studies (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2012</xref>; Koohi-Fayegh and Rosen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2014</xref>). However, they have significant modeling challenges regarding fast methods that can accurately calculate long-term behavior, particularly for multiple interacting boreholes (Allegrini et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2015</xref>; Koohi-Fayegh and Rosen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2014</xref>). Effects of parameters such as location and storage system design on a solar district heating system equipped with borehole seasonal storage have also been studied (Flynn and Siren <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2015</xref>). Improvements to current ground storage systems such as use of PCMs in boreholes to improve ground heat pump efficiency and reduce the borehole design length are also examined (Eslami-nejad and Bernier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2013</xref>). Modeling ground thermal energy storage including aquifer storage is often performed using finite difference, element and volume methods using tools such as FEFLOW. Several models and software tools that address district-level interactions among energy systems including seasonal energy storage systems are reviewed in (Allegrini et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2015</xref>). Numerical models have been used to better understand thermal processes in the charging and discharging of the seasonal storages, such as hot water tanks in (Dickinson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2013</xref>). When using multiple storages, various charging and discharging strategies such as charging and discharging of storages in parallel or series or their combination are studied (Dickinson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2013</xref>). Since results of analytical and numerical modeling can be strongly dependent on assumed storage characteristics (i.e., material) for some storage types, field scale living laboratories have also been built in some cases [e.g., in Torino, Italy (Giordano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2016</xref>)] to calibrate the results on real data.</p><p id="Par23">
Numerical approaches have also been developed for forecasting thermal energy storage performance (Varol et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">2010</xref>). Also, efficiency measures based on energy and exergy have been proposed and applied for various TESs (Rosen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2011</xref>; Dincer and Rosen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2012</xref>; Rezaie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2015</xref>; Li <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR500">2016</xref>), including cold storage (Rosen and Dincer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2009</xref>). The main methods have been reviewed for modeling and assessing performance of stratified thermal storage (Njoku et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2014</xref>). Further, techno-economic assessments of heat and cold thermal storage systems have been applied, often using advanced methods like exergoeconomics (economics based on <italic>exergy</italic>) (Rosen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2011</xref>; Mosaffa and Garousi Farshi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2016</xref>). The economics of thermal storage systems in conjunction with cogeneration, trigeneration and DE have also been the subject of numerous investigations (Rentizelas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2009</xref>; Lozano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2010</xref>; Balli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2010</xref>; Dominković et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2015</xref>), including thermoeconomic analyses (Balli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2010</xref>) and economic optimization of designs (Lozano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2010</xref>).</p><p id="Par24">Appropriate thermal storage utilization can also support the concept of “zero peak communities,” which are communities or subdivisions that do not contribute to the utility system peak (Christian et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2007</xref>), providing a powerful tool in demand-side management programs (Arteconi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2012</xref>). By reducing peak loads, such communities can assist electric utilities in providing affordable and reliable electric power and in enhancing environmental stewardship and sustainable development. Community-level seasonal storage can also facilitate the development of “net-zero energy buildings” (NZEB) and communities, with net-zero average annual energy consumption at both the building and neighborhood levels, and yield efficiency, economic and environmental benefits. Much research is currently being carried out on energy design and operation concepts to drive them toward such targets. These include applications, field trials and concepts of innovative systems that will improve energy efficiency and integration of renewable technologies in buildings. For example, much research effort by the Smart Net-Zero Energy Building Research Network (SNEBRN) in Canada (SNEBRN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2015</xref>) is dedicated to developing concepts and designs in a combination of systems and technologies, including short-term and seasonal thermal storage (Desgrosseilliers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2013</xref>; Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2012</xref>; Rad et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2013</xref>; Koohi-Fayegh and Rosen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2014</xref>; Eslami-nejad and Bernier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2013</xref>; Dickinson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2013</xref>) along with heat pump systems, combined heat and power technologies, integrated solar systems, high-performance windows and smart controls, that are suited to Canadian climatic conditions and construction practices to design smart net-zero energy buildings and to influence long-term national policies on their future development.</p><p id="Par25">Optimization methods have also been applied to air-conditioning using ice storage (Sanaye and Shirazi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2013</xref>) and stratified thermal storages (Schütz et al. 2015; Jack and Wrobel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2009</xref>) and to operating modes for seasonal underground thermal storages (Zhao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">2008</xref>).

Also, sustainability assessments of community systems, incorporating case studies and simulations, have been recently carried out considering exergy and environmental factors (Solberg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2010</xref>). Furthermore, improving the sustainability and environmental performance of energy systems, through the utilization of thermal storage in conjunction with cogeneration, trigeneration and DE, has been the motivation behind much research focusing on environmental emissions and impacts such as climate change (Rentizelas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2009</xref>; Balli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Integration with energy systems</title><p id="Par27">Modeling and optimization methods have been developed and employed for a wide range of district energy (DE), cogeneration and trigeneration systems (Réveillèrea et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2013</xref>; (Dominković et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2015</xref>; Lozano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2009b</xref>; Erdem et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2010</xref>; Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">2015</xref>; Mago et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2009</xref>; Mancarella <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2014</xref>), which often are integral to community energy systems. Included in many of these studies are examinations of the most advantageous role of energy storage (Rong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2008</xref>) and advances in that technology (Lund et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2014</xref>), as well as specialized integrated applications (Chacartegui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2009</xref>; Lai and Hui <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2010</xref>). This includes determining for such systems the most viable and optimal scale (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">2015</xref>; Chicco and Mancarella <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2009a</xref>; Badami and Portoraro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2009</xref>; Kavvadias et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2010</xref>), the required level of flexibility (Lai and Hui <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2009</xref>) and appropriate operation strategies (Kavvadias et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2010</xref>). Also, optimization methods have been applied to the operation and structure of cogeneration-based district heating with long-term thermal storage (Tveit et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2009</xref>). Many recent studies have focused on alternative and sustainable energy sources, including biomass (Rentizelas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2009</xref>; Dominković et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2015</xref>), while others have focused on the development of improved technologies for waste heat recovery (Cui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2015</xref>) and trigeneration and DE (IEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2009</xref>) considering diesel engines (Balli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2010</xref>), micro-gas turbines with steam ejector refrigeration (Ameri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2010</xref>), advanced heat pumps (Mancarella <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2009</xref>), fuel cells (Al-Sulaiman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2010</xref>; Malico et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2009</xref>), liquid desiccant cooling systems (Badami and Portoraro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2009</xref>) and distributed multi-generation (Chicco and Mancarella <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2009b</xref>). The significant knowledge gaps for integrating optimally thermal storage with cogeneration, trigeneration and DE, and the need to use <italic>exergy</italic> in such research, have been recognized by the International Energy Agency, which over the last decade has commissioned several annexes to investigate and implement systems incorporating cogeneration, trigeneration, district heating and cooling, and thermal storage (Lozano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2010</xref>; IEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2009</xref>). For instance, a guidebook on low-exergy systems for high-performance buildings and communities was recently released (IEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2010</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Needs and Priorities in System Research and Design</title><p id="Par28">The use of community-level seasonal storage has not received a great deal of attention in the past, but has become increasingly of interest in recent years. The appropriate utilization of community-level thermal storage can yield benefits in terms of efficiency, economics, environmental impact, etc. But many issues exist that need to be resolved to allow optimal solutions to be attained. In this section, general needs and priority areas are identified and described.</p><sec id="Sec12"><title>General needs</title><p id="Par29">Numerous needs exist in a variety of areas related to STES for community-level applications:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par30"><italic>Single versus multiple storage.</italic> The scale and number of thermal storages in a community need to be better assessed. Some efforts have focused on single storages scaled to a size appropriate for a given community, while others have focused on multiple smaller storages appropriately located throughout the community. Although smaller storages tend to have higher thermal energy losses due to higher surface area to volume ratios, other efficiency advantages of multiple storages in community settings can make the decision to develop multiple storages advantageous.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par31"><italic>Short</italic>-<italic>term versus midterm versus long</italic>-<italic>term storage.</italic> The appropriate time duration capacities of thermal storages in a community need to be determined. Long-term storage (based on seasonal or annual storage cycles) is preferred for some community energy systems, while short-term (diurnal) and midterm (weekly) thermal storages are appropriate for other community applications. Sometimes, a combination of short-, medium- and long-term storage is required to yield the most benefits from community energy systems. This is observed at some existing community energy systems. For example, the Drake Landing Solar Community in Okotoks, Alberta, uses a combination of seasonal ground-based storage with short-term liquid storage tanks.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par32"><italic>Sensible versus latent energy storage.</italic> The type of thermal storage(s) in a community energy system needs to be better analyzed and identified. Some systems benefit from utilizing sensible storages, while others benefit from the use of latent or thermochemical storages. There are also systems that may benefit from using a combination of these types. Although the combined use of thermal energy storage types has proved to be beneficial compared to single-type use in some cases [e.g., tank/PCM in a concentrating solar collector system (Bhale et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2015</xref>) or packed bed/PCM (Geissbühler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2016</xref>; Zavattoni et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">2015</xref>)], few studies are reported in the literature on the combined use of sensible and latent thermal storage systems. Moreover, there is a need for studies that focus on optimization of combined use of these storage types for various energy systems and energy storage needs.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par33">Developments are needed in seasonal storage technology and systems themselves, in terms of factors such as efficiency, reliability, economics, environmental impact and others, so as to achieve optimal performance of community energy system applications.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par34">Research is needed to quantify the most appropriate TES parameters for the optimal integration of thermal energy users (buildings), thermal energy suppliers and thermal grids.

Determination of new concepts, and the appropriate scale and number of thermal storages, time duration capacities (long-, mid- and short-term) and storage types (sensible, latent, thermochemical) is also needed for community-level seasonal storage in varied settings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Development of new configurations for community-level seasonal storage</title><p id="Par39">There is a need for new configurations for community-level seasonal storage, taking into account the storage and the community in which it is located and operates. Development of such configurations is dependent not only on the community-level seasonal storage system type, but also on both the nature and characteristics of the community and its buildings (e.g., industrial, commercial and residential) (Heier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2015</xref>; Flynn and Siren <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2015</xref>) as well as type of energy supplies available (e.g., conventional, renewable and waste recovery).</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Enhancement of the integration of seasonal TES into communities and their buildings</title><p id="Par40">The integration of STES storage schemes into communities and their buildings needs to be enhanced. This requires quantification of the most appropriate thermal storage parameters for the optimal integration of thermal energy users (i.e., buildings), thermal energy suppliers and thermal grids/networks. This need also encompasses improvement in understanding of the appropriate integration of thermal storage into communities that have numerous buildings for a wide range of energy technologies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Development of appropriate tools for modeling, simulation, analysis, improvement, design and optimization</title><p id="Par41">Appropriate tools for the above tasks need to be developed, and existing tools need to be enhanced and/or extended, while ensuring that they enable appropriate modeling, simulation, analysis, improvement, design and optimization of community-level seasonal storage. Several tools have already been proposed or reviewed for the evaluation and design of integrated energy components including seasonal energy storage and energy supplies for the community (Guadalfajara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2014</xref>; Orehounig et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2014</xref>). The tools are expected to have at least three main capabilities:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par42"><italic>Modeling and simulation</italic>. Improved seasonal thermal storage models will be developed to assist predictions of performance and behavior of seasonal thermal storage in the context of overall community energy systems. The aim will be to better predict the behaviors of thermal storages when integrated into complex systems and, as a consequence, better predict the performance and behavior of the broader community energy systems. For instance, ground-based thermal storages are proving increasingly advantageous for seasonal applications, leading to a significant need to develop advanced methods for predicting ground heat transfer for a wide range of in-ground technology, systems and applications.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par43"><italic>Analysis and design</italic>. Advanced methods will be developed for improving understanding of the efficiencies and losses for seasonal energy storage systems and community systems that incorporate them.

Furthermore, these methods will be applied to improve designs and configurations of seasonal thermal storages for community applications.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par44"><italic>Optimization and improvement</italic>. Research will be undertaken to ascertain the most appropriate seasonal thermal storage systems for community applications, as well as for the most advantageous integration of the storage systems into communities. Factors such as efficiency, economics and environmental impact will be considered. It is pointed out that environmental impact will be examined from two perspectives: the environmental benefits achieved through the use of the thermal storage systems as well as the environmental impacts caused by implementing such storages (e.g., the impact on ecosystems of heat flows away from an underground storage). Appropriate optimization schemes will be developed and applied.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par45">In addition, it would be helpful for models to consider not just deterministic effects, but also stochastic factors. Accounting for the impact of stochastic elements on TES modeling and optimization would help improve their accuracy and realism. Some work has been done in this field. For instance, the stochastic control of thermal storage-enabled demand response from flexible district energy systems has been investigated (Kitapbayev et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2015</xref>), as has the stochastic risk-averse coordinated scheduling of grid integrated energy storage units in transmission constrained wind-thermal systems (Hemmati et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2016</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Expected Outcomes from Addressing Needs</title><p id="Par46">If the needs identified in the previous section are addressed, several significant and important outcomes are likely to accrue:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par47">Improved and/or optimal thermal storage technology and systems for community-level seasonal storage, in terms of efficiency, reliability, economics and environmental impact, and for a variety of settings.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par48">Improved configurations for community-level seasonal storage that account for community and building characteristics as well as available energy supplies.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par49">Enhanced schemes for integrating seasonal storage into communities and their buildings, for a wide range of technology and settings.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par50">Enhanced tools for modeling, simulation, analysis, improvement, design and optimization, for community-level seasonal storage.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par51">The status of community-level seasonal storage suggests that the technology is working, but that room exists to optimize such systems.
