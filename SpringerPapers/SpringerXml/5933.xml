To improve plant productivity in BLSS, the quality of the solar spectrum can be modified by lightweight, luminescent films. CuInS<sub>2</sub>/ZnS quantum dot (QD) films were used to down-convert ultraviolet/blue photons to red emissions centered at 600 and 660 nm, resulting in increased biomass accumulation in red romaine lettuce. All plant growth parameters, except for spectral quality, were uniform across three production environments. Lettuce grown under the 600 and 660 nm-emitting QD films respectively increased edible dry mass (13 and 9%), edible fresh mass (11% each), and total leaf area (8 and 13%) compared with under a control film containing no QDs. Spectral modifications by the luminescent QD films improved photosynthetic efficiency in lettuce and could enhance productivity in greenhouses on Earth, or in space where, further conversion is expected from greater availability of ultraviolet photons.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Parrish et al. demonstrate the modification of an incoming solar spectrum through downconversion of high energy UV/blue photons into orange/red photons using luminescent quantum dot films, leading to improved growth of leaf vegetables.

For resilience against these threats, producers of vegetable crops have turned to controlled environment agriculture (CEA) as a solution. CEA affords crop production with the highest resource use efficiency (RUE), and exceeds the annual per-area yield of field agriculture tenfold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. This greater productivity results from optimized environmental controls, year-round production, and reduced pests and diseases. Furthermore, recirculating hydroponic plant nutrient delivery systems recycle water for greatest RUE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The 400–700 nm waveband of the electromagnetic spectrum primarily powering photosynthesis is referred to as photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The amount of PAR photons a plant receives is quantified by the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD, μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), which is the number of photosynthetically active photons per unit area per second. The PPFD a plant receives in a 24 h day is measured as the daily light integral (DLI, mol m<sup>−2</sup> d<sup>−1</sup>) and is directly proportional to the rate of plant growth, which is subsequently determined as biomass accumulation. While PPFD and DLI are important plant growth parameters for characterizing plant development, they ignore spectral quality differences of radiation received by the plant.</p><p id="Par5">Spectral quality is an important growth parameter since the efficiency of photosynthesis is dependent on the wavelength of the photon absorbed by the plant. The wavelength-dependent photosynthetic efficiency can be determined by the photosynthetic quantum yield (QY), a measure of the production of oxygen or consumption of carbon dioxide, for various crops<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The photosynthetic action spectrum compares the relative photosynthetic QY per wavelength, and indicates that wavelengths between 575 and 675 nm are ~30% more efficient for photosynthesis than photons in the blue waveband (400–500 nm).</p><p id="Par6">Several recent studies about light spectra effects on plant growth have determined that both light quantity and quality affected plant morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Using a broad-spectrum light source to grow plants outperformed monochromatic light treatments, but modifying the relative percentages of different wavelengths produced varied and improved results. For example, the sensitivity of seven plant species to blue and green light with a daylight-equivalent 500 µmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> PPFD reduced dry mass in tomatoes, cucumbers, and peppers when blue light was increased between 11% and 28% of the total spectrum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. At 200 µmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> PPFD, tomatoes continued to be negatively affected, where dry mass was reduced by 41%, while no difference was observed in peppers or cucumbers. These results illustrated the importance of spectral quality for influencing plant response, particularly in high light intensity environments, and suggest that there are optimal spectra for different plant species.</p><p id="Par7">CEA food production is particularly advantageous in extreme environments, like outer space, where regular access to fresh vegetables is impractical. NASA and other space agencies are developing CEA systems for crewed space applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, which range from growth chambers with light-emitting diode (LED)-based lighting to drive photosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, to deployable greenhouses that could utilize sunlight for photosynthesis, like the Prototype Mars-Lunar Greenhouse (MLGH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">Until recently, only limited options have been available commercially for controlling the quality of light for greenhouse crop production besides expensive and energy-intensive electrical lighting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Furthermore, artificial lighting requires relatively heavy electrical equipment to deploy, operate, and maintain, which limits applications for extended space missions. Photoselective films, which filter out certain wavelengths have been used to modify the solar spectrum, but these materials always reduce light intensity, and may not be suitable for light-limited geographic locations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Therefore, technologies that improve light quality without increasing energy demand, excessive physical mass, deployment challenges, or expense, would be beneficial for terrestrial horticulture and are required for space applications where these constraints are even greater. Previous work on luminescent agriculture films have used organic fluorophores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> or other fluorescent materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> to modify the solar spectrum without electricity, however these materials have been limited to only specific wavelength emissions, have poor photon conversion efficiencies, and/or suffer from stability issues. Therefore, quantum dots should be considered as an alternative fluorescent material due to their high photon conversion efficiency, tunable emission spectrum and improved stability compared to fluorescent organic dyes.</p><p id="Par9">Quantum dots (QDs) have been utilized for a variety of applied technologies, including remote phosphors for displays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, solid-state lighting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, solar harvesting electricity generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, cancer detection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, and even for studying pollination habits of bees<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In this study, CuInS<sub>2</sub>/ZnS (CIS/ZnS) QDs are incorporated into a film to down-convert UV and blue photons to orange and red photons. Compared with other QD compositions, CIS/ZnS QDs have unique optical properties: a size-tunable PL emission, a very high PL QY, and a broad-spectrum emission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. For QDs in general, a broad emission is generally associated with a dispersion of QD sizes or compositions in an ensemble and typically result in lower conversion efficiencies due to an unoptimized synthesis procedure, but for CIS/ZnS this is a result of a defect-mediated emission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Additionally, CIS/ZnS QDs exhibit a large Stokes shift, allowing for absorption in the UV and blue (see Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">19</xref>) while emitting in the red or orange, which minimizes PAR self-absorption and shifts the spectrum to more photosynthetically efficient wavelengths.</p><p id="Par10">Here, an approach is presented that incorporates luminescent CIS/ZnS QDs into flexible luminescent agriculture films to passively modify the solar spectrum. Repeated experiments on Lactuca sativa L. (cv. “Outredgeous” red romaine lettuce) were conducted within a semi-closed plant growth system including QD films, which increased edible dry and fresh biomass as well as total leaf area compared with a control film. These modified spectra improved light quality for photosynthesis and thereby enhanced the photosynthetic efficiency and productivity of crops grown in CEA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Spectral control with CIS/ZnS QD films</title><p id="Par11">Two different QD films were manufactured, with peak emissions centered at 600 nm (orange, O-QD) and 660 nm (red, R-QD).

Film performance remained stable throughout the study, where the statistically significant spectral shift for both QD-film treatments compared to the control treatment were equivalent after each experiment (see Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">20</xref>).</p><p id="Par15">To ensure differences in production solely resulted from spectral differences due to the QD films, the light intensity incident upon each film was ensured to be uniform (see Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">4</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">1</xref> for more information). While the difference between PPFD values measured under the C and O-QD films were within 3%, PPFD under the R-QD film the PPFD was 12% lower than that of the control film. This lower value was attributed to a portion of the R-QD emission extending beyond 700 nm, which is outside the PAR range, and therefore was not measured by the quantum sensor. This is illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">d</xref>, where normalized emission spectra of the R-QD and O-QD films, respectively, indicated only 4.6% of the emission spectrum from O-QD film was beyond PAR (&gt;700 nm), but 28.3% of the emission from the R-QD film did not contribute to PPFD. Therefore, even if the total number of incident photons was held constant for the three treatment areas, the measured PPFD incident upon the plants is always lower for the R-QD film compared to the other light treatments. The concentration of QDs in the O-QD and the R-QD films were similar and designed to ensure similar overall absorption of the metal-halide (MH) light source.

The photosynthetic efficiency of the plants was improved because of the different light quality from the QD films, under which more biomass was produced per mol of photons than under the Control film. For vegetative growth in light-limiting environments, when DLI is reduced, the biomass accumulation is linearly reduced for most crops<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par20">In these plant experiments, however, this degree of linearity was not observed for the R-QD treatment. Even with a reduction in DLI of 12% under the R-QD film, statistically significant increases were observed in edible DM, FM, and TLA. Thus, the light use efficiency (LUE, g mol<sup>−1</sup>) was greater under the R-QD film, which directly correlates with the photosynthetic efficiency of the plant. The LUE was calculated by dividing the grams of fresh or dry mass produced per day by the DLI (see Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">3</xref>). Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> illustrates how the R-QD film and O-QD films exhibited an improved LUE compared with the Control.

This equates to a +5.2% increase for the O-QD film and only a −6% reduction under the R-QD film compared with the control. Interestingly, the increased intensity under the O-QD film for the new photosynthetically active radiation range (400–750 nm), as defined by ref. 32<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, correlated well with the LUE improvement for the O-QD treatment.

To estimate these benefits, a simple model described below was employed.</p><p id="Par22">First, the absorption spectrum of the O-QD and R-QD films (see Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">19</xref>) was used to calculate the percentage of absorbed photon flux for both terrestrial and extraterrestrial locations.

As a first approximation, the following assumptions were included: (1) the QY of the films was 100%, (2) the emission spectrum of the QDs was fully within the PAR region (400–700 nm), and (3) all emitted photons were directed toward the plants. Considering these assumptions, the net change in PAR would simply be the addition of the absorbed UV photon flux density that is converted into PL, since the converted blue and green photons to PL would remain within PAR under these assumptions. However, loss mechanisms present in a real system are unaccounted under these assumptions and therefore must be considered to obtain a more realistic estimate. The first loss mechanism to consider is the QY of the QD films not being 100%. In this case, both QD films had a measured PL QY of 85%. Second, due to the isotropic PL emission, it can be assumed that ~25% of the PL would not be absorbed by the plants due to PL emission in the opposite direction. Third, as mentioned previously, there are portions of the emission spectrum for both QD films that extended beyond the PAR region and thus wouldn’t contribute to PAR. Including these three loss mechanisms, the estimated net difference in PPFD contributions were calculated for the O-QD and R-QD films under both the AM 1.0 and AM 1.5 solar spectra.

For the AM 1.5 spectrum, neither of the films would be expected to improve PPFD, with respective decreases of −1.6% and −5% under the O-QD and R-QD films. Comparing the net ΔPPFD for the QD films under AM 1.0 and AM 1.5 solar spectra shows that there would be a relative improvement of +4.2% in PPFD for the O-QD film and +2.6% relative improvement in PPFD for the R-QD film under the AM 1.0 spectrum.</p><p id="Par25">From these calculations, it can be concluded that for both solar spectra the net PPFD would be expected to decrease under the R-QD film, but a potential net increase in PPFD under the O-QD film would be expected for the AM 1.0 spectra. For the AM 1.5 spectra, a slight reduction in PPFD would still be expected for the O-QD film due to inherent losses in the system and to less UV light availability for shifting into PAR. For vegetative growth in light-limiting environments, biomass accumulation is positively correlated with DLI, generally in a linear trend<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, If we assume 1% DLI improves yield by 0.8% for lettuce<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, the estimated additional benefit for crop production in space applications would be 3.4% and 2.1% for the O-QD and R-QD films, respectively, due to converting more UV photons. This would be in addition to the observed increased production due to spectral quality shown in these plant experiments. For terrestrial applications, a net increase in PPFD would not be expected under either QD film; therefore, improved production would only be expected from spectral quality.</p><p id="Par26">It is noteworthy that the AM 1.0 spectrum used in these calculations was taken from the ASTM standard ASTME-490, which is based on irradiance measurements made by satellites and other equipment, and relates to the intensity at approximately the distance of Earth to the Sun<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. In space missions, such as to the Moon or Mars, the intensity would be reduced by ~1/<italic>d</italic><sup>2</sup>, where <italic>d</italic> is the distance from Earth to the new location and could be further reduced by a different atmosphere. Since the Moon has no atmosphere and it orbits the Earth, a reduction in available PPFD would not be expected. However, in a location like Mars, the intensity would be reduced to ~1/3 of the AM 1.0 spectrum measured at Earth, due to Mars being ~1.5× farther from the Sun and having an atmosphere, which further reduces the UV portion by an additional ~4%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Since ~39% more PPFD is available under an AM 1.0 spectrum (measured at Earth) compared with the AM 1.5 spectrum, this would partially make up for the PAR reduction at Mars, but an overall reduction in PPFD compared with terrestrial applications would be expected. In spaceflight, crewed missions could integrate QDs into spacecraft crop production systems as remote phosphors for electrical lamps or to modify optically waveguided light transmission from a connected solar concentrator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. These considerations further demonstrate the importance of maximizing the LUE for the plants, as the intensity of sunlight would continue to drop as crewed space missions expand farther out into the solar system.</p><p id="Par27">In summary, this work introduced and demonstrated the benefits of a luminescent film technology enabled by CIS/ZnS QDs to improve spectral quality for plant growth. The edible DM under the O-QD and R-QD films was increased by +13% and +9%, respectively, and the edible FM was increased by +10% under both films. The TLA was also improved under the O-QD and R-QD films by +8% and +13%, respectively. These results clearly indicate that lettuce grown under the QD films exhibited more efficient growth than lettuce grown under the Control film, despite a DLI reduction of 12% under the R-QD film. This is supported by LUE calculations, where the DM was 18% greater under the R-QD film and 6% greater under the O-QD film. Finally, a mathematical model was implemented to estimate crop yield improvements under QD films when deployed in the AM 1.0 solar spectrum in space. The plant production improvements from these QD films would potentially increase crop yields in CEA cultivation on Earth, and, due to their relative light weight and small form factor, would be beneficial for long-duration crewed space missions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Plant growth test chamber design and operation</title><p id="Par28">Lettuce plant responses to the modified spectrum of light provided by the QD films were determined within a custom-built PGTC.
