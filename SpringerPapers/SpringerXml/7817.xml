High-density frustrated Lewis pairs consisting of low-valence Lewis acid Nb and Lewis base Nb-OH are fabricated on lamellar Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> through a thermal-reduction promoted phase-transition process. Benefitting from the planar atomic arrangement of lamellar Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, the frustrated Lewis pairs sites are highly exposed and accessible to reactants, which results in a superior methane conversion rate of 1456 μmol g<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> for photocatalytic non-oxidative methane coupling without the assistance of noble metals. The time-dependent DFT calculation demonstrates the photo-induced electron transfer from LA to LB sites enhances their intensities in a concerted way, promoting the C-H cleavage through the coupling of LA and LB.

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">In recent years, widespread interest has been aroused in converting methane into high value-added chemicals through photocatalytic oxidative or non-oxidative way, which can not only promote the development of clean energy but also effectively achieve the purpose of environmental protection by consuming greenhouse gases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Researchers have used various strategies to improve the efficiency of photocatalytic methane conversion, such as introducing other auxiliary oxidants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, heat-assisted photoreaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, and improving the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, the photocatalytic methane conversion efficiency is still commonly low, especially for the non-oxidative methane coupling (NOCM) reaction due to the much easier photocatalyst deactivation in the absence of oxidants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, which however is more desirable considering the high carbon-atom efficiency and less CO<sub>2</sub> emission. Precious metals have been extensively used for methane activation due to the flexibly tunable geometric and electronic properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, which however generally face the problems of high cost, easy aggregation, and uncontrollable dehydrogenation. To date, there is still a lack of an efficient strategy for substantially promoting non-oxidative methane conversion over semiconductors without the assistance of noble metals.</p><p id="Par4">A strong polarization environment is the prerequisite for efficient C-H activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. However, the polarization sites based on adjacent lattice atoms of semiconductor photocatalysts are generally incompetent to activate the C-H bond according to the previously reported low conversion rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP) composed of a sterically encumbered Lewis acid (LA) and Lewis base (LB) pair has flexibly tunable distance and unquenched intensity of LA and LB. Currently, FLP sites have been constructed over defective metal oxides and hydroxides such as CeO<sub>2,</sub> TiO<sub>2,</sub> and In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>–<sub>x</sub>(OH)<sub>y</sub> through doping or defect-engineering strategy, which are efficient in promoting water splitting and CO<sub>2</sub> reduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. It has theoretically proven that FLP can help activate the C-H bond of methane but the efficient practical catalyst has been rarely reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. We have recently tried to utilize coupled LA and LB on metal-doped reduced TiO<sub>2</sub> for promoting the photocatalytic NOCM, which however fails to break the records achieved by noble metal-containing systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. The inconsistency between the theoretic calculation and practical activity should be attributed to the failure to construct abundant and easily accessible FLP sites during the catalyst preparation. For examples, the FLP formed via doping may be restricted by the doping content; the common undulating surface structure of metal oxides may cause high steric hindrance for producing neighbored but unquenched LA and LB sites. The difficulty of constructing high-density FLP lies in the formation of abundant neighbored but unquenched LA and LB with comparable surface concentrations.</p><p id="Par5">In this work, a thermal-reduction promoted phase-transition strategy is utilized to construct high-density FLP sites on Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> composed of low-valence Nb (LA site) and Nb-OH (LB site) that are spatially separated by oxygen vacancy (Vo). The promoted phase transition at low temperatures allows the preservation of Nb-OH while producing abundant Vo, successfully resulting in a high concentration of FLP. A remarkable methane conversion rate of 1456 μmol g<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> for NOCM reaction is achieved under light irradiation. The combination of spectroscopic and photoelectronic analyses and theoretic calculation reveals the extraordinary activity attributed to the high accessibility of LA and LB on lamellar Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> with photo-enhanced intensity for synergetic C-H activation. This work provides guidance for the rational design and construction of photocatalysts in a highly polarized environment for efficient methane conversion under atmospheric pressure and without additional heating.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Phase transitions and defect construction</title><p id="Par6">Herein, lamellar Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> with the planar atomic arrangement was selected to construct FLP, which is supposed to reduce the steric hindrance for methane adsorption. Defects are considered to be the key to constructing FLP. Since Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> has diverse crystal phases, the structural distortion and atomic dislocation caused by phase transformation may provide an opportunity to establish abundant defective sites. However, the crystal phase transformation of Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> usually relies on high calcination temperature, which may cause severe dehydroxylation, decreasing the possibility to form coupled LA and LB. Therefore, thermal hydrogenation treatment was adopted to promote the phase transformation at lower temperatures considering the efficiency in producing defect sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, using NaBH<sub>4</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> as reductants, respectively. The phase structure was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>. The pristine Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> displays an orthorhombic phase (T-phase). The (0 0 1) and (1 0 1) planes of T-phase Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> (JCPDS 30-0873) correspond to main peaks at 2θ ≈ 22.6° and 28.3° <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. When annealed with NaBH<sub>4</sub>, the transformation from T-phase to M-phase (JCPDS No. 72-1484) was initiated at a low temperature of 673 K (673K-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) as characterized by the appearance of a new peak at 2θ ≈ 32.2°, accompanied by the gradual disappearing peak at 2θ ≈ 28.3° <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. The phase transformation continues with the increasing reduction temperature but the complete phase transformation does not occur even at 973 K (973K-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), although the characteristic peaks of the T-phase become obviously weak. All the NaBH<sub>4</sub>-treated Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> samples show a mixture of dominated T-phase and accompanied M-phase. The positions and intensity of peaks changed along with the phase transformation, which demonstrates the inter-planar change and lattice distortion. In contrast, the phase transformation does not start in the H<sub>2</sub> atmosphere even at a high temperature of 873 K (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>), demonstrating NaBH<sub>4</sub> is more efficient for inducing phase transformation.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Crystal structure and defect analysis.</title><p><bold>a</bold> XRD patterns of Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> samples. <bold>b</bold> HRTEM image of 873K-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>.

The specific surface area (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>) of the Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> powder is around 13~15 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>−1</sup>. The lattice distortion is verified by high-resolution TEM (HRTEM, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The lattice fringes of 0.39 nm and 0.26 nm ascribe to the (0 0 1) planes of T-phase and (2 5 0) planes of M-phase, and obvious lattice distortion fringes are observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. As an evaluation of these structural distinctions, the average crystallite size, dislocation density, and other structural properties were further calculated based on the XRD results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> shows that the dislocation density and strain of Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> increase along with the reduction temperature and reach a maximum of 873 K. The dislocation density affords information about the density of structural defects, and strain provides the messages of crystal deformation. Compared with the H<sub>2</sub>-treated sample, the higher value of NaBH<sub>4</sub>-treated Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> indicates the increased concentration of structural defects due to the formation of mixed phases. The increased lattice strain implies a decrease in the crystal size and stronger lattice distortion. The orthorhombic cell (a = 6.144(2) Å, b = 29.194(3) Å, c = 3.940(4) Å, space group: <italic>Pbam</italic>) was chosen to fit the lattice parameters from XRD results. Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref> shows the pristine Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>-treated Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> is a relatively standard orthorhombic unit cell; the a-axis and c-axis of the NaBH<sub>4</sub>-treated Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> gradually increase after the various calcination temperature, while the b-axis is significantly shortened. The 873K-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> possesses the maximum deformation of the unit cell, which is consistent with the results of the unit cell strain as calculated above. The above results confirm that during the process of severe lattice stretching and twisting, abundant defects are more possible to generate.</p><p id="Par8">The refined elements X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) were further used for analyzing the effect of thermal reduction on the electronic state of Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. The refined O 1 s XPS spectra of 873K-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> exhibit a much higher peak at 531.3 eV corresponding to oxygen vacancy (Vo) sites than that of H<sub>2</sub>-treated Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> at the same temperature (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, d</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). It is also noted the peak of hydroxyl groups centered at 532.0 eV is significantly improved for 873K-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, which is confirmed by the FTIR analysis as characterized by the broad stretching vibration bands around 3415 cm<sup>−1</sup> and bending vibration bands around 1648 cm<sup>−1</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). The XPS peak of hydroxyl groups decreases with the further increasing of calcination temperature (973K-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). Together with the XRD results, the structure distortion and atomic dislocation of sample 873K-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> from the low-temperature phase transition should result in the simultaneous formation of surface Vo and hydroxyl groups. On the other hand, the EPR analysis indicates that although the signal at g = 2.004 attributed to Vo is improved from the thermal reduction compared with Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>), sample 873K-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> with the most distorted crystal structure exhibits a lower signal of Vo compared with H<sub>2</sub>-treated counterpart (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). It is known EPR is only applicable to the detection of single-electron occupied species, so the discrepancy between the EPR and XPS analyses regarding the Vo content should be ascribed to the formation of less single-electron occupied Vo in 873K-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, The most distorted sample of 873K-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> has the highest contents of Vo and hydroxyl groups according to the XPS and FTIR (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>), suggesting that the formation of less single-electron occupied Vo in 873K-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> should be related to the concomitant formation of hydroxyl groups. Moreover, the refined Nb 3d XPS spectra indicate 873K-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> has a higher content of low-valence Nb (Nb<sub>LV</sub>) than that of H<sub>2</sub>-treated Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, which should be attributed to the Nb neighboring Vo (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>). It is thus postulated that hydroxyl groups should help promote the electron delocalization from Vo to neighboring Nb, forming more low-valent Nb in sample 873K-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. The above speculation about the interaction with Vo and hydroxyl groups will be corroborated later by combining with other analytic techniques and DFT calculations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Photocatalytic performance</title><p id="Par9">The photocatalytic NOCM activity of Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> samples was evaluated under light irradiation with a 300 W Xe lamp.

However, there is no obvious difference among different NaBH<sub>4</sub>-treated Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> samples with similar absorption bands, which suggests that the spectroscopic and photoelectric properties are not the main reason for the enhanced NOCM. This result is accordant with the significantly decreased activity of 873K-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> in the visible light region, confirming the enhanced photocatalytic NOCM activity is not only caused by the expanded light absorption.</p><p id="Par14">Infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine (Py-IR) was further used to understand the contribution of surface functional groups.

By combining the results of Nb-OH based on XPS and FTIR, Lewis acid and base sites should co-exist on the surface of NaBH<sub>4</sub>-treated Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. To understand their effect on methane activation, pyridine and pyrrole were applied to quench the acidic and basic sites, which lead to significantly decreased activity for different samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>), demonstrating the coupling between the LA and LB sites during NOCM reaction. To verify the effect of site quenching, CH<sub>4</sub>-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) measurement was carried out to explain the affinity of acid and base site toward methane molecule and the trend of catalytic activities (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref>). The broad desorption bands can be observed in the CH<sub>4</sub>-TPD profiles of different catalysts. The wide gas desorption peaks at the middle temperature range (200–400 °C) correspond to chemical adsorption. Except for 873K-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, most of the methane desorbs in a main peak around 250 °C, and a trace amount desorbs around 330 °C. While the chemical desorption peak area in the higher temperature range increases significantly as compared with 873K-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, indicating that more CH<sub>4</sub> is firmly adsorbed on the surface with FLP sites by chemisorption. The additional peak around 400 °C indicates double sites can further enhance the CH<sub>4</sub> adsorption capacity through increasing the binding strength for CH<sub>4</sub>. The desorption yield of methane from 873K-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> is evidently higher than that from sample only with Vo site or sample 873K-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> with quenched acid/base sites. This trend of the amount of adsorbed methane was well matched with the trend of the methane activation after site quench shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>, suggesting that methane adsorption behavior should be closely related to methane activation. It is thus speculated that the coupling between the LA and LB sites enables Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> to continuously activate the C-H bond with refreshed active sites.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Structural Analysis for verification of FLP sites</title><p id="Par15">X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was further used to finely explore the local structure of reduced Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. The X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) features of Nb species formed under different reduction conditions are exhibited in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">16</xref>. Generally, heavy elements like Nb species with weak internal transitions result in weak pre-edge peaks in the XANES. Besides, the majority of Nb sites with octahedral structures in the T-phase and M-phase would reduce the s-d transition intensity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. The Nb in all samples presents a higher oxidation state than the reference sample of Nb foil, and the average valence of Nb gradually decreases with the increasing reduction temperature as evidenced by the edge shift to lower energy. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) oscillations of the Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> samples exhibit a shoulder peak at 5.6 Å<sup>−1</sup> after reduction treatment (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">17</xref>). The gradually increasing shoulder peak indicates the severe disarrangements of the Nb local structure during the phase transformation. The rapid fall to low-frequency oscillations on the reduced samples proves the static disorder of atoms around niobium. The rapid decline of oscillations frequency results in a broad low-r peak in the Fourier-transformed EXAFS (FT-EXAFS) spectra (Fig.<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig"> 3a</xref>). Niobium oxide has a highly asymmetric crystal structure and a wide range of Nb-O bond lengths, which creates beats lowering the amplitude of the total signal in the <italic>R</italic>-space and increasing the difficulty of the fitting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. The low crystalline symmetry of T-phase and M-phase Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> creates destructive interference of the backscattered electron waves, leading to non-defined peaks. FT-EXAFS exhibits the average distribution of atoms around Nb atoms in different samples, and the distortion and transformation of crystal phase with rearrangement of atoms result in the average changes reflected in <italic>R</italic>-space.

The direct comparison between H<sub>2</sub>-treated Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> and pristine Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> reveals a similar average Nb-O distance.

The complex peaks, gradually appearing in 2.5-4 Å with the increasing reduction temperature, reveals the Nb-Nb interaction.

The H<sub>2</sub>-treated Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> possesses the lowest CN among all the samples; according to its similar Nb-O distance with that of pristine Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, the formation of Vo does not cause significant atomic dislocation. The lowest CN of 873K-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> among NaBH<sub>4</sub>-treated samples is attributed to the combined effect of plentiful Vo and severe lattice dislocation. Considering asymmetry and distortion in the crystal structure of NaBH<sub>4</sub>-treated Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, and the wide Nb-O distance distribution range, as few paths as possible were chosen to investigate the overall situation of the first coordination shell. The fitting results only represent the average atomic arrangement environment in the sample. Although the fitting results show a simplified average coordination environment, it is supposed that the effect of the reduction treatment on the average Nb-O path can be reflected by fitting. For the cases of pristine and H<sub>2</sub>-treated Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, representative fits can be achieved through one average Nb-O path, while the complex situation of NaBH<sub>4</sub>-treated Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> requires one shorter Nb-O path together with a longer Nb-O path (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">18</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>), confirming the lattice distortion from NaBH<sub>4</sub> treatment. To explicitly understand the origin of the longer Nb-O path, the ratio of surface hydroxyl groups is plotted versus the ratio of fitted longer Nb-O path (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">19</xref>). It is clear that the NaBH<sub>4</sub> treatment results in a more significant increase of long Nb-O distance than hydroxyls. Specifically, the percentage of long Nb-O distance increases by about 30% for 673K-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, 773K-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5,</sub> and 973K-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, while that of the hydroxyl increase for less than 10%, which demonstrates the long Nb-O distance is mainly caused by the structure distortion in these samples. In comparison, 873K-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> shows a further increase of long Nb-O distance and hydroxyl group with a more comparable percentage, which suggests the contribution from hydroxyl to the long-distance Nb-O bond is improved in 873K-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>.</p><p id="Par17">Meanwhile, NH<sub>3</sub>-TPD was further used to reveal the effect of calcination temperature on the acidic characteristics of NaBH<sub>4</sub>-treated Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). The pristine T-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> has negligible acid sites for NH<sub>3</sub> adsorption, while all samples treated with NaBH<sub>4</sub> show two distinct peaks above 600 <sup>o</sup>C attributed to strong acid sites. The H<sub>2</sub>-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> only shows a less intense peak at the lower temperature, suggesting a weaker acidity. The relation between the reduction temperature and acidity is confirmed by pyridine-FTIR (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14</xref>). Through peak fitting of NH<sub>3</sub>-TPD spectra (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">15</xref>), it seems that sample 873K-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> with the most distorted structure has the highest concentration of acid sites. It is also noted the acidity trend of NaBH<sub>4</sub>-treated Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> is accordant with the change of Vo concentration. NH<sub>3</sub>-TPD was also used to verify the quenching of acid sites through pyridine treatment. The results prove that the strongly acidic sites are indeed covered since the adsorption capacity of the sample for ammonia decreases significantly (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">20</xref>), which is accordant with the CH<sub>4</sub>-TPD results. Considering the appearance of Nb<sub>LV</sub> neighboring Vo from the NaBH<sub>4</sub> reduction according to Nb 3d XPS spectra (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>), the Nb<sub>LV</sub> species with unpaired electron is supposed to function as Lewis acid. Meanwhile, sample 873K-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> shows a comparable increased percentage of Vo and hydroxyls (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>), while the other samples have a more obvious increase of Vo. Combining the results from EPR and XPS that the electronic properties of Vo in 873K-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> are altered due to the existence of surface hydroxyl groups, the close correlation between the increased percentages of Nb-OH and Vo in 873K-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> suggests Nb-OH should be a concomitant near Vo. Through the above mutual verification between acidic sites and surface defect groups, it can be known that Nb<sub>LV</sub> can be used as LA sites, and the adjacent hydroxyl groups can be used as LB sites. It is speculated the adjacent but separated Nb<sub>LV</sub> and Nb-OH cooperate to promote C-H activation in the way of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs), where LA and LB are spatially separated with unquenched acidity and basicity. The function mechanism of unquenched LA and LB pairs will be analyzed and discussed in detail in the theoretical calculation section below.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Theoretical calculation</title><p id="Par18">The DFT calculation was carried out to verify the existence of FLP composed of Nb<sub>LV</sub> and Nb-OH and explore its relation with methane activation.

The charge redistribution due to the formation of FLP sites lead to the non-single electron signature at the oxygen vacancies in NaBH<sub>4</sub>-treated Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, and the decrease in signal intensity present in EPR. Although the single LA site is highly accessible, the ability to stretch the C-H bond is comparatively weak. The single LB Nb-OH sites are more efficient than single LA sites for hydrogen abstraction. However, methane cannot be sufficiently polarized due to the lack of charge compensation effects of the single active site. In contrast, all the LA-LB pairs can enhance the ability to activate the C-H bond and abstract hydrogen through charge compensation between LA and LB sites (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">19</xref>, Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>, and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">24a–e</xref>).</p><p id="Par21">Transition state (TS) calculations for hydrogen abstraction at different sites further approve that FLP sites are thermodynamically favorable for methane activation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d–f</xref>).

It is less thermodynamically and kinetically favorable for a single LA or LB site to activate the methane process. In addition, the TS calculation also proves the synergistic effect of LA and LB sites in FLP. Both transition states of FLP and LB sites feature that the C-H bond is stretched to a sufficient degree.

For the Vo-Nb<sup>1</sup>-O-Nb<sup>3</sup>-OH model, the spatial changes of bond lengths and angles in GS and ES are limited. The surface structure is not significantly affected by light, which means the influence of photoexcitation on the hydrogen extraction process is based on the tuning of the electron density rather than the distortion of the surface structure.

The unique lattice structure of lamellar Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> with planar atomic arrangement allows the abundant hydroxyl groups and Nb<sub>LV</sub> to form high-density FLP in the way of Nb<sub>LV</sub>-Vo-Nb-OH with high accessibility to reactants. The combination of theoretical calculation and quenching experiments for LA/LB sites reveals the synergy between LA and LB is the key to promoting C-H stretching. The effect of light on strengthening LA and LB intensity through electron transition from LA to LB is revealed through TD-DFT, which results in a high methane conversion rate of 1456 μmol g<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> for NOCM reaction. Non-oxidative coupling as a model reaction is beneficial to explicitly understanding the relationship between methane activation and light irradiation. Constructing a polarized environment should also be conducive to the improvement of the activity in other methane conversion reactions, such as methane dry reforming and methane steam reforming. This research demonstrates the principle of constructing a polarization environment for photocatalytic C-H activation of methane, providing a new perspective on the structural design of efficient photocatalysts for methane conversion without the assistance of precious metals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Preparation of catalysts</title><p id="Par27">The pristine T-Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> material was synthesized by recrystallization of commercial niobium pentoxide.
