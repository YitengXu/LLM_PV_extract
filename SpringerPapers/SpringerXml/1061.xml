The highest efficiency OPV at present use low-bandgap donor polymers, many of which suffer from problems with stability and synthetic scalability. They also rely on fullerene-based acceptors, which themselves have issues with cost, stability and limited spectral absorption. Here we present a new non-fullerene acceptor that has been specifically designed to give improved performance alongside the wide bandgap donor poly(3-hexylthiophene), a polymer with significantly better prospects for commercial OPV due to its relative scalability and stability. Thanks to the well-matched optoelectronic and morphological properties of these materials, efficiencies of 6.4% are achieved which is the highest reported for fullerene-free P3HT devices. In addition, dramatically improved air stability is demonstrated relative to other high-efficiency OPV, showing the excellent potential of this new material combination for future technological applications.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">In organic photovoltaics, the best performing devices usually involve low-bandgap polymers whose limited solubility and stability constrain the scalability of organic solar cells.

photovoltaics (OPV) has been increasing rapidly, with the development of new high-performing benzodithiophene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and difluorobenzothiadiazole<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> -based donor polymers in particular that give up to 10% power conversion efficiency (PCE) combined with fullerene acceptors in single junction cells, and over 11% PCE in tandem devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, fullerene-free OPV has also been advancing, driven by the need to find alternative acceptors that overcome the high synthetic costs, limited optical absorption, poor bandgap tunability and morphological instability of fullerene-based acceptors such as phenyl-C<sub>61</sub>-butyric acid methyl ester (PC<sub>60</sub>BM) and its C<sub>71</sub> analogue PC<sub>70</sub>BM (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>). Multiple reports of efficiencies over 6% have now been published with acceptors based on fused ring diimide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> structures. However, the majority of these record efficiencies are achieved with low-bandgap donor–acceptor polymers such as polythieno[3,4-b]-thiophene-<italic>alt</italic>-benzodithiophene (PTB7), which are known to present intrinsic difficulties to scale-up (thereby increasing costs) as well as suffering from issues with solubility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, device irreproducibility and photochemical instability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, the simple homo-polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), one of the most extensively used and best understood polymers in OPV research for some time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, is relatively stable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and readily scalable due to its straightforward synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and compatibility with high-throughput production techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Indeed, P3HT is currently one of the only polymers available in quantities over 10 kg (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>), making it one of the few feasible candidates for commercial OPV, and its use in large-area, roll-to-roll printed solar cells has already been widely demonstrated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the semi-crystalline nature of P3HT, compared with more amorphous polymers, is almost unique in setting an appropriate morphology lengthscale for bulk heterojunction OPV from a range of solvents and processing conditions, as well as providing it with good charge transport properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Despite this, P3HT has been somewhat marginalized in recent years since the introduction of higher efficiency donor–acceptor polymers. For P3HT:PC<sub>60</sub>BM devices, the average efficiency is only around 3% (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>), with a maximum efficiency of 7.4% reported with the more expensive fullerene indene-C<sub>60</sub>-bisadduct (ICBA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. We recently published a new non-fullerene acceptor called (5<italic>Z</italic>,5′<italic>Z</italic>)-5,5′-{(9,9-dioctyl-9<italic>H</italic>-fluorene-2,7-diyl)bis[2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-7,4-diyl(<italic>Z</italic>)methylylidene]}bis(3-ethyl-2-thioxo-1,3-thiazolidin-4-one) (FBR) that had a straightforward and scalable synthesis and gave 4.1% PCE in P3HT devices, which at the time of writing was the highest reported efficiency for a fullerene-free device with P3HT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. However, the short-circuit current (<italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub>) in these devices was limited by recombination losses arising from the highly intermixed donor and acceptor phases, with FBR apparently unable to aggregate enough to form pure domains that would provide an appropriate charge percolation pathway. In addition, the large extent of spectral overlap of FBR with P3HT and lack of long-wavelength absorption reduced the ability to harvest photons across the spectrum, further limiting the generated photocurrent.</p><p id="Par4">We now present a new acceptor derivative that has been designed to address both the spectral overlap and morphological issues with FBR via replacement of the fluorene core with an indacenodithiophene unit. This has the effect of planarizing the molecular structure and thus significantly red-shifting the absorption as well as increasing the tendency to crystallize on length scales commensurate with charge separation and extraction. We show how these properties can be further tuned via side-chain engineering, with linear (<italic>n</italic>-octyl) alkyl chains yielding a more crystalline material with a further red-shifted absorption onset relative to branched (2-ethylhexyl) chains, resulting in higher <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub> and PCE. Power conversion efficiencies of up to 6.4% were achieved, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest reported for fullerene-free P3HT solar cells. The oxidative stability of these devices is also found to be superior to the benchmark P3HT:PC<sub>60</sub>BM devices, as well as devices with several of the high-performance polymers tested alongside, demonstrating this to be a robust and highly promising new materials combination for OPV.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Physical properties</title><p id="Par5">The structure of the new IDTBR acceptors is shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>. The indacenodithiophene (IDT) core was synthesized according to literature procedures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> and alkylated using either linear <italic>n</italic>-octyl (O-IDTBR) or branched 2-ethylhexyl (EH-IDTBR) side chains as shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. Stille coupling of the stannylated IDT with 7-bromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4-carboxaldehyde was then followed by Knoevenagel condensation with 3-ethylrhodanine to give O-IDTBR and EH-IDTBR in 60% and 30% final yields, respectively. The acceptors are both stable up to 350 °C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1011">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>) and highly soluble in common organic solvents such as chloroform at room temperature, as well as non-halogenated solvents such as <italic>o</italic>-xylene (60 °C), enabling facile solution processing of OPV devices. In the case of FBR, a torsional angle of 33.7° was calculated between the fluorene core and the adjacent benzothiadiazole unit by density functional theory (DFT) methods. By contrast, IDTBR was calculated to be essentially planar (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>) due to the increased quinoidal character of the phenyl-thienyl bond compared with the phenyl–phenyl bond, and the reduced steric twisting from adjacent α-C–H bonds on the coupled phenyl rings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. This enhanced planarity increases conjugation which, when combined with the more electron-rich thiophene-based core, acts to raise the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). This is manifested in a significantly red-shifted UV–visible (UV–vis) absorption spectrum relative to that of FBR. Furthermore, whereas the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of FBR was localized on the periphery of the molecule, the increased conjugation of IDTBR allows for slightly more delocalization of the LUMO across the central unit (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1011">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), which may be beneficial in terms of molecular oscillator strength and therefore molar absorption coefficient. However, the LUMO of IDTBR is still predominantly located on the periphery of the molecule, which was an important feature in the molecular design as it allows the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital to be tuned by changing the central unit while preserving the relatively high-lying LUMO energy and thus maintaining a high open-circuit voltage.

One of the design principles of IDTBR was therefore to increase the planarity of the backbone in order to induce crystallization and the formation of pure acceptor domains. Specular X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to compare the crystallinity of the acceptors in films that were slightly thicker than those used in device fabrication (280–290 nm) in order to provide enough resolution to observe crystalline reflections by this method. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1011">Supplementary Figs 7 and 8</xref> show that, while FBR showed no sign of crystallinity in this case even with annealing, both O-IDTBR and EH-IDTBR give strong diffraction peaks. A clear increase in crystalline order is observed for O-IDTBR after annealing, in accordance with the red-shifted UV–vis absorption. From differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) it is apparent that, during the first heating cycle, O-IDTBR undergoes an exothermic crystallization transition with an onset temperature of 108 °C and <italic>T</italic><sub>c</sub> of 115 °C. No such thermally induced crystallization occurs during the heating cycle of EH-IDTBR, explaining the different optical response of the acceptors to thermal annealing. DSC measurements were also carried out on drop-cast blends of the acceptors with P3HT to determine the extent of crystallization within the blend. The blend of FBR:P3HT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1011">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>) shows only the melting endotherm for P3HT upon heating, which has been depressed (by 20 °C) and broadened due to the disruption in packing caused by the acceptor; however, no transition for the acceptor is observed which indicates a lack of pure acceptor domains in this blend. By contrast, the heating cycles of O-IDTBR and EH-IDTBR blends with P3HT show the endothermic (and exothermic, in the case of O-IDTBR) transitions from the acceptor as well as the P3HT melt transition, demonstrating that these acceptors are more able to crystallize in the blend than FBR. Furthermore, the melting temperature of P3HT is only depressed by 10 °C in the IDTBR blends, at the same heating rate, suggesting that the crystallization of P3HT is less disrupted by these acceptors.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Morphology of acceptors and IDTBR:P3HT blends.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) 2D GIXRD of O-IDTBR; (<bold>b</bold>) 2D GIXRD of O-IDTBR:P3HT (1:1); (<bold>c</bold>) DSC first heating cycles of O-IDTBR, P3HT and 1:1 blend; (<bold>d</bold>) 2D GIXRD of EH-IDTBR thin film; (<bold>e</bold>); 2D GIXRD of EH-IDTBR:P3HT (1:1); and (<bold>f</bold>) DSC first heating cycles of EH-IDTBR, P3HT and 1:1 blend.

This peak does not correspond to any features seen in the diffraction pattern of neat EH-IDTBR, suggesting that in the presence of P3HT, EH-IDTBR crystallizes in a different orientation or a different polymorph than in neat form, although the diffraction data is not complete enough to allow us to distinguish between these two hypotheses.

The O-IDTBR:P3HT blend shows slightly higher charge-carrier density (which is the integrated area of the photo-CELIV curve at 1 μs delay time) than the branched chain analogue system. In addition to photo-CELIV, the electron mobility of EH-IDTBR:P3HT and O-IDTBR:P3HT blends was determined by space charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements on electron-only devices as well as the hole mobility of EH-IDTBR:P3HT blends on hole-only devices.

It can be seen that the PL quenching is reasonably efficient for both systems, suggesting efficient hole transfer from acceptor excitons to the P3HT donor polymer. Qualitatively it can be seen that the PLQE is slightly larger for the linear compared with the branched chain system, which further affirms that the increased film crystallinity of O-IDTBR allows for the formation of pure acceptor domains on a lengthscale comparable to the exciton diffusion length of O-IDTBR.

Only a small fraction (10–20%) of the polaron generation appears to occur within our instrument response. This contrasts with FBR:P3HT blends, where at least 50% of polaron generation was observed to be instrument response limited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, consistent with more complete phase segregation compared with FBR. Slower polaron formation and exciton decay is observed for O-IDTBR:P3HT (60–120 ps), indicating more delayed polaron generation for this blend which is consistent with our PLQE results. We have previously reported relatively slow (hundreds of picoseconds) polaron generation from acceptor excitons in polymer:PCBM blends, and correlated these with exciton diffusion within pure PCBM domains to the donor/acceptor interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. It appears likely that the slow polaron generation kinetics we observe herein are also limited by the kinetics of exciton diffusion within pure IDTBR domains, with the slower kinetics observed for O-IDTBR being consistent with increased phase separation for this blend as discussed above. Charge recombination is also apparent in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> as a decay of the polaron signal at longer time delays. It is apparent that these kinetics are slower for O-IDTBR compared with EH-IDTBR, again most probably associated with great phase segregation in the O-IDTBR blend.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Charge generation and recombination dynamics of IDTBR:P3HT blends.</title><p>Rise and decay of photogenerated EH-IDTBR and O-IDTBR polaron absorption, obtained by deconvolution of the ultrafast transient absorption spectra of the EH-IDTBR:P3HT and O-IDTBR:P3HT blend films excited at 680 nm, 2 μJ cm<sup>−2</sup>.

For many of the record high efficiencies reported with low-bandgap polymers, all device fabrication and measurement must be carried out in inert conditions to maintain this performance. By contrast, the efficiencies reported herein for IDTBR:P3HT were obtained with device processing and measurement carried out in air (except for active layer annealing in a nitrogen glovebox). This improved stability is partially attributed to the inverted architecture used, which means that no encapsulation steps are needed for these devices. To further investigate the stability of IDTBR:P3HT devices to air, aging measurements were carried out alongside reference devices of PC<sub>60</sub>BM:P3HT as well as three of the most widely reported high-efficiency polymers PTB7, PCE-10 (PTB7-Th) and PCE-11 (PffBT4T-2OD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> For a fair comparison, all devices were prepared in the same inverted architecture as for IDTBR devices. After the initial (stabilized PCE) measurement was taken, devices were stored in the dark under ambient conditions between measurements, which were taken at intervals over the course of 1,200 h. The corresponding PCE data is shown in <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, with normalized data given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1011">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref> along with the polymer structures. It is clear from this data that O-IDTBR:P3HT devices demonstrate the least degradation out of the materials studied, and that after an initial small drop in performance within the first 60 h, the PCE remains relatively stable and still gives 73% of the initial PCE even after 1,200 h. By contrast, the efficiency of the high-performance donor polymer devices deteriorates remarkably quickly and has fallen to zero by the end of the period of study. This further demonstrates the potential of our new acceptor design for stable, scalable solar cells with practical operating lifetimes, and also gives strong support for the choice of P3HT as donor polymer in these devices.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Solar cell stability.</title><p>Oxidative stability of O-IDTBR:P3HT device efficiencies (PCE) compared with other high-performance polymer:fullerene systems.

One of the main issues with fullerene-based acceptors like PC<sub>60</sub>BM is that large-scale aggregates and crystals emerge from the meta-stable blend morphology over time. This process can be monitored by polarized optical microscopy during accelerated aging of the films upon annealing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. To compare the thermal aging of the IDTBR blends with fullerene blends, films of O-IDTBR:P3HT and PC<sub>60</sub>BM:P3HT were prepared on ZnO/ITO substrates and these were subjected to annealing at 140 °C for 1 h. As the micrographs in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1011">Supplementary Fig. 15</xref> show, large (1–20 μm) aggregates appear after 1 h annealing of the fullerene blend, whereas the O-IDTBR blend remains smooth and featureless after annealing, suggesting that this new acceptor offers improved morphological stability over fullerene acceptors, at least in terms of lateral diffusion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par19">In this work, we present a new small molecule electron acceptor IDTBR that is based on an indacenodithiophene core with benzothiadiazole and rhodanine flanking groups. IDTBR is designed to give high performance with the donor polymer P3HT, chosen for its commercial scale-up potential both in terms of cost, scalability and stability. In comparison with our previously published acceptor FBR, which had an essentially overlapping absorption profile with P3HT, this new acceptor has a significantly reduced optical bandgap owing to the more planar molecular backbone, delocalized electronic structure and push–pull molecular orbital hybridization, resulting in a UV–vis absorption profile that is now highly complementary to that of P3HT. This gives broader photon harvesting across the incident solar spectrum within the active layer, which is reflected in higher short-circuit currents and power conversion efficiencies relative to FBR:P3HT devices. Furthermore, the absorption onset of this new IDTBR acceptor can be tuned by judicial choice of solubilizing alkyl chains on the IDT unit. Linear (O-IDTBR) chains promote stronger intermolecular packing, which is particularly enhanced by thermal annealing, relative to branched (EH-IDTBR) chains. One effect of this is to further red-shift the absorption of O-IDTBR relative to the branched counterpart, which results in a broader EQE profile, higher <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub> and an increase in PCE from 6.0 to 6.4%. CE measurements at the same light intensity reveal a reduced electronic bandgap for O-IDTBR relative to EH-IDTBR, which explains the difference in <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> measured for these devices. As well as affecting the optoelectronic properties, the enhanced intermolecular interactions of the linear alkyl chain also have an effect on the blend morphology. Relative to FBR, both IDTBR acceptors exhibit increased crystallinity and, crucially, formation of pure acceptor domains as evidenced by GIXRD and DSC studies. O-IDTBR in particular shows pronounced crystal packing upon annealing, which is consistent with the reduced optical bandgap. This results in greater phase segregation for the linear analogue which is manifested in reduced PL quenching of the acceptor emission, as well as a delayed polaron generation and slower recombination dynamics in the O-IDTBR:P3HT blend. Interestingly, the charge-carrier mobilities measured for the IDTBR:P3HT blends appear quite low, considering the reasonably high FFs obtained from devices (up to 64%) and the charge recombination dynamics of these systems therefore warrant further investigation to determine whether non-geminate recombination is significantly suppressed. In addition to high efficiencies, IDTBR:P3HT devices demonstrate improved stability in ambient conditions compared with the benchmark PC<sub>60</sub>BM:P3HT device, as well as several systems with typical low-bandgap, high-performance polymers, which were found to degrade at a dramatic rate when exposed to air. IDTBR devices also showed improved morphological stability to fullerene devices in accelerated aging studies. These results strongly supports the use of P3HT, in conjunction with non-fullerene acceptors such as IDTBR, for high-efficiency, scalable and stable OPV for future technological applications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>General characterization</title><p id="Par20"><sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra were collected on a Bruker AV-400 spectrometer at 298 K and are reported in p.p.m. UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded on a UV-1601 Shimadzu UV–vis spectrometer.

Current transients were recorded across an internal 50 Ω resistor on an oscilloscope (Agilent Technologies DSO-X 2024A). A fast electrical switch was used to isolate the cell and prevent CE or sweep out during the laser pulse and the delay time. After a variable delay time, a linear extraction ramp was applied via a function generator. The ramp, which was 20 μs long and 2 V in amplitude, was set to start with an offset matching the <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> of the cell for each delay time.

Spectra were measured using a steady state spectrofluorimeter (Horiba Jobin Yvon, Spex Fluoromax 1). The spin-coated films were excited at 680 nm. Sub-picosecond TAS was carried out at 800 nm laser pulse (1 kHz, 90 fs) by using a Solstice (Newport Corporation) Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier. A part of the laser pulse was used to generate the pump laser at 680 nm, 2 μJ cm<sup>−2</sup> with a TOPAS-Prime (light conversion) optical parametric amplifier. The other laser output was used to generate the probe light in near visible continuum (450–800 nm) by a sapphire crystal. The spectra and decays were obtained by a HELIOS transient absorption spectrometer (450–1,450 nm) and decays to 6 ns. The samples were measured in N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. Deconvolution of the blend spectra was conducted by fitting the singlet EH-IDTBR exciton spectrum (S<sub>exciton</sub>) and the P3HT:EH-IDTBR polaron spectrum (S<sub>polaron</sub>) at 6 ns to the blend spectra for 20 different time delays using the equation:<disp-formula id="Equ6"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2016_Article_BFncomms11585_Equ6_HTML.gif"/></disp-formula></p><p id="Par40">where <italic>A</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>A</italic><sub>2</sub> are linear coefficients that estimate the percentage contribution of the spectra to the experimental blend spectra. <italic>S</italic><sub>exciton</sub> was derived from the transient absorption spectra of the EH-IDTBR, which peaks at 1,150 nm at selected time delays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1011">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>).
