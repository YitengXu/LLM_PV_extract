organisms capable to perform photosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. They can be found in all biological ecosystems and are typically grown in controlled bioreactors to use light for CO<sub>2</sub> fixation into organic biomass and valuable bioproducts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Despite their potential, industrial application of microalgae is limited by physiological and technical constrains that reduce the economic feasibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Improving microalgae cultivation is a multivariable challenge that includes strain selection and optimization of cultivation process design, which can partially be addressed by improved light energy utilization for biomass and biomolecules production.</p><p id="Par5">Oxygenic photosynthesis is carried out by four multi-subunit membrane–protein complexes in the thylakoid membrane: Photosystem I and II (PSI and PSII), cytochrome b6f and ATPase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Each photosystem is composed by a core complex connected to an array of antenna complexes that increase their light harvesting properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Both antenna and core complexes include several protein subunits that binds pigments as chlorophylls (Chl) a, b and carotenoids. Light absorption by both photosystems fuels the electron transport from O<sub>2</sub> to NADPH. This electron transport is mediated by several electron carriers coupling electron transfer with proton pumping from the stroma to the lumen, generating a transmembrane ΔpH gradient used by the ATP synthase enzyme to produce ATP. When light intensity is too high and electron transport is saturated, the photochemical quenching of Chl excited states is impaired, increasing the probability to generate Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). Because of its strong oxidizing potentials, ROS induce damage in their local environment by destroying lipids, nucleic acids and proteins yielding into widespread oxidation and reducing biomass accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Microalgae have different protection mechanisms for excess light energy such as regulation of cellular pigments contents, reorganization of photosystems, redistribution of antenna proteins between PSI and PSII (state transitions) or accumulation of antioxidant molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Short term photoprotective mechanisms such as thermal dissipation of the excitation energy absorbed in excess in a complex process called non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] can further assist in fluctuating light conditions. NPQ is activated by ΔpH on the thylakoid membrane and work as feedback-regulatory mechanism for excitation energy transfer to reaction centres. In <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, two LHC proteins, LHCSR1 and LHCSR3, were reported to have a key role in NPQ induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The accumulation of both isoforms is depended on the light regime with LHCSR1 present also in low light while LHCSR3 mainly accumulated in high light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">These native protection mechanisms are efficient in avoiding photodamage and increase fitness in natural ecosystems but are not tailored to achieve maximal biomass accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, microalgae cultivation in artificial bioreactors is typically different from natural conditions. In industrially relevant cultivation systems, high cell densities are required often exposed to strong continuous illumination to maximize biomass production. Moreover, algal growth is inhibited by constantly changing irradiances due to the steep gradient in light intensity applied from outside of the bioreactor, where cells rapidly move between layers of low and high light, which increases the risk of cellular photodamage. Strategies directed at enhancing the resistance of microalgae to oxidative stress could likely increase their productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Carotenoids, present in all photosynthetic organisms, where they play crucial roles in photosynthesis and photoprotection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. They are involved in photosystem assembly and light harvesting, contribute to the antioxidant network of the chloroplast, and detoxify ROS generated by photosynthesis preventing lipid peroxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In the case of <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> carotenes as β-carotene and α-carotene and xanthophylls as lutein, loroxanthin, zeaxanthin, violaxanthin and neoxanthin are involved in the photosynthetic process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The stoichiometry of different carotenoids and their specific binding site to photosynthetic complex complexes are conserved in a wide range of taxa from microalgae to crops plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Despite this conserved distribution, in other species of algae different types of carotenoids can found. Diatoms and multicellular brown algae accumulate xanthophylls fucoxanthin, diadinoxanthin and diatoxanthin while some species of microalgae accumulate ketocarotenoids, like astaxanthin. Ketocarotenoids show a higher antioxidant capacity with respect to the carotenes and xanthophylls normally accumulating in green microalgae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. They are obtained by β-carotene ketolase (BKT, named also crtW) activity that catalyses the addition of a keto-group at the C4 position of carotenoids β-rings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The most studied ketocarotenoids is astaxanthin that is synthetized adding a keto-group on both rings of zeaxanthin. Due to this carbonyl group this pigment has an antioxidant activity 10 times stronger than zeaxanthin and β-carotene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Higher plants and most microalgae do not possess the carotene ketolase activity and consequently do not synthesize ketocarotenoids. The most prominent source of astaxanthin is fresh-water microalgae <italic>Haematococcus lacustris</italic> which can accumulate astaxanthin up to 5% of its dry weight during hematocyst formation upon exposure to stress conditions such as excessive light, nutrient starvation, high salinity or high/low temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. <italic>H. lacustris</italic> cysts exhibited higher photoprotection capacity and resistance to pigment photobleaching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Although the genome of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> harbours the genetic information for BKT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], its expression is limited to diploid zygospore stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Recently, synthetic redesign of this gene enabled its constitutive overexpression and robust accumulation of ketocarotenoids in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In this work, we investigated the effect of astaxanthin accumulation in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> and characterized resistance to oxidative stress and photoinhibition. Engineered <italic>bkt</italic> strains, were able to accumulate ketocarotenoids as their most abundant carotenoids in their thylakoids, demonstrated a higher resistance to photodamage and an improved performance in high light with respect to wild type. Remarkably, growth of <italic>C. reinhardtii bkt</italic> outcompeted the fast-growing green algae <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> in high light conditions. These results demonstrate that inducing astaxanthin accumulation in microalgae could be a successful strategy to improve biomass accumulation in advanced microalgae cultivations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par9">Generation of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> strains overexpressing BKT enzyme, herein named <italic>bkt</italic> strains, was described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In summary, <italic>Cr</italic>BKT was redesigned in silico, optimizing the amino acids (aa) codon usage, spreading of the RuBisCO small subunit II (RBCS2) intron 1 sequence to minimize exon lengths and increase transgene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and removal of a redundant 116 aa-long C-terminal sequence extension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> strain UVM4 was previously engineered to enable robust protein production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and was used for <italic>Cr</italic>BKT expression. Among the transformant lines generated, <italic>bkt5</italic> strain was selected for the experiments herein described, being one of the strains with the higher rate of ketocarotenoids production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In all experiments presented in this study, <italic>bkt5</italic> was used as ketocarotenoid-accumulating strain while UVM4 served as a parental control.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Pigments accumulation and composition of photosynthetic apparatus</title><p id="Par10">To study the physiologic effect of ketocarotenoids accumulation in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, UVM4 and <italic>bkt5</italic> strains were grown photoautotrophically in high-salt (HS) medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] at two different light intensities: control (CL, 100 μmol photons/m<sup>2</sup>/s) and high light (HL, 600 μmol photons/m<sup>2</sup>/s). Pigments were extracted and analysed by spectral absorbance and HPLC (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Table S1). <italic>bkt5</italic> strain accumulated a high amount of ketocarotenoids, accounting for more than 50% of total carotenoids in CL and 59% in HL. In particular, a production of 0.26 ± 0.03 and 0.37 ± 0.06 mg/L of astaxanthin at the end of the growth, respectively, for cells grown in CL and HL were achieved, in line with previous finding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The change in carotenoids composition affected the Chl content in the <italic>bkt5</italic>, with a 30% decrease in Chl content per cell in CL. In HL, both UVM4 and <italic>bkt5</italic> strains reduced their Chl content per cell, but the differences in terms of Chl content were stronger compared to the CL case, with a ~ 50% decrease in <italic>bkt5</italic> compared to UVM4. Total carotenoids content was also reduced in <italic>bkt5</italic> compared to the UVM4 case in CL and HL, respectively, with a 20% and 30% decrease. Chl a/Chl b and Chl/Car ratios were also significantly reduced in <italic>bkt5</italic> compared to UVM4 in both CL and HL conditions: since Chl b is bound only by antenna subunits reduced Chl a/b ratio indicate that <italic>bkt5</italic> had a different reorganization of the photosynthetic apparatus compared to the UVM4. Chl/Car ratios are reduced in HL compared to CL in both strains, in line with the higher carotenogenesis at strong irradiance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], and further reduced in <italic>bkt5</italic>. HPLC analysis confirmed that ketocarotenoids were present in <italic>bkt5</italic> but not in the UVM4 (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Table S2). Astaxanthin biosynthesis starts from β carotene or zeaxanthin generating a series of different intermediate ketocarotenoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In <italic>bkt5</italic> astaxanthin was the main carotenoid accumulated but other ketocarotenoids intermediates as canthaxanthin, adonirubin, adonixanthin and hydroxyechinenone were also detected at lower contents. In HL <italic>bkt5</italic> was characterized by a general increase of ketocarotenoid content, with the strongest increase observed in the case of canthaxanthin (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Table S2). Other than ketocarotenoids, in <italic>bkt5</italic> there was a relative decrease of all the carotenoids normally present in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> with the strongest effect observed in the case of β-β xanthophylls as neoxanthin and violaxanthin.</p><p id="Par11">The change in pigment composition in <italic>bkt5</italic> compared to UVM4 suggests a possible a reorganization of photosynthetic complexes. Composition of the photosynthetic apparatus was analysed by solubilization of thylakoid membranes with dodecyl‐α‐d‐maltoside and ultracentrifugation in sucrose gradients (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In UVM4, different green bands were recovered and identified by absorption spectra; from top to bottom, the bands corresponded to free pigments (b1), LHC protein in monomeric state (b2), trimeric LHCII (b3), PSII core complex (b4) and PSI‐LHCI (b5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In <italic>bkt5</italic> strain b1 band was highly enriched in carotenoids and there was an additional upper band (b0) composed of ~ 90% of ketocarotenoids (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Figure S1). Monomeric LHC fraction (b2) was more abundant than trimeric LHC (b3) in <italic>bkt5</italic>, while the opposite was observed in the case of UVM4, suggesting a destabilization of LHCII trimers upon accumulation of ketocarotenoids. PSII core and PSI fractions (b4 and b5) were reduced in <italic>bkt5</italic> compared to UVM4, in line with Chl a/Chl b reduction observed upon ketocarotenoids accumulation (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Table S1). The absorption spectra of the different fractions isolated from <italic>bkt5</italic> strain were characterized by a shoulder around 530 nm which is related to astaxanthin and ketocarotenoids absorption (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Distribution of pigment-binding complexes. <bold>A</bold> Ultracentrifugation in sucrose gradients of UVM4 and <italic>bkt5</italic> solubilized thylakoids isolated from cells adapted in HL. <bold>B</bold>–<bold>G</bold> Native absorption spectra of the different fraction; b0 and b1 were normalized to the maximal absorption, b2–b5 were normalized to absorption peak in the 600–740 nm region</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13068_2022_2173_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par12">The HPLC analysis of the fractions of the <italic>bkt5</italic> gradient allowed studying ketocarotenoids distribution (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Figure S1).

Moreover, Chl/Car ratios were decreased in both CL and HL conditions indicating, respectively, a ~ 17% and  ~ 20% increase in total carotenoids accumulation on a Chl basis (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Table S1, Table S2). It is important to note that overall pigment content per cell in <italic>bkt5</italic> was reduced, with a decrease in both Chl and carotenoid accumulation on a cell basis (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Table S1). However, the increased carotenoids content per Chl implies an increased availability of carotenoids as photoprotective agent for the Chl accumulated in the thylakoid membranes. The altered carotenoids composition with ketocarotenoids partially substituting xanthophylls and carotenes (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Figure S1) destabilizes the photosynthetic complexes affecting mainly the trimerization state of LHCII, PSII core and PSI (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The PSII core complex was more affected by the alteration in carotenoids: in <italic>bkt5</italic> the accumulation of PSII complexes was greatly impaired while the assembly of PSI was less sensitive to carotenoid availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The lack of appropriate carotenoids could result in a reduced efficiency in PSII assembly. Ketocarotenoids were found distributed throughout the overall fractions in sucrose gradient which could be related to contamination due to high accumulation of astaxanthin in the thylakoids. Alternatively, partial substitution of xanthophylls and carotenes by ketocarotenoids cannot be excluded, but the binding of these carotenoids to photosynthetic complexes need further work to be verified. It is likely that the molecular structure of astaxanthin (e.g., carboxylation of β-rings) does not fit with photosynthetic proteins or that their interaction is weaker than endogenous xanthophylls and it is disrupted by detergent solubilization. Accordingly, the distribution of the astaxanthin in thylakoid membranes (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Figure S1A) showed that the main part of the ketocarotenoid was not bound to the photosynthetic complexes but free in the membranes. Similar consequences were also observed in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and tobacco plants engineered to accumulate astaxanthin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. In the case of <italic>H. lacustris</italic>, astaxanthin is mainly accumulated outside the chloroplast, but even in this case the small fraction of this ketocarotenoid detected in the plastids is mainly free in the thylakoid membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">The changes in carotenoids composition and partial destabilization of the photosynthetic complexes affect the photosynthetic performance in <italic>bkt5</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The Fv/Fm was reduced in <italic>bkt5</italic> by ~ 18% while, upon exposure to actinic lights, ΦPSII, ETR and 1-qL were reduced at 100 μmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). However, the reduced PSII efficiency had almost negligible effect on the growth of <italic>bkt5</italic> at this light intensity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). This discrepancy between the negative impact of BKT expression on photosynthetic parameters at low light and comparable biomass productivity for <italic>bkt5</italic> and UVM4 strains under autotrophic or mixotrophic conditions, could be explained with the “pale” phenotype of <italic>bkt5</italic>. Decreasing the chlorophyll content of microalgae cells is a strategy successfully applied to increase solar energy conversion efficiency enhancing light penetration inside algal culture and minimizing feedback energy dissipation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. As reported in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Figure S9, the reduction of both Chl and carotenoids per cell content in <italic>bkt5</italic> caused a slightly enhanced penetration of blue and red light<italic>,</italic> possibly compensating the reduced efficiency of the PSII, even if this speculation requires further evidences to be supported. We cannot even exclude that the reduced penetration of the 500–560 nm wavelengths in <italic>bkt5</italic> culture might contribute to some extent to the increased photoresistance of this strain, involving some signal transmission pattern related to some specific photoreceptors as channel rhodopsins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], which perceives light at these wavelengths. At higher irradiances, PSI and PSII photosynthetic parameters as ΦPSI, ΦPSII, ETR and ETR<sub>PSI</sub>, were similar or even higher in <italic>bkt5</italic> compared to UVM4. Moreover, the photosynthetic rate, measured as oxygen evolution, showed a higher <italic>P</italic><sub>max</sub> and a higher half-saturation intensity (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Table S3). These results indicate that the negative effect on the stability of photosynthetic complexes was compensated by an increased resistance to high light. Accordingly, the biomass productivity was strongly enhanced in <italic>bkt5</italic> when grown at 3000 μmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> either in autotrophy or in mixotrophy (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). This effect is particularly evident from growth curves and productivity of the second cycles of growth when the cell were already exposed to high illumination and ketocarotenoid content was increased (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>E, F). Moreover, <italic>bkt5</italic> outcompeted its parental strain when competitively co-cultured in the same photobioreactor (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Surprisingly, <italic>bkt5</italic> strain was able to become dominant even in a competition test with <italic>C. vulgaris</italic>, one of the green alga species more considered for industrial application due its fast-growing phenotype (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).</p><p id="Par25">These results were quite surprising since in land plant expressing BKT, there were no reported evidence for an increased productivity while in some cases the transgenic plant showed a hampered growth compared to the control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. This is likely related to the simple structure of unicellular organism like microalgae that can cope better with the severe changes in carotenoids composition. It is interesting to note that even in the case of astaxanthin-rich <italic>H. lacustris</italic> cysts an increase in P<sub>max</sub> on a Chl basis was observed compared to the “green” vegetative cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. In <italic>C. reinhardtii bkt5</italic> astaxanthin accumulated constitutively during growth phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], whereas natively it requires environmental stress-related activation in <italic>H. lacustris</italic>, which simultaneously induces profound changes of cellular structure and a shift to the aplanospore phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">Improved biomass productivity in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> could be mediated by the increased light penetration due to reduced chlorophyll contents, although application of higher light intensities should compensate diffusion limitations and ensures sufficient light energy supply in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> cultures. But it is likely that increased resistance to photoinhibition in <italic>bkt5</italic> is assisting in tolerating high light, as measured from chlorophyll bleaching, oxygen evolution and singlet oxygen production upon exposure to photo-inhibiting irradiances (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p><p id="Par27">The main mechanism for protection from high light is the NPQ that dissipates the excessive light energy as heat. A higher resistance to photoinhibition could be due to an improved quenching mechanism, but this was not the case of <italic>bkt5</italic> where a strong reduction in NPQ was evident in cells acclimated either to CL or HL. Activation of NPQ in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> is dependent on generation of protonic gradient in the thylakoid lumen and accumulation of antenna protein LHCSR1 and LHCSR3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. ECS measurements demonstrated that proton transport into the lumen was similar or even higher in <italic>bkt5</italic> strains compared to its background strain. In <italic>bkt5</italic> LHCSR1 is present both in CL and HL even if its level is reduced compared to UVM4. The reduction of LHCSR1 is likely not the cause for the impaired NPQ since LHCSR3 is primarily responsible for quenching activation in high light-acclimated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> mutant without LHCSR1 showed the same NPQ level as wild type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. LHCSR3 is synthetized in <italic>bkt5</italic> only in HL: on chlorophyll basis LHCSR3 was reduced in <italic>bkt5</italic> but on a PSII basis, there was no significant difference between the two genotypes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>): because it was reported that the LHCSR3/PSII ratio is linearly correlated with the NPQ capability of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], the different LHCSR3 expression on a chlorophyll basis is likely not sufficient to explain the NPQ phenotype of <italic>bkt5</italic> strain. However, it is important to note that while LHCSR3/PSII ratio is essentially unchanged, <italic>bkt5</italic> exhibits an increased LHCII/PSII ratio: being the energy absorbed by LHCII one of the main targets of NPQ, we cannot exclude that the reduced LHCSR3/LHCII ratio in <italic>bkt5</italic> could at least partially contribute to the reduced NPQ phenotype in this engineered strain compared to UVM4. Astaxanthin accumulation in tobacco plants was previously reported to induce LHCII antenna proteins into a light-independent quenched state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. However, this possible constitutive quenching mechanism had a minor role in <italic>C. reinhardtii bkt5</italic> because 77 K fluorescence measurements on dark or light-treated whole cells demonstrated that PSII in <italic>bkt5</italic> cells is not in a constitutive quenching state (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Figure S8). The reduction of NPQ was more probably due to the changes in carotenoids compositions; mutants with altered xanthophylls and carotenes composition showed a reduction of NPQ both in microalgae and land plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. However, independently from the reason for its reduction, the NPQ mechanisms are not involved in the increased resistance to strong irradiances observed in <italic>bkt5</italic>.</p><p id="Par28">The increased resistance to high light of <italic>bkt5</italic> strain must then directly depend on astaxanthin and ketocarotenoids accumulation. Astaxanthin could probably exert this role with different mechanisms. (i) The increased carotenoid contents per chlorophyll observed in <italic>bkt5</italic>, mainly related to ketocarotenoids accumulation, makes astaxanthin as a “sunscreen” for chlorophylls, reducing the penetration of blue light into the thylakoids, thereby reducing excessive light absorption by photosystems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. The reduced singlet oxygen production, measured by SOSG fluorescence, in <italic>bkt5</italic> compared to UVM4 upon red light only exposure demonstrates, however, that the light-filtering effect of ketocarotenoids in the 500–560 nm (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Figure S9) is not the only mechanism contributing to increased photoprotection in <italic>bkt5</italic>. (ii) Astaxanthin is one of the most powerful antioxidant molecules and can scavenge ROS and could act as a barrier that prevents lipids, pigments, and photosynthetic complexes oxidation. Astaxanthin showed an antioxidant activity against singlet oxygen far higher than β-carotene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. According to this hypothesis, singlet oxygen was detected in far higher amount in UVM4 compared to the strain that accumulates astaxanthin (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C). This result is different from what was observed in <italic>H. lacustris</italic> where astaxanthin accumulating “red” cells showed a reduced Chl bleaching but the same amount of singlet oxygen generation. This difference could depend on the fact that in <italic>bkt5</italic> ketocarotenoids are accumulated in the chloroplast, the main site of light-dependent ROS production, while in <italic>H. Lacustris</italic> astaxanthin is present in lipid droplets in the cytosol, having a major role as a light filter. (iiii) The extensive accumulation of astaxanthin could be an additional way to use the high level of reducing power generated during continuous illumination regenerating NADP<sup>+</sup> as electron acceptor for the photosynthetic apparatus, mitigating the risk of saturation of the electron transport chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. All these aspects can contribute to the higher resistance of <italic>bkt5</italic> in high light. It is important to consider a possible astaxanthin dose response for the high light tolerance in <italic>bkt</italic> strains: <italic>bkt5</italic> strain herein investigated was selected for having high astaxanthin and accumulation (up to 2.5 mg/g dry weight), but further work is required to identify the best astaxanthin and ketocarotenoid cell concentration to improve biomass production in high light conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par29">The results presented here demonstrate that tailored pigments composition and addition of ketocarotenoids with higher antioxidant activity is a viable strategy to induce high light resistance and improve photosynthetic efficiency of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> and likely other green algae. Astaxanthin accumulated in engineered <italic>C. reinhardtii bkt5</italic> strain was found mainly free in the thylakoid membranes or possibly bound to both PSI and PSII. The changes in pigments composition affect the photosynthetic machinery in low light condition, but the presence of ketocarotenoids gives a striking advantage in constant high light. Very high light (up to 3000 μmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) natively occurs in outdoor cultivation strategies in extreme environments but induced strong photoinhibition in wild-type <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> reducing overall efficiency.
