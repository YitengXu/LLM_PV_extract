Dynamic efficiency was a core concept of this environmental policy. Out of multiple technologies wind and solar power—which were considered too expensive at the time—turned out to be cheaper than the use of oil, coal, gas or nuclear energy for power generation, even without considering externalities. The German minimum price policy opened doors in a competitive way, creating millions of new generators and increasing the number of market participants in the power sector. The fact that these new generators are distributed, non-synchronous and weather-dependent has caused contentious discussions and specific challenges. This paper discusses these aspects in detail and outlines its impacts. It also describes Swiss regulations that successfully launched avoidance technologies or services and asks why exactly Pigou's neoclassical economic approach to the internalization of damage costs (externalities) has rarely worked in policy reality, while sector-specific innovations based on small surcharges have been more successful. Based on the model of feed-in tariffs, a concept for the introduction of low-carbon air traffic is briefly outlined.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Graphic Abstract</title><p><fig id="Figa"

people engaged in environmental policy. The situation is similar to the 1980s when young people opposing the nuclear arms race and nuclear power plants faced an uphill battle, even after the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl accidents caused the spread of radiation and radioactive fallout.</p><p id="Par3">The following essay is written by an economist who, as a member of national and cantonal Parliaments for 30 years (1988–2018), has tried to put economic instruments at the heart of environmental policy. It addresses policy strategies in Germany and Switzerland that decisively launched the development of avoidance strategies, industries and processes.</p><p id="Par4">The German Energiewende (energy transition) was an exemplary model of a new policy approach and caused a fierce reduction in the cost of electricity generation by renewable energy sources, as explained in “<xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">The German Energiewende (energy transition): a successful environmental policy</xref>” section.</p><p id="Par5">Due to intermittency and low marginal prices of renewables, flexibility, sector coupling and market restructuring were logical complements to the energy transition and changed energy supplies in the traffic, heating and industry sectors. These structural changes will produce winners, losers and laggards. In this context, some challenges to and allegations against transforming the energy sector are discussed in “<xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">New (old) arguments and real performance</xref>” section.</p><p id="Par6">The price drop of renewable energy output is disrupting national and international energy systems and trade and, ultimately, can reduce the use of fossil fuels worldwide. The main trends in this restructuring are explained in “<xref rid="Sec19" ref-type="sec">The relevance of renewables: restructuring and expansion</xref>” section.</p><p id="Par7">“<xref rid="Sec24" ref-type="sec">Swiss policy attempts promoting avoidance</xref>” section discusses examples from Switzerland that illustrate potential policy tools and institutional approaches that are not based on the standard solution of a Pigou levy. They offer valuable insights into changes in the modal split of traffic and in the circular management of waste.</p><p id="Par8">The German energy transition is not yet complete and must extend beyond electricity supply. But already it may have enabled a more thorough advancement of price and volume regulations such as those in the European Emissions Trading scheme or in the revision of the Swiss CO<sub>2</sub> levies that deliver incentives for a change toward low-carbon technologies. Supporters of economic instruments often think that it is sufficient to internalize externalities through prices, after which the "invisible hand of the market" will do everything so that externalities disappear to a reasonable extent. However, reality is more complicated. Rather than taxes, avoidance strategies with coordinated efforts should be put at the center of any regulation, as discussed in “<xref rid="Sec35" ref-type="sec">Priceless environment</xref>” section.</p><p id="Par9">Finally, using the example of air traffic, we consider which findings can be transferred to other policy areas in “<xref rid="Sec47" ref-type="sec">Final thoughts on clean flying</xref>” section.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>The German Energiewende (energy transition): a successful environmental policy</title><p id="Par10">From 1990 to 2020, solar photovoltaic (PV)<sup>2</sup> and wind power generation changed from being two of the most expensive technologies to being the least expensive energy sources worldwide (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This achievement, which had disruptive consequences, was the result of a courageous environmental policy initiated in the German Parliament and assisted by other renewable energy hot spots around the globe (Irena <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2020</xref>). The affordability of renewable energy will shape the twenty-first century. But the transition is far from complete, and challenges persist, while market shares of new technologies continue to grow.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Production costs of electricity from new renewable energies and batteries (BNEF 2020)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10098_2020_1939_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par11">The raw material for the first industrially produced solar cells was silicon waste from the semiconductor industry. The efficiency of the best solar cells in the laboratory rose from a few percent (1953) to over 47 percent (NREL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">2020</xref>; Fraunhofer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">b</xref>). Today, the best standard module efficiencies range from 20 to 23 percent (Energysage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2020</xref>). With solar irradiation of 1000 kWh per m<sup>2</sup> typical for Central Europe, they allow for 150–200 kWh of power generation per year. Inverter efficiency has increased from approximately 80 percent to over 98%. The balance of system costs including, for example, costs for metal frames, arrays, cabling, planning, installation, storage (batteries, electrolysis, heat) and the required area per kWh have been reduced as well.</p><p id="Par12">Initially, the focus of PV was on off-grid electrification. New applications for self-consumption, for grid-connected customers and for grid injection expanded over time. New applications such as power for heat pumps and storage, electric vehicles and batteries created additional, flexible possibilities for utilization. This mode of expansion is inherent to new technologies, but there can be delayed take-offs ("hysteresis") when incumbent companies overstretch old technologies because they do not know or trust new ones or because they fear a loss of market share (Arthur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2011</xref>).</p><p id="Par13">1998, the deregulation of the power and gas markets began. Liberalization was the overarching condition for the expansion of new technologies. The unbundling of grids and power plants and the creation of competitive power markets with—to some extent—a level playing field were merits of the European Union’s regulatory framework (Schiffer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par14">Today, electricity from PV systems primarily serves four different markets: (1) captive locations without grid connection, (2) solar farms for wholesale power trading, (3) grid-connected systems for self-consumption and (4) micro-grids for industrial, residential and commercial complexes, ships, villages or entire city districts, including storage and black start facilities.</p><p id="Par15">Together with old and new technologies such as heat pumps, heat storage, electric vehicles, battery storage and electrolysis, solar and wind power form a disruptive family. Their combined abilities go far beyond what each technology can achieve on its own. Today, solar-wind-hybrid concepts with storage can offer a security of supply equal to that provided by conventional energy services, and at a lower cost (Vedel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par16">With new global installations of 115 GW PV and 60 GW wind power in 2019, these technologies have become less dependent on the whims of local government coalitions (IEA-PVPS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2020</xref>; GWEC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2020</xref>). The balance of forces within the electricity sector has changed in many countries or states. Even old, depreciated coal, gas or nuclear power plants can be undercut by new solar and wind farms’ low costs, expenses for storage, and included frequency control (BNEF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par17">Self-consumption of solar power from rooftops can reduce costs for commercial establishments and households. Business-friendly governments can no longer ignore this. Photovoltaics and wind power are displacing gas, coal and nuclear power plants, and recently, they have started to compete with petrol, diesel and heating oil in the transport and heating sectors.</p><p id="Par18">Electricity-based technologies can be far more efficient than those powered by thermal engines. An electric motor uses energy three to five times more effectively than a combustion engine. Heat pumps up-cycle the power input by a factor of 3 to 4 by compressing air from ambient heat or other low-temperature thermal sources.</p><p id="Par19">Power from renewable energies is mainly produced and used regionally or locally. Where transport distances are reduced, energy losses are lower. Thanks to the ubiquitous availability of the primary renewable energy sources of wind and solar, and due to advances in energy storage technologies, renewable energy systems can achieve a higher level of resilience than their fossil or nuclear fueled predecessors.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Learning curves</title><p id="Par20">Competitiveness and affordability were important drivers of market growth. The price per watt of installed PV capacity fell from $100/W in the early 1970s (Perlin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">1999</xref>) to around $0.5/W (megawatt-sized systems, ground-mounted, Lazard 2019; Pfeiffer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">2020</xref>). German tenders for solar power resulted in a generation cost of € 0.05/kWh (BnetzA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>). In California, the "historically lowest average price" stood at $0.0282 per kWh in 2019 and the source was renewable energy (CPUC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2020</xref>). In the Middle East, prices were below $0.02/kWh (Bellini <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2020</xref>). And in India, Solar Energy Corporation of India has concluded its 400 MW “round-the-clock” renewables tender to supply 24-h electricity at $0.038/kWh (Gupta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par21">The learning curve for solar modules between 1976 and 2019 was 23.5 percent (VDMA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2020</xref>), and that of balance of system costs stood at 11 percent (Elshufara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2018</xref>). A learning curve of 20 percent means that with each doubling of cumulatively installed capacity, the materials and manufacturing costs fall by 20 percent, which is then reflected in lower prices. Installed PV capacity worldwide doubled seven times between 2000 and 2019 (BP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2020</xref>). Prices dropped by more than 80 percent. Even during the winter season, PV can be a viable solution in certain locations—in alpine regions, for example (Häberlin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2012</xref>; Rohrer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">2019</xref>; Rechsteiner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2018</xref>; Rechsteiner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The case of wind power</title><p id="Par22">Wind power had a similar learning curve, though less steep. Longer blades and new materials had a cost-reducing effect. A tenfold increase in rotor length increased the nominal power ratings by a factor of approximately 100,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> while an increase in hub heights opened-up new air layers with more reliable and stronger winds (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Evolution of US wind turbine characteristics 1998–2018 (US DOE 2019)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10098_2020_1939_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par24">Wind power is more dependent on well-dimensioned power grids than PV. Geographically dispersed usage over large, interconnected areas (EU, USA, China) can balance the intermittency of high and low wind speeds at different locations and can therefore deliver cost-reducing effects.</p><p id="Par25">A strong interest in PV and wind power and grid congestion has led to location diversification. Today, solar power is not only installed on rooftops, but also in open fields, deserts, floating on water surfaces and on the sea, as a provider of shade on farmland (“agrophotovoltaics”), on textiles and on vehicle roofs. For wind power, marine sites have recorded the highest growth rates. Winds are more regular over the sea, and site permits can be managed by central authorities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Drivers and extent of the energy transition in Germany</title><p id="Par26">What exactly were the key drivers of these technical, environmental, and economic achievements?</p><p id="Par27">Publications such as "Limits to Growth" (Meadows et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">1972</xref>) led to increased attention to natural capital and scarcities. After the first oil price crisis (1973), many people refused to accept shortages and undesirable spillovers from extractive industries. Environmental movements became active. They opposed foreign dependence on dwindling oil, gas and raw materials, armed conflicts, monopolistic market structures, air or sea pollution, oppression of indigenous peoples, nuclear accidents and radioactive waste, and later, they fought climate change.</p><p id="Par28">A deep rift ran through the midst of society over whether nuclear power was a problem or the solution to the problem. Today, this question has become obsolete because accidents and lack of competitiveness have disqualified the nuclear industry’s pretention as a savior of the climate that is “too cheap to meter” (Strauss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">1954</xref>).</p><p id="Par29">Historically outstanding was the fact that for an entire generation, opposition to nuclear power created many thousands of small pioneers of wind and solar technologies. These included technicians and small investors in self-consumption or in grid-connected, distributed generation. After 1970, opponents of nuclear power won majorities or strong minorities in many local and national parliaments. Their efforts reduced nuclear risks, and their engagement provided a basis for climate policy.</p><p id="Par30">There was still a long way to go. After World War II, nuclear research dominated the budgets of universities, research institutes and militaries (Fischer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2019</xref>). "Atomic ministries" were founded. The risks and failures of commercial applications became apparent with the first meltdown of a commercial reactor at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant (Pennsylvania, USA) in 1979. Previously, accidents of this kind were presented as impossible or extremely improbable. Afterward, safety requirements were tightened. This made new plants more expensive and curbed commercial interest from utilities operating in competitive power markets (Keystone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2007</xref>; Grubler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2010</xref>).</p><p id="Par31">The next severe meltdown (Chernobyl 1986) caused a gradual political turn away from nuclear power in some countries (Janzing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2011</xref>). The share of nuclear power in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) research budgets subsequently fell from more than 75% (1974) to less than 25% (2018). However, the research budget share of renewable energy has remained low; it has ranged below 20 percent to this day (IEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2019</xref>). Even with small but focused budgets, power generation from renewable sources has succeeded.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> These achievements are not only due to research, but also to manufacturing and politics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Breakthrough in the Bundestag (German Parliament)</title><p id="Par33">The decisive impulse for the success of renewables was not of a technical nature, nor was it a question of resource quality. Rather, the determining factor for take-off was of an institutional nature, based on changes to laws on tariffs and new, open market structures.</p><p id="Par34">An important forerunner was the PURPA Act (1978) of US President Jimmy Carter. It forced US power grid operators to purchase electricity from independent producers at fixed prices.

To prevent excessive consequential costs, there was a proposed 5 percent annual reduction of tariffs, which later happened much faster.</p><p id="Par38">The EEG required utilities to purchase electricity from any renewable energy generator in their area and to concede priority access to the grid. It provided a fixed payment guarantee (cents per kWh delivered) for the full output of an installation over a guaranteed period time, spanning 20 years. The payment amount was re-structured several times according to technology, project size, quality of renewable resource at site, and other variables that affected project economics (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Policy support changes and renewables capacity deployment, 1990–2017 (IEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2020</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10098_2020_1939_Fig3_HTML.png" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p id="Par39">In 2004, the feed-in tariff for solar power was set at € 0.574/kWh for 20 years for all new installations starting production in that calendar year.

Generation was distributed and generation costs were falling. Small and medium-sized companies in Germany, Denmark, Switzerland and elsewhere were involved in manufacturing and in developing and refining components. This bottom-up approach, the technology neutrality of remuneration and the open access to markets provided for a new industry that had few administrative barriers. There were also risks when, for example, years after the introduction of the German Renewable Energy Act (EEG), cheap Chinese solar modules arrived on the German market, outcompeting German market leaders. Within the new supply of technology, investors selected the best offers. Some companies were successful; many pioneers fell by the wayside.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>The concept of dynamic efficiency</title><p id="Par45">The parliamentary initiators of the German Renewable Energy Act (EEG)—first and foremost members of parliament Hermann Scheer (SPD, 1944–2010) and Hans-Josef Fell (The Greens, *1952), together with so many others—recognized from the outset that it would be wrong to take <italic>current costs and prices</italic> of power generation and efficiency technologies as a yardstick for economic efficiency and political aims. Rather, the goal was to increase market share and bring down costs of a large range of environmentally friendly technologies over long periods of time. Cost reduction was, of course, a primary goal, but it was not the only one. Equally important were a more democratic, bottom-up access to and control of energy supply and a wider diversity of actors within a decentralized generation and distribution structure. Policy should no longer protect extractive and polluting industries, rather, it should honor the prevention of further environmental damage.</p><p id="Par46">Hoping for learning curves bringing cost reductions, the term "efficiency" was not considered static and based on pure cost indicators, but instead, dynamic (Fritsch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">1993</xref>; Krey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2000</xref>). Higher economic costs for consumers in the short and medium term were tolerated. The additional costs of feed-in tariffs were passed on as a surcharge on power prices for final consumers. The sharing of this burden, too, later led to fierce discussions, political conflicts and increasing exemptions for the business sector.</p><p id="Par47">It was no surprise that feed-in tariffs, initially up to ten times the actual market price, were harshly criticized by neo-liberal economists in Germany and by advocates of the conventional power industry who made current prices the measure of all things. They attacked the environmental and innovation goals of the former ruling red-green parliamentary alliance, which looked to overcome path-dependency and lock-in effects of the nuclear and fossil fuel industries.</p><p id="Par48">Minimum prices paid by consumers were denounced as a “subsidy,” and the law was framed as a deep "sin," ignoring its aims for long-term ecological benefits, innovation and cost reductions. It was demanded that "money should be used to insulate houses better, which in turn is most cost-effective with polystyrene" (Pfeiffer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par49">Some economists criticized the “inefficient technology portfolio” covered by feed-in tariffs and argued for a quota scheme instead. Many of them advocated for abandoning feed-in tariffs entirely (Weimann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">2013</xref>). The law was blamed for trying to serve "far too many unrealistic hopes." By abolishing feed-in tariffs, electricity would become cheaper and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions would anyway be capped by the European emissions trading system (Sinn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">2012</xref>).</p><p id="Par50">The location of power generation could be more efficiently organized by a concentration of wind power in Northern EU regions and of solar power in Southern EU member states and by harmonizing renewable energy policy within Europe (Haucap <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2012</xref>; Frondel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2013</xref>; Mundt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2013</xref>). Efficiency was a main argument of the European Commission, too. “The historical development of renewable energy systems policies in the EU has shown, above all, that member states consistently resist the Commission’s attempts to implement an EU-wide quota scheme.” A majority of member states were countries with second-best resource quality at best, compared to the sunshine level in Southern Spain or wind resources in Northern Scotland, Sweden, Denmark or Norway. A quota system threatened an immediate and risky shift of electricity infrastructure toward regions far away from load centers in Central Europe. Governments, grid operators and EU institutions were not prepared for this at the time. The support for expensive photovoltaic installations in Germany might have ceased completely with a shift of installations toward Italy or Spain. Both EU directives (2001/77/EC and the substituting directive 2009/28/EC) have been interpreted as failed attempts to introduce EU-wide quota systems (Strunz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par51">Objectors to feed-in tariffs ignored the fact that under simple quota systems, private actors failed to expand innovative technologies such as offshore wind or PV. A quota scheme would have grown only the cheapest technology which at that time was onshore wind power. Quota systems would have led to a concentration of plants in a few regions, as earlier examples from Great Britain showed. They risked accelerating local externalities and threatened landscape protection, biodiversity (birds) and noise pollution control while accelerating “nimby” behaviors.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3">3</xref></p><p id="Par53">Feed-in tariffs were the decisive choice for addressing a high diversity of supply and a decentralized, “home-grown” power system with popular investment participation. In this way, a higher diversity of supply was also guaranteed with regard to summer–winter seasonality and daytime–nighttime load profile difference. The combination of solar, wind, hydro, biomass and new storage technologies had system benefits compared to a pure technology-neutral deployment of least-cost technologies that disregarded security of supply and grid extension failures.</p><p id="Par54">The market prospects of PV and other technologies that were in stages of early development would not have benefited from a quota scheme. Ultimately, “the feed-in tariff-driven, large-scale deployment of photovoltaic installations in Germany during the last decade contributed to driving down module costs” (Strunz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par55">When, after the nuclear accident in Fukushima, the German (right-wing) majority coalition confirmed the closing of all nuclear power stations by 2022, this aroused opposition. Some critics simply resisted technological change and disguised their aversion against renewable energies in pseudo-economic arguments. Others feared the market backlash of their main facilities. The methods of the nuclear and fossil lobbies were similar to the PR strategies of the tobacco industry (Brandt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2012</xref>): Industry-related "think tanks" fed the media supposedly “scientific findings.” These appeared on TV shows and in industry-friendly newspapers that continued to deny the risks of nuclear energy or climate change.</p><p id="Par56">For more than two decades, the energy transition was derided as pointless, unattractive, technologically impossible or unaffordable (Eisenring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2017</xref>; Sinn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">2012</xref>; Frondel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2014</xref>; Buck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2018</xref>; FT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2014</xref>; Butler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2018</xref>).

Adjustments of generation portfolios are regularly followed by the adaptation of grid architectures. In Switzerland, for example, during baseload build-out of nuclear power plants, distribution networks had to be enhanced for additional electrical heating systems to get rid of power surpluses at night. This caused costs that were socialized, without lobby complaints, by an increase in uniform tariffs for all small consumers including consumers without such heating appliances.</p><p id="Par67">Transmission System Operators (TSO’s) all over the world manage grid congestion. They arise in emerging economies when power consumption grows at high rates. In OECD member countries where power consumption has been regressing for some time and new technologies have been expanding, grid congestion can be an indicator for complicated planning procedures of provincial or local administrations that are not in line with national climate policy.</p><p id="Par68">Opposition against build-out may be indicative of lack of communication, lack of participation or missed technological innovation such as underground cabling or the introduction of megawatt-sized batteries. It also cannot be excluded that incumbent power plant owners with non-renewable capacities have been quite happy with grid extension delays. This way they have gradually been able to protect their supply regions against cheap wind power deliveries from other regions.</p><p id="Par69">“Curtailment” is power that could be generated but was not dispatched onto the grid in response to grid operator requests. Curtailment rates for wind power in Germany rose to a peak of 4.95 percent in 2015 (Joos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2018</xref>). Higher rates—“15–16% for onshore Scottish farms”—are reported from Scotland (Joos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2018</xref>), Texas with up to 17% (DOE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2018</xref>) or China with 7% curtailment in 2012 and a much higher estimated peak in 2016 (Radowitz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">2019</xref>; Huenteler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par70">Curtailment rates in the USA are well documented over long periods for all transmission system operators.

The numbers modeled in the context of a mass transition to electric vehicles can be staggering. Let us take the case of Switzerland, where the power hub is blessed with backup power from hydro storage systems. Swiss hydroelectric plants have a combined capacity of 15.51 GW, 2.56 GW of which is pumped storage (UVEK 2020). For years, this capacity and storage played a crucial role in sweeping the power trade with Italy, France and Germany.</p><p id="Par88">Switzerland counts 4.6 million private passenger cars (Federal Statistical Office <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2020</xref>). If these were replaced by battery-powered vehicles, a new pool of grid-connected batteries could be made available. Assuming that each car has a configuration similar to Tesla's Model 3 (340 kW output, 75 kWh energy storage), the additional power capacity would amount to 1564 GW, corresponding to 100 times the capacity of all hydroelectric power plants combined or 600 times the capacity of pumped storage. These numbers show that even a marginal use of vehicle-to-grid appliances can substantially contribute to smoothing frequency control and power management, if technical specifications and financial incentives are in place.</p><p id="Par89">As with grid congestion, there are no built-in technical barriers to the accommodation of control power for high volumes of power from renewable energy sources. It is a question of taking responsibility for investments and the adaption of power markets. “In summary,” integrating large amounts of wind and solar energy into power systems is “less dramatic than sometimes believed” (Hirth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2015</xref>) and “has not proven to be the major impediment that was once feared” (Joos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par90"><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Unaffordable profile costs?</p></list-item></list> The temporal mismatch between variable renewable energy output and the load results in profile costs.

Splitting tenders into different markets and regions using technology-profile/site/orientation for better coverage of seasonal or daily demand profiles should be further investigated.</p><p id="Par100">Additional impacts can be expected from sector coupling where power delivery to electric vehicles, heat pumps or heat stores is structured in a supply-oriented way. All of these new designs may enable wind and solar power generators to increase their market value, while they serve as a cheap source of clean energy for their customers.</p><p id="Par101">Weak carbon prices under the EU ETS scheme before 2018 were highly insufficient for internalizing climate externalities. These low prices also decreased the market value of wind and solar power because the merit order stayed flat, while cheap coal power could be added at any time without considering externalities. Similarly, explicit and implicit subsidies for fossil fuels and price caps in the power market put renewable energy investments at a competitive disadvantage.

To a certain extent, wind or solar power generation will always depend on primary sources of energy, irrespective of siting, locational spreads, diversity of orientation or interconnection capacities. We will therefore have to live with recurring low-price periods. This should be perceived as an opportunity rather than a burden from a consumer perspective.</p><p id="Par105">A growing number of hours or days with negative prices may be an indicator for low market integration of renewables and deficits in sector coupling.

This was lower than prices for new coal or gas generation. In the EU ETS, a new market stability reserve regulation was introduced in 2017. The prospect of reduced emission permit volumes led to a recovery in CO<sub>2</sub>-prices in the European power market. This also made many of the old coal-fired power plants unprofitable and may have created room for storage investments as a substitute for coal-powered backup.</p><p id="Par109">In Germany, smaller plants (&lt; 750 kW) still get a fixed premium that is somewhat higher than the estimated €0.06/kWh power generation costs of new coal power plants. For these small-sized PV plants, positive externalities may justify the additional cost. Small installations can be integrated into buildings or infrastructures without taking up unused open space. The siting of these installations very close to load can save grid expansion costs. Short distances can reduce transmission-related energy losses and risks. Distributed facilities may advance sector coupling for heating and traffic without charging transmission lines for power. Advancing sector coupling may help stabilize prices caused by variations in weather conditions. The robustness of the system will be improved by smoothing generation and consumption at a very low grid voltage level when main grid congestions affect distribution grids (BnetzA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2019</xref>). The positive external effects by a more decentralized power generation architecture are significant for system security, even if they cannot be easily quantified in monetary terms.</p><p id="Par110">For integration of the growing output of German solar PV power at midday, the ramp up of demand in the evening could be perceived as an outlet.

For adjusting the power system to a further rising share of RE and maintaining security of supply, a variety of intelligent solutions will be necessary including adaption of the electricity grid to meet the demands of more decentralized power production, demand-side management, short-term and long-term storage and a higher diversity of tenders where demand profiles can enter as a trigger for remuneration of supply. To make use of these flexibilities, new markets with shorter lead times are necessary.

The country, with just 8.5 million inhabitants, is too small to offer large markets for new technologies. Companies are positioned as suppliers of neighboring EU and other countries. The export quota of goods and services is at &gt; 65 percent (2019). Swiss companies are experienced in environmental technologies. In the renewable energy business, Swiss companies include ABB, Meyer Burger, Huber + Suhner and Gurit.</p><p id="Par158">Too often, however, new technologies are not applied in the real world. "Industry policy" is a taboo, given a strong aversion to the direct financial support of companies. There is a consensus that "conditions like those in agriculture,” where costs are covered largely by the federal budget, should be avoided.</p><p id="Par159">Greenhouse gas emissions of Switzerland are too high. According to the National Inventory Report (NIR), they have fallen by 14 percent since 1990 to 5.4 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents per capita. This number does not include emissions from ships or air traffic. The latter has risen by 84 percent since 1990 (NIR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">2020</xref>). Kerosene is not subject to taxes charged on other fossil fuels; neither VAT nor the CO<sub>2</sub>-levy have to be paid on it. A plane ticket levy of CHF 30 to 120 has recently gained a parliamentary majority and will be the subject of referendum.</p><p id="Par160">Switzerland is a country poor in raw materials. Large amounts of energy, metals, minerals, and feed are imported. The environmental impacts take place abroad, mainly at the expense of the climate, biodiversity, and water availability. The ecological footprint (including imported goods and services) is larger than the average of European Union member states. In 2015 it was 14 t CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents per capita. Only about one third of the overall CO<sub>2</sub> footprint of Swiss residents is recorded in the national inventory report (NIR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">2020</xref>; Bafu <xref rid="CR12" ref-type="bibr">2020c</xref>).

In Switzerland 50,000 signatures are needed to demand a popular vote (referendum) on a new or revised law of Parliament. In general, it can be challenging to win majorities for new levies or incentives according to the PPP. Even small PPP-charges such as waste disposal fees or CO<sub>2</sub> levies that are reimbursed by a “carbon dividend” may fail by referendum when not properly explained or based on multi-party agreements. Therefore, it is difficult to enforce the polluter-pays principle in Switzerland.</p><p id="Par162">The origin and amount of donations for campaigns, parties, press organizations, and members of parliament do not have to be disclosed. This has repeatedly led to criticism regarding Switzerland’s failure to prevent corruption (GRECO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2019</xref>). Direct democracy makes it easy for financially powerful lobbies such as the automotive industry, aviation, or electricity companies to influence public referendums. However, environmental organizations have also built some power and use direct democracy instruments to launch new environmental policies through so called <italic>people’s initiatives</italic> (100,000 signatures needed).</p><p id="Par163">Swiss environmental policies make use of a variety of different instruments, including promoting and financing innovations. It is easier to pass PPP-measures when cost-effective substitutes are ready for market. Substantial public support for research and development is available for the promotion of innovation and substitutes. "Innosuisse" Agency allots CHF 250 million (US$ 270 million) annually for mixed support of new technologies from private companies. The Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (SFOE) provides a maximum of CHF 4 million to support new technologies to reduce pollution.

Action was only taken when it was nearly too late.<disp-quote><p id="Par165">125 years ago, catastrophes forced our ancestors to rigorously protect the forest (…) today's forest policy understands the forest as a broad public service (…) Not thoughtless use should be in the foreground, but the benefit for all of us. (Leuenberger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2001</xref>).</p></disp-quote>
In the early nineteenth century, municipalities, cantons, and private individuals were owners of forests. "The experts were unanimous, and their message was clear but uncomfortable. The onset of industrialization fueled the demand for wood. Entire forests were sold and then cleared […] In addition, new land was needed for agriculture." (Küchli and Baumgartner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2001</xref>) The depletion of forests had many negative implications. It led to soil erosion, loss of land, and in 1834 and 1839 severe floods occurred.</p><p id="Par167">However, numerous decades passed until real action was taken. It was not until 1868 when more than 50 people were victims to flooding that "change of opinion in forest policy" occurred. It was the urban, "economically more developed center who campaigned for the protection of mountain forests. This was facilitated by the fact that freight trains were able to import coal. The forestry law was imposed on mountain cantons against their will. It had a reputation of "disciplining mountain regions, which have shown themselves to be unreasonable and unwilling to accept forest protection" (Küchli and Baumgartner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2001</xref>).</p><p id="Par168">"Ultimately, the transition to new, fossil energy sources made the transformation possible, because it removed the high pressure of depletion from forests, that was felt in the eighteenth century. The struggle for scarce resources was alleviated, and this probably increased acceptance of new regulations”. (Sieferle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">1998</xref>). Agriculture also benefited from coal as a new source of energy, while fertilizers were used to increase productivity, and the pressure on forests decreased. Industrialization shifted the creation of revenue to cities and created new niches for near-natural forests that then fulfilled new functions: near-natural silviculture, forest reserves, natural forest reserves for biodiversity.</p><p id="Par169">Success was possible when the problem moved to top of the political agenda of the young federal state. Conservation had to be negotiated and new institutions ready for sanctions had to be secured; this was achieved by the federal state using its monopoly on violence and on property rights, sometimes against the will of provincial governments or people. Forest rangers supervised the reforestation. Anyone who felled trees needed a permit, and this was only granted if the forest as such was not endangered.</p><p id="Par170">Meanwhile, climate change poses new challenges. And there is no law of nature according to which we always have enough time to learn from damage. "The problem of increasing weakness of mountain forests due to air pollutants, over-fertilized soils, new pests and the rising number of extreme meteorological events in Alpine regions observed since the mid-1980s is likely to intensify. Frequent storms as well as landslides and massive avalanches have caused severe damage.” (Greminger and Jordi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Economic instruments in environmental policy</title><p id="Par171">Market economies create new products every day. Competition ensures that market participants have a level of efficiency often imposed by transnational companies dominating the sector. However, competition only works for real costs such as wages, materials or capital. Externalities, so called “social costs” at the expense of third parties, are neither charged nor compensated by market forces. They do not appear in income statements or balance sheets.</p><p id="Par172">Legal measures to make externalities "visible" can improve the overall efficiency of markets. They can incentivize new business models and reduce environmental degradation and loss of natural capital such as clean air, biodiversity or climate stability. By managing natural capital and by including environmental costs, processes, products and services are delivered in a more efficient way. Government action through regulation, rationing of emission allowances (emissions trading) or taxing of externalities may open new markets for innovative products, processes and innovative finance instruments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Economic instruments in Swiss legal code</title><p id="Par173">Switzerland has succeeded in introducing a few economic instruments over time. Levies, emission trading and feebates are perceived preferred solutions. Unlike standards, they give incentives for innovation, the adaption of consumption with better efficiency, substitution of hazardous products or investments in new products. However, where emission control and product security are established and need to be ensured with minimum transaction costs, emission standards are indispensable.</p><p id="Par174">A pure incentive mechanism exists as a levy for high sulfur heating oil (1997) and for volatile organic compounds (VOCs, 1998). The levy creates an incentive to reduce VOC-containing products. Receipts are distributed evenly to the population by reducing health insurance premiums, together with the revenue from the CO<sub>2</sub> levy.</p><p id="Par175">There are not many pure incentive schemes to reduce emissions. The prevailing economic instruments are mixed systems. Levies are combined with earmarking and partial reimbursement such as the “carbon dividend.” “Carbon dividend” is a nickname for the redistributed revenue from the CO<sub>2</sub> levy which is redistributed uniformly to all residents. Each person receives the same amount, regardless of his or her consumption. The distribution of the levy revenues is carried out by health insurance companies who have the most current address directory of Swiss residents since basic insurance is compulsory for all. The system incurs low enforcement costs. In 2021, the redistributed CO2 levy (“carbon dividend”) combined with redistributed tax on VOC is CHF 87.—per year and per person. The amount is settled against the health insurance premium. The goal is to maintain social balance for people of low income. The earmarked part is spent on avoidance activities and investments, often reducing the tax base and often benefiting those with low incomes, such as refurbishments of old, insufficient multi-dwelling buildings.</p><p id="Par176">There exist many charges that are 100% earmarked, namely, to cover recycling costs or costs of waste disposal. Examples for mixed systems are the performance-based heavy goods vehicle levy (HGVL) for freight transport (2001), feed-in tariffs (FiT) for power generation from renewable energy (2008) and the CO<sub>2</sub>-levy on fossil combustibles including a carbon dividend (2008).</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Levies for recycling and waste disposal</title><p id="Par177">"There is hardly any other country in the world who produces that much municipal waste in relation to its resident population" (Bafu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020d</xref>). This is not surprising given the high household incomes in Switzerland. The recycling rate is at 53 percent. Incineration is mandatory for residual waste, mostly processed by waste-to-energy plants.</p><p id="Par178">From 1997, the Environmental Protection Act gave the government the legal power to ask companies to guarantee recycling, waste disposal treatment and prevention. The law prioritized private sector responsibility—producers, importers and vendors—for avoidance and recycling activities. Recycling is labeled a "voluntary measure"; contrary to the semantics, these activities are not "voluntary." But the business sector can decide how to fulfill legal standards. Where recycling or waste management is deficient, the government can decide on sector- or product- based fees.</p><p id="Par179">Many business sectors ensure the financing of recycling through a common, self-organized effort such as with the recycling of paper, electrical and electronic equipment, beverage cans or cars. The cost is usually a single-digit percentage figure of the total cost per unit. In the case of battery recycling and glass beverage packages, no self-organized agreements were achieved by the business sector. Here a disposal fee on products sold was made mandatory by the government. It is charged as part of the product price.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Performance-based Heavy Goods Vehicle Levy (HGVL)</title><p id="Par180">In Switzerland it proved to be difficult to reduce the emissions of the traffic sector. The number of heavy-duty off-road vehicles (Sport Utility Vehicles) and heavy motorbikes has grown at a record-breaking pace—most of all in high-income suburbs where terrain is flat. CO<sub>2</sub>-emissions from road traffic have not been reduced as prescribed by law. Nevertheless, transport policy is on the move. The behavior of many consumers has gradually changed, especially in urban and semi-urban areas, due to public transport, parking management, promotion of bicycle traffic and car-free inner cities. Technological innovations such as e-bikes and electric vehicles may bring substantial CO<sub>2</sub> reductions in the foreseeable future. Financial incentives play a major initial role as has been shown in the heavy goods transport sector.</p><p id="Par181">A performance-based Heavy Goods Vehicle Levy (HGVL) was introduced in 2001 in Switzerland. It is a combined levy charged on heavy transports within Switzerland. Vehicles with a nominal weight of more than 3.5 tons must pay the levy according to specific air emissions, kilometers travelled and nominal vehicle weight. A large part of the revenue is used for investments and support of border-to-border rail systems. The extension and refurbishment of rail infrastructures was a primary objective and delivered side benefits for all train passengers as well as for car drivers whose perceived roads to be less congested.</p><p id="Par182">The policy for a modal shift in transport was strongly confirmed by majorities from a half dozen referenda: a new rail-rail link through the Alps (1992), protection of the Alps (1994), introduction of a performance-based heavy goods vehicle levy (1998), financing major railway projects (1998), further expansion of railway infrastructure (2014).</p><p id="Par183">The number of transits by trucks fell from 1.4 million (2001) to 0.94 million (2018).

This corresponded to CHF 0.03/L of heating oil and CHF 0.025/m<sup>3</sup> of natural gas. Over ten years the levy was subsequently increased eightfold to CHF 96/t CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="Par188">In general, much attention has been paid to ensure that levies do not disadvantage export industries. Production facilities with greenhouse gas emissions can be exempted from tax by special arrangement. Exempted companies must in turn deliver an emission reduction commitment or become part of the emissions trading system (ETS). A cooperation between Swiss and European ETS was achieved in 2017. Companies in Switzerland can buy emissions rights of counterparties in the EU. An electronic link enables the transfer of emission allowances between the two systems. The ETS now includes aviation and thermal power plants in line with EU regulations but still, emissions rights may be given for free (Bundesrat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par189">The CO<sub>2</sub> levy today is levied on 51% of CO2 emissions from only fossil combustibles (no transport fuels). Around 33% of emissions is regulated in the ETS and 16% comes from companies with target agreements (Bafu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2017</xref>).

This resulted in a reduction of waste quantities and gave rise to political controversy and allegations of bad planning or mismanagement ("pork cycles"). However, there is little point in looking for culprits because those responsible acted within the given frameworks. The mismatch was the price paid to achieve political majorities. Without initial budget financing, the realization of recycling activities or waste treatment installations could have failed in many cases due to resistance (referenda) from populist parties and political entities with tight budgets. These lessons might also prevail in the future.</p><p id="Par197">Earmarked and mixed levies were introduced successfully where avoidance activities were available, could be credibly explained and could contribute visibly to preventing ecological damages: carbon emissions reduction and air pollution control, noise reduction, energy efficiency programs, feed-in tariffs for increasing renewable energy shares and more. The market share of organic farming increased to more than 10 percent mainly based on proper labeling and consumers asking for healthier products; new production lines then started to influence farmer support of policies.

Instead of talking about the pollution or polluters that are responsible, there is talk about “natural disasters,” as if earthquakes had started to dominate weather patterns.</p><p id="Par221">In the former Soviet Union, there was a joke about the success of a planned economy: "The statistics were always good." But the queues in front of retail stores showed another reality.</p><p id="Par222">Industrial societies have celebrated growth figures for decades. There is nothing wrong with this except that they obscure the extent to which our natural resources have been degraded and the additional risks we run over time. The climate crisis is endangering everything, and we can barely comprehend the extent and dynamics of environmental destruction.</p><p id="Par223">In real economic terms, climate protection has not achieved the status of a reportable issue on a micro-economic level. Sustainability reports from companies are voluntary. Where they exist, they do not create enforceable obligations. And where avoidance technologies are not readily available or competitive—due to technical hurdles or high prices—environmental goals risk remaining unreachable.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Value as a question of contemporary thinking</title><p id="Par224">The Italian American economist Mariana Mazzucato points out that theories of value have always been ideological, and that they have changed over time (Mazzucato <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2019</xref>). In <italic>The Wealth of Nations</italic>, Adam Smith made a distinction between productive activities that generate added value and unproductive activities, such as rent collected by landowners. “Value” was derived from the amount of work that went into production, first from agriculture (physiocrats), and later from industrial manufacturing (classics).</p><p id="Par225">The school of marginal utility in neoclassical theory (from 1870) postulated that "value" was derived from marginal utility, the benefit gained from consuming one additional unit of a product or service. Though the usefulness of water may be great, the marginal cost is low and therefore its price is low or possibly zero. In the case of diamonds, as the supply is small, marginal cost tends to be high, though the total usefulness of diamonds in daily life is small (Lokanathan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2018</xref>). The school of marginal utility considers demand to be the decisive element in the determination of value. Its approach is from a micro-economic rather than from a macro-economic perspective. This myopic perspective often seems to dominate the thinking of many economists. Natural resources are priced using hedonic methods, by asking people what price they are willing to pay for a forest, for a clean river or for “climate stability.” <italic>Value</italic> thereby arises in the eye of the respective beholder, who feels free to give natural goods the value he wants from his individual perspective.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>The "tragedy of the commons"</title><p id="Par226">The perception of value was different in the past. In the Middle Ages and well into modern times, important environmental goods—forests, fields and waters rich in fish—were managed as common-pool resources and local rules defined sustainable management (Ostrom <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">1999</xref>). The commons were protected against excessive use and the input of harmful substances usually remained unproblematic (Sieferle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">1998</xref>). The hunters and gatherers of Stone Age, the first farmers of the Neolithic Age and the first urban societies cultivated animistic relationships with trees, waters, and landscapes. Natural goods were considered "sacred."</p><p id="Par227">This changed with the expansion of market economies. The private acquisition of formerly common goods found new outlets and became an important source of wealth. Production was no longer a means of subsistence. The prospect of profit arose and the creation and extension of financial assets was made possible by the allocation of investments. A race for the appropriation of natural resources began, plundering virgin forests for rare timbers, oceans for whaling and fishing or clean air for fossil energy conversion to maximize monetary yields.</p><p id="Par228">Natural resources, land, and entire continents were forcibly taken away from indigenous peoples and dedicated to the extraction of raw materials or the production of feed and food. Colonial structures encouraged corruption, violence, deforestation, and the depletion of soils and groundwater.</p><p id="Par229">Whether or not humanity will survive these ruinous degradations is typically not a subject of economic analysis. The damage costs are borne by third parties, diffuse and often only show up as a problem over time. Market economics are based on the right to freedom. Today, everything that is not forbidden remains allowed. Shareholder value thinking is not focused on the preferences of future generations. The latter will have no choice but to accept what remains. Hardin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">1968</xref>) described the consequences of this logic for common goods. If the pressure of use increases and there is no social control, everyone will maximize his or her yield even faster to maximize his or her current profit. Over time, the losses fall to the community.</p><p id="Par230">Without values of cooperation or solidarity, individual rational conduct, as postulated by neoliberal-minded economists, leads to ruin. Methodical individualism, with its resistance toward state activity, did not oppose free riding behavior effectively. Common goods are neither inventoried nor managed by modern economists. Cheating and dining-and-dashing have become the main business model when it comes to natural goods. This will only change when environmental risks and pollution start to be sanctioned and when polluters are forced into avoidance activities and paying compensations that can maintain and restore natural capital.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Correcting "market failures”: the deficits of Pigou’s theory</title><p id="Par231">The British welfare economist Arthur Cecil Pigou (1877–1959) was the first to demand that not only monetary values but also all activities that generated “welfare” should be recognized as an addition of “value.” The role of the state would be to correct <italic>market failures</italic> when <italic>negative externalities</italic> caused damage but were not considered to be costs by companies.</p><p id="Par232">Pigou's theory bears more questions than answers.

Instead of safeguarding value, value destruction becomes a common habit and subsequent generations will find themselves cheated. They cannot successfully speak out against expropriation, and they are not part of decision-making processes. When irreversible effects on natural resources prevail, these values will be lost forever. To prevent this, the intrinsic value, or the "mere existence" of natural goods should be honored over time and safeguarding natural capital should be the rule, beyond individual preferences.</p><p id="Par241">Pigou's concept ultimately leads to the <italic>economically optimized destruction of nature</italic>, where the preservation of natural capital might be an option but is in no way organized or affirmed as a common goal.

Later, however, the newly established regulations and technologies enjoyed a high level of acceptance among former opponents, turning them into big investors.</p><p id="Par280">With market- or sector-based avoidance strategies, the discussion on “Pigou taxes” should be replaced by a discussion of product, sourcing or processing qualities. When, around 2015, power production from renewable energy reached cost parity with new coal and gas plants, German, French, English, Spanish, Norwegian, Portuguese and Italian utilities and power companies such as (in alphabetical order), BKW, EDF, EDP, EnBW, ENEL, Engie, E.on, Iberdrola, RWE, SSE, Statkraft and Vattenfall all started to reposition themselves in the new power markets (Amelang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2016</xref>; Brunekreft et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2016</xref>), just to name some important European actors. Their investments in renewables often started in new, far-away places outside the established supply areas. This changed over time, and residual conventional power plants “at home” were replaced, split from the main company, or transferred to a “bad bank holding” that would later be sold.</p><p id="Par281">In the long run, cost allocations for avoidance should comprise all levels of the value chain including cross-border trade flows, for example for wood, palm oil, cocoa or cotton. Intergovernmental trade agreements should ensure that ecological production can be established by itself for a commodity’s quality, and quality assurance should be an obligation for the overall value chain. In the EU, this was made possible when requests for proposals for renewable energy tenders were organized to include trans-border areas.</p><p id="Par282">The necessity of internalizing the remaining external costs of harmful goods or services that are not avoided will persist. Harmful goods or behavior should never remain "cheap." This also applies to residual emissions of so-called better products or “avoidance industries.”</p><p id="Par283">The timing and amount of avoidance cost surcharges are delicate decisions. Once new techniques are available, new charges are more easily applied, and they may turn out to be a boost for the industry when overall cost in the sector can be reduced, as has happened with new renewable energy investments.</p><p id="Par284">When avoidance costs continue to be expensive, the preference should be for reducing the cost of better products while substituting market shares of the old, polluting practice. As soon as low-emission alternatives are available for a reasonable price, an additional charge on externalities “Pigou Style” can be an option, amongst others. Often a regulatory ban, a final closure period or an emission standard can do the same when the avoidance of harmful products and processes has become common sense. Internalization charges can wait, but they must remain a credible threat if a sector does not improve.</p><p id="Par285">If a Pigou tax had been introduced in Germany in 1990 as a starter, it would have triggered only minor impacts while creating competitive disadvantages for export industries and drawing fierce political resistance. Power companies would have passed the new levy onto consumers, remaining largely unscathed, and the latter would have felt confirmed in their prejudice that insatiable governments always find excuses to charge innocent citizens.

A step-by-step micro-start in niche markets with modest costs, as the EEG has done, seems like a good option.</p><p id="Par287">It is no coincidence that today, coal-fired power plants are stigmatized while being subject to new EU-wide carbon regulations. However, this happens only now, when renewable energies have achieved a competitive position. Thirty years ago, moral shaming and blaming would hardly have been successful. When avoidance technologies are close to being competitive, it is the right time for the internalization of external costs. In 2017, the EU emissions trading system was supplemented with a market stabilization reserve, lifting the price of CO<sub>2</sub> certificates, while incumbent companies with new investments and old allowances took a profit.</p><p id="Par288">From 2018, an increase in CO<sub>2</sub> emission costs to &gt; 20 €/t CO<sub>2</sub> across the European electricity market was registered. This time, despite being a homeopathic dose, the still rather low price for carbon emissions turned out to be the most effective climate protection measure of the last 20 years over the whole European common power market. It made coal-fired power plants unprofitable, while cheaper energy from new renewable investments was ready and available.

For many years, emission trading systems of the EU ETS were insufficient in creating stable financial support for clean energy investments due to low CO<sub>2</sub> emission prices, free access for allowances and volatility.

The prohibition of earmarking is meant to protect legal decision makers from making the same decisions as their predecessors. While this principle is valuable in fiscal policy, in environmental policy it is not. For the latter, the polluter-pays principle is regarded as the preferred system of cost allocation.

According to this view, environmental protection merely leads to wasting public money on unsuccessful technologies that crowd out private investment (Tullock et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">2002</xref>).</p><p id="Par307">This kind of thinking became a popular movement in the USA, boosted by billionaires who pursued their own interests. The <italic>Tea Party</italic> conquered the Republican Party and led to the candidacy of Donald Trump ("America first"). In some cases, governments and reform-oriented parties are also to be blamed for the recent surge of populist parties. For too long, governments have ignored income disparity and have lost trust and credibility. In France, the <italic>Gilets jaunes</italic> opposed and prevented CO<sub>2</sub> levies because the Macron government was unwilling to compensate for the additional burden of any kind of “carbon dividend” such as the one in Switzerland that neutralized the reduced purchasing power of a CO<sub>2</sub> levy.</p><p id="Par308">Environmental policy must therefore be on its guard. Benefits of government intervention must outweigh the costs (Buchanan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2003</xref>). This can be achieved by a gradual start, testing and cooperation with established companies who are willing to change. Actors in the creative private sector are normally intrinsically interested in new technology and innovations.

The increase in environmental degradation exhibits patterns of an epidemic. Time is an important factor. Failure to act will be ever more expensive, and tipping points must be avoided as far and as quickly as possible (Sachverständigenrat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par311">Over the last 100 years, temperatures worldwide have risen by 1 degree Celsius. So far, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions have not been stabilized. As a result, temperatures have started to rise even faster—by an estimated 0.2 degrees per decade (IPCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2018</xref>). Even with some CO<sub>2</sub> reductions in the medium term, we will be far from reaching climate stability; damages will continue to grow. Therefore, achieving “net zero” emissions should be the way forward.</p><p id="Par312">It is a battle on two fronts: The cost of destruction is increasing. And there are transition costs for a “low-carbon economy” that increase prices for end consumers. But is this true? Following learning curves, we can view this transition as an opportunity, too. Avoidance investments within a "Green New Deal" will reduce direct energy costs, while in some sectors such as airline industries rising costs might be unavoidable. Repair and “healing” costs could create new business cycles, not necessarily increasing welfare but stabilizing the climate, and therefore avoid disaster. Defensive activities are necessary to escape the worst anticipated damages.</p><p id="Par313">A comparison with the reactions during the COVID-19 epidemic is of limited benefit (Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>). Nationwide measures will not lead to a corresponding slowdown in global warming but may bring indirect successes. The example of the EEG shows that national efforts or a <italic>coalition of the willing</italic> can make expensive technologies cheap and change international sourcing and trade patterns. The dissemination of low-carbon technologies has driven coal power plants out of markets where competitive electricity sourcing is the rule. Avoidance has become cheaper; hence, the move toward sanctioning polluting technologies on political grounds has become easier.<fig id="Fig14"><label>Fig. 14</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Climate policy paths (graph by the author, inspired by Pueyo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">2020</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10098_2020_1939_Fig14_HTML.png" id="MO14"/></fig></p><p id="Par314">The latest photovoltaic and wind power technologies produce 100 times less CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per kWh than power from lignite (Ballif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020</xref>, 27; Wissenschaftlicher Dienst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>).

Where it is difficult to cut CO<sub>2</sub>-emissions and where technical solutions are not at hand, polluters normally exhibit reluctance toward change. One of the sacred cows is air traffic. For decades, political approaches to emissions management were insufficient or uncertain at best.</p><p id="Par316">New terms such as "flight shame" are an indication that many people are unhappy with the situation. As a result of perceived helplessness, the debate has started to become moralized. People question air travelers who take advantage of cheap offers. And some passengers themselves feel <italic>ashamed of flying</italic>.</p><p id="Par317">The Viennese ethicist Konrad Paul Liessmann gives some warnings against moralization. For instance, moralizing might block conflict resolution:</p><p id="Par318">"For me, the question of what energy we use is primarily not a moral question, but a question of political concepts on energy, mobility, and industrial production. It is a question of weighing up and balancing different interests. By moralizing these questions, firstly, you distract from looking at things in a sober way. Moralizing always takes place in a mode of indignation, blame and shame. It clouds the view” (Liessmann in: Fuhs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par319">Through moralization, social, technical or political challenges become a question of the misconduct of individuals. This can be a successful strategy if you want to <italic>prevent</italic> regulation. By allowing this, politics is cheated out of its proper tasks, while people start to believe that solutions are impossible.</p><p id="Par320">"Then you do not need laws, but those who drive the wrong car model simply are evil. I do not think there is much to be gained if people keep flying but are ashamed to do so. This inevitably leads to rituals of shame and expiation, but no improvement in the carbon footprint" (Liessmann in: Fuhs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par321">Moralization itself has a social component, both in patterns of consumption that we morally condemn and in those from which we cannot escape:</p><p id="Par322">"Once it is the diesel engine, then the airplane, then the cruise ship, then every newborn baby. We exclude things that are important to us, anyway. Who talks about the devastating CO<sub>2</sub> balance of digitalization? Nobody.[…] Moralization leads to a competition of expressions of a good conscience, and this good conscience, by the way, also has its price: one must be able to afford to live a climate-neutral life, or at least pretend to. Nothing is won" (Liessmann in: Fuhs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par323">Individual changes of behavior might not be as insignificant as Liessmann believes. If somebody decides to travel without flying to protect the climate, it certainly is a contribution to climate protection on a micro-level. And micro-changes by thousands of people may create new value streams and macro-restructuring—for trains, for example—and be the start of different behavior patterns. In Europe, there are many people who have given up flying or reduced their air travel for climate-related reasons.</p><p id="Par324">However, individual avoidance activities may not be sufficient in the fight for climate protection. Moreover, some strategies perceived as avoidance technologies might not be "good" enough based on life cycle assessment. Liessmann talks about these <italic>grey zones</italic>:</p><p id="Par325">"It is possible that our energy-hungry technical civilization has maneuvered us into a situation where there are no longer any clearly positive solutions, where everything we can do will involve major risks and disadvantages. Moralization pretends that there is good and bad, and thus actually trivializes the situation. The individual can of course do something. He can try to move things along the paths of political decisions, can argue and launch new concepts to convince people. That is hard work. But that is the very essence of a democracy.[…].</p><p id="Par326">Companies react to markets. You can create a gentle pressure on companies to influence corporate strategies. Customers can boycott certain products or change their buying behavior.[…] We can set a good example, but we must be very careful not to fall into the trap of double standards. It is a different matter when you come to a decision at a political level to change the legal frameworks […] in principle, be it regulatory or fiscal. Then I don't need any moral at all" (Fuhs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par327">Too often though, in the face of relentless lobbying, “Pigou-style” internalization attempts and the discussion of damage costs have led to decades of deadlock. Instead, focusing on avoidance options might be more successful.</p></sec><sec id="Sec49"><title>Communication tasks</title><p id="Par328">A main communicative task is the creation of empathy for the needs of the future and for the survival of younger generations. As global warming has progressed, the damages alleged to be “problems of the future” are spilling over into the present. Extreme temperatures and their costs can no longer be kept away from headlines. Insight is growing into how avoidance activities for later generations may bring benefits to those living today as well, by reducing local air pollutants, noise or preserving biodiversity.</p><p id="Par329">With a consensus for action, experiences gained through the EEG should be adopted in other industries.

Create long-term programs</italic> Innovations with a smaller footprint should be assessed regarding their footprints and—if solid—get an assured remuneration within a fixed time frame, sponsored by industry-wide cost allocations (small, sector-wide contributions). Basic research should be financed by governments. These two financial flows were successful with renewable energies in Germany or with the recycling business in Switzerland. The philosophy behind it is that products and processes, including avoidance of environmental or social damage, should not be more expensive than their conventional counterparts.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par332"><italic>Phase 3: Scaling up</italic> Once avoidance technologies are established technically at reasonable costs, obsolete technologies will have to give way, incentivized by “feebates” (a mixture of small charges and rebates), emission trading, technical standards, decommissioning time limits, bans or—in a later stage—by incentive levies (Pigou taxes) combined with a “dividend” reimbursing substantial parts of the charges while preserving the social balance.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par333"><italic>Phase 4: Internalization</italic> When the change in technology has progressed successfully, environmental damage might still occur from new technologies with a better footprint, depending on the product or industry. For remaining damages, pollution charges, prevention and compensation schemes should be continued. It might be necessary to finance "negative emissions," for example, with the planting and burial of forests (Zeng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">2008</xref>) for bio-carbon capture and storage.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec50"><title>“Clean Air traffic”: a draft</title><p id="Par334">Let us outline a model of feed-in tariffs for the airline industry as an intellectual experiment:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par335"><italic>Developing avoidance technologies</italic> Create an inventory of sustainable avoidance technologies for the technological field of air travel.

The same logic may apply today if climate protection becomes as important as military defense.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec52" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par347">The German energy transition, including the persistence with which it has been achieved, is of similar relevance as the innovations in information technology in the Silicon Valley. What distinguishes it from private innovation is its quality as an avoidance industry that arose primarily through parliamentary initiatives and decisions. The courageous, cost-based compensation schemes decided by the German Bundestag were inspired by the idea of dynamic efficiency and by the polluter-pays-principle, operating completely outside of the normal budgetary rules for governmental support. They delivered the necessary long-term support while maintaining crucial incentives that are specific to economic instruments.</p><p id="Par348">The decisive factor for success was not research but to a much larger extent, as the term <italic>learning curve</italic> suggests, market introduction, scaling of volume including priority access to the grid. With a variety of coalitions, the German Bundestag maintained these financial conditions for initially expensive “alternatives” over time, until they achieved a cost-effective, mainstream status and were able to conquer energy technology markets worldwide.</p><p id="Par349">It was a stroke of luck that the actual trigger for this energy sector transformation was based on broad opposition against nuclear energy. Nuclear energy was politically battered in Germany after the catastrophe at Chernobyl. It has never achieved the strategic position it has in France or Great Britain, where it is part of military strategy. Nuclear power stations always had smaller market shares than coal-fired power stations in Germany. If the energy transition had been directed against the German coal complex from the outset, it might have failed due to political resistance long before renewable energy reached a competitive status.</p><p id="Par350">The importance of this political constellation is particularly evident when compared with the pitiful failure of the German car industry, which was unable to transfer the achievements of clean power from renewable energy to the transport sector on its own. It only switched to a sustainable energy supply for vehicle production later, when it was under pressure from foreign competition and after fatal criminal machinations around diesel emissions and IT-malware in its cars.</p><p id="Par351">From the German energy transition, we can learn that avoidance schemes can be highly successful and may be transferred into new sectors of the economy. For this to happen, the institutional backing of circular economy principles at a constitutional level is advantageous. Or at the very least, individual sector transitions should be supported by legislation based on PPP-deliberations, keeping long-term support systems outside of fiscal budgetary mechanisms.</p><p id="Par352">Perhaps in the future, every economic sector or market will need institutional arrangements with supervisory duties similar to the “forestry service” of the Swiss Forestry Act. The task would be to.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par353">analyze sustainability gaps along the supply chain and consult science, industry and NGOs;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par354">provide sufficient funding for the market introduction of new technologies or processes that prevent externalities, at least in the initial innovation phase, and</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par355">make financial resources available on the basis of an industry-wide cost allocational fee until these techniques have passed the learning curve, whereupon they become a least cost "best practice," as demonstrated by renewable energies.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par356">Delegating the task of monitoring the supply chain to the individual consumers, as recommended by neoliberal economists, is not very helpful. This is because transparency at the end of the supply chain is often inadequate and ends up in a jumble of different labels, whether credible or not. Even well-intentioned consumers are often unable to judge the ecological footprint of a product and to influence a change in production methods, because responsibility ultimately lies with companies and because the entry costs for the latter are often too high to launch expensive innovations against competitors.</p><p id="Par357">Self-regulation is certainly an ideal solution. The efforts and scope for action of ESG-oriented investment funds and ESG-oriented corporations should not be underestimated. However, there are sectors—first and foremost the suppliers of fossil and nuclear energy sources—that remain categorically opposed to reform decade after decade and where efforts to find alternatives within the sector are futile.</p><p id="Par358">This means that the responsibility for solving environmental problems falls primarily back on political authorities. Whereas the economy does not in itself guarantee a circular flow of materials and sustainable production methods, it is they who can prescribe and finance this, and ESG-friendly companies and investors might join these efforts by launching partnerships with state agencies delegated to realize circular economy material flows.</p><p id="Par359">The classic approach of the Pigou tax falls short in this respect. The aim must not be to tax damage, but to prevent damage by innovations and rearrangements of production and processes. To achieve this, it is important to find partners in the economy and to give them the opportunity to bring their products to market while shielding them against economic disadvantages.</p><p id="Par360">In the case of renewable energy, this was guaranteed thanks to the resolutions of the German Bundestag, supported by a competent industry, committed research institutions in Germany and around the world and hundreds of thousands of citizens who dedicated themselves to the adventure of decentralized energy production long before it became a standard.</p><p id="Par361">The German example also shows that the omnipresent cost argument against such new environmental economic instruments has, in reality, been overcome. In the foreseeable future, Germany will have not only the cleanest but also one of the most competitive energy industry, and the innovations and implications of the German energy revolution will open up new market opportunities and a variety of other possibilities for the production of circular material flows and the reduction of emissions and hazardous waste.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec id="FPar01"><title>Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest</title><p>Rudolf Rechsteiner (1958), economist (Ph.D.), has been engaged in environmental policy as a member of Parliaments on national and provincial levels in Switzerland since 1988 (State Parliament Basel-Stadt 1988–1999, 2012–2018, National Parliament 1995–2010). He is a member of the board of Basel utility Industrielle Werke Basel (IWB), committed to a 100% re-newable and carbon neutral energy provision. Before he was a board member and president of ADEV Energy cooperative, engaged in investments of distributed solar, wind, combined heat-and-power (CHP) and hydro investments. Today Rudolf Rechsteiner is president of Ethos Foundation, Geneva, engaged in responsible investments and pooling stock voting power of some 230 Swiss pension funds. As a member of the Parliament Committee on energy and environment he was a supporter of market reforms in energy; he co-authored the Swiss Electricity Act which successfully introduced liberalization in the power sector and feed-in-tariffs (2008). He promoted the law on a Swiss carbon tax by launching popular initiatives for referenda on incentive taxes on nonrenewable energy. On a local level he intro-duced an incentive levy on electricity of CHF 0.05/kWh with a “power dividend” reimbursement for households and companies in Basel-Stadt (1999) and he was a co-author of the revised Basel Energy Act (2016) which practically banned new oil and gas heating systems from 2018. As a member of Eurosolar (a German NGO) he was in continuous discussions with Hermann Scheer (1944–2010) and Hans-Josef Fell, co-authors of the German EEG (2000). He supported the launch of IRENA (International Renewable Energy Agency) including financial support from Switzerland. In 2003 he published the book „Grün gewinnt – Die letzte Ölkrise und danach” [Green Wins — The Last Oil Crisis and After] predicting 100$/barrel crude oil by 2010 based on depletion curves of oil and gas fields, and he projected an unstoppable rise of renewable energy while fossil fuels would disappear. In 2009 Rudolf Rechsteiner published the book Wind Power in Context with a perception of exponential growth for wind and solar power and he criticized the annual Energy Outlook of the International Energy Agency (IEA) which since decades is predicting stagnating contributions of renewable energy output. In 2012 Rudolf Rechsteiner published the book “100 Prozent erneuerbar” (Orell Füssli, Zürich) on the phase-out of fossil and nuclear energy by an energy system based on 100% renewable energy output and efficiency.
