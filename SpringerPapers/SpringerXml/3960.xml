However, fast recombination of photogenerated charge carriers in these frameworks remains the most significant limitation for their photocatalytic application. Although the construction of homojunctions is a promising solution, it remains very challenging to synthesize them. Herein, we report a well-defined hierarchical homojunction based on metal–organic frameworks via a facile one-pot synthesis route directed by hollow transition metal nanoparticles. The homojunction is enabled by two concentric stacked nanoplates with slightly different crystal phases. The enhanced charge separation in the homojunction was visualized by in-situ surface photovoltage microscopy. Moreover, the as-prepared nanostacks displayed a visible-light-driven carbon dioxide reduction with very high carbon monooxide selectivity, and excellent stability. Our work provides a powerful platform to synthesize capable metal–organic framework complexes and sheds light on the hierarchical structure-function relationships of metal–organic frameworks.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Homojunctions are very promising in photocatalysis, but challenging to achieve.

In virtue of the tailorable chemistry, uniform porosity, and ordered crystalline structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, MOFs have shown great potential in catalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Unlike traditional bulk MOFs with a broad size distribution spanning several orders of magnitude (from millimeter to nanometer), reducing the size of MOFs to nanoscale in one or more dimensions exhibits advantages such as accelerated adsorption–desorption kinetics and promoted mass transfer in catalysis. It also allows for the construction of well-defined hierarchical nanostructures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, which has significance for in-depth understanding of MOFs’ structure-function relationships and achieving high catalytic activity. However, it is still challenging to build MOFs with precisely controllable complex structures in nanoscale.</p><p id="Par4">Photocatalytic conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to chemical fuels using sustainable and abundant solar energy is attractive for relieving both global warming and energy issues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Much effort has been devoted to developing MOFs-based semiconductors for photocatalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. However, the severe recombination of photogenerated carriers and poor selectivity toward reaction products limited their practical application<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Homojunctions, composed of semiconductors with analogous composition but different energy levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, have attracted more and more attention for their superior capability of promoting charge separation as compared to traditional heterojunctions in recent years, due to their features of faster carrier transfer through chemically similar interfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Although some organic- and inorganic-based homojunctions have been well developed, to the best of our knowledge, promising versatile MOF-based hierarchical structures have not yet been successfully exploited in homojunctions. Besides, most of the reported homojunctions involve elaborate multiple-step manipulation, such as copper-surface-mediated laser coupling method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, combined deposition processing approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and programmed exfoliation procedure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Thus, it is of considerable significance to develop MOF-based homojunctions in nanoscale through simple synthesis for boosting the conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> and further, extending the homojunction family.</p><p id="Par5">Here, we report a highly orientated phase-enabled MOF homojunction with a well-defined junction interface for visible-light-driven CO<sub>2</sub> reduction. It is well known that the dynamic feature of supramolecular coordination bonds in MOFs allows metal nanoparticles (NPs) to react with MOFs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Metal NPs can be either embedded into MOFs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> or loaded on the surface of MOFs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Herein, we creatively developed a transition metal NPs-directed MOFs growth route to create, in one step, a MOF homojunction composed of two stacked concentric MOF nanoplates with the same orientation and uniform size. The nanoplates had analogous cobalt porphyrin composition but slightly different crystal structure and varied energy level alignments. Meanwhile, in situ surface photovoltage microscopy (SPVM) images<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, obtained through integrating Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM)) with appropriate light illumination, visually and straightforwardly revealed the light-induced charge separation between the two stacked nanoplates in MOF nanostructures. The as-prepared MOF nanoplate-based homojunctions demonstrated ca. 2.5 times enhanced CO<sub>2</sub> reduction to CO, over single MOF nanoplates, in water under visible light and high stability for at least 22 h. Importantly, the high selectivity (ca. 100%) of our system toward CO synthesis in water media surpassed the overwhelming majority of photocatalysts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Synthesis and characterization of Co-MOF</title><p id="Par6">The dynamic feature of supramolecular coordination bonds in MOFs allows metal NPs to direct MOFs’ synthesis through metal node exchange. One of the determining factors of the node exchange consists in the relative strength of coordination bonds between metal nodes and organic linkers. Generally, stronger coordination bonds can gain a competitive edge over weaker coordination bonds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. In MOFs, metal ions interact with –COOH in the organic linker of tetrakis (4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (TCPP) in the most common form of –(COO)<sub>4</sub>M<sub>2</sub> (M=Co, Au, Ag) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). It is well known that the d-band position of transition metals plays an important role when metals interplay with oxygen (O) atoms or molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Hence, density-functional theory (DFT) was used to investigate the d-band position of transition metals in Co-MOF, Ag-MOFs, and Au-MOFs. The d orbital projected densities of states of M in –(COO)<sub>4</sub>M<sub>2</sub> are plotted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>. A higher <italic>d</italic>-band center (<italic>E</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub>) of Co (−1.20 eV) in –(COO)<sub>4</sub>Co<sub>2</sub> than Au (−2.93 eV) in –(COO)<sub>4</sub>Au<sub>2</sub> and Ag (−2.69 eV) in –(COO)<sub>4</sub>Ag<sub>2</sub> suggests a decrease in the filling of the (<italic>d–σ</italic>)* state and stronger bonding of Co–O than Au–O and Ag–O. Moreover, the crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) was taken to chop the total band-structure energy of –(COO)<sub>4</sub>M<sub>2</sub> into specified M–O interactions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Co–O shows the highest intensity of integrated COHP (1.086 eF) than Ag–O (0.487 eF) and Au–O (0.637 eF), further revealing the stronger bonding of Co–O and less destabilized feature of –(COO)<sub>4</sub>Co<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Thus we decided to use weaker-interacting, transition metal Au/Ag NPs as potential inducers. Further considering cost effectiveness, we designed hollow, instead of solid, Au/Ag nanocubes to induce the growth of cobalt MOFs in this work.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Structural and elemental analysis of Co-MOF-3 nanostacks.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic illustrations of –(COO)<sub>4</sub>M<sub>2</sub> (M=Co, Au, Ag). <bold>b</bold> PDOS of <italic>d</italic>-band of M in –(COO)<sub>4</sub>M<sub>2</sub> (up: spin up, down: spin down) and corresponding caculated d-band center values.

From the TEM image (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>), we can clearly see the hollow structure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>) and element dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>) confirmed the co-existence of Au and Ag in the nanocubes and the Ag/Au ratio of 47:53. The preset amount of hollow Au/Ag nanocubes was then added into the MOF precursor solution to initiate the MOF synthesis reaction. As a result, three different samples, here named Co-MOF-1, Co-MOF-2, and Co-MOF-3, with different morphologies were formed by just adjusting the amount (1, 2, and 5 μmol) of hollow Au/Ag nanocubes. The red shift of the Söret band in the ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption spectra of three MOFs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>) suggested the formation of coordination polymers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. As shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>, the Raman spectra of Co-MOFs are similar but quite different from that of the TCPP monomer ranging from 1500 to 1800 cm<sup>−1</sup>, suggesting the coordination of -COOH in TCPP with Co atoms in the Co-MOFs, and similar chemical bonding in Co-MOFs.</p><p id="Par8">A typical TEM image of Co-MOF-1 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>) reveals its morphology, mainly single square nanoplates plus a small number of rectangular ones with their lateral size ranging from 200 to 300 nm, and its high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) and a single set of selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern suggested single crystal feature (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>). After we increased the Ag/Au NPs to 2 μmol, a few stacked MOFs appeared in resultant Co-MOF-2, but most of the MOFs were still single unstacked small nanoplates (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>). When the Ag/Au NPs reached 5 μmol, Co-MOF-3 with two well-stacked concentric-aligned MOF nanoplates with identical orientation were formed, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>. Scanning electron microscopes (SEM) image (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>) and 3D TEM image (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>) confirmed the stacked structure and excluded the possibility of a core-shell structure. 3D topography reconstruction (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g–j</xref> and Supplementary Movie <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">1</xref>) suggested that the smaller nanoplate was partially embedded into the large nanoplate. Such a well-defined unique structure is very rare in either heterojunctions or homojucntions, since it is still very challenging to control the relative orientations of the two components at their interface. An AFM image of Co-MOF-3 nanoplates implies that the lateral sizes were much larger than the heights of both large and small nanoplates (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>). AFM (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref>) and SEM (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>) images of a single Co-MOF-3 particle with the small nanoplate removed, showed a reduction in height ca. 27 nm in the center of the large nanoplate, suggesting that the smaller nanoplate was partially embedded into the large nanoplate, instead of merely stacking on the surface, thereby producing an intimate and robust junction interface between the two.</p><p id="Par9">Moreover, a high-angle annular dark-field (HADDF) image of a representative Co-MOF-3 nanostack (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1k</xref>) and the corresponding EDS element mapping analysis of C (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1l</xref>), Co (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1m</xref>), O (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1o</xref>), N (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1p</xref>), and Ag (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1q</xref>) were conducted. The C, Co, O, and N elements were found to be evenly distributed in both large and small nanoplates in Co-MOF-3, suggesting a uniform Co-MOF composition. However, no detectable signal from Ag or Au elements indicates that the hollow Au/Ag nanocubes only acted as an inducer for the synthesis of MOF nanostacks, in line with EDS spectra (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14</xref>). Meanwhile, the XPS spectrum of Co-MOF-3 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">15</xref>) suggested the presence of Co element, but no apparent Au and Ag elements left in the samples. Besides, the ratios of integrated peaks of Co K series to N K series (Co/N), O K series (Co/O), and C K series (Co/C) from mapping images of different Co-MOF-3 nanoplates were calculated and are listed in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1r</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>. It can be seen that the ratios of Co/N, Co/O, and Co/C in the central part of three randomly selected Co-MOF-3 nanostacks were consistently higher than those in the peripheral part, suggesting a slightly higher Co content in smaller nanoplates than large ones.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Crystal structure, and optical and electronic properties of Co-MOF-3 nanostacks</title><p id="Par10">The atomic structure of one typical Co-MOF-3 nanostack was investigated by SAED, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>.

From the HR-TEM image (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>) of the interface between the central and peripheral parts, a certain dislocation at the interface was observed.

Moreover, two sets of interplanar distances were also noticed for (110), (200), (210), (220) crystal lattice planes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e, f</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">16</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Besides, the TEM image of one Co-MOF-3 nanoplate with a missing central part (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">17a, b, d–g</xref>) shows continuous crystal lattice fringes with the same distance, and the corresponding Fast Fourier Transform image (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">17c</xref>) exhibits only a single set of (100) diffraction spots. Furthermore, we have done extensive searching under TEM and finally found several small plates with a similar size of MOF(s). Their corresponding SAED (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">18</xref>) also agrees well with that of the MOF(s), suggesting that they may be the small plates falling down from the Co-MOF-3 stacks. All these observations further verified our proposed structure. All these data confirmed that two nanoplates in the Co-MOF-3 nanostacks had slightly different crystal cell parameters. Although we had also tried the XRD characterization of MOFs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">19</xref>), unfortunately, the XRD patterns are noisy and not good enough to verify the crystal structure. There may be two reasons; one is that the long-range order in MOF or COF NPs is often not good as the bulk materials. The other possible explanation is that although the Ag/Au NPs and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) in this system are very effective for regulating and controlling MOFs’ morphology, they inevitably decreased the crystalline degree of MOF NPs.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Crystal structure of Co-MOF-3 nanostacks.</title><p><bold>a</bold> TEM image and <bold>b</bold>, <bold>c</bold> the corresponding SAED from the central (position 1 in <bold>a</bold>) and peripheral (position 2 in <bold>a</bold>) areas of Co-MOF-3, respectively. <bold>d</bold> HR-TEM image of the epitaxial inteface between the central and peripheral parts (yellow polygons represent interfacial dislocation). <bold>e</bold>, <bold>f</bold> Enlarged lattice image of position 1 in <bold>d</bold> and position 2 in <bold>d</bold>, respectively. <bold>g</bold> Cystal structural model of the smaller MOF, named MOF(s), in nanostacked Co-MOF-3. <bold>h</bold> Cystal structural model of the larger MOF, named MOF(l).

Considering the charge transfer mainly happens at the contact interface, the interfacial electronic structures of monolayer MOF(l) and MOF(s) were investigated using total densities of states (TDOS) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2j, k</xref>), respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Moreover, the bandgap of 2D MOF(s) and 2D MOF(l) was calculated to be 1.48 and 1.92 eV, respectively. The higher conduction band minimum (CBM, −0.99 eV) and lower valence band maximum (VBM, 0.93 eV) of MOF(l) than those of MOF(s) indicate the formation of the type-II homojunction (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2l</xref>). Thus, MOF(l) can transfer electrons to MOF(s) while holes transport in the opposite direction, so as to promote the charge separation in a photochemical reaction. Besides, the bandgap of 3D MOF(l) and MOF(s) are only a little smaller than corresponding 2D ones, and their relative band alignment is very similar (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">24</xref>). It should be noted that MOF(s) was partially embedded into MOF(l). Thus, photogenerated charges cannot only transport in the vertical direction but also the horizontal direction, as shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">25</xref>, which is rare for epitaxial heterojunctions and homojunctions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par12">The experimental bandgap of Co-MOF-3 was determined to be 1.46 eV from UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra and the Tauc plot (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">26</xref>), which is close to the calculated bandgap of 2D MOF(s) (1.28 eV).

Besides, there is neither the Co–Co interaction peak at 2.15 Å nor other high-shell peaks in the EXAFS spectra of Co-MOF-3, further confirming that no heavy backscattering atoms (Co) are connected to Co sites. Moreover, the local environment of the Co atoms was determined using the phase shift, and amplitude functions of Co–N contribution and Co–C contribution generated using MOF(s) structure, and the coordination number of Co atoms in Co-MOF-3 is found to be 5. It should be noted that it is very challenging to distinguish first-row ligands (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine) using EXAFS since the photoelectron scattering function is weakly dependent on the Z number. Therefore, we can conclude that the samples present approximately five neighbors in the first shell, but we cannot affirm which atoms (O or N) are present since they would give a similar result. Thus the pillar structure of Co-MOF-3 was confirmed.</p><p id="Par15">Besides, the carbon K-edge core-loss mapping (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">28a–c</xref>) and spectra (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">28d</xref>) were obtained from electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. The stronger carbon element signal of raw data in the central part of position 1 than in the peripheral part of position 2 is mainly due to the center part’s relatively higher thickness (see 3D TEM reconstruction, AFM, and SEM images). To eliminate the effect of thickness, the carbon K-edge core-loss EELS image and spectra were normalized by the integral signal, extracted with background removal, and smoothed by the Gaussian fitting method. Normalized carbon <italic>K</italic>-edge from the core-loss EELS mapping and spectra are shown in Supplementary Fig <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">28e, f</xref>, and it is possible to observe the differences between the edges’ response intensity. Less carbon element signal was observed in the central part of position 1 than in the peripheral part of position 2, which suggested that the C content in the former is smaller than in the latter, in good agreement with our EDS elemental analysis in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1r</xref>.

Bulk plasmon bands of edge and center regions were extracted from the corresponding pixels in the raw dataset and then smoothed by the Gaussian method (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>).

The bulk plasmon peak positions of the edge and center regions were found slightly shifted, suggesting the difference of the valence electron density between MOF(s) in center and MOF(l) in center and edge in Co-MOF-3 nanostack. We further mapped the low-loss EELS dataset of Co-MOF-3 in 2–35-eV energy range by applying non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>.

It should be noted that although 2–4 eV (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>) is due to the tail of the zero loss-peak not bulk plasmon, it supports the three components (center, edge, and substrate) in a whole STEM/EELS view. The different variation trend of relative intensity of two target components (center and edge) in these energy ranges straightforwardly confirmed center/edge difference in terms of valence electron density.</p><p id="Par17">As shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">29</xref>, there are two peaks in the fluorescence (FL) spectrum of a single Co-MOF-3 nanostack excited at 450 nm. One is at 430–470 nm, which should be ascribed to triplet-triplet annihilation produced S2 emission (S2–S0), and the other is at 600–730 nm of S1–S0 emission. Furthermore, much lower intensity of S2 emission than S1 emission suggests the efficient charge transfer between porphyrins in MOFs. From Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3h–j</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">30</xref>, and Supplementary Movie <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">2</xref>, we can see that the FL intensity for both S1 and S2 emission in the center is much higher than the edge part in the Co-MOF-3. To exclude the effect of thickness, we have quantitatively measured the FL intensity profile from one Co-MOF-3 nanostack. It was found that the intensity ratio of the center to edge in the nanostack reached ca. 85.2:28.1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3k</xref>), which is much higher than the thickness ratio (1:1.3–1.6) of center to edge in the Co-MOF-3 based on the AFM measurements and 3D reconstruction. Therefore, the FL intensity difference should not mainly result from the thickness difference. Higher FL intensity of MOF(s) than MOF(l) further suggested the difference in quenching rates attributed to differences in the free energies of electron transfer between porphyrin molecules in MOFs. A much remarkable quenching of red FL than blue FL in MOF(l) compared with MOF(s) suggested the more S1–S0 state quenching than S2–S0 in the former, which may be affected by the charge transfer between MOF(s) and MOF(l) at the junction and self-quenching properties of these two MOFs due to the different molecular arrangement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Formation mechanism of Co-MOF-3 nanostacks</title><p id="Par18">The formation mechanism of asymmetric (in the thickness direction) Co-MOF-3 nanostacks was revealed by tracking intermediate evolution in time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. At the very beginning, organic porphyrin molecules are easily absorbed onto the surface of Au/Ag nanocubes through the interaction of Au/Ag with COO– or Au/Ag and π electron interaction in porphyrin and then prearrange through self-assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. The porphyrins are generally prearranged on the surface of Au or Ag as a form of inclined configuration with shorter center distance than free self-assembly due to restricted arrangement, and it is the same as what we have observed in MOF(s). The role of hollow Au/Ag nanocubes as self-assembly inducer was confirmed by more TEM observations of Co-MOF-3 nanostacks (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">31</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">32</xref>).

Meanwhile, free TCPP molecules and Co<sup>2+</sup> in the solution formed the second nanoplate of MOF(l) on the 001 facet of the primary nanoplate, which act as a substrate due to similar composition (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">34</xref>).

Considering the more thermodynamically stable crystal structure of MOF(l), the growth speed of MOF(l) should be faster than MOF(s). Subsequently, both layers continued to grow, mainly in two dimensions due to the attachment of PVP in (100) surface.

It indicates that the CO<sub>2</sub> reduction tends to occur on the N<sub>4</sub>Co sites. Meanwhile, because it protects O<sub>4</sub>Co as the node and linker of MOFs from damage in the process of catalysis, the photocatalytic durability of Co-MOF-3 is thus achieved. Besides, the CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption energies onto the N<sub>5</sub>Co sites are quite small (ca. 0.08 eV), suggesting good adsorption capacility of Co-MOF-3. Meanwhile, the required H<sup>+</sup> transfer energy from an intermediate of *CO<sub>2</sub> to *COOH is about 0.42 eV over MOF(s)_N<sub>5</sub>Co, which is much smaller than the energy barrier of H<sup>+</sup> reduction to H<sub>2</sub> (0.87 eV, Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>), which well explains the observed high CO selectivity for Co-MOF-3 over the hydrogen evolution reaction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par28">In summary, we report a “transition metal NPs-directed MOF growth” process to construct well-defined MOF NPs-based homojunctions for visible-light-driven CO<sub>2</sub> reduction.

The two constituent nanoplates showed slightly different chemical compositions and crystal structures, and thereby different energy levels. This Janus structure displayed visible-light-driven CO<sub>2</sub> reduction to CO in water with enhancement factor of 2.5 as compared with the case of single nanoplates, due to the formation of the unique homojunction of the hierarchical MOF NPs. It also exhibited excellent stability for at least 22 h during the continuous photocatalytic reaction. Most importantly, the CO selectivity of the as-prepared MOF was exceptional (ca. 100%). In situ SPVM was used to monitor the photogenerated charge flow direction in single MOF nanostacks and proved the enhanced charge separation due to the formation of the homojunction. The promoted separation of photogenerated charge carriers was verified by time-resolved FL lifetime and electrochemical impedance tests.

Lifetime measurements were carried out with the same excitation wavelength and at the emission wavelength of 650 nm using a time-resolved FL spectro-fluorometer (USA/CAN Photon Technology International Int.). Instrument response function was monitored to confirm the effectiveness of the measured FL lifetimes. The lifetimes of Co-MOFs were estimated through a double-exponential fitting.

We used a the double-pass technique, mechanically oscillating the cantilever at its first (fundamental) resonance (between 75 and 85 kHz, tip-dependent) for topography imaging in the first pass, and electrostatically oscillating the cantilever at the same frequency in the second pass while tracing the topography at a lift height of 30 nm. The amplitude of the AC excitation applied was 1 V. And the Co-MOF-3 dispersion samples were dropped onto conductive HOPG support. The LED laser powers of 5, 15, 50 W were used to irradiate the samples. The direction of light irradiation was almost parallel to the HOPG plate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>XAS characterization of Co-MOFs</title><p id="Par37">XANES and EXAFS were measured at the beamline 20-ID-C of the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. A Si (111) double-crystal monochromator and focused beam (beam footprint on the sample of ∼500 μm (<italic>v</italic>) × 1000 μm (<italic>h</italic>)) were used to perform the measurements at Co <italic>K</italic>-edge (7709 eV). Harmonic rejection was facilitated by detuning 15% of the beam intensity at 500 eV above the edge of interest. Data were collected in transmission mode using ionization chambers filled with He. The sample was spread and sealed using Kapton<sup>®</sup> tape, and the surface was tilted 45° to the incoming beam. EXAFS oscillations were extracted using Athena code and analyzed using Arthemis software. The local environments of the Co atoms were determined using the phase shift and amplitude functions of Co–N contribution and Co–C contribution generated using MOF(s) structure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Low-loss and core-loss EELS</title><p id="Par38">TEM measurements were performed with JEOL JEM-2100 PLUS at 200 kV equipped with an in-column energy filter providing an energy resolution better than 150 meV.
