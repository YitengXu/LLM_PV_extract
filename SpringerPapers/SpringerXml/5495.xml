These devices have been designed to mimic solar energy conversion processes from photosynthetic organisms (the most efficient energy transduction phenomenon observed in nature) with the aid of low-cost materials. Recently, light-harvesting complexes (LHC) have been proposed as potential dyes in DSSCs based on their higher light-absorption efficiencies as compared to synthetic dyes. In this work, photo-electrochemical hybrid devices were rationally designed by adding for the first time Leu and Lys tags to heterologously expressed light-harvesting proteins from <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, thus allowing their proper orientation and immobilization on graphene electrodes. The light-harvesting complex 4 from <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> (LHC4) was initially expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, purified via affinity chromatography and subsequently immobilized on plasma-treated thin-film graphene electrodes. A photocurrent density of 40.30 ± 9.26 μA/cm<sup>2</sup> was measured on devices using liquid electrolytes supplemented with a phosphonated viologen to facilitate charge transfer. Our results suggest that a new family of graphene-based thin-film photovoltaic devices can be manufactured from rationally tagged LHC proteins and opens the possibility to further explore fundamental processes of energy transfer for biological components interfaced with synthetic materials.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2020_Article_60408.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Decarbonization of the global energy production represents one of the major issues in current research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, which has resulted in the extensive development of fuels-free technologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. As the highly explored technology, solar cells have been shown to be the most promising solution to address the carbonization problem for which three generations of these devices have been sequentially developed throughout the last half-century<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Within the third generation of photovoltaic solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been proposed as the future devices as a consequence of both a low <italic>pay-back time</italic> and a low <italic>carbon footprint</italic> manufacture. Also, their ability to mimic the photosynthetic transduction of photons into electrons has been considered a key attribute for an exceptional performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Moreover, the capability to separate and reuse their components made DSSCs a remarkable eco-friendly alternative for solar energy utilization.</p><p id="Par3">Recent studies on DSSC performance have shown energy conversion efficiencies of around 14%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, which could be further improved by fine-tuning the assembly of dyes and electrodes, which are considered critical components for superior transduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In order to manufacture a DSSC, dyes, and electrodes are required to allow light-induced charge separation through the conjugation interface. Recently, the advantage of using eco-friendly materials as potential dyes and electrodes has been reviewed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Among the emerging eco-friendly dyes, photosynthetic proteins have been recently used to design photosynthetic machinery-based DSSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In this regard, light-harvesting complexes (LHC) have been proposed as potential dyes for the production of DSSCs due to their ability to efficiently capture solar radiation in the visible region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Core reaction centers and whole photosystems have been also incorporated into hybrid solar transduction devices as the main DSSCs dyes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, LHCs, as single proteins, have been shown to maintain their ability for light capturing in isolation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> i.e., in the absence of interactions within the monomeric subunits. This independence represents an easier/inexpensive alternative to engineer DSSCs.</p><p id="Par4">LHC proteins have been obtained from different photosynthetic organisms including bacteria such as <italic>Rhodobacter spp</italic>. and higher plants such as. <italic>Pisum sativum</italic> and <italic>Spinacia spp</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Surprisingly, the utilization of LHCs derived from algae in DSSCs has been poorly explored despite the abundant information available regarding the properties and energy transduction capabilities of the photosystems of these organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. For instance, the photosystems from the model algae <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> are well-described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The photosystem I of this algae has been shown to contain nine LHCs where LHCA2, 4 and 9 were found to have the greater amount of <italic>red forms</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> (i.e., chlorophylls with a redshifted light behavior) that lightly enlarge their absorption spectrum.</p><p id="Par5">The potential for using protein-based dyes (e.g., LHCs from <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>) instead of traditional synthetic light-harvesters is enabled by their feasibility to be produced by recombinant expression in model microorganisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Research in this area is, however, still at its infancy and only a few studies have attempted to explore this potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. An advantage of recombinant LHCs is the possibility to develop protein engineering routes to improve their activity and facilitate their controlled deposition or immobilization within DSSCs. Thus far, specific tags have been only added to LHCs to facilitate their downstream processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, however, the potential of using tags to favor specific immobilization/orientation remains largely unexplored.</p><p id="Par6">As mentioned before, in order to drive a photovoltaic behavior in DSSCs, an electrode is also required to separate the light-induced charge from LHCs. Traditionally, DSSCs have made use of 2D semiconductor materials as electrodes mainly because they have been widely studied at a fundamental level. Some of the semiconductor materials that have been successfully assembled into DSSCs include quantum dots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, carbon nanotubes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, and nanoparticles such as ZnO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> and TiO2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">Recently, graphene has been used as electrode due to its unique properties (e.g., high electrical conductivity and large carbon lattice structure), which can be even further tuned according to its specific application<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Even though pristine graphene is not a semiconductor, a controlled mechanism such as surface oxidation might be used to open its electronic band-gap, which in turn allows a further surface charge separation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Thus far, no reports are available on the potential of graphene as a substrate for the immobilization of light-harvesting proteins. This work is therefore aimed at rationally designing hybrid photo-electrochemical devices using graphene-based electrodes as a platform for the immobilization of recombinantly-expressed tagged <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> LHCA proteins for solar energy capture and photocurrent generation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>A rationally engineered platform for the production of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> light-harvesting proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic> was assembled</title><p id="Par8">A current challenge for the application of light-harvesting complexes in DSSCs is the development of strategies for low-cost production of such proteins at large scale, which might eventually facilitate their study and field implementation. In this regard, microbial biofactories have been proposed as potential platforms for the production of light-harvesting complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>; however, research and development in this area is still in its infancy. Thus, the majority of reported studies have used light-harvesting complexes from bacteria and higher plants, and little is known about the potential of light-harvesting complexes from other photosynthetic microorganisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In this work, a biofactory for the heterologous production of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> light-harvesting proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic> has been rationally designed and constructed. Initially, two expression cassettes (Cassette1 and Cassette2) were designed based on two configurations as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>. Both cassettes were placed on expression vectors pET6xHN-C and pET6xHN-N as described above. The topology of the resulting plasmids is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>. These plasmids (pET6xHN-C::Cassette1 and pET6xHN-N::Cassette2) were used to construct the strains <italic>E. coli</italic>_pETC-<italic>LHCA4</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>_pETN-<italic>LHCA4</italic>, respectively. After inducing both cultures with IPTG, the purified proteins were evaluated by SDS-PAGE.

Proteins were designed to fulfill the following two conditions: (i) the photo-active region of proteins must be oriented towards the light source when immobilized on the EEG-based electrodes. This condition was selected because light-harvesting proteins have been reported to exhibit an orientation-dependent photocurrent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. The proper orientation was achieved by using a hydrophobic 10xLeu tag flanking the proteins, as it offers the possibility for a preferential orientation of the photo-active region when suspended in the aqueous electrolyte prior to immobilization. (ii) Proteins must be able to properly conjugate to EEG-based substrates through covalent bonding. The free amine groups from the 10xLys tag also flanking the proteins lead to the formation of an amide bond with the free carboxyl groups on the surface of EEG-based electrodes.

For both set of devices, photocurrent measurements in PEC devices assembled in the absence of both protein and PV revealed the presence of a background photocurrent (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>), which could be attributed to the basal activity of electrodes. In this regard, it has been recently shown that graphene display photocurrent in isolation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Basal photocurrent also varied according to the electrolyte composition within the microampere range (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Additionally, photocurrent was measured in PEC devices where PV was stacked and compared to devices where PV was in suspension (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Devices with stacked PV showed higher basal photocurrents as compared to devices with PV in suspension regardless of the electrolyte composition. This might be explained by the coulombic interactions of reduced PV species near the space-charge layer that lead to their oxidation and transport of the extracted electron through the external circuit. This result agrees well with an observed red-shift in the absorption spectrum of the PV molecule when stacked on the EEG-based electrode (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>). Another likely explanation of the high photocurrent observed could be related to the thickness of the surface coating of PV, which in turn might be due to the used dip coating deposition technique, which might ultimately endow a more pronounced semiconductor-like behavior to the EEG-based electrode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Consequently, the observed photocurrent for devices where PV was in suspension was lower when compared to devices with stacked PV. This can be explained by the fact that a lower amount of suspended PV resulted in a reduced number of charge separation reactions in the vicinity of the photoanode.</p><p id="Par17">In order to determine the role of engineered proteins on charge separation events, photocurrent was measured for PEC devices in the presence of protein (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). These devices were assembled using 0.1 M KCl and 0.1 M PV as PV-supplemented electrolyte which was set up as the fixed condition in the second set of DSSCs devices due to both the previously reported interaction between light-harvesting proteins and viologen molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and the change in transmittance when using I<sub>2</sub> and PV in the same electrolyte solution. As light-harvesting proteins require pigments to enable charge transfer upon light exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, pigments from <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> were isolated and subsequently used for protein reconstitution. Chlorophyll a and b and carotenoids were extracted from algae pellets as described in the experimental section. The reconstitution of proteins with pigments was carried out after protein immobilization to avoid photobleaching of pigments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Even though the electrolyte composition was fixed in these protein-based devices, pigments were placed on PECs at three different points during the preparation of the devices considering that such a dependence has not been previously reported (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>): (1) along with proteins in solution before immobilization, (2) diluted in the electrolyte after immobilization, and (3) added to the PEC by both methods. Our data showed an enhanced photocurrent in protein-based PECs containing pigments as compared to protein-based PECs alone (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). This observation suggests a light-induced charge transfer from the proteins to the photoanode (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref>). This agrees well with recent experimental evidence that indicates that light-harvesting proteins play a role in charge transfer that is different from that observed in photosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. DSSCs based on photosynthetic proteins have been observed to generate a photocurrent because they are assembled with photosystems I or II where charge transfer has been described to be driven by the reaction center<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. In this study, the charge separation reaction takes place at the interface with the electrode where the energy from extracted pigments (i.e., chlorophylls and carotenoids) has been funneled by the LHC and subsequently separated at the surface of the graphene thin-film. This process is driven by the proteins in the presence of an electric potential gradient (i.e. the space charge layer on the EEG surface). This interaction agrees with the observation that pigments alone fail to generate any photocurrent (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S5</xref>).</p><p id="Par18">Additional absorption spectroscopy of the assembled photoanodes was carried out to study interaction between the LHCA4 proteins and the pigments (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>). The absorption spectra in each device was de-convoluted to identify a likely interaction, however, no red-shift was observed. This result agrees well with the small photoactive area which might be responsible for the scarce light-transfer events at the interface thereby leading to no observable interaction. Moreover, the pigments were assembled with the LHCA4 proteins without an unfolding experimental procedure thus leading to a relatively weak interaction. In this regard, additional characterization of low-range interactions is required to understand the charge-transfer mechanism between the pigments throughout the LHCA4 protein.</p><p id="Par19">Photocurrent on protein-based PECs was observed to depend on the assembled protein, which seems to suggest a strong dependence on its orientation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. The protein C-LHCA4 was designed to locate the N-terminal of LHCA4 towards the light source while the protein N-LHCA4 was designed to position backward. The photocurrent was found to be higher in devices with immobilized C-LHCA4 regardless of the step at which the pigments were added to the PECs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). The crystallographic structure and photoactive region of the photosystem I of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> have been elucidated very recently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Our results agree with Xiaodong <italic>et al</italic>. observations according to which light-capturing proceeds from the N-terminal region of the LHCA4 complex. For this reason, the complex is oriented towards the chloroplast stroma where light reaches the photosystem I. Our engineered design with Lysine and Leucine tags flanking the proteins appeared useful to immobilize LHCA4 proteins in an orientation for maximal light capturing and transfer.</p><p id="Par20">Furthermore, photocurrent magnitude varied depending on the step where pigments were added during the PEC assembly (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). The highest photocurrent density (40.30 ± 9.26 μA/cm<sup>2</sup>) was obtained for the PEC where pigments were reconstituted during immobilization of the protein complex. It is important to mention that proteins were not entirely distributed over the thin films and some areas remained uncoated, which leaves room to further improvement in the photocurrent. Additionally, when pigments were added to the electrolyte after immobilization (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>), the resulting photocurrent was the lowest. This result might be likely a consequence of the partial assembly of the pigments, most likely due to the reduced solubility and high surface tension. In addition, incubation of immobilized proteins with pigments might promote interactions with residues involved in the energy transfer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Finally, the photocurrent in PECs assembled with pigments just before and after immobilization was observed to be between both −Chlls and +Chlls, which suggests that protein functionalization is affected by the time pigments interacted with the protein before measurement.</p><p id="Par21">Incident Photon-to-electron Conversion Efficiency action spectra (IPCE) for the devices C-LHCA4 and N-LHCA4 were recorded using a similar setup (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S6</xref>). The external quantum efficiency reached values of around 50% and 60%, respectively, for wavelengths between 800–900 nm. As a point to be raised, illumination through the counter-electrode led to a higher IPCE between 400 and 700 nm for the N-LHCA4 device. This swap of the dominant wavelengths depending on the direction of illumination supported anew the effect of the protein orientation on the photocurrent performance. Additionally, an estimated Absorbed Photon-to-electron Conversion Efficiency action spectra (APCE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup> was observed to display a similar behavior when compared to the IPCE as well as few relation with the absorption spectra of the photoanodes (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>).

To conduct the conjugation, 0.04% (w/v) of protein dissolved in elution buffer was mixed under magnetic stirring at 100 rpm with 1.36% (w/v) of EDC and 1.36% (w/v) of NHS.

Immersions of the thin-film into each aqueous sample were performed at 0.5 mm/s at 0–16 °C for 24 h (~1400 cycles) with the protein solution under magnetic stirring at 100 rpm. Reactants excess was removed by additional dipping in deionized water (dH<sub>2</sub>O) and thin-films were dried out in a low-vacuum chamber at 718 mbar. Samples were stored at 4 °C until further use. Similarly, Rhodamine labeled proteins were immobilized for subsequent evaluation of the protein coverage under a ZEISS fluorescence microscope at a wavelength around 532 nm. The labeling was carried out by additional mixing of dissolved protein, EDC and NHS as previously mentioned with 1.36% (w/v) of Rhodamine.
