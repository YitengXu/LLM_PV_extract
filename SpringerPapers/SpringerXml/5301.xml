degradation in Vietnam and Thailand for centuries. In addition to an ever-increasing population density, economic transformation and market integration have exacerbated the pressure on natural resources in the rural areas of both countries, particularly during recent decades. From its beginning, the Uplands Program has sought to address research questions related to the impacts of land use management on natural resource degradation at the landscape level in Southeast Asian countries, as have researchers linked to the Program in the area. Integrated modeling of land cover and land use change, as a means to simulate effects which extend over various spatial and temporal scales or scientific domains, began to play a more prominent role within the Uplands Program after 2006. This chapter highlights modeling approaches and decision support tools used as part of the Uplands Program to investigate various research questions at the human–biophysical interface, and will compare modeling approaches, looking at the issues of land use and management impacts from different angles, whereby the different focuses used by each model have resulted in different levels of detail and precision in various respects.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>chapter-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>chapter-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/978-3-642-33377-4_Chapter_10.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>output-medium</meta-name><meta-value>Online</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></book-part-meta><body><sec id="Sec00101"><title>Modeling Approaches in the Uplands Program</title><sec id="Sec00102"><title>Applications and Approaches</title><p>In the context of this chapter the term integrated modeling embraces: (a) the spatial interaction between higher and lower elevation positions in a watershed, linked by material flows of water and soil (Sect. <xref rid="Sec00105" ref-type="sec">10.2</xref>), (b) up-scaling from the plot through the catchment (up to 50 km<sup>2</sup> Sect. <xref rid="Sec00105" ref-type="sec">10.2</xref>) and on to the regional or national scales (Sect. <xref rid="Sec001020" ref-type="sec">10.3</xref>) (c) combinations of models covering different disciplines; mainly human-environment interactions (Sects. <xref rid="Sec001040" ref-type="sec">10.5</xref>, <xref rid="Sec001047" ref-type="sec">10.6</xref>, <xref rid="Sec001060" ref-type="sec">10.7</xref>, and <xref rid="Sec001068" ref-type="sec">10.8</xref>) and (d) the inclusion of innovative elements in the modeling cycle, particularly scenario building and calibration/validation (Sect. <xref rid="Sec001032" ref-type="sec">10.4</xref>).</p><p>All case studies presented deal with land cover and land use change and their impacts on natural resources as this has been a main focus of the Uplands Program (Nikolic et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001046">2008</xref>; Saint-Macary et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001063">2010</xref>; Lippe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001038">2011</xref>) and many of its partners in the region (e.g., Ziegler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001094">2007</xref>; Lusiana et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001039">2011</xref>; Pansak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001050">2010</xref>) and because assessing such effects in a spatially explicit manner requires modeling. In small mountainous catchments spatially distributed modeling approaches were chosen to represent erosion and nutrient translocation, often triggered by the introduction of mono-cropped continuous maize cultivation and other intensified cropping systems. For regional/national level decision support, GIS-coupled plot models were used that were fed with data from large-scale data bases, e.g., of soils and weather. Participatory methods were used mainly in order to cross-check and improve plausibility of model calibration, but also to adjust the modelers’ concepts and perceptions and to aid the identification and formulation of scenarios. Combining models of different scientific domains can serve different purposes, representing topics that are not covered by one model alone being probably the most common reason to integrate models. If two models overlap in their domains, useful comparisons can be made between the outputs of both, and may improve the level of understanding of the processes, the sensitivity to certain parameters or the trends observed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec00103"><title>Complexity</title><p>Models with higher predictive capacity, better accuracy or a more mechanistic representation of processes may be preferred over simpler ones, as long as sufficient data are available. In addition, more process-based complex models may be used to obtain simplified empiric transfer functions for certain processes, which can then be used on a wider scale or in places of low data density, e.g., landscape modeling. This approach is also useful for more comprehensive models, which are usually less specific. Where models from various disciplines are combined, the detailed representation of processes needs to be simplified, as complexity shifts from the process level to the interaction between the different modules. Figure <xref rid="Fig00101" ref-type="fig">10.1</xref> shows how the different modeling approaches introduced in this chapter are positioned regarding complexity at the human and environmental scales.<fig id="Fig00101"><label>Fig. 10.1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Complexity of biophysical and human aspects represented by the various models discussed in this chapter.

While the Trenbath model directly links an overall value of soil fertility to a certain crop production level, TSPC contains production functions that account for N, P and K supply following the Mitscherlich rule (stating that combinations of nutrient insufficiencies can become effective, rather than the most limiting single nutrient insufficiency constraining plant growth). Both TSPC and FALLOW build on empirical functions, with FALLOW accounting for the spatial distribution of land uses. The Integrated Participatory Social-Ecological Research approach (FALLOW-IPSER) includes user feedback loops used for participatory model calibration/validation (Sect. <xref rid="Sec001032" ref-type="sec">10.4</xref>). DSSAT is a mechanistic plot level model extended to the landscape scale (Crop Production Decision Support System or CropDSS) in combination with a GIS database in which areas are represented in classes and do not interact. LUCIA represents hydrological and nutrient flows and their impact on plant growth and organic matter cycling in small catchments, while WaNuLCAS simulates hydrological and nutrient cycling on up to four plots, and additionally considers the competition among inter-planted species for light, water and nutrients.</p><p>On the decision-making side DSSAT/CropDSS, LUCIA and WaNuLCAS run on predefined crop rotations, that is, their land use and management options do not dynamically react to the biophysical model component. FALLOW and the Common Resources Multi-Agent System (CORMAS) build their decision-making rules on decision trees; the former aggregates at the landscape scale while the latter uses agents. Mathematical Programming-based Multi-Agent Systems (MP-MAS) uses mathematical programming to maximize the net income of farm households.</p></sec><sec id="Sec00104"><title>Overview</title><p>The contributions in this chapter are roughly ordered by the level of integration they represent, needed in each case to address a specific research question.</p><p>Section <xref rid="Sec00105" ref-type="sec">10.2</xref> presents LUCIA which was developed within the Uplands Program to integrate matter fluxes (lateral subsurface water flows, surface run-off, erosion, deposition and leaching) between upland and lowland areas in the landscape. LUCIA is applied here to assess the impact of soil conservation measures on maize yields in the Chieng Khoi watershed, Vietnam. While LUCIA cannot handle large watersheds due to the large amount of spatial interactions calculated on high resolution pixels, Sect. <xref rid="Sec001020" ref-type="sec">10.3</xref> expands the scenarios from the plot to the (sub-)national level and shows that the Crop System Model – Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (CSM-DSSAT) and its spatial extension, CropDSS, can be used to assess the impact of climate change on paddy rice production in Thailand.</p><p>Section <xref rid="Sec001032" ref-type="sec">10.4</xref> gives an example of qualitative data obtained from participatory interviews, decision trees and remote sensing in order to parameterize a semi-quantitative land use model. The study highlights the stepwise calibration and validation of the model building on stakeholder feedback, projecting socio-economic and biophysical trends over longer time periods and showing, for the case of Chieng Khoi, how increasing crop production levels masked a steady decline in inherent soil fertility. What appeared sustainable from an economic perspective owed to a combination of soil mining plus new varieties and increasing fertilizer application. Land use sustainability in a smallholder village in north-west Thailand is assessed in Sect. <xref rid="Sec001040" ref-type="sec">10.5</xref>, based on predefined sustainability criteria. The CatchscapeFS approach is a heuristic decision model with an underlying decision tree structure, and, the approach presented in Sect. <xref rid="Sec001032" ref-type="sec">10.4</xref> – CatchscapeFS-CORMAS, can facilitate participatory approaches such as companion modeling, that is, the application of a model by farmers, with the guidance of a researcher.</p><p>The contribution in Sect. <xref rid="Sec001060" ref-type="sec">10.7</xref> leads back to the more academic level. Within the Uplands Program MP-MAS has been the most widely used instrument for assessing household (agent) decision-making, but is complex and data demanding and therefore less suitable for participatory approaches. Being a fully fledged economic and learning model, some applications of MP-MAS use empirical biophysical functions provided by the TSPC. In a case study of the Mae Sa watershed, Thailand, the model was applied to simulate agricultural intensification, with the diffusion of agricultural innovations as the main driver of land use change. The same model was applied for a case study in northern Vietnam (see Sect <xref rid="Sec001047" ref-type="sec">10.6</xref>), building on a large dataset gathered through farm household surveys. The section describes the data basis required to calibrate and validate the MP-MAS model, explains the relevance and basis of derivation of the simulated scenarios, and analyzes model outputs with respect to potential recommendations to policymakers. A combination of the mechanistic biophysical and detailed agent-based models is presented in Sect. <xref rid="Sec001068" ref-type="sec">10.8</xref>. LUCIA and MP-MAS were dynamically coupled to run detailed simulations of land use and landscape dynamics in Chieng Khoi, north-west Vietnam. The section describes the advantages of the coupling approach over combining either model to an empirical counterpart. Challenges along the way are discussed, technical in nature as well as in terms of the interpretation of complex outputs and the new insights created by the coupled model, with a focus on spatial variability.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec00105"><title>Case Study 1: Linking Natural Resource Use and Environmental Functions in the Uplands and Lowlands: the Land Use Change Impact Assessment (LUCIA) Tool</title><sec id="Sec00106"><title>Introduction</title><p>Devlopment of LUCIA has been ongoing at the University of Hohenheim since 2008, within the context of the Uplands Program.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn00101">00101</xref><xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn00102">00102</xref> For a research framework that aimed to provide holistic approaches at the landscape scale, it appeared logical to design a tool capable of integrating a large but fragmented knowledge database on soil fertility, hydrology, plant growth and food security related processes.</p><p>The model was conceptualized to address questions specifically relevant to the Uplands Program’s research areas in Thailand and Vietnam, but at the same time in a generic way to allow its use in mountainous ecosystems of other regions. Given the general tendency for agricultural intensification and natural resource overuse in both research areas, the consequences of this on water and soil resources were the most burning issues to be investigated by the several sub-projects of the Program. One major issue in the area was continuous high input maize cultivation, as this has been replacing fallow-based upland rice and cassava systems for the last decade (Keil et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001035">2008</xref>), leading to severe soil loss and the siltation of paddies (Schmitter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001065">2010</xref>), ponds and reservoirs. Nutrient cycles, erosion rates (Pansak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001050">2010</xref>), sediment loads, crop yields, efficacy and adoption of soil conservation measures (Saint-Macary et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001063">2010</xref>) have been researched intensively in both Thailand and Vietnam. In Thailand, water is an important issue for irrigated peri-urban agriculture; and so the discharge from several sub-catchments under different land cover regimes, as well as lateral water flows in the soil, were measured during elaborate campaigns (Kahl et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001033">2008</xref>). The impacts of de- and re-forestation, or agricultural innovations like litchi or rubber plantations in these catchments on the soil water balance, and also on carbon stocks, have also been subject to research projects.</p><p>LUCIA was conceptualized to allow a priori assessment of such changes and their consequences on the environment and on food security. A process-based representation of flows at high spatial and temporal resolution was seen as indispensable to account for spatial variability and patterns in the landscape. At the same time, different landscape aspects needed to be designed-in and linked together to give a holistic picture of the relevant processes involved in mountainous landscapes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig00102" ref-type="fig">10.2</xref>).<fig id="Fig00102"><label>Fig. 10.2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Landscape scale flows represented in the LUCIA model; water flows in Mae SaNoi, Thailand (<italic>left-hand side</italic>) and erosion in Ban Tat watershed, Vietnam (<italic>right-hand side</italic>)</p></caption><alternatives id="MO00102"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/978-3-642-33377-4_10_Fig2_HTML.png"/><graphic specific-use="print-only" mime-subtype="EPS" xlink:href="978-3-642-33377-4_10_Fig2_Print.eps"/></alternatives></fig></p><p>In this part of the chapter, the capabilities and limitations of LUCIA as a standalone model are highlighted. The model is suitable for identifying and tracing back cause-effect relationships in predefined scenarios. Land cover and land use types are defined before the start of a simulation, so that the dynamic adaptation of land use or management practices as a reaction to changes in natural resource availability can be seen. Later on in this chapter (Sect. <xref rid="Sec001068" ref-type="sec">10.8</xref>), this approach, as well as the standalone version of the Mathematical Programming-based Multi-Agent Systems (MP-MAS) model (with contributions in Sects <xref rid="Sec001060" ref-type="sec">10.7</xref> and <xref rid="Sec001047" ref-type="sec">10.6</xref>) will be compared to a LUCIA and MP-MAS coupled-model system. By comparison, the advantages of coupling the models, but also the use of the biophysical standalone model, which facilitates identification of the effects of land use and management change under predefined scenarios, will be highlighted.</p></sec><sec id="Sec00107"><title>Scope and Description of the Model</title><p>LUCIA simulates the landscape-scale effects of changes in environmental conditions, caused by farmers’ land use and management strategies or climate change, on the availability of and changes to ecosystem services. Applications include water provision, soil organic matter accumulation or decomposition, soil fertility and nutrient cycles, soil and biomass capacity as carbon sink or the production of food – depending on the spatial distribution of land uses in a catchment, crop rotations, the different cropping, burning or plowing techniques used, and fertilizer/manure inputs, to mention just a few (Fig. <xref rid="Fig00103" ref-type="fig">10.3</xref>).<fig id="Fig00103"><label>Fig. 10.3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Overview of modules and applications of the LUCIA model</p></caption><alternatives id="MO00103"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/978-3-642-33377-4_10_Fig3_HTML.png"/><graphic specific-use="print-only" mime-subtype="TIFF" xlink:href="978-3-642-33377-4_10_Fig3_Print.tif"/></alternatives></fig></p><p>The model focuses on representing spatial patterns and the variability of resources in the landscape of small mountainous catchments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec00108"><title>Model Structure and Database</title><p>LUCIA is written in the PCRaster modeling language (van Deursen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001087">1995</xref>), which builds on the Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS) mapcalc algorithms (Shapiro and Westervelt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001075">1992</xref>), and combines GIS functions with a simple high level modeling language. Parameters are overlaid and calculated on a grid basis. Pixel size and time-steps are user defined, and in contrast to its predecessor mapcalc, PCRaster is optimized for dynamic modeling. The modeling language also contains specialized routing algorithms to simulate matter flows between pixels.</p><p>Spatial PCRaster models like LUCIA combine the landscape-scale representation of soil and vegetation classes in a map format, with parameters assigned to each of these classes. During model initialization, parameters and maps are associated using look-up tables; for example, the same value for the parameter <italic>subsoil clay content</italic> is assigned to all related soil type pixels in the soil map. During the following time-steps, each parameter is updated for each pixel based on the specific model algorithms. Temporal data series such as weather data are read from time series tables at every time step and are assigned to the respective pixels. LUCIA requires soil, land cover and topographic (Digital Elevation Model (DEM)) maps, as well as daily weather data such as rainfall, air and soil temperature, solar radiation and reference evapotranspiration rates (ET0) (for a full description, we refer to Marohn and Cadisch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001040">2011</xref>). Soil and plant parameters required for model initialization are grouped according to the modules described in the following subsections.</p><sec id="Sec00109"><title>Soil</title><p>Soil information represented in the LUCIA landscape is read from spatial soil maps in a specific PCRaster-grid format. For each pixel, a specific soil is composed of two horizons – top- and sub-soil, which have user-defined physical and chemical properties. Within the physical category fall horizon thickness, bulk density and texture, among others. Based on these parameters, plus soil organic matter content, soil hydraulic properties (pore volume, field capacity and hydraulic conductivity, among others) are derived based on the empiric pedo transfer functions developed by Saxton and Rawls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001064">2006</xref>). Soil chemical properties determine plant nutrient supply and include total and available nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium.</p></sec><sec id="Sec001010"><title>Water Balance, Erosion and Deposition</title><p>Water enters the system in the form of rainfall, a part of which is intercepted and evaporated from the plant canopy (Fig. <xref rid="Fig00104" ref-type="fig">10.4</xref>). System losses occur as evapotranspiration, as drainage below the soil profile and as stream outflows from the watershed. Topsoils and subsoils store water according to their pore volume and pore size distribution, and rain water that has passed through the canopy (throughfall) infiltrates the topsoil or, bypassing the soil matrix, goes directly into the subsoil. The amount of infiltration depends on the rainfall intensity, as well as the level of saturation and hydraulic conductivity of the topsoil. If the topsoil is saturated, overflow occurs, and if rain intensity exceeds conductivity (both are expressed in volume of water per time unit), surface runoff occurs (see Semmens et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001074">2008</xref> for the infiltration concept used in LUCIA). Both processes then lead to soil erosion. Infiltrated water can be stored in the topsoil or move into the subsoil (percolation) once field capacity is exceeded and there is free pore space in the subsoil. The percolation rate depends on the minimum of top- and subsoil hydraulic conductivity. Capillary rise is the movement from the subsoil into the topsoil, as driven by the matric potential of the topsoil and groundwater depth. Bypass flow is water potentially infiltrating in due time, but limited by available space in the topsoil, which directly enters the subsoil through macropores and cracks. Transpiration is water uptake from both horizons (depending on the rooting depth of the plant stand) into vegetation based on plant demand and water stocks above the permanent wilting point. Evaporation from the topsoil into the atmosphere is driven by reference evapotranspiration. Lateral flows between pixels occur in both soil horizons, their magnitudes determined by source and receiving pixels, the available water above field capacity, the hydraulic conductivity of the emitting pixel and the hydraulic conductivity and pore space of the recipient pixel. The partitioning between (vertical) percolation and lateral flows is regulated by the slope. Lateral flows in the soil, as well as surface run-off, are distributed in the landscape along the local drain direction map, which is derived from the DEM via a slope map.<fig id="Fig00104"><label>Fig. 10.4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Representation of water flows on and between pixels in the LUCIA model (<italic>Notes:</italic> water flows: <italic>1</italic> through-fall, <italic>2</italic> interception, <italic>3</italic> transpiration, <italic>4</italic> infiltration, <italic>5</italic> bypass flow, <italic>6</italic> percolation, <italic>7</italic> loss, <italic>8</italic> plant uptake, <italic>9</italic> capillary rise, <italic>10</italic> evaporation, <italic>11</italic> runoff, <italic>12</italic> and <italic>13</italic> lateral flow)</p></caption><alternatives id="MO00104"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/978-3-642-33377-4_10_Fig4_HTML.png"/><graphic specific-use="print-only" mime-subtype="TIFF" xlink:href="978-3-642-33377-4_10_Fig4_Print.tif"/></alternatives></fig></p><p>Soil erosion is simulated following a process-based approach (Rose et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001062">2007</xref>) as implemented in WaNuLCAS (van Noordwijk and Lusiana <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001089">1999</xref>). Soil on a specific pixel is detached by rain or entrained by sediments travelling through the pixel. Once the transport capacity of the run-off water is exceeded, particles in the water flow are deposited. Sediment loads are transported downslope along the local drain direction map. Erosion and deposition in the model dynamically alter topsoil depth, affecting water holding capacity and nutrient storage in the soil profile.</p></sec><sec id="Sec001011"><title>Plants</title><p>Vegetation types in the landscape are read from land cover maps. At the pixel scale, vegetation characteristics are calculated at the stand level, not accounting for individual plants. Biomass growth in LUCIA follows the WOFOST concept, as implemented in the Crop Growth Monitoring System (Supit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001080">2003</xref>). Potential growth rates are thereby calculated first, as determined by photo-synthetically active solar radiation and plant-specific assimilation capacity. Actual growth rates are then derived by successively introducing water and nutrient constraints, which are determined by the actual soil water and nutrient contents, and the rooting depth.</p><p>Having accounted for respiration, net assimilates are converted into biomass. Morphological characteristics of the plant stand are then mainly driven by air temperature. Within a species-specific range, temperature sums are accumulated, which then determine the phenological development stages, from germination through flowering to maturity. Thus, for annual plants, higher temperatures throughout a growing season lead to accelerated maturation and shorter vegetation periods. Phenological development steers important physiological functions in the plant organism, such as the partitioning of assimilates between plant parts (leaves, stems, fruits and roots), the N, P and K demand of these same parts, the maximum assimilation capacity and the specific leaf area (SLA; a measure of leaf thickness). Values for these factors vary throughout the development stages of the plant and are thus indirectly temperature driven.</p><p>Once leaf biomass has been formed according to the above-mentioned partitioning rules, it is converted into leaf area index (LAI) by multiplication with SLA. LAI expresses leaf area relative to ground area and thus determines the capacity of the plant to absorb sunlight.</p><p>LUCIA can simulate both annual and perennial plants. The biomass and LAI of perennial plants, which are present before the start of a simulation, such as old growth forest, can be initialized using allometric or other empiric equations.</p><p>Plant litter in the form of leaves is shed once a plant ages, experiences severe drought stress or shades itself out once the canopy becomes too dense (i.e., above a threshold of LAI). In addition, plant necromass can remain in the field after harvest or slashing and burning; this includes above-ground as well as root litter. While the latter remains in the respective horizons, the former can be incorporated into the soil when plowing takes place.</p></sec><sec id="Sec001012"><title>Soil Organic Matter</title><p>Carbon and macro-nutrients circulate between plant and soil, and turnover rates are determined by soil organic matter dynamics (Fig. <xref rid="Fig00105" ref-type="fig">10.5</xref>). Above ground and root litter are subdivided into a metabolic and a structural fraction, which differ in their lignin: N and C:N ratios, and decompose at different rates. When these pools are initialized in the model, they are associated with the present vegetation, not genetic soil units.<fig id="Fig00105"><label>Fig. 10.5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Representation of soil organic matter (<italic>SOM</italic>) and C, N, P and K flows in the LUCIA model: <italic>1</italic> plant uptake, <italic>2</italic> leaching into subsoil (<italic>a</italic>) and neighboring pixels (<italic>b</italic>), <italic>3</italic> fertilizer/manure inputs, <italic>4</italic> erosion. <italic>Surf</italic> Surface, <italic>Lit</italic> Litter, <italic>metab</italic> metabolic, <italic>struc</italic> structural</p></caption><alternatives id="MO00105"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/978-3-642-33377-4_10_Fig5_HTML.png"/><graphic specific-use="print-only" mime-subtype="TIFF" xlink:href="978-3-642-33377-4_10_Fig5_Print.tif"/></alternatives></fig></p><p>Litter fractions are converted into soil organic matter (SOM) over time. As an analogy for litter, SOM fractions are characterized by distinct C:N ratios and decomposition rates, representing the role of substrate degradability in microbial decomposition processes. The entire system is carbon and thus energy-driven and energy-limited, while the N needed for microbial processes can be drawn from the organic substrate, or from the soil mineral pool if the substrate has a wide C:N ratio. Once the latter happens, soil mineral N is immobilized and temporally not available for plants. SOM fractions are called active, slow and passive, with approximate turnover times of 1.5, 25 and 1,000 years respectively. Decomposition rates, litter and SOM pools and flows are defined following the CENTURY approach (Parton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001051">1987</xref>). According to this concept, matter can be converted – decomposed or stabilized – between the three SOM pools except from the passive to the slow pool. Each conversion occurs at the expense of respiration energy and releases N and P if in excess of the recipient C:N or C:P ratio. The mineral N released during SOM decomposition is available to plants, while a user-defined share of released P is adsorbed to clay minerals or sesquioxides, depending on the soil type.</p></sec><sec id="Sec001013"><title>Land Use and Management</title><p>Farmers have several options to influence soil fertility and plant growth rates, including plowing and burning as well as fertilizer and manure application. The timing of each of these operations is user-defined in the model for each land cover, as is planting time.</p><p>To define fertilizer use, fertilizer types (N, P and K concentrations), amounts and application dates need to be defined. N and K are immediately plant available, while fertilizer P is distributed to the labile and stable P pools in the soil, which are in equilibrium. Manure or organic residue additions enter the litter pathway, so that carbon and lignin contents need to be additionally specified. Burning includes the option of collecting firewood beforehand and of defining the intensity of the fire.</p><p>In general, the standalone version allows one to implement land use change scenarios, but these have to be defined beforehand for the entire simulation. This allows for scenario testing and reverse modeling where land cover types are known. At the current stage of model development (v 1.2), LUCIA cannot dynamically adapt land use/land cover to changes in the biophysical environment, e.g., automatically adjusting crop rotation in line with soil fertility. Also, economic incentives or constraints are not yet part of the model.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec001014"><title>Capabilities and Application</title><sec id="Sec001015"><title>Applications and User Groups</title><p>LUCIA integrates different processes related to soils, water and plants, thus allowing a user to assess the benefits and trade-offs of land use change and management activities. These processes are represented in a spatially explicit way, so that the effects of positioning of each land use and activity in the catchment are taken into account and can be considered when designing management strategies. Applications of the model encompass the decline and recovery of soil fertility, changes in the water balance, surface run-off, erosion and sedimentation processes, yield levels, as well as food security, biomass and carbon stocks. Scenarios can represent the consequences of local farmers’ short-term management decisions (such as fertilization, plowing or burning), land use and land cover changes, or longer term changes such as in climate.</p><p>The current user groups targeted are researchers, graduate and post-graduate students, as well as staff at land development agencies. For M.Sc. level lectures, a graphical user interface (GUI) has been developed to facilitate data entry and plausibility tests, and to provide relevant outputs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec001016"><title>Case Study</title><p>The purpose of the LUCIA standalone simulation presented here, as well as of the coupled model system (see Sect. <xref rid="Sec001068" ref-type="sec">10.8</xref>) was to assess the potential impact of low-cost soil conservation methods on maize cultivation in upland areas, across a 30 km<sup>2</sup> catchment called Chieng Khoi in Son La province, an area which represents the ongoing trend toward intensified maize-based agriculture in parts of north-west Vietnam (Keil et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001035">2008</xref>; <ext-link xlink:href="10.1007/978-3-642-33377-4_7" ext-link-type="doi">Chap. 7</ext-link> of this book). The combination of heavy rain and mostly steep terrain makes soils highly susceptible to erosion once permanent vegetation cover is removed.

After the first year, soil conservation on maize plots under no-tillage (Scenario B) resulted in 0–7.3 Mg ha<sup>−1</sup> less sediment loads per pixel as compared to the Baseline, while the legume scenarios C and D achieved between 0 and 18.8 Mg ha<sup>−1</sup> less sediment loads (Fig. <xref rid="Fig00106" ref-type="fig">10.6</xref> left). Land uses other than maize showed only minor differences between scenarios. After 25 years, reduced sediment loads on maize plots reached up to 365 Mg ha<sup>−1</sup> for Scenario B and 1,680 Mg ha<sup>−1</sup> for Scenario C and Scenario D. The most substantial reduction was found in the lowland areas, which receive sediment from the entire catchment. Here, cumulative reduction ranged from 0 to 780 Mg ha<sup>−1</sup> for Scenario B and from 0 to 2,150 Mg ha<sup>−1</sup> for Scenarios C and D. These figures may appear high, because LUCIA does not distinguish erosion that originates on a pixel and re-entrained sediments from previous time steps. To disentangle these effects, we analyzed topsoil depth after 25 years using the same procedures. On a few of the pixels (~20 in the entire catchment), topsoil thickness was slightly greater in the baseline as compared to Scenario B and Scenarios C and D. In all other cases, topsoil was up to 5.3 cm thicker under Scenario B and up to 20 cm under Scenarios C and D, as compared to the Baseline. Separating these effects between maize and other land covers showed that other land uses were hardly affected, revealing that top soil loss affected mainly the source cells and that sediments travelled through the lowlands, but did not cause a major entrainment of soils under other land cover types.<fig id="Fig00106"><label>Fig. 10.6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Difference in sediment loads baseline minus scenario D after year 1 (<italic>left</italic>), and difference in topsoil depth scenario D minus Baseline after year 25 (<italic>right</italic>)</p></caption><alternatives id="MO00106"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/978-3-642-33377-4_10_Fig6_HTML.png"/><graphic specific-use="print-only" mime-subtype="EPS" xlink:href="978-3-642-33377-4_10_Fig6_Print.eps"/></alternatives></fig></p><p>Thirdly, analyzing yields after 25 years showed that it was mainly maize that was affected by soil conservation measures, as expected (Fig. <xref rid="Fig00106" ref-type="fig">10.6</xref> right).

Yields under F0 dropped quickly from about 3 Mg ha<sup>−1</sup> in the first year to about 0.3 Mg ha<sup>−1</sup> in the second and then less than 0.1 Mg ha<sup>−1</sup> in the following years (data not shown). Under farmers’ practice continuous fertilizer inputs (F1 treatment in Fig. <xref rid="Fig00107" ref-type="fig">10.7</xref>, left chart) average maize yields started around 6 Mg ha<sup>−1</sup> and then increased up to 7 Mg ha<sup>−1</sup> under the baseline and no tillage scenarios, while yields of maize combined with legumes slightly decreased and dropped below the baseline in year 8. As nutrient competition between crop and legume was not modeled, this might have been caused by indirect nutrient insufficiency due to water stress in the crop (caused by the higher water demand of crop plus legume). Yields under high fertilizer input (F2 treatment; Fig. <xref rid="Fig00107" ref-type="fig">10.7</xref>, right chart) came close to potential yields during years without water stress. Under soil conservation and high fertilizer inputs, yields remained clearly above the baseline at all times; however, during years of extreme weather (e.g., 7 and 17) the difference in yields between legume and non-legume treatments shrunk.<fig id="Fig00107"><label>Fig. 10.7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Average maize yields at farmers’ practice (<italic>left</italic>) and high fertilizer levels (<italic>right</italic>) under all scenarios over the 25 years of simulation</p></caption><alternatives id="MO00107"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/978-3-642-33377-4_10_Fig7_HTML.png"/><graphic specific-use="print-only" mime-subtype="TIFF" xlink:href="978-3-642-33377-4_10_Fig7_Print.tif"/></alternatives></fig></p><p>Significant effects of plowing between the two legume treatments were not observed in the simulations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec001019"><title>Discussion and Outlook</title><p><italic>At the plot level</italic>, the magnitude of soil eroded from maize plots (Table <xref rid="Tab00102" ref-type="table">10.2</xref>) was in the range of that found in the reference experiments carried out on similar slopes and soils in Chieng Khoi (Tuan, personal communication). Simulated soil conservation measures on maize plots were effective at reducing soil erosion on these plots and also on other plots downstream, although even erosion under soil conservation was at times considerable. Still, reduced erosion rates had a positive effect on maize yields in the first years after implementation of the measures.</p><p>After 8 years, yields under the legume scenarios (C and D) dropped below those under no tillage (B) and even those of the baseline (A). In this case, the initially higher nutrient export of C and D through maize harvest could have led to soil mining, but after a further number of lower maize yields under C and D, this tendency should have been reversed again (which was not the case). Two potential explanations can be given at this stage: (a) the higher water demand under crop plus legume as compared to a single crop (effects of weather in years 7 and 17 point to water stress), and (b) the effects of not burning on the availability of nutrients to plants.</p><p>While yields under scenarios A and B were above those of the legume treatments C and D, higher nutrient export for the maize harvest could have been the cause of the yield decline. However, this tendency would have reversed after several years of lower maize yields under A and B. The fact that the high fertilizer scenarios did not show the same trend supports this assumption.</p><p><italic>At the landscape level</italic>, the effects of soil conservation measures on maize were limited when looking at sediment loads leaving the entire catchment. Although absolute quantities of eroded soil at the catchment outflow differed clearly between scenarios, these differences remained small in relative terms (data not shown), due to the fact that the large areas under forest and tree plantations, those contributing little to erosion, remained unchanged between scenarios. Seemingly larger erosion reduction effects in paddies, as compared to maize plots, stemmed from the fact that the model simulated sediment loads and thus did not distinguish between eroded soil originating from a pixel and such passing through a pixel (except for pixels without an inflow, e.g., next to a ridge). As sediment from the entire catchment passed the lowland and outflow cells, total amounts were always higher than in the upland source cells.</p><p>The LUCIA standalone model captured the spatial variability in erosion and crop yields observed in the field (Lippe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001038">2011</xref>). The high temporal and spatial resolution of the model allowed us to identify erosion hotspots (in terms of reduced topsoil thickness), distribution of sediment loads and patterns of soil fertility (e.g., high fertility along previously forested footslopes, outputs not shown) and their development over time. The unchanged land cover and management practices over 25 years, even though not a necessarily realistic scenario, facilitated the tracing back of causal relationships between variables.</p><p>In a coupled model with dynamic land use (Sect. <xref rid="Sec001068" ref-type="sec">10.8</xref>), the effects observed here could not be expected to appear to the same degree, because agents facing waning yields would resort to different land uses or fertilizer levels. Given that soil conservation measures do make a difference regarding erosion, a dynamic decision-making model would need to allow farmer decisions to keep track of these factors separately for each pixel.</p><p>In Chieng Khoi, after 10 years of intensive maize cropping, the trend of increasing yields is still ongoing despite obvious soil degradation, and the simulations shown here, and in Sect. <xref rid="Sec001032" ref-type="sec">10.4</xref>, point in the right direction. On the other hand, farmers are aware of problems caused by maize monocropping and soil degradation, such as paddy and reservoir siltation, pest pressure and others, which have not been modeled here. Recently, farmers have been starting to expand fodder grass and cassava cultivation, which both reduce erosion, so in the future maize may be grown only on the less erodible plots. The future generation of models needs to account for such plot-specific characteristics.</p><p>Currently, LUCIA-Choice is being developed – a decision-making module, which can be coupled with LUCIA. LUCIA-Choice contains a decision algorithm based on household resources, crop preferences and plot quality. The latter includes top-soil carbon contents and other indicators of soil fertility, and it is up to the farmers (as parameterized by the user) how much importance they attribute to these factors. This will allow a reflection of farmers’ levels of local knowledge on plot-specific characteristics in terms of their land.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec001020"><title>Case Study 2: Assessing the Impact of Rice Production in Thailand Under Climate Change Scenarios</title><sec id="Sec001021"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mainland Southeast Asia covers six of the ten Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states, namely Cambodia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam, and has an estimated population of 252 million (2010).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn00103">00103</xref> Rice ecosystems cover a total area of 30.6 million ha, with respective country land areas being 2.7, 0.9, 0.7, 8.0, 11.0 and 7.4 million ha for the above, and these systems are very sensitive to changes in climatic, edaphic and socio-economic conditions. Decision making to maintain rice ecosystem productivity, as well as livelihoods, requires well-organized knowledge and information system tools to be in place. Models that integrate spatial information and crop/weather databases reflect such tools, as they facilitate better decision-making through collective efforts, and provide an efficient communications platform based on organized and standardized databases, structures and key processes for the relevant ecosystems, including agricultural systems, watershed and regional production systems. The purpose of this paper is to present an information technology tool, CropDSS, which is able to link the Crop System Model-Decision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer (CSM-DSSAT) tool (Jones et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001032">2003</xref>) with spatial databases and climate change scenarios taken from the Atmospheric General Circulation Model (ECHAM4) (Roeckner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001061">1996</xref>) climate model.

The model used here assumed farmers to be the main agents of land cover and land use change, based on a multi-criteria analysis of: (1) plot attractiveness – to expand a land use type as a function of soil fertility, accessibility, attainable yield, and potential costs arising from transportation and land clearing, (2) the allocation of labor and land to available options of investment, and (3) the diminishing and increasingly marginal returns on soil fertility and land productivity. The annual simulation loop for FALLOW was built on the ‘Trenbath’ soil fertility approach (Trenbath <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001084">1989</xref>), under which soil fertility at the plot-level proportionally declines during cropping periods by a specific soil fertility depletion rate and increases during fallow periods with a characteristic half-recovery time. Fertilizer application affected soil fertility and yields by reducing the depletion rate, while crop yield was a function of a crop specific conversion factor and existing soil fertility levels at the plot-level. Overall crop productivity at the landscape level contributed to food security, together with revenues gained from other economic activities (such as forest resource utilization activities or tree plantations). The consequences of these landscape dynamics were assessed by output indicators, that is, annual land use and soil fertility maps (Suyamto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001081">2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec001036"><title>Participative Focus Group Discussions</title><p>The employed participatory assessment approach was built on conceptual ideas drawn from <italic>Soft-System-Methodology</italic> by Checkland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001017">2000</xref>) and <italic>Participatory Rural Appraisal</italic> by Chambers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001016">1994</xref>).

Over this period, land tenure changed from cooperative to individual land use rights, and cropping areas expanded from foothills and moderate slopes to steep slopes and hilltop positions. This change in upland cropping was characterized by the abandonment of swidden agriculture and the adoption of continuous cropping systems with a shift from upland rice, traditional maize and cassava, to hybrid maize and cassava crop varieties. Participants defined an upland crop suitability system (maize and cassava, intercropping) based on eight soil classes which they combined with inherent soil fertility levels to describe the crop yield potentials of the existing upland cropping system (Table <xref rid="Tab00103" ref-type="table">10.3</xref>). From the participant’s point of view, a high soil fertility level represented a high crop yield potential, which corresponded with the Trenbath approach to link crop yields to soil fertility levels. Based on this view, farmers yielded assessments drawing on soil color units which were then converted to model soil fertility units using a linear, equidistant approach. Overall, soil degradation was described as the overarching problem constraining existing upland cropping systems. With the help of paper cards and A0 paper sheets, participants linked an identified set of causes with those consequences having a direct influence on soil fertility decline, these being: (1) increased fertilizer application rates we used to circumvent declining crop yields, (2) pest and disease pressure increased as a consequence of utilizing hybrid seed varieties, (3) soil erosion and the abandonment of fallow periods reduced plot water holding capacity, and (4) tillage by hoe and plow resulted in soil compaction.<table-wrap id="Tab00103"><label>Table 10.3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Farmers’ cropping preferences and the level of inherent soil fertility according to soil color – as revealed by focus group discussions and corresponding FALLOW model soil fertility units (Adapted from Lippe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001038">2011</xref>)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th><p>Local soil classification</p></th><th><p>Inherent soil fertility</p></th><th colspan="4"><p>Suitable cropping system<sup>a</sup></p></th><th><p>FALLOW soil fertility units</p></th></tr><tr><th/><th/><th><p>Maize</p></th><th><p>Intercrop<sup>b</sup></p></th><th><p>Cassava</p></th><th><p>Trees</p></th><th/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Black</p></td><td><p>Good</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>15</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Red-Black</p></td><td><p>Moderate</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>12.5</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Red</p></td><td><p>Moderate</p></td><td/><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>10</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Red-Clay</p></td><td><p>Moderate</p></td><td/><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>10</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Red-Sandy</p></td><td><p>Moderate</p></td><td/><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>10</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Yellow-Black</p></td><td><p>Moderate</p></td><td/><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>10</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Red-Yellow</p></td><td><p>Low</p></td><td/><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>7.5</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Yellow</p></td><td><p>Low</p></td><td/><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>++</p></td><td><p>5</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>++ very suitable, + suitable</p><p><sup>b</sup>Intercrop = maize and cassava</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec001038"><title>FALLOW Model Simulations</title><p>The FALLOW model was calibrated based on the qualitative outputs of the focus group discussions to simulate the period 1975–2008.

Moreover, the stepwise increase in crop conversion efficiency (<italic>c</italic>) resembled the use of improved and hybrid seed varieties possessing a higher crop yield potential when compared to traditional ones.<table-wrap id="Tab00104"><label>Table 10.4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Input variables for the Trenbath soil fertility module used in the FALLOW model’s baseline scenario</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2"><p>Trenbath input variable</p></th><th rowspan="2"><p>Unit</p></th><th colspan="4"><p>Time period</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>1975–1988</p></th><th><p>1989–1995</p></th><th><p>1996–2000</p></th><th><p>2001–2008</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Yield (Y<sub>min</sub>;Y<sub>max</sub>)</p></td><td><p>Mg ha<sup>−1</sup></p></td><td><p>0.5–1.5</p></td><td><p>0.5–1.75</p></td><td><p>0.5–2.25</p></td><td><p>0.5-3.25</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Depletion rate (f<sub>D</sub>)</p></td><td><p>Dimensionless</p></td><td><p>0.35</p></td><td><p>0.4</p></td><td><p>0.45</p></td><td><p>0.5</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Fallow period</p></td><td><p>Year</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>0</p></td><td><p>0</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Half recovery time</p></td><td><p>Year</p></td><td><p>16.5</p></td><td><p>11</p></td><td><p>5.5</p></td><td><p>2.75</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Crop conversion efficiency</p></td><td><p>Dimensionless</p></td><td><p>0.3</p></td><td><p>0.35</p></td><td><p>0.4</p></td><td><p>0.45</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Cropping period</p></td><td><p>Year</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>5</p></td><td><p>5</p></td><td><p>10<sup>a</sup></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Fertilizer efficiency (K<sub>fert</sub>)</p></td><td><p>Dimensionless</p></td><td><p>n/a<sup>b</sup></p></td><td><p>n/a</p></td><td><p>n/a</p></td><td><p>0.25</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>Assumed permanent cropping until 2018</p><p><sup>b</sup><italic>n/a</italic> not applicable, <italic>HY</italic> hybrid variety</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>Simulated land use change trajectories were evaluated by drawing on the multiple-resolution goodness-of-fit (GOF) procedure (Costanza <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001020">1989</xref>), and using land cover maps derived from a Système Pour l’Observation de la Terre (SPOT) satellite image taken in 1992 and a Linear Imaging Self-Scanning Sensor (LISS III) satellite image taken in 2007 (Thi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001082">2009</xref>). The GOF statistical technique is based on the measurement of pattern similarity between simulated and observed land use change, where one denotes a perfect model fit. The analysis revealed that FALLOW reflected the development of land use and land cover reasonably well, with a GOF value of 0.78. The increase in cropping area during the simulation period was made at the expense of fallow areas, resulting in a decline of inherent soil fertility from predominantly black into average red-yellow soil conditions (soil fertility value &gt; 7.5). The combined use of maize hybrid varieties and fertilizers from 2000 onwards initially masked soil degradation, enhancing maize production to an annual average of 2–3.2 Mg ha<sup>−1</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig001010" ref-type="fig">10.10</xref>). However, the application of fertilizer did not strongly influence inherent soil fertility development, as simulated soil fertility remained within red-yellow soil conditions.

They confirmed topsoil color as being a major indicator of a soils’ crop suitability, as black soils are the most preferred soil types in Chieng Khoi commune due to their higher total N, C and CEC contents, when compared to red or yellow soils. This underscores the overall model calibration concept linking soil fertility and soil color, further supported by the FALLOW model approach of crop choice being relative to soil fertility classes (or predefined boundaries). Challenges with such an approach may arise in the choice of an adequate soil fertility calibration approach, due to interactions between soil fertility and crop management practices in the field. For example, it might questioned as to whether the employed calibration approach (Table <xref rid="Tab00103" ref-type="table">10.3</xref>) satisfactorily represented the stakeholder described land use evolution pattern; however, as stakeholders did not describe more drastic changes of soil fertility with yield changes, e.g., by pointing towards exponential developments, it was assumed that an equidistant calibration approach captured the local soil fertility evaluations adequately in this case. The model analysis further demonstrated that soil degradation would move towards critical red to yellow soil levels (Fig. <xref rid="Fig001011" ref-type="fig">10.11</xref>) in 2018, with a higher vulnerability in relation to soil erosion (Clemens et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001019">2010</xref>), a tendency also shown in the LUCIA approach (Sect. <xref rid="Sec00105" ref-type="sec">10.2</xref>). Low current soil fertility levels also pose a challenge to potential soil conservation strategies, as the build-up of soil fertility will be slow once soil degradation has advanced (Wezel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001092">2002</xref>), as demonstrated in the model simulations. Here lies an apparent advantage of the FALLOW model, as it allows for the possibility of integrating different knowledge domains to produce simulations that may be relevant for local stakeholders and decision-makers. The low data input requirements when compared to data-demanding mechanistic model approaches allow the disclosure of meaningful insights into local soil degradation phenomena, those relevant for strategic planning. While absolute maize yields simulated with FALLOW may be less detailed when compared to the LUCIA simulations presented before (Sect. <xref rid="Sec00105" ref-type="sec">10.2</xref>), the phenomenon of yield increase masking soil degradation is common to both approaches.</p><p>Overall, the presented study has an important message to convey at the community level. If resource managers resist changing current cropping practices, environmental degradation will adversely affect the livelihoods of farmers and will be increasingly difficult to reverse. Yet this problem has a much broader regional dimension, as the case study presented here is a typical example of the challenges currently faced across the north-western mountainous provinces of Vietnam. This study has shown that building on an iterative participatory approach to obtain input variables that are suitable for semi-quantitative modelling – as a methodological pathway to foster the implementation of sustainable upland cropping practices, has proven its usefulness in a data-poor environment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec001040"><title>Case Study 4: Agent-Based Modeling on the CORMAS Platform to Examine the Sustainability of Rain-Fed Farming Systems in Northern Thailand</title><sec id="Sec001041"><title>Introduction to the Application</title><p>This study developed an integrated agent-based model called “CatchScapeFS”, which was applied to assess the sustainability of agriculture in the case study village of Bor Krai, located in Mae Hong Son province, as population growth and the intensive use of agricultural land had raised questions about the sustainability of this rain-fed farming system.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn00105">00105</xref></p><p>To assess sustainability and extrapolate the area’s sustainability situation, the CatchScapeFS model was developed as a virtual farming system based on a multi-agent system (MAS) approach. Relying on a bottom-up approach, the model is suited to sustainability assessments on an individual farm basis. In addition, it captures the complexity of the system by including aspects related to the heterogeneity and interaction of the system elements, such as farm households, crops, plots and livestock (Potchanasin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001053">2008</xref>).</p><p>The farm household decision-making process, which is the main part of the model, was modeled using behavioral heuristics in which the processes were presented as decision tree diagrams with behavioral rules and dynamic conditions. The heuristic approach was selected as an alternative to optimization, because it includes the qualitative aspects of farm household decision-making, such as behavior about subsistence, the fallowing of land and the performance of off-farm activities, which are difficult to apply in optimization models (Schreinemachers and Berger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001069">2006</xref>; Becu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001010">2008</xref>). In addition, the approach captures bounded rationality, which is characteristic of the decision making of farm households with limited capability with regard to search costs in either the cognitive or financial form (Schreinemachers and Berger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001069">2006</xref>). Furthermore, the approach is flexible enough to model agents’ environmental perceptions and their communications, which are important properties to model in terms of the social interactions among cognitive agents in the model. The approach is also flexible enough to involve stakeholders in the various stages of the modeling process, such as model development and validation, whereby decision-making processes can be presented in a decision tree diagram, which is more understandable for the non-modelers and; thus, enhances stakeholder discussion (Becu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001010">2008</xref>). This approach is also more flexible in terms of integrating the farm decision-making model with other models such as crop, water balance and hydrological models, which have a different temporal resolution (Becu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00109">2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec001042"><title>Background and Study Objectives</title><p>The study presented here aimed to assess the sustainability of farming systems in Bor Krai village, Mae Hong Son province, by developing an integrated farming system model called CatchScapeFS. The case study area was selected as it is a critical mountainous area located in a National Conservation Forest in northern Thailand. In the study area, the villagers pursue subsistence farming and face increasing resource scarcity because of population growth and the limited availability of land, while increasing market opportunities have stimulated a more intensive use of agricultural land (Praneetvatakul and Sirijinda <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001054">2005</xref>; <ext-link xlink:href="10.1007/978-3-642-33377-4_1" ext-link-type="doi">Chap. 1</ext-link>). These trends are challenging the sustainability of the system and could in the long run cause food insecurity and environmental problems such as land degradation.</p><p>An assessment of sustainability was performed through the use of sustainability indicators covering the economic, social and environmental domain (Praneetvatakul et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001055">2001</xref>), and indicators included household incomes, net farm incomes, household capital, household savings, food security, top-soil erosion and the length of fallow periods. These represented outcome indicators of the simulations, which were run for a period of 15 years (2003–2017). The assessment started at the farm level, and based on a household’s performance in terms of the above indicators, each farm household was classified into one of three classes: Sustainable (S), Conditionally sustainable (C) and Non-sustainable (N) (Potchanasin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001053">2008</xref>). The sustainability of farming systems at the village level was evaluated based on the number of farm households in each class, and the results of the area’s farming systems sustainability at the village level were presented using a Sustainability Index (SI) for each indicator and a Performance Index (PI) for all the indicators. These indices were presented as percentages, with higher or increasing percentages indicating a greater level of sustainability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec001043"><title>Data</title><p>Both primary and secondary data were used in this study. The first primary data came from a 2004 survey carried out by Praneetvatakul and Sirijinda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001054">2005</xref>), who used structured questionnaires on 32 randomly selected farm households out of 56 in Bor Krai village. The second primary data included field surveys conducted by the researcher in 2005 and 2006. For the survey in 2005, the data consisted of quantitative and qualitative data about the behavioral and decision-making aspects of farm households and other stakeholders. Additional data were collected, such as village land use, the amount of water resource release from natural springs and Geographic Information System (GIS) data. The 2006 survey provided data for the model validation and the testing of the hypotheses on farm household behavior and decision-making processes, based on the farm household group sessions. Diagrams on significant behavior and decision-making processes were presented and used as a tool for information elicitation and confirmation of the diagrams, which were hypothetically predetermined from all the available information and data from the surveys. In addition, the study used secondary data from various data sources to complement the primary data for the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec001044"><title>The CatchScapeFS Model</title><p>The integrated CatchScapeFS model was based on the CatchScape3 model (Becu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00109">2003</xref>), which was developed on the CORMAS platform using the SmallTalk programming language. The model had two principle components: a biophysical and a socio-economic component. The biophysical component consisted of a hydrological model, a crop model, a water balance model and a soil erosion model, which for this study were all embedded in the landscape model (Fig <xref rid="Fig001012" ref-type="fig">10.12</xref>). Each sub-model can be presented as follows.<fig id="Fig001012"><label>Fig. 10.12</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The study area represented through the CatchScapeFS model (Adapted from Potchanasin 2008)</p></caption><alternatives id="MO001012"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/978-3-642-33377-4_10_Fig12_HTML.png"/><graphic specific-use="print-only" mime-subtype="TIFF" xlink:href="978-3-642-33377-4_10_Fig12_Print.tif"/></alternatives></fig></p><p><bold>Landscape model –</bold> the landscape of the study area, Bor Krai village, was divided into a spatial grid of cells representing plots of one rai (0.16 ha). The total number of plots was 8,855 rai or grid cells, and each cell contained a set of attributes such as land use, soil types, slope gradient, fertility and fallow periods, which were required by the biophysical modules. Some local spatial attributes were generated from a GIS analysis of consistent maps of the study area, including land use, land type<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn00106">00106</xref> and slope gradient as attributes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig001012" ref-type="fig">10.12</xref>).</p><p><bold>Water balance model –</bold> the model was structured to quantify the amount of water output released from each plot as run-off and deep drainage, which was then used in the hydrological model. The water balance model was based on the concept of double reservoirs, following Perez et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001052">2002</xref>), which included a root zone and soil layer reservoir. The soil layer reservoir was supplied by water inputs as infiltration and irrigation, and released water outputs as deep drainage and evapotranspiration. The soil layer reservoir covered the root zone reservoir which could increase depending on root growth at each time-step, while the soil layer reservoir was kept constant.</p><p><bold>Hydrological model –</bold> the model was linked to the water balance and crop model at the grid cell level. The amount of water flowing as run-off and deep drainage from the water balance model was used in the hydrological model, representing the propagation of such water through the catchment’s hydrographic network, represented by an arc-node structure (Becu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00108">2005</xref>). Water dynamics were implemented as a semi-distributed hydrological model, which was an aggregation of water at the intermediate level of the spatial scale, called the supply area, which was distributed through an arc-node structure similar to water inputs and outputs, and was propagated along upstream and downstream features.</p><p><bold>Crop model –</bold> this model was based on the CropWat model (Smith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001077">1992</xref>) developed by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Actual yields can be estimated in the model using the methodology proposed by Doorenbos and Kassam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001022">1979</xref>), in which the actual yield is linearly related to the evapotranspiration deficit, which is determined by the ratio between cumulative values of actual evapotranspiration (ETA) and maximum evapotranspiration (ETM) during the growing period.</p><p><bold>Soil erosion model –</bold> this model was based on the Universal Soil Loss Equation model (USLE model) proposed by Wischmeier and Smith (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001093">1978</xref>). In this model, at each year in the simulation, soil loss in the study area was quantified subject to five significant factors, namely rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, slope length and slope gradient, crop management and conservation practices.</p><p>For the <bold>socio-economic component</bold>, the CatchScapeFS model included farm household agents and other social elements based on a farming systems approach (Potchanasin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001053">2008</xref>). To generate farm agents, cluster analysis and qualitative analysis were applied, together with Monte Carlo techniques (Schreinemachers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001068">2006</xref>; Potchanasin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001053">2008</xref>). These analyses allowed a population of 60 agents to be created, which was statistically consistent with the 30 sample households from the 2004 survey. The average amount of resources allocated to the agents, such as the number of persons per household, land holding, heads of livestock, cash, debt and stored rice, was not significantly different from the average for the farm households in the survey, which indicates a close statistical fit between the agent population and the sample population.</p><p>Each simulation time step corresponded to a 10 day time interval, and the model simulated six dynamic phases, which were: biophysical dynamics, farm household activities, socio-economic dynamics, information exchange and result arrangements. Each phase contained model processes that were performed in sequence; for instance, the farm household activities phase contained farm agent decision processes, such as the selection of which crops to grow. Farm household activities consisted of eight sub-phases: knowledge base updating, household resource updating, cropping activities, household activities, harvesting, the selling of farm products, financial activities and livestock activities. At each time step, farm agents executed all the processes, some of which required agents to interact with other agents or objects; for instance, asking for price information and crop alternatives, asking for loans and changing crop properties on their plots. In the sub-phase of the cropping activities, farm agents examined their own plots; whether they were ready to be cropped – such as having already been left fallow, or used to produce the main crop from the previous year (to keep cropping patterns in line with reality). Then, if plot properties reached the test conditions, the farm agent interacted with the abstract object, a form of behavior used to select crops using their own strategies. For example, if an agent was risk-seeking, it would execute its own risky strategy to select the crop, whereby a crop which could generate a higher level of income would be preferable to a crop grown with government support or for subsistence purposes. After that, the agent tested or considered the other resources available and the subsistence conditions, such as cash, labor and consumption expectations, and if satisfied, the selected crop would be planted. To plant the selected crop, the agent interacted with his plot object and the plot would change its crop attribute property from fallow to prepared plot and then to selected crop. In addition, after the crop had been harvested, information such as the yield, price and income level would be stored in the farm agent knowledge base, then used to influence the agent’s decision-making in the next cropping year. All methods in this model were verified in order to test and examine that the model would proceed in the correct way. After parameterization and calibration, model validation was conducted using social validation (the diagram elicitation approach) and statistical data comparison validation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec001045"><title>Main Results</title><p>The study results showed that the farming system in the study area is not sustainable.

This increase in household private expenditures occurred due to population growth and inflation; thus requiring more income to recover. This scenario affected other indicators, as seen through a decrease in the sustainability level in terms of fallow periods, which resulted from an increased pressure to meet subsistence consumption needs, as more land was needed to produce enough rice to feed the growing population. This meant that existing agricultural land was used more intensively through a shortening of the fallow periods, while encroachment into the forest in search of new land increased, which in reality is not legally allowed. This situation was harmful to soil fertility and the recovery of land, leading to land degradation in the long run.<fig id="Fig001014"><label>Fig. 10.14</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Average of the key information, plus the Sustainability Index (<italic>SI</italic>) for each indicator (Adapted from Potchanasin 2008)</p></caption><alternatives id="MO001014"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/978-3-642-33377-4_10_Fig14a_HTML.png"/><graphic specific-use="print-only" mime-subtype="TIFF" xlink:href="978-3-642-33377-4_10_Fig14a_Print.tif"/><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/978-3-642-33377-4_10_Fig14b_HTML.png"/><graphic specific-use="print-only" mime-subtype="TIFF" xlink:href="978-3-642-33377-4_10_Fig14b_Print.tif"/></alternatives></fig></p><p>The lack of sustainability could also be noticed through a worsening of the household savings and capital indicator situation, meaning that the situation regarding household capital became less sustainable over time; the result of a decreased production of farm products (farm capital goods). This situation subsequently compromised the ability of households to recover once faced with stress events.</p><p>Regarding food security, sustainability slightly decreased; however, the results show a strong variation at the beginning of the first 4 years, which was influenced by an unfavorable distribution of rainfall and a poor availability of suitable land during some of the production years. This situation induced a lag in the production decisions, or led to wrong decisions being made by the farm agents, corresponding to biophysical conditions that were uncertain and varied from year to year. In the case of topsoil erosion, the results show that the sustainability situation became worse, and this corresponded to the amount of soil erosion produced by farm households per area unit. In addition, erosion caused by rain had a relatively high impact when compared to other factors, especially during rains, in terms of the clearing or land preparation period, when vegetation cover was sparse.</p><p>Regarding all the Sustainability Indices, their development over the simulation period showed that the various aspects of sustainability could be ranked and used to determine issues which needed to be improved. Food security was considered as the most unsustainable issue, as it contributed significantly to the area’s lack of sustainability (Fig. <xref rid="Fig001015" ref-type="fig">10.15</xref>). This can be denoted by highest negative trend comparing among other indices’ trend. Household savings were the second most important issue, followed by the level of household capital, topsoil erosion, household incomes, fallow periods and net farm incomes.<fig id="Fig001015"><label>Fig. 10.15</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Trend comparison among sustainability Indices of all indicators (Adapted from Potchanasin 2008)</p></caption><alternatives id="MO001015"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/978-3-642-33377-4_10_Fig15_HTML.png"/><graphic specific-use="print-only" mime-subtype="TIFF" xlink:href="978-3-642-33377-4_10_Fig15_Print.tif"/></alternatives></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec001046"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The study presented here used an integrated model application called CatchScapeFS, which was based on an MAS approach.

The model showed its ability to present the ex-ante results, as emergence of the system generating through the systems<italic><underline>’</underline></italic> complexity property whereby the classic assumption, ceteris paribus, was neglected. Furthermore, qualitative and quantitative variables could be included together in the model, which is difficult or impossible to achieve in conventional models. As a consequence, a model relying on the MAS approach may be used to address research questions over a wider or different perspective, in which the heterogeneity, interaction and dynamics of the system elements need to be accounted for. However, the main purpose of the model was not to replace conventional approaches, but rather to act as a complement; to enhance a study’s ability to answer research questions over a wider range. Also, this study shows that modeling using a behavioral, heuristic approach in general has advantages, not only in terms of mimicking real-world situations, but also in terms of integrating other models, those which use a different temporal resolution. Also, the activity processes in the model can be presented in decision-tree diagrams, which make the model more flexible when it comes to communicating with non-programmers and stakeholders, those who participated in the model’s development.</p><p>The study results show that current agricultural practices in the study area are not following a sustainable development path, and so, to improve the situation, we propose the ranking of sustainability issues, something which should also take account of policy developments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec001047"><title>Case Study 5: The Adoption of Soil Conservation Practices in Northern Vietnam and Policy Recommendations</title><sec id="Sec001048"><title>Introduction</title><p>Previous research has shown that farmers in north-western Vietnam know about soil erosion and soil conservation, but still do not apply preventive practices (Saint-Macary et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001063">2010</xref>), and without soil conservation measures in place, large amounts of soil are eroded from sloping land (Schmitter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001065">2010</xref>; Valentin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001086">2008</xref>; Wezel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001092">2002</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn00107">00107</xref> The objective of this study was to simulate the adoption of soil conservation practices, and to assess the impact of a payment policy for the application of such practices in the north-west of Vietnam.</p></sec><sec id="Sec001049"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec001050"><title>Models</title><p>This study applied Mathematical Programming-based Multi-Agent Systems (MP-MAS), an integrated modeling approach used in order to evaluate the adoption of soil conservation practices in north-western Vietnam, and to suggest policy options that would promote sustainable agriculture.

When the maize yield using leucaena hedges equaled 110 % of the baseline, the conservation area was only 79.24 ha and the cumulative adoption rate was 91 %, while in the baseline the adoption rate was only 53 % and the growing area 2.31 ha.

Compared to grass strips and grass barriers, there was a faster uptake for leucaena hedges, because growing maize with leucaena hedges was more profitable than the other options, due to the higher maize yields produced. Applying grass strips to the maize fields generated more profit than when using grass barriers, and so more agents adopted this technique. At a level of three million VND ha<sup>−1</sup>, the adoption rates for leucaena hedges, grass strips and grass barriers were 100 %, 90 % and 69 % respectively.

This implies a positive relationship between the amount of cash received, the area under soil conservation and the reduction in soil losses. In terms of the relationship between payments and the reduction in soil losses, the costs incurred when reducing soil erosion could be derived from the total payments divided by the quantity of soil-loss reduction for each agent. The last row in Table <xref rid="Tab00108" ref-type="table">10.8</xref> shows the costs needed to reduce soil loss. For a payment of 3 million VND per ha, the cost of reducing soil loss was 201,000 VND Mg<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup> and the quantity of soil losses decreased by 39.29 %. At the highest level of payments (6 million VND ha<sup>−1</sup>), the average cost per year was 401,000 VND Mg<sup>−1</sup>, and there was a reduction of 44.23 % in total soil losses.

Sensitivity analysis with regard to crop yields and labor requirements indicated that low yields and high labor requirements were constraints upon agents using soil conservation practices – with low crop yields being the most important constraint. This supports the results of a case study carried out in Thailand by Jones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001031">2002</xref>), who showed that even if the labor required to manage soil conservation practices was lower than that for conventional practices, if crop yields were not attractive enough, the farmers involved were reluctant to adopt these practices (Jones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001031">2002</xref>). In Vietnam, one study in a mountainous area looking at the adoption of direct-seeding, mulch-based cropping systems which involve minimum tillage of the soils covered by dead or living plants, showed that labor requirements were the major constraint on farmers adopting such practices (Affholder et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00101">2010</xref>). It is therefore essential to improve soil conservation practices in terms of increasing yields and reducing the labor required.</p><p>When applying soil conservation practices in the model, farmers lost income (due to lower productivity) and had higher labor requirements, and these challenges prevented farmers from using them more widely. This finding confirms the conclusions made by Saint-Macary et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001063">2010</xref>) in their study – that soil conservation practices disseminated in the north-west of Vietnam were not economically attractive enough for farmers to adopt them, although these practices had been promoted for over a decade. This implies that there were no appropriate policies or well-functioning extension services in place; the projects were not effective in terms of supporting the adoption of soil conservation practices. Without this support, soil conservation practices will have little impact upon farm incomes and environmental sustainability.</p><p>The sensitivity analysis used here points toward recommending technology changes in soil conservation, as well as encouraging scientists to create higher yields from the use of soil conservation practices and reduce the labor required to support them. The analysis of adoption rates for soil conservation practices here suggests the need for the Vietnamese government and non-governmental organizations to help improve adoption rates as a whole.</p></sec><sec id="Sec001059"><title>Payment Policies</title><p>Agent-based models have been increasingly applied for policy assessment purposes (Balmann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00105">1997</xref>; Berger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001011">2001</xref>; Happe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001024">2006</xref>; Janssen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001028">2000</xref>; Matthews <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001043">2006</xref>; Kok et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001036">2007</xref>; Berger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001013">2006</xref>; Schreinemachers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001071">2007</xref>). Using sensitivity analysis, this study <italic>ex-ante</italic> assessed policies supporting the adoption of soil conservation practices. By introducing a payment policy into the model, the costs of reducing soil erosion could be identified by comparing payment levels against the reductions in soil erosion. It was found that at a cost of 201,000 VND Mg<sup>−1</sup> soil losses was reduced by 39 %. This cost was calculated based upon the compensation received under the payment policies, but did not include the costs associated with disseminating the soil conservation practices – such as improving extension services or conducting experiments. However, these findings will be helpful for policy makers in terms of providing a rough estimate of the costs involved in reducing soil erosion within the region. It can therefore be concluded from the results of this study that the level of payment needed to support individual farmers in applying soil conservation practices is in the region of 3 million VND ha<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup> – equal to about 187.5 USD ha<sup>−1</sup>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn00108">00108</xref> and that the appropriate payment lies in the range of 50–200 USD ha<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup>, as suggested by Affholder et al.

Farmers in some areas have; therefore, reduced orchard management or substituted more profitable crops for litchi trees. Although this is a logical adjustment for market-oriented farmers, the substitution of vegetables for fruit trees has raised environmental concerns, as seasonal crops require more intense tillage, can worsen soil erosion, use greater amounts of agrochemicals, and intensify the run-off from hillsides – a factor linked to the flooding of lowland areas (Turkelboom et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001085">1997</xref>; Delang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001021">2002</xref>; Sidle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001076">2005</xref>).

The land use decisions of farm households were simulated by optimizing net household incomes under resource and knowledge constraints, including monthly land, labor and water constraints, an annual cash constraint and the level of knowledge on innovations. Agents decided what crops to plant on what type of land, as well as what inputs (fertilizers, pesticides, labor and irrigation) and how much of each to apply. Decision-making was separated in terms of investment, production and expenditure decisions, as discussed in Schreinemachers and Berger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001069">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001070">2011</xref>). Prices were assumed constant throughout the simulation, which was run for 15 years.

Within the landscape, agricultural fields were represented as pixels, 40x40 m in size, and these were divided into twelve types of agricultural land, determined by combinations of average slope gradient (less than 8 %, 8–19 %, 20–35 % and above 35 %) and average altitude (below 650 m, 650–1,000 m and above 1,000 m). The decision-model constrained what types of land were suitable for what crops; for instance, litchi could only be grown on pixels above 650 m above sea level, and steep areas were assumed to require more labor than flat areas. Other than these physical characteristics, soil fertility was not considered in this application.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Crop production</italic> was modeled as based on the FAO CropWat model (Smith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001077">1992</xref>), which assumes that if average monthly crop water demand is not met by sufficient crop water supply then the crop yield reduces proportionally. The crop water supply was modeled as the sum of effective rainfall and irrigation water supply (from groundwater pumping or reservoirs), and for each farm household was approximated using a backward calculation based on the observed land use, irrigation methods and effective rainfall, and assuming no water shortage in the year of data collection.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Litchi</italic> fruit yields are a function of the age of a tree, the intensity of the management applied and the water supply. Three levels of management were defined in the model, namely unmanaged, poorly managed and well managed.

The model allowed agents to switch between management levels and between innovations. The effect of shelf-life extension could not be tested as it was unclear if this innovation would be used by farmers or middlemen; therefore, we assessed what the price premium would have to be in order to maintain the existing litchi area.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Outcome indicators used to assess the simulation output included the area under litchi trees, net household incomes, the potential risk of pesticide use as calculated by the Environmental Impact Quotient (EIQ) method (Kovach et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001095">1992</xref>) and erosion soil loss quantified using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE).</p></sec><sec id="Sec001065"><title>Data</title><p>All economic information for designing and parameterizing the agent decision model came from farm level data based on a random sample of 303 farm households interviewed in October/November 2006.

This shows that each agent in the model did not exactly represent a real-world farm household, but that at the watershed, village or group level, agents on average were a good representation of reality.</p><p>The impact of the innovations was assessed by comparing a baseline scenario – representing current conditions in the absence of innovations, with alternative scenarios which included the innovations. The results of the baseline scenario showed that the litchi area would decline annually by 2.3 %, while the general intensification of land use would increase incomes by 3.4 %, pesticide loads by about 3.5 % and soil erosion by 1.3 %.</p><p>As can be seen from Fig. <xref rid="Fig001019" ref-type="fig">10.19</xref>, the introduction of each innovation reduced the decline in litchi area, but the effect was weakest for improved irrigation and strongest for cooperative fruit drying. If simultaneously introducing all three innovations, then the average area under litchi was found to be 6 % greater than in the baseline, but still declined over time in spite of a relatively successful adoption of the three innovations, especially AFI. The three innovations were; therefore, able to limit the decline in litchi orchards, but not reverse the trend, and while the innovations helped to slightly reduce levels of pesticide use and soil erosion, there was no notable effect on average household income.<fig id="Fig001019"><label>Fig. 10.19</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Simulated impact of four innovations on the area under litchi trees, in average % annual change (2005–2020)</p></caption><alternatives id="MO001019"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/978-3-642-33377-4_10_Fig19_HTML.png"/><graphic specific-use="print-only" mime-subtype="TIFF" xlink:href="978-3-642-33377-4_10_Fig19_Print.tif"/></alternatives></fig></p><p>We analyzed at what level of fresh litchi prices the decline in litchi orchards would reverse.

The results in Fig. <xref rid="Fig001020" ref-type="fig">10.20</xref> show that without innovations, the decline in litchi orchards stabilized at about 15 baht/kg, but with all innovations available there was a moderate growth in litchi orchards, even at a price of 12 baht/kg. As it takes about 5 years for newly planted litchi trees to give their first fruit yield, the effect on current incomes was small. Higher litchi prices reduced average pesticide use in the watershed, as higher litchi prices increased the share of pesticide-extensive litchi in the agricultural land and reduced the share of pesticide-intensive seasonal vegetables.

While this came at the price of higher data requirements and more effort needed for data interpretation, the coupling of models allowed us to simulate more realistic scenarios to a higher precision and thus potentially greater accuracy.</p><sec id="Sec001077"><title>Adoption of Soil Conservation Measures</title><p>The results of this study agree with those in Sect. <xref rid="Sec001047" ref-type="sec">10.6</xref>, in so far as soil conservation measures were initially unattractive for farmers. After 5 years; however, adoption in our simulations extended to a substantial fraction of the maize area. The primary reason for non-adoption in Quang’s study was crop competition with hedgerows and thus lower yields, but this did not apply to the same extent to our scenarios, which assumed cover crops that did not compete for nutrients with other crops. Another reason, mentioned by Saint-Macary et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001063">2010</xref>), was the comparatively higher costs of soil conservation methods simulated in Sect. <xref rid="Sec001047" ref-type="sec">10.6</xref>. In our simulations, we tested the adoption of low cost methods (which required labor, but no cash investments) used to reduce this problem. However, as the sensitivity to fertilizer prices showed, the costs of soil conservation measures still mattered when it came to adoption. If the trend in yield decline shown in the baseline could be reversed through the use of cheap fertilizer, this would obviously be preferred to soil amelioration using labor intensive soil conservation measures. Saint-Macary et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001063">2010</xref>) also found that a lack of knowledge on soil conservation measures was an important obstacle to implementation by farmers. In our scenario, we assumed unlimited diffusion of knowledge, a simplification used to concentrate on the coupled aspects of the model. In future simulations, an assessment of adoption rates would need to be included. Still, even at this early stage, an important benefit of the coupled model is its ability to depict farmers’ strategy changes from extensification under decreasing yields to intensification under decreasing fertilizer prices.</p></sec><sec id="Sec001078"><title>Effects of Soil Conservation</title><p>Our results show that in the coupled model farmers chose soil conservation to gain higher yields, as long as this was profitable due to high fertilizer costs and when competitive as compared to other crops. In contrast to the coupled model, with continuously changing land cover, the standalone LUCIA model showed that in the medium term soil conservation led to reduced erosion and higher yields. As suggested by the much higher soil erosion rates in the standalone runs, soil conservation measures did make a difference regarding erosion, but in the coupled model these soil conserving effects were partially compensated for by the changing land cover, or distorted by co-variation with fertilizer effects.</p><p>Although soil conservation was successfully applied on maize plots, both model versions agreed that soil conservation did not have a major impact at the catchment scale, owing to the relatively small area under maize (less than 5%) when compared to other land cover types. In particular, areas under tree crops remained relatively stable over time and did not contribute substantially to erosion. Only a small portion of the large amounts of sediment simulated at the catchment outflow stemmed from the respective cells; reflecting that the model does not distinguish between eroded material native to a pixel and sediment passing through, having originated elsewhere in the watershed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec001079"><title>Spatial Aspects and Model Complexity</title><p>Land use change implemented in the coupled model system led to substantially different outputs, e.g., reduced soil erosion and higher yields of unfertilized maize after 5 years – when compared to the LUCIA standalone simulation, showing the added value of coupling. Agents were able to react to changes in soil productivity, at least at the farm level, and leave unproductive plots fallow, as a farmer would do in reality. This may also have been the reason for lower spatial variability, while in the standalone model maize was still grown even when the soil was no longer fertile enough for sustained production.</p><p>In conclusion, the greater the number of variables, levels of complexity and thus degrees of freedom there are, the more accurate the representation of reality will be if the model system is well calibrated. As a trade-off, this requires more input data and more effort in terms of interpreting the model outputs (Marohn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001041">2012</xref>). While particularly non-linear cause-effect relationships can be represented to a greater extent, the effects of changes in single parameters cannot be easily identified. Thus, to experimentally attribute effects to specific causes, standalone versions or more specialized individual models may be the best choice (e.g., Pansak et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001050">2010</xref>) for interactions between maize yields and erosion at the plot scale), whereas the approach taken here may be more appropriate for assessing the effects of integrated scenarios on certain outcomes at the landscape scale, and not analytically dissecting a process into its component parts. In our case study, it was not possible to unambiguously attribute plot-specific soil erosion rates or topsoil depth to a specific soil conservation treatment, for soil conservation was applied only on maize plots, and over time the locations of the maize plots – or the crops grown on each specific plot – changed in the coupled model system.</p><p>Although the inclusion of agent decisions at the farm level led to more plausible results, further improvements may be achieved by taking into account plot-specific decisions. In practice, farmers monitor plot soil fertility and optimize cropping decisions accordingly. Implementing these mechanisms may lead to a reduction in spatial variability of soil fertility over the long run, as farmers would fallow degraded plots or to increasing spatial variability as distance to the farmstead may become a decision criterion to preferentially allocate labor and fertilizer resources. However, to incorporate this into the model would significantly increase the computing power required. A major challenge in future versions will thus be to bridge the different aggregation strategies that exist between the plot and farm levels, while using a reasonable amount of effort.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec001080"><title>General Conclusions and Outlook</title><p>The fact that the case study locations presented in this chapter were all located in the Uplands Program’s study area, plus the exchange among colleagues regarding modeling approaches allows to compare trends modeled and observed in the field and aspects of the different models. This chapter showed the different perspectives of the models presented and the resulting level of detail used according to the research question posed by each approach: Detailed spatially distributed biophysical processes need to be represented in the LUCIA model, which looks into matter translocation in small watersheds. As land use change dynamics are of secondary importance in this approach, they are exogenous to the model. In comparison, the FALLOW model operates at a semi-quantitative biophysical level, but integrates socio-economic factors. MP-MAS focuses on household economics and thus puts less emphasis on biophysical processes, which are simplified in the TSPC as nutrient balances or empirical equations on yield potential. CropDSS serves as a decision support tool for policy makers that predicts yields and thus combines a process based crop model with a large-scale GIS database, but clustering spatial units and not taking matter flows in the landscape into account.</p><p>Each of these approaches has its validity and no single model can address all questions that turn up within given settings. In general, the models applied to the uplands showed similar challenges for farmers: Progressing soil erosion and degradation as a consequence of unsustainable farming methods, potentials of soil conservation measures, but lack of adoption owed to prohibitive costs or farmers’ preference of short-term benefit, dependence of cash crop yields on massive fertilizer inputs are the main trends, which are modified by the level of agricultural intensification and market access a watershed has reached. Model projections differed only with respect to maize yield levels in the farther future; the question, in how far productivity of an unsustainable system can be maintained by fertilizer inputs or when exactly it will collapse, was answered differently by LUCIA and FALLOW on one side (where maize yields increased under farmers’ practice) and the coupled LUCIA-MP-MAS model system (where only the soil conservation treatment gave increasing yields). In this case, a comparison between MP-MAS standalone and the coupled version on the same Chieng Khoi dataset might lead to new insights.</p><p>The contributions presented here also show a cross-section of the potential model adaptation and coupling options needed in order to fit a model to a specific research question. Interest in and the technical possibilities of combining spatial scales and temporal resolutions, empiric and mechanistic approaches, have steadily increased over the last few years, which is reflected in the mushrooming number of approaches put forward, such as Open Modelling Interface (Open MI) (Moore and Tindall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001044">2005</xref>), CORMAS (Becu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00109">2003</xref>), the PCRaster Python Framework (Karssenberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001034">2010</xref>; Schmitz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001067">2009</xref>) and many others.</p><p>Within the research of the Uplands Program, interdisciplinary modeling – as an approach (rather than as a technical tool) that can link scientific domains, has created added value in terms of:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Discussing approaches, their interfaces and potential linkages, from the conceptual level to the technical level</p></list-item><list-item><p>Understanding the perspectives of other disciplines and how these influence mind models of a researcher’s scientific domain.
