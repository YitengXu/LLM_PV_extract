exhibit lipid domains (or rafts) of coexisting phases, which can govern cellular functions and processes. As previously reported by us, membrane fusion efficiency was modulated by controlling membrane charge and phase state in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs, 10-50 μm) used as biomimetic membranes.</p><p id="Par33">OBJECTIVES</p><p id="Par34">In this work, we proposed a new composition of the fusogenic system preferentially in the gel phase at room temperature but fluid in physiological temperatures; additionally, membrane fusion efficiency was also investigated.</p><p id="Par35">MATERIALS AND METHODS</p><p id="Par36">The fusogenic system was based on large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs, 100-150 nm) and composed of an equimolar mixture of neutral and positively charged gel lipids, whereas the GUVs were composed of a mixture of zwitterionic and/or negatively charged fluid lipids. Initially, the fusogenic system was characterized using dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential, anisotropy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Then, fusion efficiency was characterized using microscopy-based fluorescence assays (lipid and content mixing).</p><p id="Par37">DISCUSSION AND RESULTS</p><p id="Par38">The DLS and zeta potential measurements exhibited a size average of ≈ 120 nm and a surface charge of ≈ 42 mV, respectively. The anisotropy and DSC showed that the lipid mixture was in the gel phase at room temperature. The incubation of the fusogenic system with neutral GUVs did not lead to significant lipid mixing and therefore no/low membrane fusion. However, negatively charged GUVs exhibited high lipid and content mixing, as expected in systems with efficient membrane fusion (Lira et al, in preparation). Interestingly, the highly membrane fusion efficiency induced phase-separation in the GUVs.</p><p id="Par39">CONCLUSION</p><p id="Par40">We demonstrated that membrane fusion can be controlled by modulating the membrane charge of the system in spite of the membrane phase state of the fusogenic system.

On the other hand, Lo vesicles were completely or partially insoluble to all detergents. Two different interactions with Ld phase were determined: increase in GUV surface area and turbidity before solubilization (C10E5, TX165, Tween 20 and OG) and vesicle rupturing/bursting (DDM, Chaps, CTAB and SDS) that pairs with no increase on solubilization profile acquired by turbidity measurements.</p><p id="Par70">CONCLUSION</p><p id="Par71">Detergents that promote increase in GUV surface area and turbidity before solubilization apparently can insert on Ld phase and make flip-flop across the membrane. The other detergents are not able to make flip-flop, so their insertion on Ld phase causes tension on the membrane curvature, which is alleviate by bursting.

In this context, Langmuir monomolecular films at the liquid-liquid interface can be used as experimental models to investigate the dynamic behavior of surfactants at the oil/water (O/W) interface in ME. We have used this technique to characterize the composition and thermal behavior of monomolecular layers of L-α-phosphatidylcholine (EPC) and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) at the Vaseline/water interface (VAS/W) by using a homemade Langmuir interfacial trough. Besides, we have studied the interfacial behavior, at the air/water interface (A/W), of VAS/DPPC pseudo-binary mixtures with different VAS/PC molar ratios. This combined analysis was carried out with the aim of theoretically predict and design stable formulations of ME. From our study of adsorption isotherms of DPPC at the VAS/W interface, we obtained the saturation equilibrium pressure of DPPC (πeq, sat ∼ 27.3 ± 0.1 mN / m), which could be interpolated in the π-MMA isotherm at the VAS/W interface to calculate the minimum area of DPPC (MMAmin) corresponding to the equilibrium pressure of DPPC at this interface. With the aid of geometric calculations, the MMAmin could be used as a starting point to estimate a suitable DPPC:VAS ratio to formulate stable miniemulsions particles according to the desired size and concentration. Controlling the VAS:DPPC molar ratio, the theoretical predictions made from the Langmuir film model were satisfactory for the synthesis of particles with average diameters in the range of 100 nm to 400 nm and with low DPPC concentrations (0.01mM) in the global system. The ME obtained were characterized by DLS and were stable at least for one month in suspension.</p><p id="Par95"><bold>Keywords:</bold> Langmuir films, nanoemulsions, liquid/liquid interface</p><p id="Par96"><bold>Supported by:</bold> CONICET, FONCYT, SeCyT-UNC.</p><p><bold>08788 - Poster Session</bold></p><p id="Par98"><bold>AA.06 - Impact of macromolecular crowding on the mesomorphic behaviour of lipid self-assemblies</bold></p><p id="Par99">Agustin Mangiarotti<sup>1</sup>, <bold>Luis Alberto Bagatolli</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup></p><p id="Par100"><sup>1</sup>Biofísica, Instituto de Investigación Médica Mercedes y Martín Ferreyra - INIMEC (CONICET)- Universidad Nacional de Córdoba, Córdoba, Argentina (, Argentina)</p><p id="Par101">INTRODUCTION</p><p id="Par102">We established that intracellular water dynamics in yeast displaying oscillatory glycolysis, is coupled to, and oscillates synchronously with, the concentration of ATP.

Specifically, we found that the extent of water dynamics correlates with an increased fraction of randomly oriented configurations in the polymers, as Gelatin&gt;PEG&gt;IgG&gt;HSA. Also we found that structural transitions from globular to extended conformations in proteins induced lamellar to non-lamellar phase transitions in mixtures of DOPC and monoolein. In addition, Raman experiments show that high proportions of randomly oriented conformations display increased fractions of tetracoordinated water, a configuration that is dominant in ice.

The monodispersity of GUVs is essential in terms of the quantitative analysis and the experimental reproducibility as biomimetic microreactors. Here we established a highly reproducible plug-and-play microfluidic-based method to generate the monodisperse GUVs without surface treatment[1] of the channel or precise flow-rate adjustment[2]. In this technique, the water-in-oil (W/O) droplets were generated in the microfluidic channel by hydrodynamic flow focusing and transferred across the W-O interface to form thin-shelled water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) droplets as a precursor of GUVs. The success rate of the W/O droplets transferring reached nearly 100% by stabilizing the co-flow of oil and water as well as adjusting the curvature of the interface. Owing to interfacial energy minimization, the thin oil layer of the W/O/W droplets was accumulated and detached to form GUVs. We performed a membrane protein insertion assay to confirm the unilamellarity of the GUVs and shrinkage of the GUVs caused by osmotic pressure. The present device can be operated right after bonding the monolithically replicated PDMS channel and plugging tubes. The stable state of the W/O/W droplet generation can be obtained within a short time (1–2 min) so that the amount of inner solution can be reduced down to ~20 μl. GUVs generated by the dewetting of the excess oil can be used as a unilamllar biological compartment as a cell mimic, and the present technology is especially useful to conduct rare or expensive reactions. We believe that this method will become one of the major platforms for artificial cell studies and quantitative biochemical studies which involve the lipid membrane.

Understanding the fundamental biophysics of light-triggered changes in bio-systems is crucial for cell viability and optimization of clinical applications of light-induced processes in optogenetics and photopharmacology. Here, we employ cell-sized giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) to investigate light-triggered changes on the material properties of membranes doped with azobenzene-phosphatidylcholine (azo-PC ) as a photoswitch. In particular, we examined light-triggered vesicle area change, reversibility and kinetics of photoswitching and membrane bending rigidity. We show that light can be used to manipulate the shape and mechanics of these synthetic cells. Light-induced changes in vesicle area were quantified by employing vesicle electro-deformation. Our studies demonstrated membrane area increase due to cis photoisomerization of azo-PC which is consistent with results from molecular dynamics simulations. At high azo-PC fractions (&gt;50 mol%), large and complex shape transformations were observed. Photoswitching was reversible but showed faster kinetics from cis to trans isomerization. Trans-to-cis isomerization of azo-PC rendered the membrane softer. With increasing fractions of trans azo-PC the GUV membrane stiffens, while increasing cis-azo-PC fraction softens the membrane. Our results demonstrate that membrane mechanics could be easily controlled for azo-PC containing membranes through light.</p><p id="Par220"><bold>Keywords:</bold> biomembranes, biophysics, photoswitchable lipids</p><p><bold>08734 - Poster Session</bold></p><p id="Par222"><bold>AA.15 - Self-organization of protocell accompanied by micro phase-segregation in a crowding solution</bold></p><p id="Par223"><bold>Fumika Fujita</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup>, Hiroki Sakuta<sup>1</sup>, Kanta Tsumoto<sup>2</sup>, Koichiro Sadakane<sup>1</sup>, Takahiro Kenmotsu<sup>1</sup>, Kenichi Yoshikawa<sup>1</sup></p><p id="Par224"><sup>1</sup>Faculty of Life and Medical Sciences, Doshisha University (, Japan)</p><p><sup>2</sup>Faculty of Engineering, Mie University (, Japan)</p><p id="Par225">INTRODUCTION</p><p id="Par226">Living cells on the Earth maintain their lives through the self-organization of their structure under the crowding conditions of biopolymers on the order of 30 - 40 weight%.

The brain is responsible for several cognitive, motor and metabolic functions, and over the years the functions are compromised due to the degeneration of neuronal circuits and structures that are coordinated. The senescence causes considerable changes in the substantia nigra pars compacta. This nuclei of dopaminergic neurons is part of a movement modulation circuit, which once damaged, causes a decline in the subject's motricity pattern. S100B is a calcium-binding protein, expressed mainly in astrocytes, which plays several intracellular and extracellular roles, and its release is increased in cases of trauma to the nervous tissue, and for this reason it is very useful as a marker of injury to the nervous system central. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of senescence on neuronal and glial cells of substantia nigra pars compacta. In this study, 12 male wistar rats were used, 6 young (3 months) and 6 elderly (23 months), and in both groups the brains were removed, sectioned and submitted to immunohistochemistry for S100B and Tyrosine-hydroxylase. Later, the slides were analyzed in an optical microscope. The results show a large degeneration of S100B+ astrocytes in Substantia nigra pars compacta, however there were no statistically significant changes in the density of TH+ neurons in the same region. On the other hand, there was considerable degeneration of the projection fibers, as well as the immunoreactivity of TH+ neurons. We conclude that senescence is related to the anatomical and neurochemical changes observed in our animal group. Therefore, it is important that further studies are carried out with different experimental techniques, analyzing other cell markers, to see if these results can be supported or not.</p><p id="Par294"><bold>Keywords:</bold> Aging, dopamine, astrocytes</p><p id="Par295"><bold>Supported by:</bold> CNPq and CAPES.</p><p><bold>08665 - Poster Session</bold></p><p id="Par297"><bold>AA.22 - Clotrimazole fluidizes phospholipid membranes and localizes at the hydrophobic part near the polar part of the membrane</bold></p><p id="Par298"><bold>JUAN CARMELO GÓMEZ FERNANDEZ</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup>, Alessio Ausili<sup>1</sup>, Ilya Yakimenko<sup>1</sup>, José A.

Fusion occurs through specific intermediates; (i) docking, when the membranes bind, (ii) hemifusion, when lipids in the outer leaflet mix, and (iii) full-fusion (content mixing), when lipids on both leaflets as well as their aqueous contents mix. As a result, the end product is a larger compartment whose dimensions are the sum of the fusing membrane areas. Due to the high complexity, fusion is often studied using spectroscopic methods and reconstituted lipid vesicles, but these systems carry a number of limitations - the inability to detect intermediates, the increase in vesicle area, and the inherent complicated kinetics. Recently, we have developed a reconstituted system based on the fusion of charged large and giant unilamellar vesicles (LUVs and GUVs) that is able to circumvent these limitations (Lira et al., Bioph. J. 2019). It enables the detection of fusion intermediates, efficiency and kinetics in real-time using microfluidic devices. Here, we extended its capabilities by using a combination of independent and quantitative imaging and micromanipulation techniques, allowing us to quantify fusion efficiency, to estimate membrane’s composition upon fusion in real-time and measure membrane mechanics on the level of a single vesicle. The quantification of area increase upon fusion is reported for the first time. The system is extremely efficient, and tens of thousands LUVs fused to a single GUV. Using a double optical tweezer setup coupled to a confocal microscope, we simultaneously detect fusion intermediates and measure the forces associated with the interaction of the fusing membranes, which is in the picoNewton force range. We anticipate that the insights here will help to unravel how regulatory factors mediate fusion in cells as well as it will support the development of highly efficient drug delivery systems.</p><p id="Par316"><bold>Keywords:</bold> Membrane fusion, fusion intermediates, reconstituted systems</p><p id="Par317"><bold>Supported by:</bold> University of Groningen, MaxSynBio, Fapesp</p><p><bold>08506 - Poster Session</bold></p><p id="Par319"><bold>AA.24 - The role of NPP1 in the biomineralization process: In vitro propagation of calcium phosphate minerals.</bold></p><p id="Par320"><bold>Luiz Henrique da Silva Andrilli</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup>, Bruno Zocaratto Favarin<sup>2</sup>, Ana Paula Ramos<sup>1</sup>, Pietro Ciancaglini<sup>1</sup></p><p id="Par321"><sup>1</sup>Chemistry Department, University of São Paulo (São Paulo, Brazil)</p><p><sup>2</sup>Physics Department, University of São Paulo (São Paulo, Brazil)</p><p id="Par322">INTRODUCTION</p><p id="Par323">The process of bone mineralization is mediated by matrix vesicles (MVs) that act as starting sites of hydroxyapatite formation.

The short- term adaptation involves desaturating the acyl chains of their membrane phospholipids. The temperature dependence of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) biosynthesis relies on the transcriptional control of the des gene, which codes for the sole desaturase of this microorganism, Δ5-Des, and is upregulated upon a cold shock. The increased expression of des in response to low temperatures is strictly controlled by a canonical two-component system constituted by the histidine kinase DesK and its cognate response regulator DesR. This regulatory pathway has been dissected at the genetic, biochemical and structural levels. However, the membrane biophysical changes regulating this pathway remain poorly studied. Therefore, the main objective of this work is to characterize and determine parameters associated with lipid membrane fluidity changes in Bs, as well as with model membranes with a similar composition, upon temperature variations. In order to obtain membranes with different lipid composition we resorted to a set of Bs strains. A wild type strain exhibits 2 % UFAs at 37ºC and 8 %UFAs at 25ºC in the acyl chains of membrane phospholipids. Overexpression of the des gene (Des+ strain) leads to membranes containing up to 12% and 20% UFAs at 37ºC and 25ºC, respectively. In contrast, a mutant strain lacking the des gene (Des-) is unable to produce UFAs. Lipid membranes of these strains were extracted and purified. We have determined quantitative parameters associated with membrane fluidity by fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy techniques. These studies provide the first step towards the biophysical characterization of B. subtilis plasma membrane adaptation upon a temperature decrease.

Their transport activity is regulated by different stimuli such as pH, binding of cations, phosphorylation/dephosphorylation or interaction with other proteins. All aquaporins share a general fold and tetrameric quaternary structure. Each protomer present two conserved regions that regulate the specificity of transport: the Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA) motives and the aromatic/arginine (Ar/R) selectivity filter. The plant PIP subfamily of aquaporins distinguish from other members of the family due to a longer intracellular loopD which is involved in its gating mechanism. The open/closed conformational transition in PIP channels is triggered by intracellular acidification, and different pH0,5 are found for homotetramers and heterotertamers form by PIP1 and PIP2 paralogues. Our goal is to elucidate the role of specific LoopD’ s amino acids in the modulation of PIP gating mechanism by intracellular pH. Our in vitro and in silico experiments, for wild type and mutant PIP show that: i- a conserved Leu residue in the cytoplasmic constriction is the structural element that determines pore blockage and, ii- a Pro residue present in PIP2 but not in PIP1 channels is involved in differential pH0.5 of homo and heterotetramers dose-response curves. So, two loopD residues, Leu 206 and Pro 194, works in combination with the pH sensor His 202 to control effective pore closing.</p><p id="Par488"><bold>Keywords:</bold> aquaporin, gating, water transport</p><p id="Par489"><bold>Supported by:</bold> Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBACYT 2018), Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica (PICT-2017-0244, PICT-2019-0387), and Universidad Nacional de Hurlingham (PIUNHAUR-5 2018).</p><p><bold>08369 - Poster Session</bold></p><p id="Par491"><bold>BA.07 - EXPLORING THE CX26 HEMICHANNEL using MD simulations</bold></p><p id="Par492">Juan M.

The development of this disease is due to the disordered growth of cells that invade tissues and organs and tend to be very aggressive and uncontrollable. The Na,K-ATPase (NKA) pump is an integral enzyme of the plasma membrane that depends on ATP for the active transport of the Na+ and K+ ions and is responsible for maintaining a low intracellular Na+ / K+ ratio. The enzyme has three subunits: The alfa subunit, responsible for catalytic activity and ionic transport; The beta subunit, responsible for the normal activity of NKA and contains several glycosylation sites; And the gama (or FXYD2) subunit that has a modulating function and influences the kinetic properties of the enzyme. This pump plays a fundamental role in the survival of cells, and is closely related to the amount of phospholipids and cholesterol in the membrane, which are necessary for its correct operation.

Recently, this approach was extrapolated to steady-state experiments, in what is called spectral phasors (SP), which are obtained from the Fourier transform of the fluorescence emission spectrum. In this work, we revise key mathematical aspects that lead us to re-interpret SP as the characteristic function of a probability distribution. This allows us to introduce a new tool, called multispectral phasor (MSP), that seize not only the information from the emission spectrum, but from the full excitation-emission matrix (EEM). Additionally, here we also developed an open-source Java software in order to facilitate the data processing. Using simulated spectra, we prove that there is a tight relationship between the MSP polar coordinates and the characteristics of the EEM, similar to what is known for SP. Due to our mathematical re-interpretation, we also show that MSP can be a powerful tool to tackle spectral signal unmixing problems in a more general case than SP. In addition, we proposed two main biophysical applications of MSP: protein conformational studies and Föster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). As a prove of concept, we experimentally measure the EEM changes upon denaturation of the human serum albumin (HSA) and during a HSA-ANS FRET. In this sense, we were able to use MSP to interpret the results in a simpler and finer way and in complete agreement with what is known in the literature. Understanding a protein’s EEM as a molecular conformation fingerprint will open a door for the use of MSP as a tool to analyze and comprehend protein conformational changes.</p><p id="Par668"><bold>Keywords:</bold> Spectral phasor, fluorescence excitation-emission matrix, signal unmixing</p><p id="Par669"><bold>Supported by:</bold> CONICET (PIP2013-2015), FonCyT (PICT2012-1377, PICT2015-2575).

Recently, the lack of expression of ADAM-33 was related to the triple negative breast cancer, basal-like markers and correlated with shorter overall survival and metastasis-free survival. Usually, the detection of ADAM-33 is performed by immuhistochemistry, which is laborious and time consuming. In this context, electrochemical immunosensors are a good alternative for protein detection as they may provide fast, straightforward, and label-free determinations. We developed an electroanalytical immunosensing platform consisting of a gold electrode modified with self-assembled monolayers of cystamine with anti-ADAM-33 IgG monoclonal antibodies covalently attached. Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments were employed to characterize the immunosensor. The ADAM-33 detection was based on the variation of the charge transfer resistance (∆Rct), obtained through EIS using [Fe(CN)6]3-/4- as probe, after incubating the immunosensor in the presence of the biomarker. ∆Rct increased linearly with ADAM-33 concentration in the range of 0.5-1.5 μg mL-1, with a detection limit of 0.31 μg mL-1. The immunosensor was able to successfully detect ADAM-33 in cell extracts from human breast cancer lines, without suffering significant influence from other coexisting biomolecules. The results suggest that the developed device is a promising, feasible, and sensitive tool to detect ADAM-33 in breast cancer isolated material.

The co-assembly of nucleotides and metal ions through coordination interactions at specific sites give raise to nanoscopic scaffolds called metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). These materials display a range of promising applications in biomedicine including drug loading, molecular delivery and bioimaging. In the current work, we perform the synthesis and structural characterization of MOFs based on coordination polymers formed between nucleotides, metal ions and quantum dots. OBJECTIVE: our purpose is to develop a synthesis protocol to produce complexes involving purine-based nucleotides, metal ions and ZnO quantum dots. We aim to provide detailed characterization on the structure of these nanostructured materials and test their in vitro behavior toward tumor cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: the synthesis protocol consists in the solubilization of guanosine or adenosine monophosphates, which have versatile binding sites, in the presence of metal ions such as Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Ni and Ag. ZnO quantum dots (QDs) are prepared through a hydrolisis reaction of zinc acetate in the presence of sodium hydroxide and methanol. This procedure leads to the formation of QDs that emit greener light upon UV irradiation. The QDs are co-solubilized with nucleotides and metal ions leading to the spontaneous formation of nanoparticles over a course of hours or days. To perform structural and morphological characterization of the complexes, we have used fluorescence microscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), fluorimetric assays and circular dichroism (CD). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: the characterization techniques allowed to select complexes that are most viable for the research. Interestingly, metal ions that participate in biological roles (e.g., Ca and Mg) have led to better results in comparison to those that do not have a biological function. The formation of complexes has been observed for atoms with neighbors regarding their valence layers and having relatively similar atomic masses. Importantly, the incorporation of ZnO has been observed and complexes have been found to form well ordered, crystal-like, nanoscopic assemblies. CONCLUSION: a viable protocol to produce ordered nanoparticles with QDs embedded in the crystal structure has been developed. From the results obtained so far, the nanostructured materials are promising for tests with cell membranes.</p><p id="Par1040"><bold>Keywords:</bold> coordination polymers, quantum dots, metal-organic frameworks</p><p id="Par1041"><bold>Supported by:</bold> CNPq</p><p><bold>08480 - Poster Session</bold></p><p id="Par1043"><bold>CB.16 - PROJECT Characterization of the antifungal activity of metabolites from native brazilian plants against the strains of the genus Cryptococcus and Candida</bold></p><p id="Par1044"><bold>Mônica Maria de Almeida</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup>, Karen Luise Lang<sup>1</sup>, Gabriella Freitas Ferreira<sup>1</sup></p><p id="Par1045"><sup>1</sup>Multicêntrico em Bioquímica e Biologia Molecular (PMBqBM), Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora campus Governador Valadares (Minas Gerais, BRASIL)</p><p id="Par1046">INTRODUCTION</p><p id="Par1047">The frequency of invasive fungal infections caused by opportunistic pathogens has increased worldwide.

Antibodies can be purified using chromatographic resins based on bacterial proteins A and G. However, these resins use acidic elution conditions, which may cause antibody denaturation. Therefore, improved methods of IgG purification are a need of the biotechnology industries. Trim21 is an intracellular protein that mediates intracellular antibody-mediated proteolysis and binds the Fc domain of IgGs and IgAs. The presence of increasing ionic strength weakens IgG binding. Therefore, Trim21 might be a good candidate for the development of chromatographic resins for IgG purification since elution conditions can occur at neutral pH conditions in the presence of salt.

Therefore, numerous peptide scaffolds have been reported to date and, in some cases, correlated with a given biological activity. Here, we describe an unusual N-capping asparagine-lysine-proline (NKP) motif that confers a hybrid flexible/stable multifunctional scaffold to a computationally designed peptide (PaDBS1R7). PaDBS1R7 has a shorter α-helix segment than two other computationally designed peptides of similar sequence but with key residue substitutions. Nevertheless, although the NKP motif acts as an α-helix breaker in PaDBS1R7, the N-terminus asparagine presents exclusive N-capping effects, resulting in a highly amphipathic and stable α-helix from Pro7-Ile17. The solution nuclear magnetic resonance structures, along with temperature coefficient spectra and computational peptide mutants reinforced the role of the NKP motif for a coil/N-cap/α-helix scaffold. Biological studies revealed that all PaDBS1 peptides presented antibacterial activities, without interfering with bacterial surfaces at their minimal inhibitory concentration. However, only PaDBS1R7 displayed anticancer properties, completely eradicated Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms, decreased bacterial counts from 100-1,000 times in an abscess mouse model and reduced LPS-induced macrophages stress, without modulating the expression of TNF-α and IL-1β. This multifunctionality was also investigated in terms of peptide/mimetic vesicle interactions, revealing that in all conditions tested PaDBS1R7 preserved its lower α-helical content, but with higher ability to disrupt bacterial-like and cancer cells-like vesicles. Based on these results, we are confident that this study extends our understanding of an N-capping NKP motif to developing structurally hybrid peptide drug candidates with multiple biological activities.</p><p id="Par1801"><bold>Keywords:</bold> N-capping, peptide scaffold, multifunctionality</p><p id="Par1802"><bold>Supported by:</bold> FAP-DF, CNPq, FUNDECT and CAPES</p><p><bold>08807 - Poster Session</bold></p><p id="Par1804"><bold>CD.13 - Production of metallic nanoparticles-polymeric hydrogels hybrid systems for tooth whitening applications</bold></p><p id="Par1805"><bold>Vinicius Ikezu Saito</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup></p><p id="Par1806"><sup>1</sup>CCNH - Human and Natural Sciences Center, Federal University of ABC (SP, Brazil), <sup>2</sup>Fundamental Chemistry, Universitty of São Paulo (SP, Brazil), <sup>3</sup>Biotechnology, University of Sorocaba (SP, Brazil)</p><p id="Par1807">INTRODUCTION</p><p id="Par1808">The search for white teeth in aesthetic character by the world population pushed scientists to search for new technologies targeting at better whitening-process performances, allied to minimizing possible side effects such as teeth sensitivity and enamel wear.

However, there is still a lot to be analyzed regarding interaction and mechanisms of functioning of these proteins. In particular, it is known that chaperone proteins from HSP70 family can interact with plasma and mitochondrial membranes. In this sense, this research project has as character the study of the interaction of chaperone proteins (HSPA9 and BIP) with biomembranes, investigating how this interaction occurs, which domains interact, in addition to verifying how the protein is internalized in the membrane. To do this, it will be performed a structural characterization study of liposomes before and after the interaction with chaperone proteins.

Knowing the current state of the drugs that use LNPs in the market by reviewing specialized literature provides valuable information for future developments. Objectives: Analyze scientific articles in the area of administration of drugs made with lipid nanoparticles to offer an overview of the forms of application in the human body and the therapeutic objective for which it is currently being used, showing the versatility of technology as a releasing agent of drugs. Materials and methods: Scientific articles from the Scopus and CAS Content Collection databases were investigated and filtered between the years 2000 to 2021.Results: LNPs supplies DNA, RNA, proteins and other agents for pharmacological are used in the treatment of various health problems. The ability of the LNPs to deliver various therapeutic agents is the key to the localized and spatialized delivery of drugs that remain protected and stabilized within the limits of the LNPs to release their contents at a desired time. The versatility of LNPs in their design and assembly has provided simple liposomes that have evolved into next-generation LNPs, such as solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, cubosomes, and cationic lipid-nucleic acid complexes. Databases such as Scopus an CAS Content Collection show the growing interest in publications as evidence that different branches of science seek a better understanding of new generations of LNPs to be applied. Currently about 29 LNPs drugs are registered as approved in the world market. These drugs are distributed in 45% dedicated to cancer treatments, 2.1% in delivery of amino acids for vaccines, 1.3% to antifungal treatment, 1% in analgesics and later they are distributed in hormonal therapies, immunosuppressants and respiratory therapies, etc. Recent FDA approvals for cancer therapies and the well-known Covid-19 vaccine are a product of the versatility of encapsulation and open the opportunity to better understand the importance of technology, exhibiting more complex architectures and stabilities. LNPs have shown versatility in the application routes, where the parental path stands out with 43 %, oral 20 %, topical/transdermal 17 %, nasal 5 %, rectal 4 %, ocular 3 %, pulmonary 3 %, vaginal 2 % and 3 % other routes. In the cosmetic area, applications of LNPs are reported in applications of: sunscreen 22%, antiaging &amp; antiwrinkle 17%, skin moisturizer 12%, shampoos 11%, etc. Finally, the prospects for finding better and more efficient LNPs preparation/application systems are growing the more these modern drug delivery systems are studied. Conclusions: It highlights that the applications of drugs that use lipid nanoparticle technology are applied parentally and are directed in genetic treatments against cancer. Vaccine, hormonal and cosmetic applications are also mentioned which shows the potential of the technique.

Here, an optimized protocol for the myristoylation in E. coli of the membrane-anchoring domain of GRASP55 is presented.</p><p id="Par2458">OBJECTIVES</p><p id="Par2459">Optimization of a myristoylation protocol in GRASP55 in E. coli and analysis of its biophysical properties and interaction with model membranes.</p><p id="Par2460">MATERIALS AND METHODS</p><p id="Par2461">Protein expression and purification in E.coli, size exclusion chromatography (SEC), liposome electrophoretic mobility assay (LEMSA), near and far-UV CD, fluorescence, MD simulations.</p><p id="Par2462">DISCUSSION AND RESULTS</p><p id="Par2463">The biophysical properties of the myristoylated/non-myristoylated GRASP55 GRASP domain were characterized in a membrane-mimicking micellar environment.

In bacteria, two main mechanisms of transcription termination have been described, Rho-independent and Rho-dependent termination. In Rho-dependent termination, Rho binds to the rho utilizing (rut) sites on the nascent RNA and translocates in the 5' to 3' direction using the ATP hydrolysis energy eventually dislodging the RNA-polymerase from elongation complex [1]. The Psu and YaeO are two established inhibitors of Rho-dependent termination [2,3]. Crystal structure of Psu, solved by our lab, demonstrates novel fold and uniquely knotted dimer [2]. Structure of Escherichia coli YaeO (EcYaeO), solved by NMR, exhibits similarity with Hfq protein [4]. Detailed sequence and phylogenetic analysis demonstrate that V. cholerae YaeO (VcYaeO) is significantly distinct from its E. coli counterpart. VcYaeO causes significant growth defect upon in vivo expression and inhibits in vitro functions of the Rho. Structure of VcYaeO solved at 1.75 Å resolution, the first crystal structure of a YaeO protein, demonstrates a beta-sandwich fold distinct from the NMR-structure of the EcYaeO. Through various biophysical techniques like SEC, DLS and chemical crosslinking we have demonstrated that VcYaeO disrupts the oligomeric state of the VcRho. Interestingly, VcYaeO has structurally more resembles to the Hfq protein and like the latter it exhibits ssDNA/RNA binding properties whereas EcYaeO is unable to do so. Through docking studies and ssDNA/RNA binding properties we propose that VcYaeO inhibits the function of the Rho protein via disruption of the latter’s hexameric assembly and also likely by sequestering the RNA from the Rho primary binding sites.

The RSV P phosphoprotein is an essential co-factor of the viral RNA polymerase complex. Its primary function is to tether the catalytic subunit of the polymerase (L) to the ribonucleoprotein genome by specific interactions with the viral nucleoprotein (N), by binding to the L protein on the one hand and to the N protein on the other hand. More generally, the RSV P protein acts as a hub protein for the viral RNA polymerase complex by assembling its different components. For example it recruits additional factors like the RSV transcription factor M2-1 and the cellular phosphatase PP1. We used a combination of biochemical, byophysical and NMR approaches to gain structural and dynamic insight into the RSV P protein. We showed that it contains large N- and C-terminal intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), the only domain with well-defined structure being a small tetramerization domain. We analyzed the full protein and fragments. By NMR we showed that the IDRs display transiently structured regions, some with high helical propensity. The combination of intrinsic disorder and tetrameric organization allows RSV P to bind to multiple partners and endows it with adaptor protein-like properties.

These proteins are composed of two domains connected by a hydrophobic linker: a nucleotide binding domain (NBD, responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis) and a protein binding domain (PBD, which binds to client proteins), which can be in an open or closed conformation if bound to ATP or not. Human 71 kDa heat shock cognate protein (HSPA8, or hHsc70) is an essential cytosolic Hsp70 that, unlike other cytosolic Hsp70s, is not induced by heat shock and is present in other cellular functions, such as cell signalling and antigen processing. These features draw attention to this chaperone as a possible therapeutic target for pathologies such as neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. To better understand this chaperone’s structure, we’ve characterized recombinant HSPA8 by means of techniques such as circular dichroism (CD), instrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and chaperone activity assays, which allowed probing its overall biophysical and biochemical features. Our studies have shown that HSPA8 was purified with high α-helical and β-sheet content, and having at least one Trp residue buried within its hydrophobic core. Chaperone activity and kinetics assays highlighted its specificities in ATP hydrolysis rate and aggregation prevention, while ITC has shown some differences regarding its interaction with nucleotides in comparison with other human Hsp70s. SAXS has allowed low resolution envelope calculation and flexibility studies, showing that HSPA8 is a slightly elongated monomer which seems to remain mostly in a compact state. We hope these results help in a better understanding and guiding future studies on the Hsp70 chaperone family.

At variance, with GdmCl, the appearance of amyloid-like aggregation becomes more evident as TFE concentration increases. Temperature-induced denaturation profiles show that both additives diminish stability.

Conversely, when both additives are present, amyloid-like aggregation initiates immediately.</p><p id="Par2764">CONCLUSION</p><p id="Par2765">In summary, two aggregation pathways might happen: amorphous or amyloid-like. Upon heating, low TFE concentrations promote the first. If GdmCl is also present the second route takes over. The explanation must reconcile the effects of additives on both the protein and solvent structures. Briefly, TFE desolvates the protein, a process further reinforced by heat. Although GdmCl might prevent thermal aggregation by solubilizing non-native states, this same phenomenon could favor amyloid aggregation. On top of that, the electrolytic-induced segregation of TFE might contribute to the development/stabilization of TFE clusters that might reach a large enough size to act as nucleation-inducing interfaces, thus leading to the observed amyloid aggregation.</p><p id="Par2766"><bold>Keywords:</bold> aggregation, guanidinium, trifluoroethanol</p><p id="Par2767"><bold>Supported by:</bold> UBACYT, CONICET and ANPCYT</p><p><bold>08620 - Poster Session</bold></p><p id="Par2769"><bold>DA.32 - SARS-CoV-2 Orf9b-host protein-protein interaction: molecular and biophysical characterization</bold></p><p id="Par2770"><bold>Kehinde S.

However, researchers have continued to intensify studies into understanding the molecular characteristics of the viral proteins during infection, replication and host immune evasion. Orf9b an important accessory protein of the Sars-Cov-2 virus is identified to play a critical role in the viral host interaction, targeting a member of the mitochondrial translocase of outer membrane complex, Tom70. This orf9b and Tom70 assembly is implicated in disrupting the mitochondrial antiviral signaling, leading to immune evasion. Here, we described the recombinant expression, purification, and characterization of orf9b using molecular and biophysical techniques. We expressed Orf9b singly and co-expressed the two proteins (Tom70-Orf9b) in an E. coli expression system, followed by purification by affinity and size exclusion chromatography. Structural characterization and protein-protein interaction studies was further accessed. The 97 amino acid protein purified as a homodimer with an approximate molecular weight of 22 kDa as determined by SEC-MALS. Folding and conformational studies using circular dichroism showed that the protein exhibit a random conformation and stable upon 90C. This conformation is believed to be altered when forming a complex with Tom70. Therefore, a series of pull down experiments are underway to characterize the Tom70-Orf9b complex.

Ankyrin repeat-containing proteins have an elongated non-globular shape and a complex folding mechanism that has not been fully elucidated. In this work, we investigated the energy landscape of proteins consisting of 3, 4, and 6 ANK repeats using the Energy Landscape Visualization Method (ELViM).1 For that, we have used biased and unbiased coarse-grained AWSEM simulations to sample conformations along the folding pathway. Combining the ELViM structure-based phase space with energy information from simulations, it is possible to reconstruct a 3-dimensional energy surface, which is funneled towards the native structure. On this surface, it is possible to indicate the existence of on-pathway and off-pathway intermediate states, suggesting the most favorable folding routes. Our results show that folding of all proteins initiates forming internal repeats, whereas a terminal repeat undergoes an unfolding/refolding process along the pathway. Overall, the results are consistent with a cooperative folding, and its pathway may be inferred from the concise ELViM representation.v[1] A.B. Oliveira Jr. et al, J. Chem.

However, this kind of interactions in the context of viral envelopes have remained relatively unexplored, partially because the intrinsically small dimensions of the molecular systems escape to the current resolution of experimental techniques. However, coarse-grained and multiscale simulations may fill that niche, providing nearly atomistic resolution at an affordable computational price. Here we used multiscale simulations to characterize the lipid-protein interactions in the envelope of the Zika Virus, a prominent member of the Flavivirus genus. Comparisons between the viral envelope and simpler molecular systems, indicate that the viral membrane is under extreme pressures and asymmetric forces. Furthermore, the dense net of protein-protein contacts established by the envelope proteins creates poorly solvated regions that destabilize the external leaflet leading to a decoupled dynamics between leaflets. These findings lead to the idea that the flaviviral membrane may store elastic energy, playing an active role in the membrane fusion process. On the other hand, we would like to show the developed an optimized pipeline for building and simulating enveloped virus-like particles (VLP). Detailed structural analysis of the protein envelope also shows very good agreement in root-mean-square deviations and B-factors with the experimental data. The level of details attained shows for the first time a possible role for anionic phospholipids in stabilizing the envelope. Combining an efficient and reliable setup procedure with an accurate coarse-grained force field provides a valuable pipeline for simulating arbitrary viral systems or subcellular compartments, paving the way toward whole-cell simulations.</p><p id="Par2787"><bold>Keywords:</bold> Zika Virus VLP Flavivirus, SIRAH force field, Coarse-grained mol dynamics simulation</p><p><bold>08196 - Poster Session</bold></p><p id="Par2789"><bold>DA.35 - Effect of C-terminal and N-terminal dimerization and alanine scan on antibacterial activity of the analogs of the peptide p-BthTX-I</bold></p><p id="Par2790"><bold>Norival Alves Santos Filho</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup>, Gabriela Marinho Righetto<sup>3</sup>, Julia Pinto Piccoli<sup>1</sup>, Larissa Mathias Teizen Almeida<sup>1</sup>, Thainá Cristina Leal<sup>1</sup>, Ilana Lopes Baratella da Cunha Camargo<sup>3</sup>, Eduardo Maffud Cilli<sup>1</sup></p><p id="Par2791"><sup>1</sup>Departamento de Bioquímica e Tecnologia Química, UNESP - Instituto de Química (Sao Paulo, Brasil), <sup>2</sup>Física e Ciência Interdisciplinar, Instituto de Física de São Carlos, USP (São Paulo, Brasil)</p><p id="Par2792">INTRODUCTION</p><p id="Par2793">The study of relationship between peptide structure and antimicrobial activity has been mandatory on the search for novel antimicrobial agents.

However, the identity of aSyn toxic species remains elusive. In this way, several post-translational modifications (PTMs) that derived from oxidative stress could be possible modulators of the physiopathology of aSyn in neurons. In this work we investigated the susceptibility of aSyn to be modified when this protein adopts different conformations, allowing us to identify potential pathological modifications. Materials and Methods: Recombinantly expressed aSyn was modified employing optimized photochemical methods that uses Rutheniun (II) Tris(bipyridine) as photosensitizer to produce either Tyrosine (Tyr) crosslinking or, in the presence of NaNO2, nitration. The reactions were characterized and quantified by Fluorescence emission, UV-Vis absorption and Mass Spectrometry. Results and Conclusions: Three conditions were analyzed: disordered aSyn free in solution, bound to membranes (helix-rich structure) and fibril conformation (cross β-sheets). Tyrosine crosslinking of disordered aSyn mainly involved Tyr39 and C-term residues Tyr133 or Tyr136. On the other hand, Tyrosine nitration were identified in all Tyr residues, being Tyr125 the most nitrated during photo-reaction. When bound to negatively charged SUVs, modification of Tyr39 is highly restricted. Similar outcome was found in the fibrillary form. Nitration of C-term residues is only reduced when aSyn interacts with membranes with a negative net charged, not in the unstructured C-term in fibrils. In conclusion, particular modifications, such Tyr39 nitration or Tyr39-Tyr133/136 crosslinking, could only emerge in pathological conditions and their identification in complex biological samples could be employed for the development of innovative tools for the early diagnosis of Synucleopathies.</p><p id="Par2962"><bold>Keywords:</bold> alpha-Synclein, Oxidative Stress, Post-translational Modifications</p><p id="Par2963"><bold>Supported by:</bold> CONICET (Argentina), ANPCyT (Argentina), UNLP (Argentina), Bunge &amp; Born, Max Planck Society and Williams Foundations (Argentina-Germany), DFG (Germany)</p><p><bold>08192 - Poster Session</bold></p><p id="Par2965"><bold>DA.47 - Identification and prediction of HbAg d-chain sequence.</bold></p><p id="Par2966"><bold>Isis Sebastião</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup>, Emerson de Souza Santos<sup>3</sup>, Leandro de Mattos Pereira<sup>4</sup>, Patrícia Gleydes Morgante<sup>1</sup>, Patrícia Soares Santiago<sup>1,2</sup></p><p id="Par2967"><sup>1</sup>Campus de Registro, UNESP, Campus de Registro (São Paulo, Brasil), <sup>2</sup>IQ, Instituto de Química, UNESP - Araraquara (São Paulo, Brasil), <sup>3</sup>Análises Clínicas, Toxicológicas e Bromatológicas, Faculdade de Ciências Farmacêuticas da USP de Ribeirão Preto (São Paulo, Brasil), <sup>4</sup>Laboratório de Ecologia Microbiana e Molecular, Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Góez, UFRJ (Rio de Janeiro, Brasil)</p><p id="Par2968">INTRODUCTION</p><p id="Par2969">The giant hemoglobins from annelids have particular biotechnological characteristics.

Wheat bran was the residue where the fungus showed the highest enzymatic production. The ethanolic fractionation fractionated the enzymatic extract into 5 fractions, the 80-100% fraction concentrated greater activity and was subjected to ion exchange chromatography (DEAE-Sepharose) in AKTA pure M1GE, the isolated enzyme was obtained in a single fraction, observed through of the SDS-PAGE. The biochemical characterization of the enzyme determined the optimum temperature of 50°C and thermal stability between 30 and 60°C with up to 50% of the enzymatic activity. The optimum pH was 5.0, with stability at pH between pH 4.0 and 8.0.

Mutations in the central domain of the protein are present in approximately 50% of human cancers, causing loss of function of p53 functions, promoting rapid cell proliferation, associated with the formation of intracellular protein aggregates. The mechanism of propagation of these structural alterations still needs to be elucidated, and interaction with cofactors may influence this process.

The fibrillation pathway of α-Syn encompasses a multitude of transient oligomeric forms differing in size, structure, toxicity and prion-like seeding activity. According to a recent solid state NMR study, the core residues within a fibril of α-Syn are arranged into in-register parallel β sheets with a unique C-terminal Greek key topology (PDB 2N0A). Here, we report the formation of stable, non-toxic (to both liposomal membranes and neuroblastoma cells) ‘mace’-shaped oligomers, when the physiologically-available small molecule heme (hemin chloride) is added at sub-stoichiometric ratios, to either monomeric or aggregated α-Syn. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we found that a tetrameric form of the Greek key model could be fit into the density of these mace oligomers, albeit with a distortion in the head-neck junction of the mace structure. The ‘Greek key oligomer’ fits well as a segment of the previously-described annular oligomers and appears to be its structural predecessor in the hierarchical pathway of fibril formation. We propose that the distortion in the heme-treated oligomer prevents further appending of the twisted units into annular oligomers. Furthermore, heme binds to a crucial histidine (His50) residue located in the inter-protofilament pre-non amyloid β component interface, thus interfering with a salt bridge formation with a Glu57 residue located in the opposite protofilament, thereby weakening the inter-protofilament steric zipper integrity. Overall, we describe a mechanism of inhibition of fibrillation and associated of α-Syn using a physiologically-available small molecule.</p><p id="Par3225"><bold>Keywords:</bold> oligomer, neurodegeneration, Greek key fibril</p><p><bold>08353 - Poster Session</bold></p><p id="Par3227"><bold>DA.65 - Isolation and characterization of Canavalia ensiformis serine proteases: enzymes with pharmacological potential</bold></p><p id="Par3228"><bold>Thayane Aparecida Alves de Araujo</bold><sup><bold>1,2</bold></sup>, Raquel Elisa da Silva-López<sup>1</sup>, Flávia Almada do Carmo<sup>2</sup></p><p id="Par3229"><sup>1</sup>Departamento de Produtos Naturais, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), <sup>2</sup>Faculdade de Farmácia, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)</p><p id="Par3230">INTRODUCTION</p><p id="Par3231"><italic>Canavalia ensiformis</italic> is a tropical legume with high content of active proteins, that have important biological functions, and their pharmacological activities have been extensively investigated.

One of the promising uses is related to autoimmune diseases, which in many cases are correlated to either central or peripheral tolerance processes. The peripheral process is mediated by the transform growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1), which is secreted by T-regulator cells, and plays anti-inflammatory function in autoimmune diseases. In this context, the structural characterization of peptide fragments derived from TGF-β1 may assist the elucidation of mechanisms implied in the action and open possibilities for developing biomimetic nanomaterials based on this growth factor [1]. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to provide detailed characterization on both self-assembly and structure of a heptamer with amino acid sequence Ac-ESPLKRQ, derived from TGF- β1, and correlate structure and anti-inflammatory action. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The peptide has been synthesized through standard solid-phase approaches. Characterization has been performed through a range of biophysical techniques including fluorescence, circular dichroism and infrared spectroscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering, and electron and atomic force microscopy. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS: Fluorescence assays have shown the formation of stable aggregates above a critical concentration ~ 3 mg/mL, with secondary structure dominated by disordered conformations; however, at higher concentrations, these supramolecular assemblies present signature of α-helix conformations, the same secondary structure exhibited by the active in the native TGF-β1 protein, which may be the conformation responsible for docking to cell receptors. The aggregates present nanometer lengths, composed by subunits with globular shape and sizes ~60 nm, which may assist interaction with cell membranes. CONCLUSION: The peptide sequence mimetizing TGF-β1 investigated here is able to form nanoscopic aggregates with secondary structure that reproduces conformations of active sites found in the native protein. These characteristics make this fragment a promising candidate to produce bioactive nanoparticles able to exert similar anti-inflammatory responses to those observed for TGF-β1.</p><p id="Par3370"><bold>Keywords:</bold> peptide self-assembly, TGF-beta1, biomaterials</p><p id="Par3371"><bold>Supported by:</bold> CAPES, CNPq, FAPESP</p><p><bold>08346 - Poster Session</bold></p><p id="Par3373"><bold>DB.02 - Structural and functional characterization of the N-terminal domain of the human coronavirus hCoV-HKU1 nucleocapsid protein</bold></p><p id="Par3374"><bold>Aline de Luna Marques</bold><sup><bold>1,2</bold></sup>, Ícaro Putinhon Caruso<sup>3,2</sup>, Peter Reis Bezerra<sup>2</sup>, Fábio Ceneviva Lacerda de Almeida<sup>2</sup>, Gisele Cardoso de Amorim<sup>1,2</sup></p><p id="Par3375"><sup>1</sup>Multidisciplinary Center for Research in Biology (Numpex-Bio), Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Campus Duque de Caxias (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), <sup>2</sup>National Center for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (CNRMN), Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), <sup>3</sup>Multiuser Center for Biomolecular Innovation (CMIB), São Paulo State University (São Paulo, Brazil)</p><p id="Par3376">INTRODUCTION</p><p id="Par3377">Since 2002, three beta coronaviruses (bCoVs) have gained notoriety: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, which is causing the Covid-19 pandemic. Besides these more aggressive CoVs, there are endemic human viruses, such as hCoV-HKU1, associated with mild respiratory tract disease, that can progress to acute respiratory failure. During infection, the transcription of the viral genome generates full-length and subgenomic RNAs, through a discontinuous process regulated by the transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRSs). The nucleocapsid (N) protein of CoVs acts as an RNA chaperone and its N-terminal domain (N-NTD) binds to TRS, forming a high-affinity complex.

Despite its existence from antiquity, efforts to eradicate and control the disease have failed and unfortunately current treatment now displays drug resistance and reduced efficacy. Schistosomes have over time developed mechanisms to cope with the myriad of stresses they encounter throughout their developmental cycle through the up-regulation of Universal Stress Proteins (Usp). The G4LZI3 USP has since been identified as a potential ‘lead’ molecule in schistosomal treatment hence, the aim of this study was to determine the 3D structure of this protein and its biological function. The G4LZI3 protein was over-expressed in M15 cells and purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and gel filtration. Characterization of the protein was done by Differential Scanning Calorimetry, Fluorescence Spectroscopy, Fourier-transform Infrared Spectroscopy, Mass Spectrometry and 1D Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. These showed the protein was folded, consisted of various secondary structure elements and is thermodynamically-stable. Pooled purified fractions were concentrated to yield samples for crystallization trials. Various conditions yielded small crystals that were seeded and thereafter used to generate considerably-sized 3-dimensionally-shaped crystals. Diffraction data was remotely collected at Diamond Light Source (United Kingdom) and processed at the University of Cape Town using MR Rosetta Software tools. Coot was thereafter used for model building and refinement of the structure. Lastly, bioinformatics tools were used to identify small molecule inhibitors which were docked onto the protein. Those with the best scores were used to determine parameters such as molecular dynamic simulations, post dynamic analysis and binding free energy calculations.

Since saliva is collectible by non-invasive procedures, a growing number of studies have identified specific salivary biomarkers associated with pathological and physiological alterations, promoting the development of non-invasive tools for diagnostics. (1,2) We collected three different types of saliva (whole; parotid and submandibular – sublingual), from 20 healthy volunteers and mapped every gland-specific metabolic composition. Saliva metabolites profiles have been obtained by 1H-NMR spectroscopy, adding a freeze-drying step in sample preparation. Metabolites quantification was performed using Chenomx and MestReNova software. Statistical analysis revealed a distinct profile for the whole saliva and an overlap for the parotid and the submandibular/sublingual saliva. We identified metabolites originated both from endogenous metabolism and from oral bacterial flora, whose concentration was higher in the whole saliva. By correlating the profile of the whole saliva metabolome with the periodontal health status scores, we identified a panel of 5 metabolites that can distinguish the initial phase of bleeding disease in the healthy population. The identified metabolites are related to oral bacterial metabolism, which could potentially induce a significant host response, including oral inflammation and gingival bleeding.

PpIX is highly fluorescent, however it photobleaches rapidly under production of singlet oxygen <sup>a</sup> which makes PpIX an efficient FS used in photochemotherapy. The affinity of PpIX for diseased tissues can be improved by the use of carriers <sup>b</sup> . OBJECTIVES: To study the interaction between PpIX and Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) to be used as a carrier justified by its similarity with Human Serum Albumin (HSA) that has affinity to cancer cells <sup>b</sup> . METHODOLOGY: Optical absorption and fluorescence emission spectroscopy, particle size and zeta potential were performed to characterize PpIX and its complexes with BSA. Langmuir monolayers containing Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) were used as a model to study the interaction between both PpIX and PpIX-BSA complex with biological membranes. All experiments were carried out in acidic (4.5) and physiological (7.3) pH buffer solutions. RESULTS: Changes in the profile of the optical absorption spectra and fluorescence emission show that BSA binds to PpIX. These photophysical changes do not impair PpIX photochemical efficiency. Particle size measures showed the formation PpIX-BSA complexes depending on the BSA concentration with sizes ranging from 5-1000 nm at pH 4.5 and from 3-400 nm at pH 7.3. The formation of the complex was favored at pH 4.5, close to the BSA isoelectric point. Surface pressure (π–A) curves measured through the Langmuir monolayers show that both porphyrin and its albumin complex interact with the DPPC monolayer. CONCLUSION: PpIX binds to BSA with enhanced photophysical properties. Both PpIX and PpIX-BSA interact with the cell membrane model suggesting enhanced performance of PpIX as PS. a LEE, H.-S.; LEE, J.-B.; YUN, S. J.; et al.

The granules are subdivided in 3 subtypes: azurophil, specific and gelatinase. These particles are differentiated mainly through their protein content; therefore, abundant specific proteins can be used as markers for each storage particle. The markers are myeloperoxidase (MPO) for azurophil, lipocalin-2 (NGAL) and lactoferrin for specific, gelatinase for gelatinase granules and latent alkaline phosphatase (latent AP) for secretory vesicles. Characterization of granule’s content is essential to comprehend the different functions of these cells, hence the importance of the granule’s isolation.

Here we investigated the role of a 2-Cys peroxiredoxin, alkyl-hydroperoxide reductase C1 (AhpC1), in P. aeruginosa (PA14) survival and virulence. In vitro, wild-type and ΔahpC1 PA14 were incubated with HOCl, H2O2, urate hydroperoxide, and human neutrophils before CFU counting. The rate constant for the reaction of urate hydroperoxide and AhpC was determined by stopped flow. Mice were intranasally instilled with wild-type and ΔahpC1 PA14 strains 24-hours before CFU counting in lung, liver, and spleen, and evaluating some lung inflammatory biomarkers. Mice were monitored for survival after intranasal instillation with wild-type, ΔahpC1 and ΔahpC1 complemented with ahpC1 gene in normouricemic and hyperuricemic animals. Deletion of AhpC1 led to a higher sensitivity to all oxidants. ΔahpC1 was more sensitive to the killing by neutrophils, and less virulent in a mice model of infection. All mice instilled with ΔahpC1 survived for 15 days, whereas 100% died within 3 days with wild-type and complemented strain. A significantly lower number of colonies was detected in lung and spleen of ΔahpC1-infected mice. Total leukocytes, neutrophils, myeloperoxidase activity, pro-inflammatory cytokines, nitrite and lipid peroxidation were much lower in lungs or bronchoalveolar liquid of ΔahpC1-infected mice. Purified AhpC reacted with urate hydroperoxide at 2.3±0.1×106 M−1s−1, and only the ΔahpC1 was sensitive to this oxidant. Uric acid, the urate hydroperoxide precursor, impaired the killing of wild-type by neutrophils but improved the killing of ΔahpC1. Hyperuricemic mice presented higher levels of serum cytokines and succumbed much faster to PA14 infection when compared to normouricemic mice. Collectively, ΔahpC1 PA14 presented a lower virulence due to a poorer ability to neutralize the oxidants generated by inflammatory oxidative burst, especially urate hydroperoxide, leading to a more efficient killing by the host.

In biological systems, we have increasing pieces of evidence that an organism can transmit information to its descendants via epigenetic states and cultures.

Intended for real time cells Optical Thickness (OT) assessment We designed and implemented a microfluidic chip integrating a Fabry-Perot resonator which allows to measure the OT profile of cells flowing through it with high throughput. To ensure the reliability of the measurement, cell trajectories should be constrained as much as possible on the same plane. A piezoelectric transducer was coupled to the chip, tuned to induce an acoustic standing wave in the chip, thus providing vertical alignment of floating cells. The same experimental setup has been exploited towards cellular mechanotyping. In fact, the size distribution collected with the system depends on the power applied to the acoustic trap, hence, it can be related to the deformability of the cell. Comparing the distribution of elasticity collected at very different values, is possible assess the overall mechanical properties with high statistical relevance aimed at measuring drugs effect or physiological and pathological condition response on this parameter. The analysis of the perturbation enables the assessment of the cell’s optomechanical properties. Measurement of Algae and Yeast cells’ deformability has been carried out to test the instrument’s performance and compared to the equivalent perturbation introduced by Microgel beads and Polystyrene spheres as controls. The results show a change in the optomechanical properties of the Algae, Yeast, and Microgel. Notoriously, the Polystyrene sample remains virtually unchanged, as expected since Polystyrene is much stiffer than a cell and cannot be deformed by the instrument’s pressure field. These results show that the acoustofluidic technique presented here is useful to detect and measure different optomechanical properties which, potentially, can be used as label-free biomarkers in clinical diagnosis.

Subsequently, CPHWS1 and CPLWS1 were carboxyl-reduced (CR; 1 and 4 cycles each), resulting in lower anticoagulant activities, reinforcing the role of carboxyl groups in bioactivity. The sulfated and carboxyl-reduced samples were resulfated (S2), using optimized parameters. The resulting derivatives showed better anticoagulant performances, indicating that replacement of carboxyl by sulfate groups favors anticoagulant activity. The derivatives that showed the best results were CPHWS2CR4 (aPTT at 40 μg/mL=226,2 s; DS=1,27) and CPLWS2CR1 (aPTT at 50 μg/mL=187,1 s; DS=1,30).

Herbaspirillum seropedicae SmR1, a PGPB, promoted different responses in Brazilian wheat (Triticum aestivum var. Lini) cultivars (CD104 and CD120) under in vitro and greenhouse conditions. The aim of this work was to investigate the protein profile in wheat leaves (CD104 and CD120) when inoculated with H. seropedicae to understand the plant physiology and photosynthetic system. ZADOK 2.1 wheat plants were obtained by growth in MS medium without (SN) and with (CN) nitrogen source, without sucrose. After 24h, some tubes of SN medium received bacterial inoculum (SNI). The tubes were kept in a culture room at 24 °C and 14h light /dark for 20 days. Leaves were harvested to obtain protein extract for proteomics based on protein fractionation by SDS-PAGE followed by LC-MS/MS - Q-TOF type. Intact plants were used to obtain nitrogen index (NBI) and chlorophyll (CHL), flavonoids and anthocyanins, chlorophyll fluorescence. As results, CD120 in SNI medium promoted increase in NBI and CHL, reduced anthocyanins, chlorophyll fluorescence in photochemical and non-photochemical extinction. Only one protein was uniquely found in SNI condition, being related to protection of photosystem II. CD 104 in SNI condition presented 5 photosynthesis proteins and others related to hypersensitivity and diseases resistance. Both cultivars in SN presented antioxidant proteins, although chlorophyll fluorescence was not severely affected. The plant-bacteria interaction is genotype dependent and H. seropedicae was able to partially meet the N requirement for the CD120 genotype and promote defense and tolerance responses for the CD104 genotype.</p><p id="Par5597"><bold>Keywords:</bold> Wheat, proteomic analysis, photosynthetic system</p><p id="Par5598"><bold>Supported by:</bold> FAPPR and CAPES</p><p><bold>08503 - Poster Session</bold></p><p id="Par5600"><bold>GE.03 - PROJECT - Secondary metabolites from Zea mays L. corn silk extracts</bold></p><p id="Par5601"><bold>Natan Rodrigues Santana Da Hora</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup>, Paulo Roberto Ribeiro de Jesus<sup>1</sup></p><p id="Par5602"><sup>1</sup>DEPARTAMENTO DE QUÍMICA ORGÂNICA, UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DA BAHIA (BAHIA, BRASIL)</p><p id="Par5603">INTRODUCTION</p><p id="Par5604">Corn silk is a part of the female flower of <italic>Zea mays</italic> L., which is well-known in the traditional Chinese medicine for its properties.

An ambitious challenge of building a synthetic cell via bottom-up methodologies requires a metabolic component, thus ensuring the constant availability of nicotinamide cofactors.Here, we constructed a synthetic pathway in which both the redox cofactors involved in cell catabolism and anabolism, respectively NAD+ and NADP+, are continuously reduced and oxidized. This is mediated by the catalysis of the purified enzymes formate dehydrogenase and soluble transhydrogenase. Regulation between the two oxidative states is given by the concentrations of enzymes and substrates required by the specific reactions. The action of formate dehydrogenase leads to NADH accumulation. This allows the reduction of NADP+ over time by soluble transhydrogenase, which simultaneously restores the required NAD+ for the first reaction. Consequently, the formed NADPH becomes available for further redox enzymes that could drive NADP+ regeneration. The coupled reactions are triggered by a membrane permeable redox donor, formic acid. This makes the cofactor regeneration feasible confined in vitro in phospholipid vesicle compartments, as well as in solution. We also investigated the behaviour of our coupled redox system across different compartment scales, using LUVs and GUVs. Developing such coupled redox reactions will provide the necessary energy in terms of reducing equivalents in order to increase the achievable metabolic complexity inside the synthetic cell-like systems.

The phosphorylation of adipose tissue subtype of PPARy at Ser273 has been linked to the dysregulation of a subset of specific genes that induce insulin resistance. However, the molecular mechanisms that drive this change in gene expression are unclear. In this work, we aim to investigate how this phosphorylation may disturb the interaction between PPARg and some coregulator proteins as a new mechanism that leads to insulin re-sistance. Through cellular and in vitro assays, we show that PPARg phosphor-ylation inhibition increased the activation of the receptor. Thus, this blocking increases the recruitment of PGC1-a and TIF2 coactivators, whilst decreases the interaction with SMRT and NCoR corepressors. Moreover, we investigate whether the CDK5, responsible for Ser273 phosphorylation could also disturb the PPARg-corregulator’s balance. Finding that CDK5 presence decreases the PPARg interaction with PGC1-a, TIF2, and NCoR, while increases the cou-pling of SMRT. Together these results indicate that the insulin resistance as-sociated with PPARg phosphorylation is linked to a differential coregulators recruitment, which may promote dysregulation in gene expression.</p><p id="Par5740"><bold>Keywords:</bold> PPARg, protein-protein interaction, phosphorylation</p><p id="Par5741"><bold>Supported by:</bold> This work was supported by the CAPES: 8887.373113/2019-00; FAPESP: 19/10274-7; and CNPEM</p><p><bold>08461 - Poster Session</bold></p><p id="Par5743"><bold>HA.04 - Peptides reduce cell viability of glioblastoma cells</bold></p><p id="Par5744"><bold>Mariany Lopes da Costa Folly</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup>, João Eustáquio Antunes<sup>1,1</sup>, Raquel Tognon Ribeiro<sup>1,1,1</sup>, Michelle Bueno Moura Pereira Antunes<sup>1</sup></p><p id="Par5745"><sup>1</sup>Programa Multicêntrico Bioquímica e Biologia Molecular, Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora (Minas Gerais, Brasil), <sup>2</sup>Departamento de Farmácia, Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora (Minas Gerais, Brasil)</p><p id="Par5746">INTRODUCTION</p><p id="Par5747">Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a spontaneously occurring central nervous system tumor that is highly aggressive and invasive.

On the contrary, TBOA abolished all guanosine effects, indicating a dependence on glutamate transport on the mitochondrial OXPHOS activity.</p><p id="Par6461">CONCLUSION</p><p id="Par6462">Guanosine treatment prevents mitochondrial dysfunction after OGD/R, pointing to a promising effect of improving brain mitochondria bioenergetics.

In the beginning of chemotherapy treatment, there may be the development of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) due to the large amount of intracellular content from lysis of tumor cells. For this, the treatment of TLS, carried out in parallel to the chemotherapy treatment, uses a recombinant urate oxidase enzyme.

Among them, TLR2 and TLR4/MD2 recognize lipids located in bacterial membrane and induce pro-inflammatory reactions. We found that TLR recognition is not limited to bacterial molecules. TLR4 and TLR2 are able to recognize also synthetic cationic lipids, used as nucleic acid nanocarriers, and the mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin. In silico analysis coupled with in vitro and in vivo experiments brought us to understand the molecular parameters for which a lipid would be inert, an agonist or an antagonist of TLRs: short saturated di-acyl cationic lipids lipopolyamines activate TLR2 and 4, longer(≥C18) saturated cationic lipids activate only TLR2, and ≥C18 unsaturated lipopolyamines do not induce TLR activation(Lonez et al., 2015; Pizzuto et al., 2016, 2018); moreover, saturated tetra-acyl lipids like cardiolipins(CLs), activate TLR4, whereas unsaturated CLs are TLR4 antagonists(Pizzuto et al., 2019). Molecular docking show that all CLs fit into the hydrophobic cavity of MD2, however, our analysis failed to predict the pharmacology of CLs, revealing the limitations of such an approach with this family of molecules. By contrast, docking of lipopolyamines in TLR2 suggested potential TLR2 binding modes reminiscent of natural TLR2 agonist and was able to predict their activity. According to our in silico analysis and in vitro data, lipopolyamines with both unsaturated chains do not fit into the hydrophobic pocket and do not activate TLR2.(Pizzuto et al., 2017 J Control Release). We therefore recommend the use of unsaturated C18 chains for the synthesis of inert transfection agents or TLR4 antagonists to be used as therapeutics for TLR4-related diseases such as sepsis, while we recommend saturated lipopolyamines in vaccine formulation as their immunostimulatory activity coupled to their carrier properties conferred good adjuvant properties in vivo(Pizzuto et al., 2018 J Control Release). The ability of saturated CL to activate TLR4 may boost the development of vaccine adjuvants, the understanding of the immune response to bacteria rich in saturated CLs as well as of the chronic inflammation in disease characterized by the presence of saturated CLs.

As a consequence, an impairment in even one of the sub-constituents at the micrometre level can lead to loss of function of the entire organ, causing the eruption of severe orthopaedic diseases. Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease characterized by the progressive erosion of articular cartilage, which covers the surfaces of the long bones in the joints. It is caused by the establishment of inflammatory processes that affects all the joint constituents and subchondral bone, causing in the patient acute pain. Brillouin and Raman micro-spectroscopy is a correlative technique contact-less and not destructive, that allows the simultaneous investigation of both the mechanical and the chemical properties of samples, thanks to endogenous mechanisms, namely the propagation of thermally activated acoustic waves and the macromolecular vibrations. In recent years, this technique has approached applications in the biomedical field, successfully analysing the properties of single cells, complex biomaterials, and tissues affected by oncological and neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we present the results of mapping and imaging performed on both the cortical and trabecular tissue obtained from resections of a human femoral head and diaphysis. The results of the analysis of tissues in healthy conditions will be used to demonstrate the ability of the technique to recognize the major manifestations of osteoarthritic pathology on the cartilage surface and subchondral bone. This proof-of-concept not only constitutes a first step towards the application of the technique in the diagnosis of osteoarthritis but provides an approach that can be extended to other important issues in biomedical research on bone, such as bone infections and cancer.</p><p id="Par6758"><bold>Keywords:</bold> Brillouin spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, bone disease</p><p><bold>08702 - Poster Session</bold></p><p id="Par6760"><bold>KA.01 - Conservation and evolution of splice sites</bold></p><p id="Par6761"><bold>Renan dos Reis</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup>, Ricardo De Marco<sup>1</sup></p><p id="Par6762"><sup>1</sup>Departamento de Física e Ciência Interdisciplinar, Instituto de Física de São Carlos, Universidade de São Paulo (São Paulo, Brazil)</p><p id="Par6763">INTRODUCTION</p><p id="Par6764">Introns are sequences that interrupt coding regions of eukaryotic genes. They are removed from the pre-mRNA in a process termed splicing, by the action of the spliceosome. For the correct splicing of introns, the spliceosome must recognize two sites present on the intron’s boundaries: the 5' (5'ss) and 3' (3'ss) splice sites. However, those recognitions are not simple tasks for the spliceosome, which must differentiate pseudo sites from the real ones, that are degenerated. Much of what is known about these sites was gathered from analysis of introns in plants, fungi, and animals. However, there are still open questions about their evolution and fundamental features, which require studies of broader phylogenetic branches of eukaryotes.</p><p id="Par6765">OBJECTIVES</p><p id="Par6766">In this work, the 5′ss and 3′ss sites of the introns of 29 species of metazoan, fungal, and protozoan clades were studied via the analysis of information content of biological signals and frequency of consensus motifs.</p><p id="Par6767">MATERIALS AND METHODS</p><p id="Par6768">DISCUSSION AND RESULTS</p><p id="Par6769">The results show a strong linear negative correlation between the information content of the 5'ss site and the percentage of pre-mRNAs with introns in the genome.

They are involved in a wide variety of catalytic functions such as natural photosynthesis and cellular respiration. From structural and electronic points of view, FeS clusters sit between transition metal atoms and solids. Their electronic structures show many low-lying and near-degenerate states that may cross, leading to multiple-state reactivity. In polynuclear FeS clusters, strong electron correlation and long-range spin coupling effects complicate enormously the theoretical description. Here we describe the reactivity of FeS clusters including environmental effects with quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) potentials [1] to model Fe-S bare dissociation and substitution reactions in aqueous solution and in protein environments. We show that sextet and quartet spin states cross during bare dissociation in a protein desolvated microenvironment with an homolytic Fe-S bond cleavage mechanism[3]. For water substitution at neutral and acid media, however, no spin-crossings are observed and bond cleavage is heterolytic due to stabilization of the sextet ground state by solvation effects and leaving-group protonation[2,4]. These results help to understand the catalytic mechanisms, stability and biogenesis of iron-sulfur proteins. [1] Ferric-thiolate bond dissociation studied with electronic structure calculations.

Importin-α (Impα) contains the NLS recognition site and, importin-β (Impβ) mediates transport through the nuclear membrane pore. Several proteins related to DNA repair are transported to the cell nucleus by the classical NLS-import pathway and among them, there is a heterodimer formed by the proteins MLH1 and PMS2.

These interactions are known to mediate molecular recognition phenomena in biology, namely protein-ligand complexes or nucleic acids, and hence have found increasing application in drug discovery [2]. In this context, the ability to establish molecular interactions such as hydrogen bonds is a known factor determining the permeability of druglike molecules across biological membranes and may ultimately modulate their pharmacological properties. In contrast, the role of other interactions such as XBs has been largely overlooked, despite halogenated compounds being prevalent in drug discovery and development. Therefore, the eventual role of halogen bonding targeting phospholipid oxygen acceptors merits further investigation. In this work, we used molecular dynamics simulations, explicitly accounting for the σ–hole in halogenated ligands [3], to probe the existence of halogen-phospholipid interactions in a bilayer environment. The results [4] provide direct evidence for the formation of favorable XB interactions, as well as insights into the role of halogen bonding in the partitioning of halogenated molecules across biomembranes.

In recent years, complex models have emerged with the development of atomistic models for the OM and the cell wall components, which is allowing us to access novel conformational dynamics that were previously unreachable. In this regard, studies involving an accurate depiction of the bacterial envelope, as well as describing antibiotic mechanisms of action at the molecular level, can provide invaluable insights for experimental efforts to tackle the current antibiotic resistance crisis.Here, we present our work on large scale atomistic-level molecular dynamics simulations of the E. coli cell envelope, with a particular focus on the development of complex cell envelope models and the path taken by polymyxin B1 (PMB1) through various models of the periplasm, aiming to understand how it negotiates the periplasmic space to arrive at the inner membrane. Systems sizes oscillate between 600,000 to 700,000 atoms, due to the presence of OM and cell wall, plus 6 to 9 proteins, water, ions, and antibiotic molecules. Our simulations reveal that PMB1 forms transient interactions with proteins that are free in solution as well as lipoproteins anchored to the outer membrane. Furthermore, the lipid moiety of PMB1 enter the hydrophobic cavities of some lipoprotein carriers. Data obtained also shows that PMB1 binds strongly to the cell wall, diffusing on its surface and altering local morphology, while also allowing us to evaluate possible cell wall crossing mechanisms. Together the results show that PMB1 has a winding, obstacle-ridden path to the inner membrane. It is likely that this observation is true for other antibiotics that rely on diffusion rather than transporters.</p><p id="Par7155"><bold>Keywords:</bold> molecular dynamics, cell envelope, antibiotics</p><p><bold>08208 - Poster Session</bold></p><p id="Par7157"><bold>KA.28 - In Silico Analysis of the A4V and D90A Variants of Human SOD1 related to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</bold></p><p id="Par7158"><bold>Gabriel Rodrigues Coutinho Pereira</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup>, Joelma Freire De Mesquita<sup>1</sup></p><p id="Par7159"><sup>1</sup>Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Group, Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)</p><p id="Par7160">INTRODUCTION</p><p id="Par7161">Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most frequent motor neurodegenerative disorder in adults.

The frequency of dysarthria was significantly higher in the CBS-A– group than in the CBS-A+ group (55.6 vs. 7.7%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.008). They showed brain atrophy mainly at the putamen and opercular frontal gyrus. Relative to the phonemic verbal fluency, we found a positive correlation at the left frontal opercular gyrus (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0003, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.3685), the inferior (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0004, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.3537), and the middle temporal gyri (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0001, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.3993). There was a positive correlation between [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG uptake and semantic verbal fluency at the left inferior (<italic>p</italic> = 0.006, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.2326), middle (0.0054, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.2376), and superior temporal gyri (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0066, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.2276). Metabolic and structural signatures depicted from this feature provide further insights into the motor speech production network and are also helpful to differentiate CBS variants. In the spectrum of language impairment profile, dysarthria might be helpful to distinguish CBS patients not related to AD.</p><p id="Par7461">Keywords: Corticobasal syndrome, amyloid-PET, fluorodeoxyglucose</p><p id="Par7462">Funding: FAPESP</p><p id="Par7463"><bold>Keywords:</bold> Corticobasal syndrome, amyloid-PET, fluorodeoxyglucose</p><p id="Par7464"><bold>Supported by:</bold> FAPESP</p><p><bold>08534 - Poster Session</bold></p><p id="Par7466"><bold>SE.01 - Didactic games in Biochemistry: alternative approaches to content absorption</bold></p><p id="Par7467"><bold>Daniel de Carvalho Santos</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup>, Giselle Zenker Justo<sup>2</sup>, Karin Argenti Simon<sup>2</sup>, Nidia Alice Pinheiro<sup>2</sup></p><p id="Par7468"><sup>1</sup>Química, Universidade de São Paulo (, Brasil), <sup>2</sup>Ciências Farmacêuticas, Universidade Federal de São Paulo (, Brasil)</p><p id="Par7469">INTRODUCTION</p><p id="Par7470">Biochemistry is considered by many students as a subject with a high degree of difficulty in view of the massive amount of content, which stimulates the development of new teaching methodologies, generating new approaches to the learning process.
