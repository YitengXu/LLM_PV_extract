In this way, rates are exceptionally high, and loss of intermediates minimised. Similarly, extended enzyme cascades trapped and crowded within the nanoconfined environment of a porous conducting metal oxide electrode material form the basis of a powerful way to study and exploit myriad complex biocatalytic reactions and pathways. One of the confined enzymes, ferredoxin-NADP<sup>+</sup> reductase, serves as a transducer, rapidly and reversibly recycling nicotinamide cofactors electrochemically for immediate delivery to the next enzyme along the chain, thereby making it possible to energize, control and observe extended cascade reactions driven in either direction depending on the electrode potential that is applied. Here we show as proof of concept the synthesis of aspartic acid from pyruvic acid or its reverse oxidative decarboxylation/deamination, involving five nanoconfined enzymes.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Multistep enzymatic reactions (cascades) can be achieved by confining enzymes in synthetic materials, but ways to simultaneously energize, control and observe the reactions in real time are lacking.

In such a way, the local concentration of each enzyme is massively increased, and in what is often termed substrate channeling, intermediates can be prevented from escaping and the distances they must travel between catalyst partners are minimized. Nanoconfining a package of enzymes in synthetic materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> brings these advantages to new technologies where cascade reactions are already attractive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>: furthermore, approaches such as directed evolution are producing individual enzymes for completely new functions to increase chemical complexity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.

What is currently lacking (and would be invaluable) is a way of simultaneously energizing, controlling, and observing nanoconfined cascades in real-time, and we now describe how this can be achieved in a way that can greatly facilitate systems enzymology.

The cyclic voltammograms—revealing how the steady-state catalytic velocity of the cascade varies with driving force—were obtained for a mixture of pyruvate, KHCO<sub>3</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, NADP<sup>+</sup>, in the absence and presence of aspartate. They were measured after loading all the enzymes into a nanoporous layer of indium tin oxide (ITO) formed by depositing commercial nanoparticles electrophoretically onto a titanium foil support (area 1.89 cm<sup>2</sup>). The ITO layer, varying between 1 and 3 µm deep depending on the deposition time (2–10 min), comprises pores and cavities of less than 100 nm in diameter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. This procedure provides a fast, natural way of creating random nanospace (i.e., of ≪1 μm porosity) that can be energized electrochemically via the trapped FNR (E1), which serves as the transducer (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The catalytic activity of a two-enzyme cascade was already established to depend upon the ability of each enzyme to enter and bind in these spaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. The package was loaded as a 20 µL premixed solution having a ratio 0.1/1/5/1/1 (CA/FNR/ME/FumC/AspA), where we define 1 enzyme equivalent as 2 nmol. The solution was allowed to soak in for 20 min at room temperature after which the electrode was rinsed thoroughly with ultrapure water before placing it in the electrochemical cell (4 mL). A quantity of ~17 nmol total enzyme cm<sup>−2</sup> was applied to the electrode, although only the uptake of FNR could be quantified: in this experiment, integration of its sharp, two-electron FAD redox signals (Supplementary Fig. S<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>) gave a value of 64.5 pmol cm<sup>−2</sup>, equating to a concentration of 0.65 mM FNR for a 1 µm layer, ignoring the volume taken up by the material<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. The concentration established for FNR alone implies that, collectively, the nanoconfined enzymes can have a total concentration greatly exceeding millimolar and will thus be crowded together.</p><p id="Par6">The gray trace shows the results before introducing NADP<sup>+</sup> and aspartate into the surrounding solution (4 mL) of the electrochemical cell. The pH of 7.5 was chosen as a compromise with respect to reported pH optima for all the enzymes involved. Injection of NADP<sup>+</sup> (to a final concentration of 20 µM) produced a large reduction current, then the addition of aspartate led to a bidirectional catalytic voltammogram. The sharp crossover point (at which there is zero net current) ideally equates to the reduction potential of the overall reaction for the entire cascade (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) and demonstrates the possibility for measuring, directly, the thermodynamics of elaborate and even de novo metabolic pathways, although this ideal situation depends on minimizing the escape of intermediates (see below). Similar results were obtained for an unbuffered solution (Supplementary Fig. S<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>) and for a four-enzyme cascade (with no CA) in the presence of 100% CO<sub>2</sub> (Supplementary Fig. S<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>), although high CO<sub>2</sub> levels are inhibitory in the oxidation direction. High CO<sub>2</sub> levels also lower the cell pH unless heavily buffered: its localized production by CA in the nanopores avoids this problem.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Upstream/downstream catalysis: hydrodynamic and potential control</title><p id="Par7">The cascade can be driven in either direction simply by changing the electrode potential, which can be controlled by a simple command on a laptop computer (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>: outputs). The terms Upstream and Downstream are introduced to describe where the cascade activity lies relative to the electron transfer that is occurring and being reported at the transducer FNR (E1): more widely, this notation is independent of whether an oxidation or reduction reaction is being driven. The E1–E2 pair converts the chemical flow rate through the cascade into electrical current and, like a river, events upstream of the E1–E2 pair are detectable whereas events downstream are not, unless inhibitory products build up.

In both cases, rapid electrode rotation increases the diffusion gradients at the electrode surface, thereby accelerating the supply of reactants or escape of intermediates. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> shows results for the downstream reaction (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref> for enzyme and reaction-step identification), the synthesis of aspartate, which is driven simply by applying an electrode potential of −0.45 V vs SHE. Against a general slow decrease, the rate, observed as current, increases sharply (by up to 10%) each time the rotator is switched on, returning to the trend line when the rotator is switched off. This behavior is expected for a fast reaction because rotation increases the rate of supply of reactant molecules from the bulk solution. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref> shows results for the upstream reaction, oxidation of aspartate. The experiment was conducted using the same electrode as used for panel c after changing the cell solution and setting the electrode potential to +0.1 V vs SHE. In contrast to the downstream reaction, the rate increases sharply (by ~5%) each time the rotation is stopped: the main effect of rotation is now to facilitate the escape of intermediates which decreases the current that is detected through the E1–E2 pair. Notably, the nanoconfined enzymes are not dislodged by the centrifugal force set up at the rapidly spinning electrode.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Analysis of products released during catalysis in either direction</title><p id="Par9">We next addressed the overall performance through <sup>1</sup>H-NMR analysis of products and intermediates over long time periods and under different conditions. Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> shows the results for the synthesis of aspartate from pyruvate (20 mM), KHCO<sub>3</sub> and NH<sub>4</sub>Cl carried out using an ITO/Ti foil electrode loaded with the cascade enzymes. The cell volume was 4.5 mL and the electrode area was 12 cm<sup>2</sup>: the enzymes were loaded in a different ratio 0.1/1/5/2/1 (CA/FNR/ME/FumC/AspA) as we expected this would increase the rate of flow along the cascade towards the product, aspartate. The electrode potential was held at −0.45 V vs SHE for a 20 h period (under continuous stirring); the solution was then removed, the cell recharged with reactants and 20 µM NADP<sup>+</sup>, and the reaction was continued for a further 20 h. The two current-time traces were in close correspondence, showing that the nanoconfined enzymes are stable over a useful time period and the decrease in rate with time is due to the accumulation of products (Supplementary Fig. S<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). For the experiment shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref> a conversion of 34%/24% pyruvate to aspartate was obtained for the first/second 20 h runs (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Expt 1), with the following product distributions: 6.80/4.8 mM aspartic acid, 0.06/0.02 mM fumarate and 1.4/1.26 mM malate (Supplementary Fig. S<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref> for NMR). Aspartate is the dominant product and there is relatively little release of malate and (even less so) fumarate intermediates. The total turnover numbers (TTNs) of aspartate/NADP<sup>+</sup> formed were 340 and 240 for the first and second 20 h, respectively. Decreasing the NADP<sup>+</sup> concentration to 5 µM produced a similar conversion: for example, in a 40 h experiment, 23.4% of pyruvate was converted to aspartate (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Expt 2) the TTN based on aspartate production being 936 (Supplementary Fig. S<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>). Clearly, NADP<sup>+</sup> needs to be present only in catalytic amounts, although it exchanges between the pores and bulk solution. Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref> shows the analogous results for the oxidation of aspartate (Supplementary Fig. S<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>), where it is now clear that malate, not pyruvate, is the dominant product.

The presence of CA was essential for the downstream aspartate synthesis starting from bicarbonate but made no difference in the upstream oxidation direction (Supplementary Fig. S<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>). Aspartate is not electroactive at the potential applied (Supplementary Fig. S<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">To help interpret these results we measured the steady-state solution kinetics of E2, E3, and E4 under similar conditions to the electrochemical experiments: <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub><sup>app</sup>, <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub><sup>app</sup>, and resultant specificity constants (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub><sup>app</sup>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub><sup>app</sup>) are shown in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>.

From these data, the rate-determining step in downstream aspartate synthesis is catalyzed by ME, the least active of the enzymes. The high activities of fumarase (100×) and AspA (1000×) then ensure that most malate is taken forward catalytically and very little fumarate escapes, explaining why aspartate is produced in such a high yield. For upstream aspartate oxidation, the slowest enzyme is again ME, thus accounting for the tendency for malate to escape before it can be converted to pyruvate.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Kinetic data for ME, FumC, and AspA measured by conventional steady-state solution assays.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th colspan="3"><p>Aspartate synthesis (downstream)</p></th><th colspan="3"><p>Aspartate oxidation (upstream)</p></th></tr><tr><th/><th><p>ME</p></th><th><p>FumC</p></th><th><p>AspA</p></th><th><p>ME</p></th><th><p>FumC</p></th><th><p>AspA</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p><italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> (s<sup>−1</sup>)</p></td><td><p>17 ± 1.1</p></td><td><p>220 ± 54</p></td><td><p>503 ± 33</p></td><td><p>34 ± 3.1</p></td><td><p>220 ± 29</p></td><td><p>359 ± 15</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> (mM)</p></td><td><p>8.6 ± 2.2</p></td><td><p>1.5 ± 0.11</p></td><td><p>0.19 ± 0.03</p></td><td><p>0.7 ± 0.22</p></td><td><p>0.6 ± 0.2</p></td><td><p>9 ± 1.6</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><italic>k</italic><sub>cat/</sub><italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>(M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>)</p></td><td><p>2.0 × 10<sup>3</sup></p></td><td><p>1.47 × 10<sup>5</sup></p></td><td><p>2.65 × 10<sup>6</sup></p></td><td><p>4.86 × 10<sup>4</sup></p></td><td><p>3.67 × 10<sup>5</sup></p></td><td><p>4.0 × 10<sup>5</sup></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><italic>τ</italic> (1/<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>, ms)</p></td><td><p>58</p></td><td><p>4.5</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>29</p></td><td><p>4.5</p></td><td><p>2.7</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Numbers refer to mean values (<italic>N</italic> = 3 independent replicates) followed by standard errors.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Comparing electrode nanoconfinement with conventional solution kinetics</title><p id="Par12">Experiments were carried out to draw practical and fundamental comparisons with a non-confined cascade—an obvious difficulty being in comparing metrics between 3D homogeneous kinetics in solution and (at the primary macroscopic level) 1D heterogeneous kinetics with an electrode modified with buried enzymes, the local concentrations and accessibility of which are unknown (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

An electrochemical experiment with a different enzyme ratio was performed by applying a 20 μL droplet of enzymes (0.5 mM FNR and 0.1 mM in each of ME, FumC, and AspA) to the surface of an ITO/Ti electrode (area 1 cm<sup>2</sup>), incubating for 20 min then rinsing and placing in a cell containing 20 μM NADP<sup>+</sup> and 20 mM aspartate at pH 7.5. This experiment, conducted with a larger stationary electrode, produced an aspartate oxidation current density of 28 μA cm<sup>−1</sup> corresponding to a rate of 0.15 nmol cm<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>.</p><p id="Par13">The solution experiments were carried out using different dilutions of each 20 μL droplet into a cuvette containing 1 mL total buffer solution volume. The role of the electrode was now played by benzyl viologen, the reduction of which was monitored at 600 nm after initiating the reaction by injecting aspartate, to 20 mM, under anaerobic conditions. At a concentration (µM, in each of FNR/ME/FumC/AspA) of 4.2/0.85/0.85/0.85, the reaction rate corresponded to a rate of 0.9 mol of product per four-enzyme cascade unit per second. Successive dilutions (10-fold, 20-fold, 50-fold) resulted most obviously in greatly extended lag periods preceding slower rates.</p><p id="Par14">On a practical level, the solution rates appeared far higher than the electrochemical rates when comparing on a mol s<sup>−1</sup> (solution) to mol cm<sup>−2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup> (electrode) basis, and suggested that a dilution of ~2000-fold (Supplementary Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) was required to give comparable rates. However, at a more fundamental level, two further factors must be considered. First, the uptake of all enzymes in the droplet into the ITO porous layer would result in an impossibly high enzyme concentration—at least 53 mM in total, assuming a layer of a maximum thickness (3 μm) and zero volume taken up by ITO itself. Based on the mass of a minimal catalytic unit, such a solution would weigh 18 kg L<sup>−1</sup>. While much lower concentrations of the enzyme can be loaded from solution, the adsorption times are much longer, so the concentrated droplet presented a rapid, albeit inefficient remedy. Second, the electrochemical kinetics of porous electrodes are complex: steady-state electrocatalysis will occur predominantly where enzymes are bound in regions closest to the solution boundary surface (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), leaving enzymes that are too buried essentially redundant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Unlike a scaffold-supported cascade suspended in solution (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), which will be serviced by efficient 3-dimensional diffusion of reactants and escape of intermediates and products, diffusion to a densely-packed porous electrode surface is 1-dimensional. In an earlier study that proved the importance of nanoconfinement in a two-enzyme cascade, we proposed using a target area approximation—a 10 × 10 nm square of a hypothetically flat electrode to represent the capture activity of each catalytically competent nanoconfined cascade unit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Using the same approach, the catalytic currents that we observed in the two representative electrochemical experiments (28 and 40 μA cm<sup>−2</sup>) equate to turnover frequencies (aspartate molecules produced per target area unit) of 90 and 126 s<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. For comparison, in the solution experiment, a turnover rate of ~1 s<sup>−1</sup> (moles aspartate produced/moles of cascade unit) was measured for the fastest experiment.</p><p id="Par15">A compelling piece of qualitative evidence overriding these metric difficulties concerns the initial lag period, so characteristic of enzyme cascade reactions measured conventionally in solution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. A lag is absent for the electrochemical experiment (a close-up of the region of Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref> following aspartate injection is included in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S13</xref>) but is pronounced for the solution experiments and can even be seen for the most concentrated condition. As mentioned earlier, nanoconfinement traps intermediates, delaying their escape.</p><p id="Par16">A Fermi-style approximation is instructive. Assuming a diffusion coefficient of 10<sup>−5</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> and a 1-dimensional free path to bulk solvent, an intermediate formed even at a depth of 1–2 μm should escape on a 1 ms timescale (in the crowded environment of the pore, this may be 3–4 times slower than in pure water<sup>3</sup>). The data in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> can be used to obtain approximate <italic>τ</italic>-values (1/<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub><sup>app</sup>) that are relevant at the highest concentrations of intermediates. Whereas <italic>τ</italic>-values for FumC and AspA are ~5 and 2 ms, respectively, in either direction, quite close to the escape times, the average <italic>τ</italic>-value for ME is much higher, at 40 ms, making escape of the reactant more likely than its catalytic transformation. The high <italic>τ</italic>-value for ME suggests the importance of decreasing the probability of escape of an intermediate that is converted at a lower rate. The product and intermediate distribution correlate with individual enzyme activity rather than the practical catalytic potency (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub><sup>app</sup>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub><sup>app</sup> × enzyme concentration applied): hence, the actual pore concentration of ME would need to be much higher than the other enzymes in order that conversion of malate to pyruvate competes with its escape.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Advantages of electrode nanoconfinement for studying cascades</title><p id="Par17">Some clear and objective comparisons can be drawn with the numerous studies of enzyme cascades immobilized on scaffolds that are usually freely dispersed in solution. First, the more efficient 3-dimensional (radial) diffusion geometry for the dispersed system (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) will enhance the supply of reactants and release of products, an unfortunate consequence being that intermediates escape more easily. Nonetheless, for dispersed systems, it is relatively straightforward to extend established enzyme kinetic models to address systematic influences of nanoconfinement, in particular, of substrate channeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Second, and in various systematic bottom-up approaches, the scaffolds and attached enzymes can be pre-assembled to give structures with known enzyme composition and intersite distances: such an ideal situation is difficult to achieve in pre-deposited tight nanopores, where enzyme cascade composition and intersite distances are currently probabilistic. Third, the electrochemical system, in which FNR (E1) works as an in-situ transducer has no counterpart in the dispersed system; not only are rates observed directly and in real-time (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), but the reaction direction can be switched back and forth, as we have stated above, via a laptop command to the potentiostat. The ability to regulate how fast E1 works in either direction even offers the possibility to alter the rate-determining step.</p><p id="Par18">The experiments prove the ability to energize, control, and observe, in real-time, long cascades under nanoconfinement where local enzyme concentrations might also be extremely high and reaction partners crowded, a condition prevailing in zones of living cells. While much needs to be done to understand and optimize the loading and binding of enzymes in the material (particularly, confining them to the more shallow pores), it is difficult to see how such an advantageous situation could be obtained in another way. The variety and abundance of NAD(P)H-linked dehydrogenases that are now available afford unlimited scope for coupling, via extended cascades, to myriad enzymes of all types, driving and detecting the catalytic chemical flow that results via the transducer FNR. In fundamental explorations, the technology allows rapid optimization of reaction conditions, particularly for cascades that are driven upstream. The nanoconfined and energized cascade allows real-time, interactive kinetic measurements of the behavior of concentrated (and possibly crowded) multi-enzyme systems as opposed to individual enzymes: a notable application is the possible spontaneous assembly of active enzyme complexes such as metabolons, and our approach may be unique in its potential to shed light on this important area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.

Analogous procedures were used to prepare ITO/PGE electrodes for rotating disc experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par26">Enzymes were mixed at specific ratios (CA/FNR/ME/FumC/AspA) and then 20 μL of the enzyme solution was deposited and spread on the ITO layer (20 μL per approximate 1.9 cm<sup>2</sup>); this was altered to 10 μL for the ITO/PGE electrode. The electrode was then left at room temperature for 20 min before rinsing thoroughly in ultrapure water to remove any unbound enzyme.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Electrochemical measurements</title><p id="Par27">A three-compartment cell was used for all cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry experiments (except for the rotation experiments), using a Pt mesh as a counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Experiments were carried out using PalmSens multi-channel or Metrohm Autolab (PGSTAT128N) potentiostats. The potentials were converted to SHE using the following equation: <italic>E</italic><sub>SHE</sub> = <italic>E</italic><sub>Ag/AgCl</sub> + 0.21 V. The programs PSTrace 4.8 and MultiTrace were used in all electrochemical experiments unless stated otherwise. Cyclic voltammetry (pH 7.5, 25 °C) was carried out using a buffer containing 20 mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma, &gt;99%), 0.1 M NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 0.1 M KHCO<sub>3</sub>, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>. An ITO/Ti electrode (1.98 cm<sup>2</sup>) was prepared as described previously and a droplet of the enzyme mixture in the required ratios and concentrations was deposited on the electrode and kept for 20 min at room temperature to allow the enzymes to adsorb. The electrode was then thoroughly rinsed with deionized water. Throughout the experiment, the cell was continuously flushed with Argon.</p><p id="Par28">Chronoamperometry experiments were carried out to drive the downstream reductive amination/carboxylation of pyruvate to aspartate or the upstream oxidative deamination/decarboxylation of aspartate to pyruvate. In the former case, a potential of −0.45 V vs SHE was applied. Experiments were carried out in an anaerobic glove box (MBraun) with an N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere (O<sub>2</sub> &lt; 2 ppm). The surface area for aspartate synthesis (the downstream direction) was approximately 12 cm<sup>2</sup>. The buffer used was 0.05 M HEPES, 0.1 M NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM pyruvate (pH 7.5). The cell solution was stirred using a small magnetic stirrer bar. Reactions were initiated by injection of NADP<sup>+</sup> (to a final concentration of 20 μM) and KHCO<sub>3</sub> (to a final concentration of 0.1 M). Aspartate oxidation (the upstream direction) was carried out on the bench under a continuous flow of Argon, using an electrode surface area of typically 3.6 cm<sup>2</sup>. NADP<sup>+</sup> was added to a final concentration of 20 μM and potassium <sc>l</sc>-aspartate (Sigma, 98.5%) to 20 mM in a buffer containing 0.05 M MOPS (Melford), 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.5.</p><p id="Par29">Rotating disc electrode experiments were carried out in an anaerobic glove box (MBraun) with an N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere (O<sub>2</sub> &lt; 2 ppm) to ensure that there was no contribution to the current by O<sub>2</sub> upon injection of substrates. An ITO/PGE electrode (0.03 cm<sup>2</sup>) was loaded with a mixture of the enzymes in the following proportions (0.1/1/5/1/1, CA/FNR/ME/FumC/AspA) by drop-casting 10 μL of the enzyme mixture and incubating at RT for 20 min. The electrode was then thoroughly rinsed to remove any unbound protein. The reference electrode (Ag/AgCl) was housed in a sidearm and connected to the main cell via a Luggin capillary; the Pt counter electrode was present in the same compartment as the working electrode. Nova version 1.10.4 (Metrohm) was used to collect the data. The buffer used was 0.05 M HEPES, 0.1 M KHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.1 M NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 20 mM pyruvate, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub> at pH 7.5. An aliquot of concentrated NADP<sup>+</sup> solution was injected to give a final cell concentration of 20 μM. The rotation rate (<italic>ω</italic>) at the beginning of the experiment was 1000 rpm and the potential applied was −0.45 V vs SHE at 25 °C. The rotation rate was switched back and forth between 0 and 1000 rpm. After 1 h the cell solution was removed, the electrode was placed in a buffer, and the compartment washed 10 times with deionized water and once with buffer. A new buffer containing 0.05 M MOPS, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub> at pH 7.5 was added and the electrode reinserted into this fresh cell solution. The potential was then changed to 0.1 V SHE and rotation resumed (<italic>ω</italic> = 1000 rpm). Injection of aspartate to 20 mM caused the immediate (within 2 s) appearance of an oxidation current. Again, the rotation was switched between 1000 and 0 rpm.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title><sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectroscopy</title><p id="Par30">A Bruker AVIIIHD 400 instrument was used to measure NMR spectra.
