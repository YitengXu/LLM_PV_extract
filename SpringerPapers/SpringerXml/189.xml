Plant biomass represents an abundant source of renewable material, mainly in the form of polysaccharides in plant cell walls. However, the co-polymeric and recalcitrant nature of these cell walls constitutes a major hurdle in the extraction and valorization of the carbohydrate building blocks. Chitin represents another abundant, but recalcitrant source of renewable material, found in e.g. the shells of insects and crustaceans. Facing the structural intricacies of these biomaterials, plant-degrading and chitin-degrading microorganisms have developed complex arsenals of chemical and enzymatic tools for their deconstruction. Among the enzymatic tools are enzymes today known as lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs), which play a major role in biomass conversion by oxidative cleavage and, thus, structural disruption of biopolymers such as chitin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, cellulose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, as well as co-polymeric structures made of cellulose and hemicelluloses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. This disruptive action boosts the depolymerizing action of glycoside hydrolases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. LPMOs, classified today in families 9–11 and 13–16 of the auxiliary activities (AA) in the Carbohydrate Active enZymes database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, are ubiquitous enzymes with key roles in biological conversion of biomass by fungi and bacteria, but also with suggested roles in microbial pathogenicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.

Although the field of photocatalysis has been explored for decades, the field of photobiocatalysis, i.e., catalysis at the cross roads between photocatalysis and enzymology has been emerging more recently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Harnessing the energy carried by visible light to drive biochemical processes, including enzymatic reactions, under eco-friendly conditions, constitutes a potentially valuable addition to currently available biotechnological tools. LPMO action requires energy in the form of reducing equivalents, and, in 2016, two studies were published that address the possibility of driving LPMO-catalyzed biomass conversion by light (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Cannella et al. showed that upon photo-excitation of pigments (e.g., chlorophyllin, <italic>Chl</italic>), and, notably, in the presence of a reductant, the activity of AA9E from <italic>Thielavia terrestris</italic> (<italic>Tt</italic>AA9E) on amorphous cellulose (PASC) could be boosted by up to two orders of magnitude<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In the same year, Bissaro et al. showed that a photocatalyst (vanadium-doped titanium dioxide, V-TiO<sub>2</sub>), catalyzing the thermodynamically challenging oxidation of water upon exposure to visible light, could generate the necessary reducing equivalents for oxidation of crystalline cellulose (Avicel) by AA10C from <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic> (<italic>Sc</italic>AA10C)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Both studies discussed possible mechanistic scenarios behind the observed effects, but the underlying mechanisms of both systems remain to be clarified.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Light-driven LPMO-catalyzed oxidation of cellulose.</title><p>For the Chl-based system, Cannella et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> proposed that photo-excited electrons activate the LPMO (<italic>a</italic>) and that reductants such as AscA or lignin could serve as electron donor to regenerate Chl (not shown). Here, we provide evidence for an alternative reduction pathway, where O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup>, produced via single electron reduction of O<sub>2</sub> by photo-excited Chl (Chl*) (<italic>b</italic>), acts as reductant (<italic>b’</italic>). Disproportionation of O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<italic>c</italic>) can occur spontaneously or be accelerated by enzymatic action (e.g., superoxide dismutase, SOD) or by chemical reactions, such as reduction by AscA. In the V-TiO<sub>2</sub> based system, reducing equivalents (in the form of excited electrons) are derived from V-TiO<sub>2</sub>-mediated and light-promoted oxidation of water (<italic>d</italic>). Several reduction reactions can occur at the surface of V-TiO<sub>2</sub>, including reduction of LPMO-Cu(II) to LPMO-Cu(I) (<italic>e</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>), reduction of O<sub>2</sub> to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<italic>f</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>) or reduction of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to H<sub>2</sub>O (not shown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>). The lower panel shows that the LPMO reduced by either of the two systems uses the generated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for cellulose oxidation (<italic>g</italic>). Hydroxylation of the glycosidic bond carbon leads to spontaneous bond cleavage (<italic>h</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>). Of note, these schemes focus on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-driven LPMO catalysis, whereas O<sub>2</sub>-driven LPMO catalysis is not considered. See the main text for further details.

LPMOs are mono-copper enzymes that catalyze the hydroxylation of the C1 and/or the C4 carbon in scissile glycosidic bonds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Since the seminal study by Vaaje-Kolstad et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, LPMOs have been considered as monooxygenases, requiring the delivery of O<sub>2</sub>, two electrons and two protons for each catalytic cycle (R–H + O<sub>2</sub> + 2e<sup>−</sup> + 2 H<sup>+</sup> → R–OH + H<sub>2</sub>O) via different putative reaction pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In laboratory conditions, LPMO reactions are typically fueled by dissolved oxygen and added external reductants, such as ascorbic acid (AscA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Subsequently to the publication of the photobiocatalytic studies mentioned above<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, we showed for one AA9-type and two AA10-type LPMOs that these enzymes, when supplied with both O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, preferentially use H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as co-substrate. This observation led us to suggest that the previously described need for O<sub>2</sub> may reflect the fact that O<sub>2</sub> is a precursor of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in standard aerobic conditions typically used in LPMO reactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The reaction with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is best described as that of a peroxygenase (R–H + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> → R–OH + H<sub>2</sub>O), where the oxygen atom, the two protons and the reducing equivalents are supplied simultaneously in the form of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to an activated LPMO (i.e., the reduced LPMO-Cu(I) state). Subsequently, several experimental studies have confirmed the efficiency of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-driven LPMO reactions for different LPMO/substrate systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Furthermore, modeling studies have demonstrated the feasibility of the peroxygenase reaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Clearly, this recent paradigm change calls for a re-investigation of light-driven cellulose oxidation by LPMOs, in particular the potential underlying role of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, we use coupled enzymatic assays to probe the roles of superoxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup>) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the oxidation of Avicel by <italic>Sc</italic>AA10C fueled by visible light-exposed Chl or V-TiO<sub>2</sub> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Indeed, use of the Chl/light-AscA system gave very high initial catalytic rates, notably accompanied by almost immediate enzyme inactivation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>; orange curve, see the 25% curve in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3a, c</xref> for more details concerning the initial phase of the reaction). In accordance with the work by Cannella et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, the initial rates obtained with Chl/light-AscA were much higher than the rates obtained in a standard reaction with only AscA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, blue curve). Yet, the standard reaction with only AscA produced more oxidized products compared to the reaction with Chl/light-AscA, because the LPMO stayed active for a much longer time (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Interestingly, at the light intensities used here, which are considerably higher than those used by Cannella et al., the Chl/light system could also fuel the LPMO reaction in the absence of AscA, yielding relatively stable progress curves spanning several hours (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>; black curve).

Without added AscA, the system produces much lower amounts of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, at a more regular pace (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> does not accumulate in the LPMO reactions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), likely because it is consumed by the LPMO, which stays active over a long-time period (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). The reaction with only AscA provides a less clear picture, but it is clear that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is produced under these conditions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), and it is worthwhile noting the small peak in the apparent level of accumulated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at 240 min in the LPMO reaction (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), i.e., just after the LPMO has become inactive (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). All in all, the data shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a–c</xref> are compatible with the notion that LPMO activity is correlated with the availability of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and, that too high levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in LPMO reactions lead to enzyme inactivation and subsequent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation. Control experiments in which fresh reaction components (Avicel, AscA and/or LPMO) were added to a reaction with AscA+Chl/light after 60 min of incubation (i.e., long after product formation had ceased, Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) showed that only addition of fresh LPMO led to the reinitiation of product formation, confirming the impact of enzyme inactivation (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>).</p><p id="Par12">We then assessed whether the ability of the Chl/light system to drive LPMO reactions could be linked to the expected production of O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> by this system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.

Accordingly, we observed that addition of 100 nM SOD led to increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>) while yielding relatively low H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation in the complete system (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). On the other hand, addition of 1 μM SOD led to higher H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>) and accumulation of high levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the reaction with the (rapidly inactivated) LPMO and substrate (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). These results indicate that the Chl/light system produces large amounts of O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> and that the degree of conversion O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, e.g., by SOD (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d–f</xref>), determines both the catalytic rate and the stability of the LPMO.</p><p id="Par13">Addition of catalase (katE), a H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> consuming enzyme (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>), to the reaction containing a (too) high amount of SOD (1 μM) had a clear beneficial effect, leading to higher LPMO activity over a longer period (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>) and little accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). Addition of catalase to the Chl/light system gave a stable LPMO reaction, with only a slight reduction in rate, no visible enzyme inactivation within the 12-h measuring period (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>), and almost no accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). In light of the idea that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> drives LPMO action, it may seem surprising that, while catalase expectedly abolished accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>), it hardly affected, or even had a seemingly positive effect on, LPMO activity. There are, however, straightforward explanations for this paradox. Firstly, the beneficial effect of catalase on the reaction with 1 μM SOD is due to catalase removing the surplus of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> that otherwise would lead to LPMO inactivation. Secondly, kinetic data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> show that a reduced LPMO in the presence of substrate will easily compete with catalase for available H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>; it is thus plausible that, while catalase consumes produced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the absence of the LPMO (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>), H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> will primarily be consumed by the LPMO in reactions containing both enzymes and an LPMO substrate (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>).</p><p id="Par14">If the ability of the Chl/light system to drive LPMO reactions indeed is due to the production of O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup>, which is subsequently converted to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, the huge effect of adding AscA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a–c</xref>) suggests that AscA catalyzes the otherwise spontaneous conversion of O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, as has indeed been shown (see ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>). Accordingly, the initial rate of LPMO catalysis and the degree of enzyme inactivation could be modulated by varying the amount of AscA (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>).</p><p id="Par15">Likewise, there was a clear correlation between the light intensity, which determines the rate of O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> generation, and LPMO activity for both the Chl/light (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>) and the Chl/light-AscA system (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows that the decrease in LPMO activity upon decreasing the light intensity applied to the Chl/light system (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>) correlates with decreased production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (measured in absence of the LPMO) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Importantly, in the absence of LPMO activity, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generated by Chl/light system will be further reduced, which implies that the measured apparent levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> are likely an underestimation of the true levels of produced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. On the other hand, when the LPMO and substrate are present, one could expect that the high affinity of the LPMO for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> results in efficient integration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> in oxidized reaction products. Accordingly, while Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> shows an apparent retardation in the rate of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in the absence of the LPMO, Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> shows a linear increase in LPMO products over time.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>The effect of light intensity on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production and LPMO activity in the Chl-system.</title><p>The graphs show, for different light intensities (100% = approx. 168 W cm<sup>−2</sup>), <bold>a</bold> the apparent quantity of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generated in reactions with Chl (500 µM)/light and Avicel and <bold>b</bold> the amount of soluble aldonic acid products released in identical reactions that also contained <italic>Sc</italic>AA10C (0.5 µM).

Of note, while potentially harmful effects of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on enzymes due to non-specific oxidation reactions are well known, the deleterious effect of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on LPMOs is specific in the sense that the reaction of substrate-free, reduced LPMOs with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> leads to oxidative damage in the catalytic center<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par17">The dualistic impact of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> could also explain why our present conclusions differ from those of Möllers and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, who concluded that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are not part of light-driven LPMO catalysis. On the one hand, these authors observed that exposure of Chl/AscA to light leads to consumption of O<sub>2</sub>. In accordance with our present results, this effect was attributed to the conversion of O<sub>2</sub> into O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, as shown by increases in O<sub>2</sub> levels upon addition of SOD and catalase, respectively. On the other hand, Möllers et al. found that addition of catalase or SOD did not affect measured LPMO product levels, leading to the conclusion that the generated ROS do not affect LPMO catalysis. The absence of an effect of catalase on apparent LPMO activity is not surprising in light of kinetic considerations (see above). The absence of an effect of SOD could be due to the fact that Möllers et al. did not monitor LPMO activity over time and thus may have overlooked effects of LPMO inactivation. Perhaps, the authors encountered a situation similar to the one presented in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>, where SOD effects are not visible because the LPMO becomes fully inactivated prior to the first sampling point. In our hands, SOD clearly has an effect on light-driven LPMO performance, as shown by Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d–f</xref>.

The correlations between H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> availability and LPMO activity described above suggest that this priming reduction is not rate-limiting. This is supported by stopped-flow kinetics showing fast (4.2 × 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) and full reduction of an AA10 LPMO when using as little as 5 µM AscA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The situation may be different when using the Chl/light system, without added AscA. We have previously shown that superoxide, which is produced by the light-exposed Chl (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), can serve as reductant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Another option would be the direct reduction of the LPMO by photo-excited Chl, as suggested by Cannella et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. To probe this latter hypothesis, we initially attempted to monitor LPMO reduction by light-exposed Chl in anaerobic conditions using fluorescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, but we did not manage to establish conditions that allowed informative fluorescence measurements. In an alternative experiment, carried out under anaerobic conditions we first exposed the LPMO to Chl/light and then added substrate and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, while switching off the light. Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows that this approach led to only very low LPMO activity, compared to a control reaction with AscA, and that this activity was independent of the application of light. Thus, it would seem that light-induced reduction of the LPMO does not occur in anaerobic conditions, which supports the idea that, under aerobic conditions, the LPMO is mainly reduced by (oxygen-derived) superoxide and not by direct electron transfer from Chl to the LPMO.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Anaerobic activation of <italic>Sc</italic>AA10C by Chl/Light.</title><p>The experiment consisted of two phases, namely a pretreatment phase (I) followed by an activity test phase (II).

Given the expected low reduction potential of photo-excited chlorophyllin, efficient reduction of the LPMO may occur.

Indeed, measurement of reduction potentials of the ground state Chl (&gt;0.6 V vs. SHE; see above), present in the first phase of the experiment, indicate that it can act as an oxidant of LPMO-Cu(I), which would regenerate LPMO-Cu(II). In a real (i.e., one-phase) experiment, LPMO-Cu(I) would have several possible fates: (i) re-oxidation in solution by either ground state Chl, by O<sub>2</sub> or by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, or, (ii) binding to the substrate and formation of a productive complex with the co-substrate, leading to substrate hydroxylation and cleavage.

The fact that Cu(II) reconstituted-chlorin e<sub>6</sub> yields less H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> than the commercial preparation of Chl suggest that the latter likely is not fully saturated with copper. Our results clearly show that metalation of the pigment is an important parameter to take into account for future studies.

One technical challenge concerns the measuring of actual H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production rates by a given system in which H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is the final product (i.e., not immediately used by an enzyme such as an LPMO). Our study also shows the intricacy of interpreting the effects of accessory enzymes such as catalase and SOD and demonstrates the absolute need for analyzing progress curves, rather than relying on single time point measurements of product formation. SOD accelerates the conversion of O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> into H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which increases the LPMO initial rate but also leads to more rapid inactivation of the LPMO. On the other hand, catalase, by converting H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O, prevents accumulation of excess H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and thus reduces LPMO inactivation. It is worth noting the linear progress curve that is obtained when using catalase in the light-driven reactions displayed in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>. All in all, the present data clearly show that LPMOs use H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and that controlling H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels is key to optimizing LPMO catalysis.</p><p id="Par33">The set of experiments presented here demonstrates that when exposed to light, Chl can reduce O<sub>2</sub> to O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> leading to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, via either spontaneous disproportionation or chemical reduction (e.g., by AscA). H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production can be regulated by light intensity but also by metalation of the porphyrin ring, which tunes the photochemical properties of the pigment. Although photo-excitation of the pigment is clearly needed to fuel LPMO activity, we were not able to discriminate whether reduction of the LPMO occurs via direct electron transfer from photo-excited Chl or via superoxide. Importantly, studies of a completely different system for light-driven driven LPMO catalysis, based on using V-TiO<sub>2</sub> particles, showed that also in this case light-driven oxidation of cellulose by the LPMO entails a peroxygenation reaction. Of note, the earlier study on driving LPMO reactions with the V-TiO<sub>2</sub>/light system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> showed that LPMO activity can be controlled by switching the light on or off and that the system also works when using regular sunlight.</p><p id="Par34">Most importantly, our data show that these LPMO-catalyzed peroxygenation reactions can be fueled by light only and that other sources of energy, such as reducing equivalents used in standard LPMO reactions and in earlier work on light-driven LPMO catalysis, are not required. The use of light allows tunable in situ generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> which then fuels polysaccharide oxidation at rates that are higher than those reported when LPMOs were still believed to act as monooxygenases only.

To generate this background control, 18 µL portions of the filtrates from each sample of a triplicate chlorophyllin-containing reaction were pooled. 50 µL of this 54 µL pool (or a dilution equivalent to the one used for the reaction containing Amplex red) was mixed with 50 µL of a premix made of HRP (10 U/mL) and DMSO (2% in the premix) in sodium phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5) (i.e., the same premix as previously described but without Amplex red). The difference (if any) between this background control and the blank sample was used to correct for absorbance generated by residual chlorophyllin.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Verification of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity</title><p id="Par41">SOD activity was verified according to a published protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>.

These were protected from light in aluminum foil and kept on ice. Prior to voltammetric measurements, Chl or chlorin e<sub>6</sub> was diluted ten-fold (500 µM) in potassium phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.0) supplemented with KCl as supporting electrolyte (100 mM). The voltammetric measurements were carried out using an MCS-200 potentiostat (BioLogic, France) and EC-lab software (BioLogic, France). The voltammograms were recorded using a three-electrode system (eDAQ, Australia) with a glassy-carbon electrode (GCE) of 1.0 mm diameter as the working electrode, an Ag/AgCl (3.4 M KCl) electrode as a reference electrode, and a platinum covered titanium wire as a counter electrode. The glassy-carbon electrode was cleaned before each measurement. It was rinsed with deionized Milli-Q water prior to polishing using a 0.05 µm Alumina polishing slurry (eDAQ, Australia) on a wet polishing cloth. Then, the electrode was rinsed with deionized Milli-Q water before and after a 30 s sonication step. The solutions were degassed by nitrogen sparging before the electrochemical measurements, and a nitrogen blanket over the solution was maintained during the experiments. All experiments were performed at room temperature in the dark. To obtain the square-wave voltammograms, we used the same parameters as described in ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. The pulse height (amplitude) was 50 mV, the step height (potential increment) was 2 mV and the pulse width (frequency) was 0.4 ms (1250 Hz), which corresponds to a scan rate of 2500 mV s<sup>−1</sup>. The Ag/AgCl reference electrode was calibrated each day by cyclic voltammetry using potassium ferricyanide [K<sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>] (1 mM) in potassium phosphate buffer (100 mM pH 7.0) supplemented with KCl as supporting electrolyte (100 mM).
