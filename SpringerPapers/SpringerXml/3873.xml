However, the proteome alterations involved in cervical carcinogenesis are not extensively studied. This study aims to elucidate the differentially expressed proteins and offer insights into the cellular processes and pathways involved in the development of cervical cancer.</p><p id="Par5"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par6">The pathological regions of interest in the cervical squamous epithelium were micro-dissected from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections of six normal cervix cases, five HPV-associated squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL), and six squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). The samples were trypsin digestion and subjected to high throughput liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS/MS) and trapped ion mobility time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (timsTOF-MS), followed by quantification with MaxQuant and Perseus software. Bioinformatics analyses were carried out using DAVID, ConsensusPathDB, and STRING.</p><p id="Par7"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par8">We identified a total of 3597 proteins with 589, 550, and 1570 proteins unique to the normal cervix, SIL, and SCC groups, respectively, while 332 proteins were similar across all three groups. The predominant protein found was histone. Interestingly, the quantification results showed an upward trend for the up-regulated proteins and a downward trend for the down-regulated proteins in the progression from normal to SIL and SCC. The main molecular function was the binding process, and the top biological processes were chromatin silencing for SIL compared to the normal cervix and nucleosome assembly for the SCC compared to SIL group. The key pathways involved were viral carcinogenesis and necroptosis, reflecting their role in cell proliferation, migration, and metastasis.</p><p id="Par9"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par10">The identification of proteins and their associated pathways provides a deeper understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in HPV-associated cervical cancer.</p><p id="Par11"><bold>Acknowledgement:</bold> The work was funded by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS/1/2019/SKK13/USM/01/1) from the Ministry of Education, Malaysia.</p><p id="Par12"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par13">[1] F.

However, the relationship between obesity and CRC is still unclear. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is known for causing abnormal lipid metabolism and is usually measured in the blood [2]. Two LDL-related biomarkers, apoB and 4HNE, were chosen to investigate their expression in overweight-and obese-related CRC tissues, and their association with the clinicopathological data was also determined.</p><p id="Par20"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par21">Human ethical approval with a series code of USM/JEPeM 19060354 was obtained. This retrospective study involved overweight-and obese-related CRCs diagnosed in HUSM from January 2015 to December 2021. The classification of BMI followed the Asia Pacific BMI classification [3]. Clinicopathological data was retrieved from Laboratory Information System (LIS) and medical records at Pathology laboratory, HUSM. The CRC archival tissue blocks were then collected for Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. The data was then analysed using SPSS Version 26.</p><p id="Par22"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par23">A total of 69 overweight-and obese-related CRCs were retrieved within seven years. The patients had median age of 61 years old with interquartile range of 21, common in age of more than 50 years old (73.9%) and in males (52.2%). Most of the patients were found with CRCs localised in sigmoid colon (30.4%) and rectosigmoid colon (24.6%), larger than 2cm of tumour (97.1%), presence of bowel wall invasion (94.2%), and absence of lymph nodes involvement (58.0%). The tumours were frequently classified as adenocarcinoma (91.3%) with moderate differentiation grade (82.6%) and under Modified Duke B class (55.1%). The IHC-stained CRC tissue slides showed high apoB expression (91.3%), whereas low 4HNE expression (82.6%). Significant associations were observed between apoB expression with age (<italic>p</italic> value=0.036), tumour site (<italic>p</italic> value=0.048), bowel wall invasion (<italic>p</italic> value=0.035), Duke classification (<italic>p</italic> value=0.002), while 4HNE expression with tumour size (<italic>p</italic> value=0.029). Majority of CRC tumours of more than 2cm showed low 4HNE expression. This may be explained by the protective effect of low 4HNE level that prevents the damage of the cancer cells [4].</p><p id="Par24"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par25">In conclusion, the contrast tissue expression of apoB and 4HNE, and the significant associations obtained has shed light on the role of these LDL-related biomarkers in overweight-and obese-related CRC tissues. Exploration on the role of these biomarkers is recommended for <italic>in vitro</italic> study.</p><p id="Par26"><bold>Acknowledgement:</bold> The work was funded by Long Term Research Grant Scheme (LRGS) LR001-2019 (203/PPSP/6720019) from the Malaysian Research University Network (MRUN).</p><p id="Par27"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par28">[1] Ye PF, et al.

However, the widespread use of insecticide is causing resistance in mosquitoes. Understanding the proteomics basis of insecticide resistance may provide novel opportunities to control mosquito vectors. Hence, this study aimed to elucidate proteins associated with permethrin resistant <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> using quantitative proteomics.</p><p id="Par36"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par37">The study evaluated the resistance pattern of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> from dengue hotspot and non-hotspot areas of Penang Island. Permethrin 0.75% insecticide-impregnated papers were used to determine the resistance status in adult female <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. The mosquito proteins were analysed using LC–ESI–MS/MS for protein identification and quantification via label-free quantitative (LFQ) analysis. In this study, differential protein expression (DEP) analysis was carried out using Perseus 1.6.14.0 statistical software to perform ANOVA and student’s t-test. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) and functional ontology enrichment analyses were performed using STRING software.</p><p id="Par38"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par39">The bioassay results showed 28% and 53% mortalities in mosquitoes exposed to permethrin from the hotspot and non-hotspot areas. Permethrin has been used extensively in Malaysia’s dengue vector control program. The mortality percentage has shown a high permethrin resistance rate in the field strain <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquito, including the strains from the dengue hotspot and non-hotspot areas. These results suggested high resistance status in the dengue hotspot and non-hotspot areas. The high resistant patterns identified in the field strain <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> could be because of the widespread and indiscriminate permethrin use in the investigated areas, especially if a site was labeled as a dengue hotspot. The resistance in the non-hotspot area could be because the area was once a dengue hotspot. These areas received extra attention from vector control management and private contractors lead to insecticide selection pressure and produce offspring carrying insecticide-resistant genes. The LFQ analyses revealed 501 (q-value &lt;0.05) DEPs. The t-test showed 114 upregulated and 74 downregulated proteins in resistant versus laboratory strain exposed to permethrin. The significant functional ontology enrichment of the DEPs indicated drug-metabolic process, small molecule metabolic process, hydrolase activity acting on ester bonds, and catalytic activity. The PPI of DEPs showed a p-value at &lt;1.0 x 10<sup>-16</sup> in permethrin-resistant <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. Significantly enriched pathways in DEPs revealed metabolic pathways, oxidative phosphorylation, carbon metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, glycolysis, and citrate cycle.</p><p id="Par40"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par41">This study has revealed several DEPs and highlighted upregulated and downregulated proteins associated with insecticide resistance in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>O-4 Clarithromycin resistance in <italic>Helicobacter Pylori</italic> is associated with genetic polymorphism of virulence factors</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Anis Rageh Al-Maleki and Naim Rosli</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Department of Medical Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</title><sec id="Sec16"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Anis Rageh Al-Maleki (anisrageh@um.edu.my)</title><p id="Par42">From The International Conference on Molecular Diagnostics &amp; Biomarker Discovery 2022 (MDBD 2022)</p><p id="Par43">Penang, Malaysia. 11 – 13 October 2022</p><p id="Par44"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par45">For a long time, the macrolide antibiotic clarithromycin was used to treat <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> (<italic>H. pylori</italic>) infections. The efficiency of traditional triple therapy for the eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic> has recently been dismally reduced in many nations [1]. Clarithromycin resistance is spreading over the world and is the leading cause of <italic>H. pylori</italic> treatment failure [2]. We employed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) technology to identify genomic alterations related with the development of antibiotic resistance in <italic>H. pylori</italic> with induced resistance to Clarithromycin.</p><p id="Par46"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par47">The clarithromycin-sensitive <italic>H. pylori</italic> strains were induced to become resistant against clarithromycin. To induce resistance, the strains were exposed to gradually increased concentration of clarithromycin in vitro for 3-5 days on a chocolate agar plate (CAP). The identity between resistant strains and their corresponding parental sensitive strains before induction were verified by random amplification of polymorphic DNA polymerase chain reaction (RAPD-PCR). WGS for bacterial DNA was performed, using Illumina platform.</p><p id="Par48"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par49">There were 113 distinct single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 286 unique insertions and deletions (InDels) changes discovered among the induced-resistant <italic>H. pylori</italic> strains.

Moreover, we also found that it is not possible to infer a Clarithromycin resistance phenotype based on the existence of distinct point mutations in A2143G and/or A2142G mutations in 23S rRNA and may not be sufficient for predicting Clarithromycin resistance in <italic>H. pylori</italic>.</p><p id="Par50"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par51">As a result, we hypothesise that in these strains, alternative mechanisms unrelated to the 23S rRNA gene sequence, such as the existence of an efflux pump, may play a role in Clarithromycin resistance.</p><p id="Par52"><bold>Acknowledgement:</bold> The work is supported financially by the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia (MOHE) via Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS/1/2020/SKK0/UM/02/20), Project No. (FP105-2020).</p><p id="Par53"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par54">[1] Giorgio F, Principi M, De Francesco V, Zullo A, Losurdo G, Di Leo A, Ierardi E.

Unfortunately, lettuce is frequently associated with <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O157:H7 outbreaks that cause serious illnesses such as haemolytic uremic syndrome and haemorrhagic colitis [1]. Thus, a proper cleaning of the products is crucial to eliminate the risk of foodborne pathogens contamination. Acetic acid, such as vinegar, has shown its antimicrobial effect on inhibiting the growth of <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7 [2]. In addition, it is commonly used in the household settings for cooking and washing. Hence, the objectives for this study were identifying and verifying the presence of <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7 on lettuces purchased from retail market in Kampar Perak, using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR); followed by evaluating the antimicrobial activity of vinegar based on the analysis of log reduction in growth of <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7.</p><p id="Par76"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par77">A total of 20 samples of lettuce was purchased from a retail market in Kampar Perak.

Both encodes for somatic and flagellar antigen, respectively. On the other hand, 1.0 McFarland ATCC 700728 <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7 was prepared and inoculated on lettuce at 5°C for 1 h. 5% of white vinegar was immersed into the ‘contaminated’ lettuce at 4 time points:10, 20, 30 and 40 mins.

In Malaysia, the prevalence of anaemia was up to 13.8% and more than half of the cases were due to iron deficient. Thus, this study is to elucidate the underlying factors in leading to anaemia including the association of SNPs on iron- regulating genes to iron-metabolising parameters and its predisposition to anaemia.</p><p id="Par117"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par118">A total of 183 subjects aged between 18 to 35 were recruited at Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman with informed consent.

A lower hepcidin level is necessary to increase iron absorption to replenish iron loss through menstruation. Higher body mass index (BMI) was associated significantly with higher haemoglobin level, probably due to higher dietary iron intake among overweight and obese individuals. Individuals with a family history of anaemia presented with lower haemoglobin levels. The genetic variant of <italic>TF</italic> gene (rs12769) was associated with higher hepcidin and serum iron level while homozygous A allele in rs10421768 was associated with higher serum iron level.

Thus, WHO called for elimination of this disease as a public-health problem in 1997. Diagnostic kits were made and distributed worldwide to address this problem, and one of the kits is the Brugia Rapid test (Reszon Diagnostic International Sdn. Bhd., Malaysia) that uses recombinant Brugia malayi antigen BmR1 which is highly specific and sensitive for antifilarial igG4 antibodies in patients with brugian filariasis. In the manufacturing of rapid tests, quality control (QC) is necessary to ascertain the reactivity and specificity of the tests [1]. An anti-BmR1-IgG4 antibody which was synthesized and verified as a QC reagent was produced through transient expression [2]. However, transient expression has its downsides of being laborious, having low productivity and high cost in the long term as compared to stable expression which requires much lower amount of plasmid DNA and act as a renewable source of expressing cells. Thus, this study investigates the conversion of transient to stable expression of the antibody.</p><p id="Par128"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par129">Stable cell lines were generated using Flp-In system and Flp-In 293 cell line (Thermo Fisher). DNA sequence of anti-BmR1 IgG4 was cloned into pcDNA5/FRT, which was then co- transfected with pOg44 into Flp-In 293 cell line using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher). True transfectants were selected based on Hygromycin B resistance and expanded to make cell stocks and working cells for antibody expression. Protein A affinity chromatography was used to purify the supernatant, which contained the protein, after the cells had been harvested.

In 10 days, 1cm<sup>2</sup> of cell culture surface area (approximately 1.5 x 10<sup>5</sup> of cells) expresses up to 0.776μg of antibody. Transient or stable expression systems should be chosen based on throughput, the number and quality of resources required, and turnaround time.[3]. Stable cells are favoured for large-scale protein production because they offer high yields and reliable quality of no batch-to-batch variation. Site-specific recombination has the ability to consistently produce stable cells with high yields. The total surface area of a planar vessel can be increased to easily increase the stable cell pool.</p><p id="Par133"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par134">Although transient system may be apt for initial studies, mass production of antibody would require a stable expression system. The stably expressed antibody functions similarly to its transiently expressed counterpart.

Protein kinases are involved in many human diseases including cancers. Protein phosphatases regulate cellular events by reversing protein kinases activity. The serine/threonine protein phosphatase 4 (PP4) is an essential protein for nucleation, growth, and stabilization of microtubules in centrosomes/spindle bodies during cell division and survival of T cells. It consists of catalytic subunit (PP4c) interacting with four different regulatory subunits (PP4R1, PP4R2, PP4R3 and PP4R4). Previous studies showed that PP4c has an important tumour suppressor function and plays crucial role in the control of cell fate in leukemic T-cells and untransformed human peripheral blood T-cells.

A copy of X chromosome is relatively correlated with SLE development [2]. Due to the global hypomethylation or defective in X-Chromosome Inactivation (XCI), [2] the studies found that 23% of genes are able to escape from this mechanism leading to X-linked gene over-expression found in SLE [3]. Genetic variations are deviated in different populations and may influence the incidence and mortality rate. Therefore, our study aims to investigate a global variant on X chromosome in Thai population. This might help to address the high female to male incidence ratio found among SLE patients.</p><p id="Par155"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par156">All procedures are approved by the ethics committee at Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University (EC. 590223). Using Asian Screening Array results from previous study [4], We conducted genome-wide association study (GWAS) on X chromosome from 892 SLE samples compared with healthy controls data (n = 1,683). Low quality samples and bad SNP markers were excluded by quality control processes (QC). Inflation factors after QC process are 1.008. Next, haplotype estimating was completed by SHAPEIT to pre-phasing the SNPs before imputation step by IMPUTE v2.3.2 software using -chrX function.

High population of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) in tumor microenvironment (TME) which display M2-type macrophages promotes BC metastasis and correlates with poor clinical prognosis in BC patients. Reprogramming TAM into M1-type macrophages that capable of killing tumor cells has emerged as a favorable therapeutic target in BC. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) can stimulate immunomodulatory changes and skew naïve macrophages (M0) to M1-type macrophages [2]. Therefore, this study attempted to evaluate MSC-macrophages crosstalk on BC progression.</p><p id="Par170"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par171">THP-1 cell was incubated with PMA for 48 hours to differentiate into M0. M0 were co-cultured with MSC for 30 hours. Conditioned medium (CM) was collected to evaluate M1- and M2-type macrophage related cytokine while total RNA was extracted from co-cultured cells and then synthesised into cDNA to determine IRF-4 and IRF-5 mRNA gene expression using RT- PCR. Finally, MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured with CM of respective treatments for 24, 48 and 72 h to evaluate their cell viability using MTT assay.</p><p id="Par172"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par173">Results showed that UC-MSC significantly increased IRF-4 expression in M0 and M0+LPS compared to M0 alone but no effect on IRF-5. In addition, UC-MSC did not influence the secretion of IL-10 and TNF-α in the supernatant of M0 and M0+LPS. Moreover, CM from M0, M0+UC-MSC, M0+LPS and M0+LPS+UC-MSC significantly reduced the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells at 72 h compared with 24 h treatment respectively. The results indicated that UC-MSC induced the polarisation of M0 into M2-type phenotype as IRF-4 regulates M2-type macrophage polarisation. M0 secretory products suppressed ER- breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) as observed in a previous study (3). UC-MSC and LPS may also stimulate the M0 to secrete a secretome that contains anti-cancer properties that hinders the proliferation of triple negative BC cells. This finding is consistent with a prior study that showed umbilical cord matrix derived MSC-CM inhibited the cell viability of BC cells.</p><p id="Par174"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par175">Our findings demonstrate that UC-MSC may polarise naïve  macrophages into M2-type macrophages.

Natural compounds including bee-collected pollen contain nutrient antioxidants that have therapeutic properties and protective effects against ROS. Bee pollen is known as a complete food since the food energy produced is relatively high, thus it serves as a source of nutrients for adult bees and larvae [1]. Studies demonstrated that 70% of bee pollen compositions are biologically active and exhibit numerous benefits including nutrition, cardioprotection, hepatoprotection, immunostimulant, antioxidation, anticarcinogen, antibacterial, antiosteoporosis, antiprostatitis, anti-anaemia, anti-ageing, and anti-inflammatory [2, 3].

Despite substantial breakthroughs in diagnostic services and patient care, various gaps remain to be filled, ranging from early detection to the identification of prognostic indicators, effective therapy for metastatic illness, and the implementation of personalised treatment methods. MicroRNAs, which are small non-coding RNAs, are unregulated in CRC and play an important role in its onset and progression. Despite this, microRNA research has traditionally relied on expression levels to assess biological importance [1]. The precise mechanism underlying microRNA dysregulation in cancer has yet to be determined, however multiple studies have shown that epigenetic mechanisms, notably DNA methylation, play essential roles in the regulation of microRNA production. Thus, we intend to investigate the miRNA methylome patterns and explore their roles CRC.</p><p id="Par213"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par214">Fifty-four pairs (n=108) of CRC and the respective adjacent normal tissues were collected from the UKM Medical Center, Malaysia. Methylation profiling was performed using the Infinium Human Methylation 450K beadchip, which covers 485,577 CpG dinucleotide sites distributed over the whole genome. The raw IDAT files were exported from the scanner, and quality control was performed using Genome Studio and were further analysed using the ChAMP R package.</p><p id="Par215"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par216">We obtained 933 miRNA probes for the downstream analysis. These probes were further classified as hypermethylated or hypomethylated based on the absolute average β value difference (Δβ) at ≥0.2 between CRC and normal adjacent tissues. A total of 230 probes were identified. Distribution of hypomethylated miRNAs with respect to genomic regions revealed more than half of the miRNA probes were located in the TSS1500 (n = 130; 58%), followed by TSS200 (n=55; 24%) and body (n=40; 18%). On the other hand, the distribution of hypermethylated miRNA probes is almost equal in TSS200 (n=3; 60%) and TSS1500 (n=2; 40%). Meanwhile, categorization based on CpG islands (CGIs), 225 probes were hypomethylated and five probes were hypermethylated. The five hypermethylated miRNA probes were MIR1180_cg24553547, MIR124-3_cg02650317, MIR34B_cg22879515, MIR124-3_cg15699267 and MIR137_cg22333214. Among these, MIR1180_cg24553547 showed the most significant differentially hypermethylated delta β-value. Although atypical methylation status has been documented in tumour samples, the methylation profile of miR-1180, which is located on chromosome 17, has yet to be thoroughly explained in CRC. Prior research demonstrated a good association between hypermethylation of the miR-1180 gene and downregulation of its expression in tumour tissue when looking at its expression level in malignancies. Unlike other miRNAs, miR-1180 functions as both an oncogene and a tumour suppressor. Tan et al. [2] and Zhou et al. [3] previously demonstrated the carcinogenic activity of this miRNA in hepatocellular carcinoma by directly targeting both OTUD7B and TNIP2 to drive cell proliferation and apoptosis resistance.</p><p id="Par217"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par218">Our findings imply the existence of new pathways involving methylation alterations impacting miRNA genes that control CRC development.

Crosstalk between cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and cancer cells facilitated by growth factors drives the malignant progression. CAFs can be identified using conventional markers such as alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) although their expression can be heterogenous. Leucine Rich Repeat Containing 17 (LRRC17) is proposed to be an emerging biomarker to specifically identify activated fibroblasts and CAFs. This study was aimed to verify LRRC17 expression in different colonic fibroblasts and further characterize LRRC17 in CRC. This may provide insights on the underlying mechanisms and verify its potential as a specific marker for future prognostic purposes [2].</p><p id="Par227"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par228">LRRC17 and α-SMA expressions were analyzed using immunofluorescence staining on CCD-112CoN (MF cell line) and primary fibroblast lines derived from colorectal tumor and normal adjacent colon tissues (denoted as normal fibroblasts). SW620 (CRC epithelial cell line) was used as control. The cells were cultured under different conditions; a) serum-free medium (DMEM alone), b) DMEM + 10% fetal bovine serum (complete medium), c) conditioned medium (CM) of SW620, and d) DMEM + transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1). Fluorescence intensity was assessed via ImageJ 1.53k. Treated cells proliferation was assessed via MTT assay. All experiments were conducted in duplicates.</p><p id="Par229"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par230">Positive LRRC17 and α-SMA expressions were observed in all fibroblast groups and CCD-112CoN except SW620. However, different co-localization patterns were shown between the proteins in treated cells. Both proteins expression was greater in complete medium and TGF-β1 as compared to serum free group, indicating more activated state of treated fibroblasts mimicking CAF property. Interestingly, higher LRCC17 expression whereas lower α-SMA expression in CM SW620 for primary cell lines. This may highlight the cancer secretome effects which trans-differentiate fibroblasts or change their molecular property.

Curcumin is a bioactive compound derived from the rhizomes of <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> known to possess various pharmacological properties e.g., inhibiting cancer growth, exerting cytotoxic and inducing apoptosis [1]. Nonetheless, curcumin has some limitations that prevent it from reaching its full potential. Due to poor bioavailability, 2,6-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzylidene)cyclohexanone (BHMC), a curcuminoid analogue was synthesised via chemical structure modification by eliminating the unstable β-diketone moiety and converting it into a conjugated double bond while retaining the phenolic hydroxyl group to overcome the limitation by exerting greater cytotoxic, growth suppressive effects with more selective on cancer cells [2]. Therefore, it would be beneficial to look at the cytotoxicity along with the anti-proliferation and -migration effect of BHMC on HepG2 cells.</p><p id="Par275"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par276">The HepG2 and Hs27 cells were treated with various concentrations ranging from 0.781-50μM for 24 and 48hrs via MTT assay.

Data were analysed using GraphPad Prism software.</p><p id="Par277"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par278">BHMC was observed to be approximately 3-5 times more toxic to HepG2 compared to curcumin with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 16.73μM and 46.03μM at 24hrs while 4.77μM and 26.00μM at 48 hrs, respectively. However, BHMC was less toxic towards Hs27 cells with the IC<sub>50</sub> value of more than 30μM at 24 and 48 hrs. BHMC significantly reduced HepG2 by 30-60% at 24hrs and 70-80% after 48hrs at lower concentration than curcumin. In contrast, BHMC only reduced 20-30% of Hs27 at 24hrs and 40-60% at 48hrs. Curcumin reduced 40-60% of HepG2 for 24 and 48 hrs but only reduced 30% of Hs27 cells at similar concentrations and timepoint. Although BHMC and curcumin reduced the percentage of HepG2 cell viability in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, the anti-proliferative effect exerted by BHMC was greater compared to curcumin. BHMC also showed a cytotoxic selective effect on Hs27 especially at 48 hrs with less cell death at lower concentrations compared to HepG2. It is suggested that BHMC was cytotoxic selective towards Hs27 like its parental compound, curcumin. BHMC and curcumin suppress the migration of HepG2 as compared to controls. However, below the IC<sub>50</sub> value, BHMC exhibits a higher effect in suppressing HepG2 cell migration compared to curcumin. At lower concentrations, characteristics of apoptosis can be observed including cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation and apoptotic bodies.</p><p id="Par279"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par280">BHMC mediates a greater cytotoxic effect in HepG2 by reducing the cell viability, modulating a higher percentage of cell death at lower concentrations compared to curcumin, suppressing migration, and inducing apoptosis compared to Hs27 while cytotoxic selective towards Hs27 cells at similar concentrations.</p><p id="Par281"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par282">[1] Shanmugam, M.

By altering the expressions of tumour-promoting and tumour-suppressing targets, miRNAs could act as tumour-modulatory miRNAs in different human cancer. The preliminary findings from our previous work suggested that miR-3934 may be responsible in promoting tumour growth and migration in human breast cancer cell lines [1]. Therefore, this mechanistic study aimed to elucidate the tumour-regulatory role of miR-3934 in human breast cancer cells using <italic>in vitro</italic> cellular assays.</p><p id="Par288"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par289">Triple-negative human breast cancer cell, MDA-MB-231, was stably transfected with miRNA expression plasmids to produce clones that overexpressed miR-3934 mimic, miR-3934 inhibitor, or their respective scrambled control sequences.

Besides, miR-3934 also enhanced (p&lt;0.05) the invasion and migration abilities of the MDA-MB-231 cell line as compared to un-transfected control and clones that expressed scrambled control sequences. In contrast to clones that overexpressed miR-3934, clones that overexpressed miR-3934 inhibitor were shown (p&lt;0.05) to have lower proliferation rate, higher sensitivity to killing by cisplatin, and have decreased invasion and migration abilities <italic>in vitro</italic> as compared to all other cell groups. There were no statistically significant differences in the cell proliferation, chemosensitivity to cisplatin, invasion, and migration rates between the untransfected control and clones that expressed the scrambled control sequence. The tumour-promoting role of miR-3934 observed in the current study is consistent with the findings observed in two other miR-3934 studies that involved lung cancer [2] and neuroblastoma [3], in which miR-3934 was reported to downregulate the expression of tumour suppressor protein such as TP53INP1 [2,3]. However, to date, the tumour-modulatory role and downstream target of miR-3934 in breast cancer are still unclear and under-reported. The current study findings suggested that miR-3934 has the potential to be utilised as a prognostic breast cancer biomarker and the introduction of a miR-3934 inhibitor may potentially inhibit breast cancer development.

Persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) contributes to the carcinogenesis of cervical cancer, in which 70% of all cervical cancer cases are linked to HPV 16 and 18. The available HPV vaccines effectively prevent cervical cancer but do not treat existing cervical cancer. Besides, cervical malignancy detection at early phases remains a challenge. Consequently, treatment begins at the late stages of the disease. Hence, new diagnostics and therapeutics methods are required to treat cervical cancer. In this study, a novel antibody class, known as T cell receptor (TCR)-like antibodies, specific to HPV 16 and 18 E7 oncopeptides, has been hypothesised to enhance cervical cancer diagnostic potentials. The dual functionality of the antibody in mimicking the function of T cell receptor (internal immunosurveillance) and simultaneously executes its antibody effector mechanisms to eliminate a disease effectively opens a new and promising pathway to target cervical cancer.</p><p id="Par303"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par304">Bioinformatics were used to select the target peptides specific to HLA-A2 of HPV 16 and 18 E7.

A domain antibody library was used to select potential TCR-like antibodies specific to HPV 16 and 18 E7 pMHC by biopanning. Three rounds of biopanning were performed to get highly enriched antibody phages. Antibody phages from round three polyclonal panning were selected for monoclonal analysis because they have highest enrichment. For HPV 16 E7, 20 out of 92 clones were selected for monoclonal analysis and finally 9 clones were sent for sequencing. Meanwhile, for HPV 18 E7, 44 out of 92 clones were selected for monoclonal analysis and finally 17 clones were sent for sequencing. It was difficult to generate a novel group of TCR-like antibody until latest development in technologies like phage display techniques made it possible. The coat protein of a bacteriophage is fused with a protein/peptide and presented on a virion’s surface in phage display technique. Antibody phage display technology has emerged as a famous approach for production of antibodies against various targets including cancer. TCR-like antibody is development based on distinctive roles of T (T cell receptor) and B cells (antibody). Generally, T cell receptor recognises the antigenic peptide presented by MHC complex on all nucleated cell while antibodies generated by B cells can differentiate soluble or membrane bounded antigens which will result in the elimination of illness due to its wider effector functions. Hence, dual functionality of TCR-like antibody in combining both humoral and cell mediated immunity in a single approach makes it an appropriate candidate for cervical cancer diagnosis.</p><p id="Par308"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par309">Two out of 9 clones and 7 out of 17 clones for HPV 16 E7 and HPV 18 E7, respectively had proper sequence which were analysed by VBASE2 and IMGT/V databases.

The refolded pMHC complex was subjected to three rounds of biopanning against antibody phage display library for selection. Phages from the third round of biopanning were selected for both HPV 16 E7 and HPV 18 E7based on the polyclonal ELISA results as they showed the highest enrichment compared to the first and second rounds. 94 single colonies for each HPV 16 E7 and 18 E7 were randomly selected from the phages’ titration for monoclonal biopanning. 10 out of 94 potential monoclones for HPV 16 E7 and 37 out of 94 potential monoclones for HPV 18 E7 were subjected to comparative biopanning based on the monoclonal ELISA results with a value after normalization of ≥0.3. A total of seven out of 10 potential monoclones for HPV 16 and 26 out of 37 potential monoclones for HPV 18 were sent for sequencing based on the monoclonal ELISA results with a value after normalization of ≥0.2. TCR-like antibodies are based on the distinct roles of T cell receptors that are involved in immunosurveillance and direct killing, and the B cell is involved in antibody production. TCR-like antibodies function by differentiating the antigenic peptide which is presented on the MHC molecules and establishing primary defence mechanisms of the antibody. Therefore, the duality of TCR-like antibodies’ function makes it a great candidate for cervical cancer diagnosis.</p><p id="Par318"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par319">In conclusion, one out of seven clones for HPV 16 and three out of 26 clones for HPV 18, respectively had proper sequences. In the downstream process, the proteins of the positive clones will be expressed and purified. Later, the purified protein will be evaluated for its binding capabilities using Western blot and ELISA. Finally, the antibodies will be evaluated on the cervical cancer cell lines.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec97"><title>O-29 High throughput molecular profiling of bacterial diversity in Johor mangroves</title><sec id="Sec98"><title>Roshan Mascarenhas<sup>1</sup>, Oh Bi Han<sup>1</sup>, Ng Xin Yan<sup>1</sup>, Dominic Kay<sup>1</sup>, Kwa Yee Chu<sup>1</sup>, Pang Kok Lun<sup>1</sup>, James Sy-Keen Woon<sup>1</sup>, Nadine Nograles<sup>1</sup> and Mahibub Mahamadsa Kanakal<sup>2</sup></title><sec id="Sec99"><title><sup>1</sup>Biomedical Sciences, Newcastle University Medicine Malaysia (NUMed), Johor Bahru, Malaysia; <sup>2</sup>Faculty of Pharmacy, University College MAIWP International, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</title><sec id="Sec100"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Roshan Mascarenhas (roshan.mascarenhas@newcastle.edu.my)</title><p id="Par320">From The International Conference on Molecular Diagnostics &amp; Biomarker Discovery 2022 (MDBD 2022)</p><p id="Par321">Penang, Malaysia. 11 – 13 October 2022</p><p id="Par322"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par323">Biomedical research heavily relies on the discoveries of natural compounds and thus it is very important to safeguard nature to build resilience in biomedical research. Mangrove is the coastal ecosystem that has proven to harbour several beneficial microbial communities with a wide range of therapeutic molecules such as antimicrobial agents, anticancer compounds and enzymes. Mangrove provides habitat for several organisms including bacteria that are adapted to the microclimate with high salinity and tidal variation [1]. Some of these bacteria include actinobacteria which form the major source of antibiotics. It is important to identify and discover new antibiotics as there is an increasing threat of resistance to currently available antibiotics and limited discovery of new antibiotics [2]. Mangrove biodiversity in rapidly developing parts of the globe is severely threatened due to the destruction of habitat and thus there is a high threat to the bacterial community. One of the major hurdles in studying mangrove soil bacteria is that it is tedious to culture them and hence difficult to get a complete profile of bacterial diversity by conventional methods. Thus, it is important to adopt high throughput molecular techniques to rapidly identify bacteria to accelerate conservation efforts [3].</p><p id="Par324"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par325">DNA was isolated from mangrove soils sediments from eight mangrove sites around Johor, Malaysia that are grouped based on their vulnerability status. The library was prepared using the multiplexing method with 24 barcodes to distinguish samples and sequenced for the 16S gene using Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION sequencing. Base-calling of sequencing reads was performed by the Guppy programme and analysed using EPI2ME software. Quantitative PCR was performed to verify linear amplification.</p><p id="Par326"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par327">We have successfully sequenced the bacterial 16S gene in mangrove soil samples from Pulau Kukup, Sungai Pulai, Sungai Melayu, Sungai Danga, Sungai Skudai, Sungai Johor, Sungai Sedili Besar and Sungai Sedili Kechil. We show that the barcoding would enable parallel sequencing of samples from all sites in the same run and amplicons showed linear amplification. We achieved over 6 million high-quality reads per run in less than 24 hours. We report a widespread difference in bacterial diversity between protected mangroves compared to mangroves that have been exposed to anthropogenic activities. This is the first study to show the bacterial community profile of Johor mangroves.</p><p id="Par328"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par329">MinION sequencing is a quick and efficient way to evaluate bacterial diversity in environmental samples.

The report also highlighted TB as the leading cause of mortality by single infectious agent. Ten percent of Latent TB Infection (LTBI) will develop into active infection. Existing diagnostic methods e.g. Tuberculin Skin Test and are not accurate. Newer technique i.e. Interferon Gamma Release Assay is expensive, thus hardly affordable especially in low to middle income countries with high TB incident rate. Currently, there are lack of cheap, sensitive, and specific diagnostic methods to diagnose individuals with LTBI and the current BCG vaccine has limited coverage against adult TB infection.</p><p id="Par339"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par340">Reversed vaccinology technique was applied to shortlist potential <italic>Mtb</italic> T-cell epitopes (TCEs) for diagnosis and vaccine candidates.

It was hypothesized that the clonal replacement occurred due to faster growth rate of ST22-IV [1]. To confirm this, we studied and compared the competitive fitness of representative strains from the two clones, ST239-III and ST22-IV isolated from HCTM via broth co-culture and desiccation experiments.</p><p id="Par352"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par353">The strains used in this study were M57/2005 and M222/2009 (both ST239-III), M181/2017 and M080/2017 (both ST22-IV). Chloramphenicol (20ug/ml) susceptibility was used to differentiate the STs of tested strains; ST239 strains were resistant, ST22-IV strains were susceptible. In broth co-culture experiments, pairs of tested strains from different STs were cultured together for 48 hours in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth and platted on drug-free and chloramphenicol-supplemented BHI agar.

On the other hand, ST22-IV produced a higher number of surviving colonies on desiccation assays (29, 5-58) compared to ST239-III (2.5, 0-5) at 10<sup>-6</sup> serial dilution. While ST239-III outcompeted ST22-IV in all tested pairs for the broth co-culture studies, the latter clone had better tolerance to desiccation.

The current treatment options for PD are only symptom-targeted, while an effective therapeutic strategy remains a challenge. The study aimed to identify potent anti-PD drugs with inhibitory potentials against POP using ligand-based receptor modelling, Glide XP docking, molecular dynamics and pk-CSM pharmacokinetics ADMETprediction parameters. Results indicated that the ligand-based (LB) model generated pharmacophore with 6 features, having 1 hydrophobic, 1 positive ionizable group, 2 aromatic rings, and 2 hydrogen bond acceptors. A total of 23 hits with a Gunner-Henry (GH) score of 0.7 and enrichment factor (EF) of 30.24 were obtained as validation protocols, making it an ideal model. The LB model retrieved 177 hit compounds from 69,543 natural Interbioscreen databases virtually. Interestingly, ligands 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 demonstrated higher binding affinity to the enzyme with Glide XP docking of -9.004, -8.818, -8.749, -8.708, -8.707 kcal/mol than GSK552 and ZPP with -8.187, and -6.835 respectively. Similarly, their binding free energies were -48.424, -51.879, -51.684, -45.191, and -49.567 kcal/mol respectively. Molecular dynamics indicated that the ligands 1, 2, &amp; 4 demonstrated better stability than GSK552. Pharmacokinetic profiles of the ligands indicated their druggability and low toxicity profile. The ligands are recommended as adjuvant /single candidates as ant-PD candidates for translational study.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec113"><title>O-34 Inhibitory effects of andrographolide in PC-3 cell line and the induction of apoptosis via the involvement of caspases activity</title><sec id="Sec114"><title>Janany Manimaran and Daruliza Kernain Mohd Azman</title><sec id="Sec115"><title>Institute for Research in Molecular Medicine (INFORMM), Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang, Malaysia</title><sec id="Sec116"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Daruliza Kernain Mohd Azman (daruliza@usm.my)</title><p id="Par365">From The International Conference on Molecular Diagnostics &amp; Biomarker Discovery 2022 (MDBD 2022)</p><p id="Par366">Penang, Malaysia. 11 – 13 October 2022</p><p id="Par367"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par368">Andrographolide is a labdane diterpenoid isolated from the plant <italic>Andrographis paniculata</italic>. This substance has numerous medicinal uses, notably anticancer effects. A previous study has revealed that andrographolide inhibits the growth of lung, brain, colon, and breast cancer cells [1]. Due to a lack of research, however, it is thought that the knowledge of andrographolide’s anti-cancer effects on prostate cancer cells is relatively poor. In the current study, andrographolide was assessed on PC-3 cells, an aggressive androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line.</p><p id="Par369"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par370">Cytotoxicity analysis is vital in drug discovery research for assessing the biocompatibility of the drug being used on cancer cells. This work used the WST-1 assay to determine the cell survival of PC-3 cancer cells and Hs27 normal cells exposed to varying doses of andrographolide (0-200 μM). Metastasis is essential for the disease to progress; hence, the scratch assay and the transwell invasion assay were used to test andrographolide on PC-3 cells. In order to study the cell death mechanism after the PC-3 cells are treated with andrographolide, DNA damage and apoptosis assay have been done. Finally, the caspase-mediated pathway is analysed by carrying out caspase 3, 8 and 9 assays upon the treatment of andrographolide.</p><p id="Par371"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par372">The results indicate that andrographolide dose-dependently suppresses the viability of PC-3 cells but not Hs27 cells. The NCI considers the LC 50 value of 26.42 μM (after 48 hours of incubation) acceptable. In this study, three different concentrations of andrographolide were used: control, half LC 50, and LC 50 (0, 13.21, and 26.42 μM) in all subsequent analyses. The results showed that andrographolide inhibits both migration and invasion compared to the control. The presence of a comet tail has revealed that a 26.42 μM andrographolide treatment produces the maximum DNA damage to single cells, followed by 13.21 μM and 0 M. In addition, the maximum cell death activity was seen at 26.42 M andrographolide concentration, followed by 13.21 μM and the control. The activity of caspases 3 (executor caspase), 8 (intrinsic pathway), and 9 (extrinsic pathway) in mediating apoptosis increased significantly. The half LC 50 (13.21 μM) demonstrates significantly more activity in these caspases than the LC 50 (26.21 μM), in accordance with the new finding related to the caspase storm scenario [2]. This enables us to identify 13.21 μM as the andrographolide dosage that approaches the ideal range for caspase activity activation.</p><p id="Par373"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par374">The ability of andrographolide to prevent the progression of cancer in PC-3 cancer cells has been proven through the regulation of caspase-mediated apoptosis, suppression of metastasis, and induction of DNA damage.</p><p id="Par375"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par376">[1] Mishra, S.

NK cell functions are dictated by the myriad of receptors, regulating both activating and inhibitory signals. Studies found that through interactions with the CD16 receptor alone, NK cells can be activated for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) to occur. The ADCC mechanism can be used to home NK cell killing towards designated targets through detection by target-specific antibodies. Unfortunately, NK cell studies are hampered by the tedious sourcing of primary NK cells. NK cell lines such as NK-92 and NK-92MI are now available but they lack certain features compared to primary cells. Furthermore, NK cells are less susceptible to genetic modifications such as electroporation and viral-based methods. Recently, lentiviral vectors were successfully used in the clinical setting for cell modifications. In this study, we used a third-generation lentiviral vector, termed RRL-lentivirus, to modify the NK-92MI cells for surface expression of CD16 receptors and possibly restore their ability for ADCC.</p><p id="Par382"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par383">High binding affinity 158V-CD16 and GFP gene sequences were molecularly cloned into RRL-lentiviral transfer vector. The transfer vector plasmid containing the gene of interest and three types of helper plasmids were simultaneously transfected into HEK-293T packaging cells by calcium phosphate transfection. After 48 hours, the supernatant containing the lentiviral particles was collected and filtered through a 0.45um CA filter. This was then concentrated using PEG-6000 precipitation method and stored in serum-free media at -80°C. Using K-562 cells as positive controls, NK-92MI cells were transduced using GFP-RRL lentivirus or CD16-RRL lentivirus. Transduction replicates were done with or without the addition of polybrene polycation. The expression of reporter GFP was monitored using fluorescence microscopy, and the levels of transgene expressions were further validated through flow cytometry using FITC-conjugated anti-human CD16 antibodies.</p><p id="Par384"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par385">After GFP-lentivirus transduction was performed, the control K-562 samples showed GFP fluorescence on day 3, while the NK-92MI samples displayed GFP on day 5. The difference between the samples transduced with and without polybrene was compared through flow cytometry. At MOI of 1, GFP-transduced K-562 cells resulted in a GFP-positive population of 95.6% without polybrene and this improved to 99.5% when polybrene was added. At the same MOI, CD16-transduced K-562 did not result in the formation of two distinct CD16 populations. However, all transduced samples showed a significant positive shift in the detected FITC compared to negative controls. At the MOI of 10, GFP-transduced NK-92MI cells resulted in GFP-positive population of 3.5% without polybrene, and the population increased to 7.2% with polybrene added. CD16-transduced NK-92MI cells resulted in a CD16-positive population at 1.0%, while the addition of polybrene increased this expression to 3.1%.</p><p id="Par386"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par387">This study demonstrated the feasibility of using a third generation RRL-lentiviral vector for NK-92MI cell transduction, but further optimisations will be required before <italic>in vitro</italic> assays such as natural cytotoxicity and ADCC assays can be performed using these modified cells.</p><p id="Par388"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par389">[1] Chan, L., Hardwick, N., Darling, D., Galea-Lauri, J., Gäken, J., Devereux, S., ... &amp; Farzaneh, F.

Immunoinformatics approach is gaining traction in vaccine development due to significant time and cost reduction in immunogenicity studies and improved reliability [2]. Viral genome can be analysed for the mapping of potential T-cell and B-cell epitopes. Structural proteins, particularly spike protein (S) have been studied extensively as promising vaccine candidates. One rationale is that the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 attaches to the ACE2 receptor on the host cells to initiate infection. Taken together, a vaccine that offers protection over a wide spectrum of coronaviruses is crucially demanded.</p><p id="Par396"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par397">The sequences of S proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were retrieved from the NCBI database. Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was performed to identify the conserved regions among S proteins from different human coronaviruses. All conserved regions were analysed for the antigenicity through VaxiJen. The conserved regions that passed the threshold value of 0.5 were then analysed for T-cell and B-cell epitope predictions using NetMHCpan EL4.1, IEDB recommended 2.22 and BepiPred 2.0, respectively. The antigenic conserved regions were also used to construct 3D model using SWISS-MODEL followed by structural refinement using GalaxyRefine2. All refined models were validated using ERRAT and PROCHECK. Lastly, the docking of 3D models against TLR-3 was performed via PatchDock and FireDock.</p><p id="Par398"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par399">Based on the MSA result, S protein contains 12 conserved regions, which were then subjected to further analyses. Altogether 9 conserved regions were above the antigenicity threshold value and therefore selected. In terms of epitope prediction, the antigenic conserved regions were predicted to contain a total of 69 MHC Class-I epitopes, 45 MHC Class-II epitopes and 5 linear B-cell epitopes. Furthermore, all antigenic conserved regions were sent for 3D model building followed by structural refinement. The best refined model for each conserved region was chosen based on the Galaxy energy. These refined models were validated and the results showed that the models were of good quality. Following that, the refined model for each conserved region was docked against TLR-3. The global energies of complexes formed between the conserved regions and TLR-3 fell within the range of -11.74 to -7.36 kcal/mol. This implies that the conserved regions have good binding affinities with TLR-3.</p><p id="Par400"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par401">The identified conserved regions of S protein were predicted to have a significant number of epitopes and showed promising docking results. This study provides some insights about the interaction of conserved S peptides with TLR-3, contributing to the vaccine design. Still, further analyses such as molecular dynamics and immune simulation are required to polish the results. <italic>In vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> validation are also essential to evaluate the immunological roles of designed universal coronavirus vaccine.</p><p id="Par402"><bold>Acknowledgement:</bold> We would like to thank the funding sponsored by Ministry of Higher Education for Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) with Project Code: FRGS/1/2022/SKK0/USM/02/5, and FRGS/1/2021/SKK06/USM/02/12 to complete this work.</p><p id="Par403"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par404">[1] X.

The conventional GBM treatment faces a problem due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the post-treatment effect. Then, andrographolide has attracted many researchers because it can cross the BBB and easily distribute it into different brain regions [1]. Next, targeted therapy also is one of the treatments that can reduce the post-treatment effect because it can specifically target cancer cells without affecting normal cells. Recently, the small molecule targeted therapy by exploring on the molecular targets of oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes such as c-Myc and p53 in regulating the apoptosis signaling pathway still remains debatable [2]. Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate the mechanism action of andrographolide towards c-Myc/p53 induced apoptosis in DBTRG-05MG cell line.</p><p id="Par410"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par411">The cytotoxic effect of andrographolide was assessed by WST-1 assay in DBTRG-05MG and SVGp12 cell lines. Both cell lines were treated for 24, 48, and 72 hours with varying concentrations of andrographolide (0.781 – 200 μM). The WST-1 reagent was added to each well. Then, plates were incubated, and the absorbance (Abs.) was measured with an ELISA reader (Multiscan Spectrum) at wavelength 450 nm and the reference reading of 630 nm. The LC<sub>50</sub> values were computed and will be further used as active doses and time in the subsequent experiments. Next, the apoptosis assay was assessed using annexin V-FITC / PI double staining. Cells pellet of DBTRG-05MG were collected after treatment with andrographolide and resuspended with V-FITC, and PI staining. The cells were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 minutes before analyzing the stained cells using a BD FACS CantoTM Flow Cytometer. The gene and protein expression level c-Myc and p53 signaling pathway were then assessed using qRT-PCR and western blot. The protein-protein interaction between c-Myc and p53 was determined by a reciprocal experiment of the co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) using DBTRG-05MG total cell lysate.</p><p id="Par412"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par413">Andrographolide has significantly reduced the viability of DBTRG-05MG cell lines in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The recorded LC<sub>50</sub> values for DBTRG-05MG cell lines for 24, 48 and 72 hours of treatment were 42.82 μM, 27.21 μM and 13.93 μM, respectively. While in the non-cancerous cell line, SVGp12 cannot be determined because the percentage cell viability for the normal cell remained ~80% after being treated with the highest concentration (200 μM) of andrographolide for 24h results. Andrographolide also induced apoptosis in the DBTRG-05MG cell line, by inducing c-Myc and p53 expression at the gene and protein level. The percentage of apoptotic cells in control cells was 0.01%, and after the cell lines were exposed to 13.95 μM and 27.9 μM of andrographolide for 72 hours, the percentage of the apoptotic cell increased to 5.2% and 16.5%, respectively. Western blot results demonstrated that c-Myc overexpression also increased the production of the anti-apoptotic protein p53. Our findings revealed that c-Myc and p53 positively interact in triggering the apoptotic signaling pathway when the lane immunoprecipitated (IP) result for p53 and probed with anti-c-Myc in western blot analysis, which showed the presence of the band for c-Myc protein (62kDA).</p><p id="Par414"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par415">This study successfully discovered the involvement of c-Myc and p53 in the inhibition of DBTRG-05MG cell line via apoptosis following andrographolide treatment.

They possess a unique vesicular structure and can be derived from natural and synthetic substances. Liposomes can mimic the biological membrane of drugs, thus extending the half-life and minimizing the toxicity levels while delivering them to the target organs. The adjuvant mechanism of liposomes has been intimately associated with the stimulation of desired immune responses upon the exposure of antigen and immune cell targeting. This current study mainly targets to investigate the uptake and activation of human dendritic cells (DCs) by liposomes derived from the total lipid of <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis.</italic></p><p id="Par424"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par425">Liposomes derived from <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> were synthesized and characterized using Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN stain) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Fresh whole blood has been collected from three distinctive groups: TST-negative individuals, TST-positive individuals, and active pulmonary TB patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were separated by Lymphoprep density centrifugation and cultured with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and liposomes. The activation of DCs by <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> liposomes has been analyzed through the expression level of DCs surface markers (HLA-DR, CD11c, CD123, CD86) in flow cytometry and the secretion of cytokines (IL-4, IL12p70, and IFN-γ) via ELISA.</p><p id="Par426"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par427">The characterization of liposomes under FESEM demonstrated a size ranging from 20 nm<sup>-135</sup> nm with spherical structures.

However, the interaction of DCs from active pulmonary TB patients with liposomes exhibited an increased level of HLA-DR with low expression of CD86 compared to other groups. IL-12p70 was a highly significant increase in active pulmonary TB group compared to the group of TST-negative and TST-positive individuals. The group of active pulmonary TB patients also showed a significant increase in IL-4 and IFN-γ than the group of TST-positive individuals. Meanwhile, the secretion of all cytokines was the lowest in the group of TST-positive individuals compared to the other groups. These events emphasized the malfunction of DCs in a TB condition and highlighted the capability of liposomes to support the antigen presentation by human DCs in TB infection.</p><p id="Par428"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par429">Liposomes synthesized from <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> had been successfully produced and classified as small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs).

Fungi are also having its great medical and environmental importance. Hence, the precise and rapid identification of fungi species from specimens is important for the field applications, such as, sustainable use and conservation of biodiversity, prevention and control of fungal pathogens, human health and ecological monitoring [1]. DNA barcoding is a great tool for specimen identification that can be used for identifying and recognizing various types of fungi. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of the nuclear ribosomal RNA gene cluster were utilized as a universal DNA barcode marker for fungi specimens which was suggested by Schoch and his team [2]. In this study, we identified 11 randomized fungi specimens by using ITS primers.</p><p id="Par435"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par436">The fungi specimen grown on Petri plates containing PDA medium was obtained from the lab. A small number of mycelia of fungi specimens was picked using sterile forceps from the fully-grown culture and was transferred into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube consisting of 600 μL of sterile distilled water. The mycelia were homogenized by using pipette tips. The mixture was vortexed thoroughly and centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 1 minute. The supernatant was discarded and continued by using the EasyPure Plant Genomic DNA kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions to extract fungi DNA. MyTaq HS Red Mix, 2x, universal ITS primer pairs, extracted fungi DNA sample template and sterile distilled water were used for performing PCR amplification using Agilent SureCycler 8800 with 35 cycles of amplification. The PCR products were undergone electrophoresis to separate DNA. The gel was observed and captured using a Syngene Bioimaging system.

Among the members of FcγRs, FcγRIIA is slowly gaining interest from scientific community due to its different isotype specificities and the significant binding affinity towards IgG2. Current technology has presented the production of recombinant proteins in mammalian cell lines to introduce appropriate protein folding and post-translational modifications [1]. However, the production of recombinant proteins using mammalian expression systems is laborious, time-consuming, and costly [1]. Therefore, this study provided a simple protocol for optimized transient transfection and expression of recombinant IgG binding proteins to achieve a high yield in a short span of time.</p><p id="Par489"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par490">FreeStyle™ 293-F cells in the prewarmed FreeStyle™ 293 Expression Medium were incubated in a 37°C incubator containing a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in air on an orbital shaker platform rotating at 120 rpm. On the day of transfection, the cells were suspended in a volume of prewarmed medium to obtain a concentration of 1.0×10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL. For each mL of transfection volume, 1μg of plasmid DNA and 2μL of 293fectin diluted in Opti-MEM were needed. After adding the DNA/293fectin mixture, the suspension cells were incubated for 96 hours. The cell pellets were harvested by spinning down the cells for 5 mins at 300 ×g and the intracellular protein was harvested by using lysis buffer. After the protein has been purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), the protein was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western Blot analyses for the visual evaluation of expression. The protein concentration was measured by using Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.produced in less than one week. In general, the recombinant proteins with expression levels up to 100 mg/L can be obtained. Since the expression level may differ depending on the nature of the recombinant proteins [2], the transfection method had been refined by varying the incubation time post-transfection, ending up with an ideal harvest time of 96 hours. The harvested protein was purified by using IMAC for downstream analysis. In SDS-PAGE analysis, an intense protein band at approximately 38 kDa had been observed, indicating the expression of the recombinant proteins.

In order to express the recombinant protein in mammalian cell lines efficiently, selection of an appropriate expression vector that carry the interested recombinant gene plays an important role. Polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR), an IgM Fc receptor is chosen to be expressed due to its various clinical potentials such as the possibility to serve as predictive biomarker target owing to its correlation with various cancer malignancies, potential role, and underlying mechanisms in body immunity [1, 2].</p><p id="Par501"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par502">The plasmids that carried <italic>PIGR</italic> gene were purified from the bacterial overnight culture, followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the interested DNA segment.

Chemotherapy drugs are considered as the most reliable and common treatment for cancer. However, these drugs have limitations in terms of effectiveness and severe side effects. In addition, drug resistance is another factor that hinders successful treatment rate among patients. Therefore, finding a lead compound for cancer which addresses these issues are of utmost important. In the constant search for new anticancer agent alternatives, β-carboline has been identified as a good candidate due to its various reported health indications, particularly in anticancer. Therefore, the aims of the study are to investigate the potential of a newly synthesized β-carboline compound in eliciting anticancer activity in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and to determine the apoptosis mechanism induced by the compound.</p><p id="Par517"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par518">β-carboline compound (M25) was synthesized and confirmed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. MTT assay was conducted to evaluate cytotoxicity effect of M25 against CML cells (K562 cell line). Toxicity of M25 was determined by calculating its selectivity index (SI), through human fibroblasts (Hs27 cell line) and mouse fibroblasts (BALB/c3T3). Mode of cell death induced by M25 was further evaluated through the apoptosis assay using flow cytometry analysis with Annexin V-FITC and Propidium iodide (PI). Lastly, <italic>in silico</italic> analysis was conducted to study the binding affinity between M25 and identified proteins involved in the apoptosis pathway using Discovery Studio software.</p><p id="Par519"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par520">β-carboline compound M25 was synthesised with high purity and high yield. M25 induced cytotoxicity in K562 cell line with a low IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.8 μM. This indicated high potency of M25 in killing human CML cells. Based on IC<sub>50</sub> values for non-cancer cells Hs27 and BALB/c3T3, the calculated SI were 16 and 25 respectively. The high selectivity showed that M25 is highly specific in killing CML cells, thus reflecting good safety profile for the compound. Flow cytometric analysis also showed that significant number cell death induced by M25 compound was due to apoptosis. In understanding proteins involved in the apoptosis pathway, molecular docking study investigated the binding affinity of M25 as ligand with apoptosis-related proteins such as apoptosis inducing factor (AIF), endonucleases G (Endo G), caspase 3 (CAS 3), caspase 9 (CAS 9) and caspase 8 (CAS 8). Interestingly, the highest binding affinity was recorded for AIF and Endo G, which suggested a unique caspase-independent pathway of apoptosis.</p><p id="Par521"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par522">The newly synthesized M25 has excellent potential as an anti-leukemic agent as it has shown high cytotoxicity activity and selectivity for K562, thus indicating good effectiveness and safety profile.

Besides that, POSTN also plays a role in stimulating eosinophil migration and activation in chronic inflammation and immune pathways. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with nasal polyp (NP) (CRSwNP) is mediated by Th2-/eosinophilic inflammation type of immune response [1]. POSTN has been proposed to be found in NP tissues and contribute to formation of NP in CRS patients. In this study, we investigated the POSTN protein expression in NP tissue and then we determined its association with the clinicopathological features of CRSwNP patients.</p><p id="Par554"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par555">Tissue samples were collected from 24 CRSwNP patients and their clinicopathological features such as demographic data (age, gender, race and smoking history), clinical (history of bronchial asthma and/or atopy, SNOT-22 scores, Lund-Kennedy scores, Lund-Mackay scores), haematological (percentage of serum eosinophils and total IgE) and pathological features (tissue eosinophil count, degree of inflammation, mucosal ulceration, squamous metaplasia, and fibrosis) were evaluated.

Our findings of POSTN expressed in all NP tissue staining the area of subepithelial tissue and infiltrating inflammatory cells was consistent with other study [1-2]. POSTN is produced in fibroblasts, endothelial and epithelial cells by interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 stimulation. Fibroblasts is found to be abundant in NP tissue. Tissue eosinophilia (eosinophil count &gt;10 per high power field) is known to be a hallmark for CRSwNP and a predictor for NP recurrence. Ninomiya et al. 2018 found that protein expression associated with severity of CRSwNP but not in our study. Even though we excluded those patients taking steroids which can suppress the periostin production, we should have exclude those who was asthmatic and on any immunomodulator. Lebrikizumab was shown to be effective in controlling exacerbation of asthmatic patients with high POSTN level in their serum [1].

However, almost 30% of UC patients develop resistance to chemotherapy and recurrence within 2 years post- therapy. The understanding of the mechanism of cisplatin resistance in UC patients is scarce. In pulse-shock chemotherapy, cancer cells are subjected to chemodrug treatment in a short period of time.</p><p id="Par579"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par580">In this study, cisplatin-resistant UC model was developed and analysed for morphological and transcriptomic changes. Firstly, cisplatin IC50 dosage of a urothelial cancer cell line, 5637 cells was determined. Cells were then subjected to repeated pulse-shock treatment with the respective IC50 dosage and morphological changes will be recorded. At the end of the repeated treatment cycles, IC50 of the cisplatin-resistant cell was compared to its parental counterpart and transcriptomic changes in drug resistance genes were analysed.</p><p id="Par581"><bold>Results and discussion</bold></p><p id="Par582">When pulse-shock treated for 2 hours, cisplatin IC50 dosage of 5637 cells was 11uM. After sixth treatment cycle, IC50 was significantly increased to 21uM, which was 2 times higher compared to parental cells. During the course of treatment, morphological changes vary from polyploid giant cells, MSC-like cell, parental cells and bizarre shaped cells. ABCA1, ABCG2, Bax and BIRC5 genes were found to be significantly upregulated in cisplatin-resistant 5637 compared to parental cells. Stress induction through pulse-shock cisplatin treatment promotes cancer plasticity through transformation into polyploid giant cells. These polyploid giant cells has been reported to drive cancer progression through activation of EMT, drug resistance, apoptotic inhibition and many more. Molecular mechanism and regulation of polyploid giant cells are not fully understood, hence, an exciting niche awaiting exploration.</p><p id="Par583"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par584">The model has a potential to be used for evaluation of existing and novel targets for recurrent therapeutic regimes, thus making UC management more efficient, convenience and increased patients’ quality of life.</p><p id="Par585"><bold>Acknowledgement:</bold> This study was funded by Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia through Fundamental Research Grant Scheme FRGS/1/2019/SKK15/UITM/03/1, Project ID 15531, RMC file number 600- IRMI/FRGS 5/3 (286/2019).</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec181"><title>O-56 Selection of ssDNA aptamers against Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1)</title><sec id="Sec182"><title>Muhammad Najmi Mohd Nazri, Khairul Mohd Fadzli Mustaffa and Noor Fatmawati Mokhtar</title><sec id="Sec183"><title>Institute for Research in Molecular Medicine (INFORMM), Health Campus, Universiti Sains Malaysia, 16150 Kubang Kerian, Kelantan, Malaysia</title><sec id="Sec184"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Noor Fatmawati Mokhtar (fatmawati@usm.my)</title><p id="Par586">From The International Conference on Molecular Diagnostics &amp; Biomarker Discovery 2022 (MDBD 2022)</p><p id="Par587">Penang, Malaysia. 11 – 13 October 2022</p><p id="Par588"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par589">Recently, serum PDL1 expression has been demonstrated to be a potential biomarker for cancer patient’s treatment response and outcome or can even be used for early cancer detection. The most common biomarker detection approach utilizes antibody-based, but the use of antibody face numbers of drawback. Consequently, another potential alternative to antibody known as aptamers have become increasing popular. Aptamers exhibit characteristic that can overcome the drawbacks of antibody such as lower production cost, minimal batch-to-batch variation, possess better thermal stability and offers variety of chemical modification.

Epigenetic aberrations such as microRNAs (miRNAs) dysregulation are of great significance in the development and malignancy of MM. MiRNAs are short, single stranded non-coding RNAs (~19-25 nucleotides) that play an important role in regulating post-transcriptional expression of target genes.

This disease is the third leading cause of cancer deaths with a 5-year survival rate of 7% [1]. Cancer is the pathogenesis product of DNA damage resulting from multiple factors which among others is oxidative stress. Oxidative stress can be detected by the DNA base damage, through the formation of 8-oxo-7, 8-dihydro-2’deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) [2]. The 8-oxodG acts as oxidative stress indicator and has been essentially specified as a recognized initiator of the carcinogenic process and premutagenic injury in mammalian cells [3]. In this preliminary study, we investigated the possible association of oxidative DNA damage in a form of 8-oxodG in HCC patients in comparison with Malaysian healthy controls. We also analysed the effect of 8-oxodG in different races and gender in both groups.</p><p id="Par616"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par617">DNA of peripheral white blood cells was isolated from 91 HCC patients and 304 controls. The level of oxi dative DNA damage was determined by highly sensitive ELISA kit produced from Japan Institute for Control of Ageing (JaICA), Nikken Foods. Ltd. The determination of oxidative DNA level was digested by Ravanant (1998) and Evans (1999) methods with some modifications. The results were reported as 8-oxodG per 50 μL DNA sample in ng/ml.</p><p id="Par619"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par620">Quantitative measurement of 8-oxodG was higher in HCC patients at mean value of 3.30 ± 2.32 ng/ml. In controls, the average value is 1.57 ± 1.92 ng/ml. There was a significant difference in the average value of 8-oxodG level between the controls and HCC patients where <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001. Comparison between gender showed that there was a significant difference observed in the level of 8-oxodG between male and female in controls (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The level of 8-oxodG was higher in male (1.736 ± 2.033) ng/mL than in female controls (1.087 ± 1.433) ng/mL. From previous studies, it was reported that smoking, alcohol consumption and bad sleeping pattern were the sporadic factors for male tendency to get the oxidative damage [4]. Hepatocarcinogenesis has been reported to be associated with DNA damage through the process of oxidation. Oxidation in turn, leads to the huge amount of transversion from G □ T in tumor genes such as p53 gene [5]. In this study, however, Malays and no-Malays showed no significant difference in their level of 8-oxodG indicating no disparity.</p><p id="Par621"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par622">HCC patients showed greater oxidative damage to DNA as compared to controls. This suggests that oxidative DNA damage may contribute to the pathogenesis of HCC. Since 8-oxodG was higher in males, it is indicating that the males are at a greater risk of developing HCC than the females.</p><p id="Par623"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par624">[1] F. X.

There are two kinds of honey which are monofloral honey and multifloral honey. Monofloral honey is made from a single plant nectar that has been transformed into honey. It includes Acacia, Sidr, and Kelulut honey. Meanwhile, multifloral honeys like Tualang, Manuka, and Kelulut honey are made from a blend of several different plant nectar types found in deep forests or mixed by the beekeeper before being converted into honey [2]. Honey consumption in Malaysia is increasing due to its various nutrient contents that are beneficial to one’s health. Different types of honey contain varying amounts of sucrose, fructose, and glucose, which contribute to the sweetness of honey.</p><p id="Par633"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par634">In this study, pure Tualang, Kelulut, Acacia, Manuka, and Sidr honey samples were used. Optical spectroscopy in the ultraviolet-visible-near infra-red (UV-VIS-NIR) range was used to observe the optical properties of all of the honey, including absorbance and transmission. The wavelength range covered during the measurement was 350 nm to 1662 nm. The Ocean View software was used to capture the spectra of all honey. To improve the accuracy of the results, the spectra was collected 15 times for each honey. The average of the results were plotted, and boxplot analysis was performed for all spectra results.</p><p id="Par635"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par636">The spectra results were taken based on the wavelength of the optical properties, which were absorbance and transmittance. Based on the observed results, the peak absorbance spectra for all honey in both UV-VIS-NIR were similar. Further analyses were done using boxplot analysis to differentiate the characteristics for all type of honey. Sidr honey has the highest mean absorbance value compared to other honeys. The current study found that all Malaysian raw honey met the international standard because the sum of their fructose and glucose contents were less than 60% [3]. But since Manuka and Sidr honey originated outside of Malaysia, it was assumed that both honeys do not adhere to the standard and thus consisted a higher sugar content compared to other honey. According to the Beer Lambert Law equation, increasing the sugar content will increase the number of molecules in the solution, which will increase the absorbance value. Based on previous research, an increasing pattern in absorbance value was highly noticeable as sugar concentration increased. Maximum transmission spectra for all honey in both ranges were close for both UV-VIS and VIS-NIR ranges. From the transmission boxplot analysis, Sidr honey recorded the lowest mean compared to other honeys. As a result, when the concentration of the molecules increased, the transmission value decreased, giving Sidr honey the lowest mean among the others.</p><p id="Par637"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par638">Two optical properties, which are absorbance and transmission, were studied for all of the honey using optical spectroscopy in both the UV-VIS and VIS-NIR ranges.

Sidr honey recorded the highest mean absorbance value compared to other honeys since it has the highest sugar content. According to Beer Lambert’s law, as the concentrations of molecules increase, the absorbance value increases but the transmission value decreases. Therefore, Sidr honey has the lowest transmission mean value compared to other honeys.</p><p id="Par639"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par640">[1] Mărgăoan, Rodica, E. Topal, R. Balkanska, B.

Mitochondrial dynamics is crucial in the regulation of cell cycle, immunity, apoptosis and mitochondrial quality control of various processes such as biogenesis and mitophagy. Defective mitochondrial dynamics due to mutations were reported to be linked with human diseases [1]. For example, patients with energy deficiency are suspected of having primary mitochondrial disorders that can be inherited through defects of either nuclear (autosomal-dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked) or mitochondrial (mtDNA) genes [2]. In this study, we aim to characterize the mitochondrial dynamics of a patient with energy deficient disorder.</p><p id="Par660"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par661">Fibroblasts from a 2-month-old male patient with clinical symptoms of encephalopathy, seizure, cardiomyopathy, severe metabolic acidosis, pulmonary hypertension idiopathic and low level of lactate were cultured and harvested for western blot experiment.

Next, samples were probed antibodies with GTPases of the dynamin superfamily. Antibodies used were Mitofusin 1 (Mfn1), Mfn2, Optic Atrophy 1 (Opa1) and Dynamin-related Protein 1 (Drp1).

Recently, aptamer-based electrochemical biosensors have received a significant attention because of their advantages such as good stability, high sensitivity and selectivity. The immobilization of the aptamer onto the working electrode is very important so that the target recognition by the aptamer can be transduced into a measurable electrical signal [1]. Here, we described the selectivity and storage stability of an aptamer-based electrochemical biosensors for direct detection of 25 (OH) vitamin D<sub>2</sub> on the aptamer-modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes screen-printed carbon electrode (MWCNTs-SPCE).</p><p id="Par675"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par676">Aptamer specific to 25 (OH) vitamin D<sub>2</sub> was immobilized onto the working electrode surface of the MWCNTs-SPCE. The performance of the modified electrodes was observed to determine their selectivity towards 25 (OH) vitamin D<sub>2</sub>. The long-term storage stability of the aptamer-modified MWCNTs-SPCE was investigated by storing the fabricated devices for a period of up to 30 days at 4°C. Electrochemical measurements were carried out using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in a redox probe (0.1 M KCl containing 5.0 mM Fe (CN)<sub>6</sub><sup>3-/4-</sup>).</p><p id="Par677"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par678">The immobilization of the aptamer was determined through the differences of resistance to charge transfer (Rct) values obtained. The Rct values increased when aptamer was immobilized onto the surface of MWCNTs-SPCE compared to the bare MWCNTs-SPCE. The specific reaction between aptamer and 25 (OH) vitamin D<sub>2</sub> causing the Rct value to be decreased. However, there were no changes observed when the assay carried out in the absence of the aptamer. This demonstrates that the signals were due to the specific interaction and not to non-specific adsorptions [2,3]. A good linear response was observed for different 25 (OH) vitamin D<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the range of 0.1 - 30 ng/ml with a detection limit of 0.72 ng/ml. For the long-term storage stability, the aptamer-modified MWCNTs-SPCE showed a consistent response for the first 14 days, then experiences a drop afterwards. Therefore, the aptamer-modified MWCNTs-SPCE was determined to be stable for 14 days at 4°C.</p><p id="Par679"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par680">The aptamer-modified MWCNTs-SPCE was shown to be selective towards 25 (OH) vitamin D<sub>2</sub> and had a reasonable shelf-life of around 2 weeks which can be further improved for a better long-term storage.</p><p id="Par681"><bold>Acknowledgement:</bold> This work was funded by a research grant from the Ministry of Health, Malaysia (NMRR-19-3532-52264).</p><p id="Par682"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par683">[1] Khan N.

The emergence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) (resistance to at least isoniazid or rifampicin) has significantly jeopardized the treatment and control of TB. Isoniazid-resistant TB (Hr-TB) is much more common than rifampicin-resistant TB (RR-TB) [1]. The regulatory mechanism underlying the emergence of Hr-TB remain to be fully elucidated. Small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) regulate bacteria essential functions such as survivability and metabolism, among others. Also, the sRNA has been implicated as one of the caused for development of drug resistance [2]. The present study investigates the expression profile of sRNAs in drug-susceptible TB (DS-TB) and Hr-TB strains using next generation sequencing (NGS) with Illumina HiSeq2500 Deep Sequencing Technology for better understanding of the mechanism of resistance to isoniazid in MTB.</p><p id="Par705"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par706">Three DS-TB (SBH49, SBH149, and SBH372) and three Hr-TB strains (SBH365, SBH438, and SBH509) isolated from pulmonary TB patients were cultured in BD BACTEC<sup>TM</sup> MGIT<sup>TM</sup> (Becton Dickinson, USA) and their drug susceptibility to first-line antibiotics, i.e., streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol were tested with BACTEC<sup>TM</sup> MGIT<sup>TM</sup> 960 SIRE kit (Becton Dickinson, USA). Resazurin microtiter assay (REMA) was performed to determine the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) for isoniazid. Next, RNA from both susceptible and resistant strains were extracted using Masterpure<sup>TM</sup> Complete DNA and RNA purification kit (Lucigen, USA). The integrity of RNA was determined by Agilent RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies, USA). Small RNA libraries preparation was carried out using NEBNext® Small RNA Library Preparation kit (NEB, UK). Samples were sequenced by single-end reads of 50 base pairs generated through Illumina HiSeq 2500<sup>TM</sup> in Rapid Run mode. RNA sequences were trimmed for adapter sequence and low-quality reads were filtered out. The sequences were annotated to reference genome (MTB H37Rv) and differential analysis were carried out with CLC Bio Genomic Workbench (version 8). sRNAs target prediction was performed by using TargetRNA2.</p><p id="Par707"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par708">DS-TB strains were susceptible to all first-line antibiotics, while Hr-TB strains only resistance to isoniazid with MIC of 0.125μg/mL for SBH365, and 2mg/mL for SBH 438 and SBH509. A total of 63,252,209, 63,636,812, and 61,148,224 qualified Illumina reads were obtained from DS-TB strains and 75,296,115, 58,965,389, and 67,935,496 reads from Hr-TB strains.

The purpose of this study is to determine an optimal DNA extraction method for rodent samples by assessing the general bacterial diversity based on PCR products amplified from the partial 16S rDNA gene.

Here, we reported one of the isolated aptamers, Apt15, which potentially binds to the ACE2. The UNAFOLD revealed that this aptamer has a hairpin loop structure and single-stranded region with a Gibbs free energy value of -0.10. The low free energy value indicates that the ssDNA structure is thermodynamically stable [3]. <italic>In silico</italic> 3D molecular docking demonstrated that the single-stranded region of Apt15 binds to the ACE2 at the site recognized by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with a confidence score of 0.9894, thus suggesting the potential application of this aptamer as a therapeutic target for COVID-19 infection.</p><p id="Par752"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par753">In conclusion, one ssDNA aptamer targeting ACE2 with therapeutic potential against COVID-19 was successfully identified in this study. Further investigations are necessary to determine its binding affinity to ACE2 and its ability to block the virus spike protein-ACE2 interaction. In future, this aptamer could serve as a broad-spectrum inhibitor against any existing or future emerging viruses that also use ACE2 for cell entry.</p><p id="Par754"><bold>Acknowledgement:</bold> The work was funded by the Skim Dana Khas (SDK0226-2020) from the Universiti Malaysia Sabah.</p><p id="Par755"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par756">[1] Parums DV.

In exploring better treatment options, immune checkpoint inhibitor studies of PD-1/PD-L1 in endometrial cancer are actively conducted in clinical trials with promising findings in other cancers. However, the efficacy of those immunotherapy remains inconclusive, and guidelines are inconsistent [2]. Therefore, this meta-analysis aims to provide an updated and robust analysis of the effectiveness and safety of PD-1/PDL1 immunotherapy in endometrial cancer on the objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and adverse events.</p><p id="Par773"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par774">A literature search was conducted using the database of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases by using the keywords of “endometrial cancer” OR “PD-1 inhibitor” OR “PD-L1 inhibitor” OR “immunotherapy” OR “immune checkpoint inhibitor” OR “atezolizumab” OR “avelumab” OR “dostarlimab” OR “durvalumab” OR “nivolumab” OR “pembrolizumab”. Meta-analysis of proportion and association was pooled using STATA version17 and RevMan version 5.4 software, respectively. The effect of immunotherapy on outcome parameters was estimated by effect size (ES) or odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each study.</p><p id="Par775"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par776">Five studies between 2017 and 2022 met the inclusion criteria, with 480 endometrial cancer cases undergoing PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy clinical trials. The pooled proportion of ORR undergo PD-1/PDL-1 inhibitor treatment was 26.47% [95% CI = 16.68–37.52]. Subgroup meta-analysis showed the pooled ORR of the proficient mismatch repair (pMMR) group was 8.80% [95% CI = 0.20–24.39], and which was 37.03% [95% CI = 23.22–51.95] of the deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) group. Meta-analysis proportion of DCR undergo PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor treatment was 41.44% [95% CI = 36.38–46.60]. Subgroup meta-analysis showed the pooled proportion DCR of the pMMR group was 24.97% [95% CI = 14.87–36.49] and dMMR group was 45.02% [95% CI = 39.26–50.85]. The efficacy of the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor showed a significantly higher ORR in dMMR than pMMR [OR = 6.30; 95% CI = 3.60–11.03]. Results were the same for DCR, a significantly higher in dMMR than pMMR [OR = 2.57; 95% CI = 1.66–3.99].

However, scientific approval of the mode of action of the CN extract on MCF-7 cell lines at the molecular level is still lacking. High throughput Next-Generation Sequencing technology (NGS) to obtain large sequence numbers that benefit genetic medical research was used in this experiment [1, 2]. Bioinformatics tools such as FastQC and Picard were used to evaluate sequence data for quality control as an essential method during the analytical pipeline [3] that is important to identify challenges of systematic bias challenge in this study. The objective of this study was to evaluate the quality of NGS data sequence using FastQC in the early part of transcriptomic analysis pipelines of antiproliferative effects of dichloromethane CN fractions extracts on human breast cancer cell lines for biomarker discovery.</p><p id="Par788"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par789">Dichloromethane <italic>CN</italic> leaves extract with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) value of 108μg/mL was exposed to the human breast cancer cells, MCF-7 for 72hrs chosen from a previous study. RNA was extracted from the treated and untreated cells for transcriptomic sequence, NGS technology using the Illumina HiSeq4000 platform. The sequencing output was the raw data that must be removed from the adapter sequences by the short read trimmed using FastQC (Babraham Bioinformatics, UK). This analysis uses the Linux operating system, Ubuntu 18.0v and the adapter was removed by a barcode tool, FlexbarFlexbarth its command line and script.

In the summary report of FastQC status, important attention was made based on sequence quality and sequence length distribution. After RNA sequencing using the paired ends modules samples generated GC overall percentage of 54% and a length of 150bp showing no difference in GC composition and no biased library complexity, differences in amplification, or library specific causes. The sequence quality resulted in a pass or good result in the green area and more than 30 phred scores for all samples. As a result, the total overrepresented sequences found in each library make up more than 0.1% of the total that was passed and good quality which does not affect the biological consideration. Overall, the quality of RNA-seq data was high and the sequence quality was also good.</p><p id="Par792"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par793">Multi QC report using FastQC is an advantageous tool because it is relatively quick to generate and provides a clear method for comparing samples to determine consistency and identify problematic samples.

Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that IGF-1 served as a predictive biomarker in EEC survival. Therefore, we postulate the continuous high expression of local IGF-1 protein in EEC cells could lead to poor outcomes. Our findings support that the circulating estrogen and IGF-1 were independently associated with a higher risk of recurrence in patients with stage III and IV of EC (Merritt et al. 2021).

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a Gram-negative bacterial component, is an important sepsis-associated mediator that induces the expression of adhesion molecules such as E-selectin and VCAM-1 upon its binding to dedicated pattern recognition receptors on endothelial cells (EC) [1]. Endothelial E-selectin and VCAM-1 expression promotes leukocyte adhesion, and high leukocyte infiltration in various organs is associated with a poor prognosis in sepsis patients. As the expression of E-selectin and VCAM-1 is partly driven by the activation of the MAPK p38 signaling pathway [2], it is unknown whether Ralimetinib dimesylate (RM), a selective p38 MAPK inhibitor, can be used as a treatment to reduce E-selectin and VCAM-1 expression once LPS-driven activation of EC has started. RM treatment was previously shown to reduce TNF-α production in LPS-induced macrophages <italic>in vitro</italic> [3]. In this study, I investigated the pharmacological effect of RM treatment on E-selectin and VCAM-1 expression in LPS-stimulated HUVEC was investigated.</p><p id="Par816"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par817">Ten μM of RM was added into the HUVEC medium at 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 hours after HUVEC was exposed to 1 μg/ml of LPS. After 2, 4, 5, and 6 hours of LPS exposure, the cells were trypsinized and subjected to flow cytometry analyses. The Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) of E-selectin and VCAM-1- conjugated fluorochromes were determined in the treatment groups and statistically compared to LPS-stimulated HUVEC controls using one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni post-hoc test. Each group was represented by three biological replicates. The results were reported as mean + SD. Viability of HUVEC was monitored microscopically.</p><p id="Par818"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par819">LPS induced the expression of E-selectin and VCAM-1 in HUVEC in a time-dependent manner. E-selectin and VCAM-1 were maximally expressed on HUVEC at 4 and 6 hours after LPS exposure, respectively. E-selectin expression was attenuated throughout the 6 hours’ duration of LPS exposure upon post-LPS treatment with RM at 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 hours after LPS exposure. VCAM-1 expression was not affected upon post-LPS treatments with RM. These findings suggest that MAPK p38 to be an important signaling cascade mediating LPS-induced E-selectin expression and can be pharmacologically targeted to attenuate E-selectin, but not VCAM-1 expression.</p><p id="Par820"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par821">RM can be used to pharmacologically target the p38 MAPK signaling pathway to attenuate the expression of E-selectin, but not VCAM-1, in LPS-activated EC.

There was a significant age group for both groups (p-value=0.002). During hospitalization, 16(14.41%) patients progressed to death from severe to critically ill patients. Upon admission, the median (IQR) of AST and ALT were significantly higher in the severe to critical group compared to the mild to moderate group, [AST; 39.0(49.0) and 24.0(14.0), ALT 38.0(43.0) and 21.0(18.0)], p&lt;0.05. However, there were no significant differences between both groups for bilirubin level and AST/ALT ratio. Non-survivors had higher AST and ALT levels compared to survivors, with median (IQR) of [AST 98.0(88.0) and 32.0 (26.0), ALT of 67.5(90.0) and 28.0(31.0), (p&lt;0.05). Similarly, there were no significant differences between non-survivors and survivors for bilirubin and AST/ALT ratio. Our study supports the idea that abnormal liver function at admission has been shown to be associated with the disease severity and mortality of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, there is a need to observe hepatobiliary sequelae in COVID-19 survivors as there are dynamic changes in liver function following hospital discharge.</p><p id="Par834"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par835">Abnormal AST and ALT level at admission has been shown to be associated with the disease severity and mortality of COVID-19 infection.

Because of this, there is a lot of interest in the study of glycosylation and <italic>N</italic>-glycans as biomarkers for several diseases [1]. Thus, the reproducible release and identification of <italic>N</italic>-glycans from tissue are important criteria for biomarker discovery. The aim of this study is to explore a general out-look on <italic>N</italic>-glycans reproducibility in fibroblast using matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI/TOF) mass spectrometry.</p><p id="Par843"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par844">Two different batches (batch 1 and 2) of the human fibroblast cell lines were grown to confluence subjected to FANGS protocol [2] and permethylated before mass spectrometry analysis. Sample from these two batches (Batch 1: A1, B1 and C1; Batch 2: A2, B2 and C2) were processed on different days and the released permethylated glycans were analyzed on different days using MALDI/TOF. Triplicate spots from each sample were spotted on a MALDI plate and analyzed three times. The resulting [M+Na] <sup>+</sup> glycan intensities from the spectra corresponding to the same sample were averaged and used to prepare bar charts.</p><p id="Par845"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par846">Results showed that there were no significant differences between different spots of the same sample in all samples (<italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05). This finding is similar to the recently published paper [3], in which the plasma <italic>N</italic>-glycan analysis of control samples was used to evaluate the reproducibility of sample processing. Reproducibility of sample processing on different days showed a few sialylated glycans were missing in A2 and B2 compared to A1 and B1 samples. This is possibly due to the low levels of the collected sialylated glycans thatmay be lost during sample processing or possibly due to biological variation during cell growth. There were differences in the signal intensities of the Hex5HexNAc2 and NeuAcFucHex5HexNAc4 species between the two batches. Most of the signal intensities are similar in the two batches prepared from the C cells.</p><p id="Par847"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par848">In conclusion, this technique of <italic>N</italic>-glycan identification from fibroblast using mass spectrometry can be applied in investigations using human fibroblasts.

It has been reported to possess a promising neuroprotective effect that has the potential for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease [1]. However, the penetration of andrographolide into the central nervous system via the blood-brain barrier is one of the main obstacles for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Oral administration of <italic>A. paniculata</italic> extract has been reported to limit the reach of andrographolide to the brain owing to high plasma protein binding (55%) [2-3]. Andrographolide also readily degraded in acidic and alkaline environments of the gastrointestinal tract. Hence, it is hypothesised that if andrographolide in the nanoparticle form is delivered to the brain, the poor bioavailability limitations could be overcome. The current study aimed to produce spray-dried andrographolide nanoparticles and investigate their cytotoxicity in vitro using a human neuroblastoma cell line.</p><p id="Par857"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par858">Andrographolide nanoparticles were produced using a nano-spray dryer (Buchi Nano Spray Dryer B-90 HP). The particle size was measured using laser diffraction technology and electron microscopy was used to observe the morphology of the particles. The cytotoxicity of the nanoparticles was tested on SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. The nanoparticle suspension at various concentrations was added into the cells in two-fold dilutions and incubated for 48 hrs. 0.05% resazurin was then added and further incubated for 4 hrs. Fluorescence readings were taken at a wavelength of 590nm following excitation at 544nm using a microplate reader. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) was determined by comparing the inhibition to the untreated cells. In addition, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, nitrite oxide (NO) level and reactive oxygen species (ROS) level were determined using the supernatant of the cells following the assay kit guidelines. An andrographolide solution was included as a control. Three independent experiments were performed in triplicate.</p><p id="Par859"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par860">The spray-dried andrographolide nanoparticles were spherical with a rough surface with a hydrodynamic diameter of 724 ± 39 nm with a polydispersity index of 0.3. The spray-dried nanoparticles showed lower toxicity (IC50 of 15.22 ± 0.61 μg/ml) as compared to the solubilised andrographolide control (IC50 of 10.82 ± 0.61 μg/ml). As anticipated, cells treated with solubilised andrographolide showed a higher amount of LDH release compared to the formulated nanoparticles, indicating that the formulation slightly reduced the toxicity of the andrographolide. The nitrate level in the supernatant did not increase dramatically compared to the untreated control, indicating that the cellular death did not involve the release of NO level in the cells. Similarly, the cells did not show any differences in ROS between the treated and untreated cells, suggesting that cellular death might not be induced through the ROS pathway.</p><p id="Par861"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par862">These findings warrant further in vivo studies to establish the efficacy of the spray-dried andrographolide nanoparticles for the treatment of Alzheimer disease.</p><p id="Par863"><bold>Acknowledgement:</bold> The work was funded by the Technology Development fund 1 (TDF03211038) from the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, Malaysia.</p><p id="Par864"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par865">[1] Patel et al.

Microscopic agglutination test (MAT) is the gold standard method in diagnostic leptospira armamentarium. MAT is a laborious serological test performed by observing agglutination reaction of patient sera when incubated against a panel of live Leptospira serovars. This study aimed to analyze the degree of cross-reactivity of sera for MAT conducted in Institute for Medical Research (IMR).</p><p id="Par872"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par873">The study included all sera for MAT in 2019. MAT was performed using an extended WHO panel comprising 20 serovars and 4 strains of <italic>Leptospira species.</italic> A titer of more than or equal to 1:400 is considered seropositive.

Single seropositivity was observed in 40.6% of the sera and the remaining demonstrated cross-reactivity ranging from 2 to 9 serovars (average of 3 serovars). The high degree of cross reactivity observed may be a unique interplay between acute febrile illness (AFI) sera reacted to an extended MAT panel. Single serovar seropositivity involving serovar Fugis, Whitcombi and Lai Langkawi, <italic>L. meyeri, L. borgpetersenii</italic> serovar Batavae, may reflect a convalescent serum reacting to specific infecting serovar. Our finding is in parallel with other studies that support the optimization of extended MAT panels to suit locally dynamic circulating serovar.

One of the capacities required to study this virus is to isolate and propagate them according to the requirement of the studies. To date, the majority of studies utilized monkey-derived Vero cells to rapidly propagate the virus. However, due to its highly susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and limited capacity to metabolize drugs, this cell line is not suitable for pathophysiology and anti-viral research. Vero cells are not preferred for investigation of pathological mechanism of host cell’s response to virus infection because they are not derived from human lung tissue. Furthermore, they are difficult to be used in the study to assess cytopathic effects as they do not express type 1 interferon genes [2]. In this study, we adapted the SARS-CoV-2 isolates into selected human lung-derived cell lines, i.e., MRC-5 and A549, to investigate the capacity of these cell lines as a platform for the characterization of SARS-CoV-2 isolated in Malaysia. MRC-5 has already been identified to be highly susceptible to the infection of various human coronaviruses, including HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [3]. Meanwhile, A549 was selected due to its origin of lung derived.</p><p id="Par887"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par888">To determine the growth profile of SARS-CoV-2 in human-derived cell lines, a local SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate obtained from the IMR archive was first adapted into Vero E6, thus resulting in the generation of passage 1 (P1). The P1 isolate was used to study the growth profile of the virus in MRC-5 and A549 cell lines. P1 isolate was subjected to Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) to identify the genomic sequence of the isolate. The replication kinetics of these isolates in MRC-5 and A459 were evaluated based on the on the formation of cytopathic effect (CPE), Cq value, plaque forming unit (pfu) as well as observation by electron microscope (EM). Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) was repeated on the propagated SARS-CoV-2 passages to examine the genomic stability.</p><p id="Par890"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par891">There was no formation of CPE observed after inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 into MRC-5 and A549 cells after 7 days of culture. In parallel, the qRT-PCR results suggested that the virus did not multiply well in these cells. Plaque assay and EM images further supported these findings. In terms of genome stability, WGS data revealed several genetic polymorphisms in the genome of the virus adapted in MRC-5 and A549 cells.</p><p id="Par892"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par893">MRC-5 and A549 are not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p><p id="Par894"><bold>Acknowledgements:</bold> The work was funded by the NIH Research Grant NMRR-20-709-54523 from the Ministry of Health, Malaysia.</p><p id="Par895"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par896">[1] MacKenzie JS, Smith DW.

Extensive studies have been done to investigate its anticancer properties against various cancers [1,2]. Here we report effects of kaempferol on cellular activities that are closely regulated by microtubules. We also reveal our finding on expression of main microtubules components following kaempferol treatment in colorectal cancer cell line HT-29.</p><p id="Par903"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par904">We carried out cell viability assay to examine whether kaempferol inhibits HT-29 cell growth by estimating viable cell numbers. Next, we performed cell spreading and scratch wound assay to investigate the effects of kaempferol on HT-29 cell morphology and migration activity. To obtain a clearer understanding of how kaempferol causes alterations in microtubule network and cell motility, we performed whole cell microtubule analysis by flow cytometry.</p><p id="Par905"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par906">Kaempferol decreased viable HT-29 cell numbers in a dose-dependent manner with almost 66% decrease in the viable cell number within 24 hours after the addition of 240 μM kaempferol. During cell spreading, HT-29 cells treated with IC<sub>50</sub> of kaempferol (143 μM) were found to be significantly reduced in cell area and increased circularity. This suggests kaempferol inhibits cell spreading and promotes a more circular-shaped cells. Further investigation on microtubule organization revealed that kaempferol suppressed normal microtubule spreading in HT-29 cells, consistent with reduction in the cell area. Kaempferol-treated cells were having intense anti-tubulin staining around the cell edge almost identical to the effects seen in taxol-treated HT-29 cells. Taxol treatment resulted in a more intense anti-tubulin staining, in agreement with its well-known role in promoting microtubule stabilization. More detailed microtubule analysis revealed that expression of α-tubulin and β-tubulin in kaempferol-treated cells was significantly lesser than untreated cells. Given the important roles of microtubule cytoskeleton in controlling cellular shape and cell motility, altered cell morphology and inhibition of cell migration found in kaempferol-treated HT-29 cells could be attributed to perturbation in microtubule functions.</p><p id="Par907"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par908">Collectively, our findings show that kaempferol leads to alteration in cell spreading and hinders cell migration of cancer cells. These changes could be associated with decrease expression of α-tubulin and β-tubulin. Further work will be required to elucidate underlying mechanisms of kaempferol effects on microtubule dynamics.</p><p id="Par909"><bold>Acknowledgement:</bold> Special thanks to Universiti Sains Malaysia for the financial assistance through Short Term Grant (304/CIPPT/6315481).</p><p id="Par910"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par911">[1] Wang X, et al.

In Malaysia itself, dengue is a hyperendemic disease and the incidence rate continued to increase exponentially since the past ten years [1]. Manifestations of the dengue symptoms can range from asymptomatic, mild or severe. Dengue fever that progresses to severe dengue, either dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS), are usually life-threatening. The mechanisms of how this disease progresses to severity is incompletely understood. Early identification of cases that are likely to progress to worse health conditions remains challenging. Multiple studies have highlighted the role of host genetics as a crucial factor towards severity. Thus, this study aimed to identify single nucleotide polymorphism(s) that predisposes dengue patients to severe disease outcomes among the Malaysian dengue cohort.</p><p id="Par928"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par929">This is a case-control study that includes a total of 188 dengue patients; 86 with dengue fever and 102 with severe dengue. Patients were recruited from Hospital Kuala Lumpur from year 2018 till 2020. Classification into dengue fever (DF) or severe dengue (SD) were made based on the WHO 2009 classification. DNA extracted from whole blood samples, were genotyped using Infinium™ Asian Screening Array. Single variant association analysis was performed on 617,245 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Both sample- and SNP-levels data were subjected to stringent quality control checking for high quality genotype data.</p><p id="Par930"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par931">We found genetic variations that are suggestively associated with dengue severity, namely rs9872672 and rs148681490. These SNPs reached the p-values of ~10<sup>-6</sup>, with their odds ratio of 4.574 (rs9872672) and 0.092 (rs148681490) were mapped to chromosome 3p14.2 and 11p11.2, respectively. Our findings at position 3p14.2 indicate a change of allele from C to T that occurred at a frequency of 0.143 globally [2]. Suggestive allele at this position identified an intronic region of the synaptoporin (SYNPR) gene that is predicted to be an integral component of synaptic vesicle membrane, whose probable function is linked with vesicular channel protein. Likewise, suggestive SNP found at chromosome 11 showed a change from A to G. The alleles at 11p11.2 encode for tetratricopeptide repeat domain 17 (TTC17) protein that are involved in the actin filament polymerization and cilium organization.</p><p id="Par932"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par933">In conclusion, the findings from this study support the notion that host genetic factor contributes to the disease pathogenicity of dengue severity. Although the potential roles of the suggestive SNPs are still uncertain, further validation is highly warranted.</p><p id="Par934"><bold>Acknowledgement:</bold> This work was funded by the Ministry of Health, Malaysia for a project coded NMRR-18-263-40377.</p><p id="Par935"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par936">[1] Ministry of Health Malaysia.

There are very limited population-based breast cancer survival and prognostic factors studies for Malaysian population, particularly that focus on TNBC patients. Hence, the purpose of this study was to determine the survival of TNBC patients at HUSM and to identify potential prognostic factors for their overall survival (OS).</p><p id="Par957"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par958">This retrospective study was conducted using primary data of 50 women diagnosed with malignant breast cancer at HUSM between January 2017 and December 2019 (USM/JEPeM/18120775). The patients were divided into two groups: TNBC and non-TNBC. Overall survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and a log-rank test was used to compare the survival functions among the two groups. Simple Cox’s proportional hazard regression model was employed to identify the important prognostic factors of death.</p><p id="Par959"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par960">The OS for TNBC was significantly lower than that for non- TNBC, at 45.0% vs 83.3% (<italic>p</italic> = 0.003). The mean survival time for TNBC was 38.7 months compared to 73.4 months for non- TNBC. Molecular subtype was a significant prognostic factor for malignant breast cancer patients whereby diagnosis with non- TNBC reduces the death hazard by a factor of 0.23 or 77.0% (95% CI 0.079–0.664; <italic>p</italic> = 0.007). Only staging status was statistically significant for OS of TNBC patients.</p><p id="Par961">The OS for early-stage TNBC was significantly higher than that for advanced-stage TNBC, at 66.7% vs 27.3% (<italic>p</italic> = 0.021). The median survival time was 57.0 months (95% CI 50.5–63.5 months) for early-stage TNBC vs 24.0 months (95% CI 19.7–28.3 months) for advanced stage TNBC patients. Advanced stage TNBC patients had 5.3 times increased hazard to death compared to early-stage TNBC patients (95% CI 1.096–25.647; <italic>p</italic> = 0.038). Since no other variables showed statistical significance on OS of TNBC or non- TNBC patients, multivariate analysis was not conducted. The OS and important prognostic factors reported in this study are in accordance with other studies [1,2] that have recorded worse OS for TNBC patients diagnosed at advanced stage. Nonetheless, other factors including patient’s age, surgical treatment methods and family history of malignancy have been shown to be important prognostic factors for breast cancer [1,2], which was not the case for this study.</p><p id="Par962"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par963">At HUSM, TNBC patients, particularly those diagnosed at advanced stage, have worse prognosis compared to non-TNBC patients. Future studies with larger sample size and comparative studies with other hospitals in Malaysia are necessary to enable the identification of more potential prognostic factors for TNBC and non-TNBC patients, with the aim to improve breast cancer management in this region.</p><p id="Par964"><bold>Acknowledgment:</bold> This work was funded by Agilent Technologies (304/CIPPM/6150161/A146).</p><p id="Par965"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par966">[1] Gonçalves H Jr, et al.

Neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 is useful, however with the large size (~150 kilodaltons (kDa)), complex hetero-tetrameric structure and susceptibility to extreme ambient temperature for the conventional antibody may limit their performance in therapeutic and diagnostic applications [2]. Antibody surface display technology allows the exploration of antibody fragments from other organisms, including VNAR (variable domain of immunoglobulin new antigen receptor (IgNAR)) from shark with better thermostability [3]. The advantages of shark VNAR single-domain antibody are due to possessing smaller size (~12 kDa) and simpler structure, with its antigen-binding capability comparable to conventional antibody [2, 3]. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential of shark VNAR as binders towards SARS-CoV-2 as target antigen.</p><p id="Par972"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par973">A proprietary phage-displayed semi-synthetic shark VNAR library was subjected to 3 rounds of biopanning. The commercial wild-type SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) diluted in various concentration was used as target antigen in this study. The biopanning steps per round involved immobilizing antigen on immunotube, blocking immunotube with skimmed milk, incubating phages from antibody library in immunotube, washing off unbound phages while eluting bound phages, followed by the re-propagation of specific phage clones in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> TG1.

Hence, in this project, we opted for a novel intervention by using aptamers to inhibit the growth of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa,</italic> which can be cost-effective and less laborious. Besides, antimicrobial agents targeting the outer membrane protein (OMP) in Gram-negative bacteria can also be effective at killing or inhibiting bacterial growth as these proteins play an important role in bacteria survival as well as being exposed to the surface, which facilitates direct binding. Aptamer repurposing also reduces the cost and length of new drug development.</p><p id="Par987"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par988">Unmodified functional DNA aptamers from the Aptagen database were docked with the essential OMP using various docking tools such as HADDOCK 2.4 and HDOCK web server to determine the binding site and binding score of the various aptamers.

Interestingly, this aptamer also exhibited significant antibacterial activity from the early stationary growth phase onwards. The addition of the aptamer after the late log phase also exhibited a similar effect. Besides, the antibacterial activity of apt31 was also dose-dependent. Hence, we can deduce that apt31 binds to the active site region and blocks the OMP activity. The major role of this OMP is to fold and insert β-barrel proteins into the outer membrane layer. As apt31 hinders the OMP activity, we postulate that the bacteria cells eventually die due to a lack of OMPs, which are essential for survival and virulence.</p><p id="Par991"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par992">We show that the apt31, an aptamer that binds to an antitumor, is capable of binding to OMP in <italic>P.aeruginosa.</italic> The aptamer-OMP complex exhibits a significant antibacterial effect in a dose-dependent manner.

The accuracy of early diagnosis is the key for effective treatment. However, early diagnosis for DENV infection is a great challenge due to the similar onset symptoms of Dengue with other flaviviruses, concurrent infection and cross-reactivity among dengue serotypes and other flaviviruses [1]. Besides, the limitations of conventional monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) also affect the efficiency of diagnostic kits [2]. Alternatively, the variable new antigen receptor (V<sub>NAR</sub>) found in shark, has recently been identified as a promising diagnostic tool due to its excellent thermostability and capability to target on cryptic epitopes [3]. In this study, a potential clone that recognizing DENV Type 2 NS1 has been isolated and expressed.

In Malaysia, stroke is the third leading cause of death. The rs1801133 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (<italic>MTHFR</italic>) gene has been linked to stroke pathogenesis in a recent meta-analysis [2]. To date, there is a lack of study addressing this SNP towards stroke risk and rehabilitation outcomes in the Malaysian population. Hence, this study aims to investigate the association of <italic>MTHFR</italic> rs1801133 SNP with the risk and rehabilitation outcomes in Malaysian stroke patients.</p><p id="Par1023"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par1024">The peripheral blood sample was collected from 251 age-matched individuals (113 stroke patients and 138 healthy controls without a stroke history) with written consent. The genomic DNA was extracted from these blood samples and the rs1801133 SNP was genotyped using a TaqMan® assay approach. The odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were calculated for risk association analysis. The stroke patients were subjected to a special-designed rehabilitation exercise and their pre- and post-exercise assessments including the Barthel index, Fugl-Meyer assessment-upper extremity, and Fugl-Meyer assessment-lower extremity were compared based on their genotypes.</p><p id="Par1025"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par1026">This study showed that the presence of a T allele of the rs1801133 SNP had at least a 0.4-fold reduced risk of stroke. This suggests that the T allele of the rs1801133 SNP is protective against a stroke in the Malaysian population. Surprisingly, the finding of this study is in contrast with those reported in the meta-analyses [2,3]. Out of the 31 stroke patients who had completed their special-designed rehabilitation exercises, patients with a homozygous (C/C) genotype showed significant improvement in the post-rehabilitation assessments including the Barthel index, Fugl-Meyer assessment-upper extremity, and Fugl-Meyer assessment-lower extremity.</p><p id="Par1027"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par1028">In conclusion, this study suggests that the <italic>MTHFR</italic> rs1801133 SNP is a potential biomarker for stroke risk and rehabilitation outcome predictions in Malaysian stroke patients.

However, the reliability of gene expression data obtained through this technique is highly dependent on the stability of the housekeeping genes being used. Housekeeping genes act as a normaliser or endogenous reference in the relative quantification of a target gene and its expression may vary between different types and sources of samples. Studies on urinary microRNA as a potential disease biomarker are expanding, and the suitable housekeeping genes are yet to be confirmed. In this study, we assessed the stability of three commonly used references for microRNA i.e., hsa-miR-26b, hsa-miR-16, and RNU6B.</p><p id="Par1038"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par1039">This study was registered (NMRR-19-1188-47227), approved by the Medical Review and Ethics Committee (MREC) of the Ministry of Health Malaysia, and the Human Research Ethics Committee of Universiti Sains Malaysia (JEPeM, USM), and conducted following the Good Clinical Practice Guideline. The urine samples were collected from 24 patients (12 with colonic polyps and 12 without colonic polyps) scheduled for colonoscopy at Hospital Sultanah Bahiyah, Kedah, Malaysia. Colonic polyps’ diagnosis was confirmed by colonoscopy and histopathological report. MicroRNA was extracted from the urine supernatant based on the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform-potassium acetate-lithium chloride method described by Zununi Vahed et al. (2016) with a slight modification. Reverse transcription and primer design for RT-PCR were performed following protocol by Balcells et al. (2011) and Busk (2014), respectively. We performed RT-PCR with cycling conditions of initial denaturation (95°C, 5 min) followed by 45 cycles of denaturation (95°C, 15 sec) and annealing (60°C, 30 sec). The analysis was extended with melting curve analysis (60°C to 95°C) to assess RT-PCR efficiency. The stability of Ct values was evaluated using three algorithms i.e., BestKeeper, DeltaCq, and NormFinder. T-test was used to analyse whether a significant difference in mean Ct values of hsa-miR-26b, hsa-miR-16, and RNU6B existed between those two groups of patients.</p><p id="Par1040"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par1041">There is no significant difference in mean Ct values of RNU6B, hsa-miR-26b, and hsa-miR-16 between the group of patients with colonic polyps and without colonic polyps (P-value = 0.204, 95% CI, -2.56, 0.58). This suggests that these three microRNAs are suitable candidates for normalisation control for relative RT-PCR. Analysis with all three algorithms showed that hsa-miR-16 alone had the best stability among the three microRNAs tested, while the stability improved when miR-16 and RNU6B were combined.</p><p id="Par1042"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par1043">The findings in this study could be used as a guide to other research applying the relative RT-PCR technique in measuring gene expression of microRNA in human urine samples.</p><p id="Par1044"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par1045">[1] Balcells, I., et al.

Most <italic>NOTCH3</italic> mutations reported so far are rigidly stereotyped, involving the gain or loss of a cysteine residue in a specific <italic>NOTCH3</italic> epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats on chromosome 19.p13.12 [1, 3].</p><p id="Par1052"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par1053">More than 100 blood samples of unrelated Malaysian patients with clinical/neuroimaging pictures suggestive of CADASIL were referred to our laboratory for molecular investigation. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood using Prepito DNA Blood250 Kit (PerkinElmer). Genetic diagnosis of CADASIL was performed by targeted PCR amplification of exons 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 16 and 19, including exon-intron boundaries of the <italic>NOTCH3</italic> gene, followed by Sanger sequencing to detect causative mutations. Sequence analysis was performed using 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). To confirm the pathogenicity of new nucleotide variants, the identified sequence variants were assessed against several public databases and <italic>in silico</italic> prediction tools such as VarSome in accordance with ACMG guidelines.</p><p id="Par1054"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par1055">Out of the 108 samples tested, 23 samples were found to harbour variants suggestive of CADASIL. Using PCR-directed sequence analysis, a total of seven mutations were identified. One was a novel missense mutation, C260S and six previously reported mutations, R110C, R141C, R182C, C194S, R544C and R1006C were listed in the Human Genome Mutation Database (HGMD). In this study, a 51-year-old female patient with novel missense mutation C260S is presented with sudden onset of left-sided weakness and MRI brain scan findings suggestive of CADASIL. VarSome predicted C260S as pathogenic, located in a mutational hotspot and two different missense changes determined to be pathogenic have been seen before. The nucleotide position was strongly conserved and the variant was not found in gnomAD, a population database for normal individuals. Furthermore, the pathogenicity score was 95% from multiple <italic>in silico</italic> predictors. This result is consistent with the CADASIL diagnosis for this patient.</p><p id="Par1056"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par1057">Careful assessments of genealogical, clinical, and neuroimaging data in patients with lacunar stroke can aid in selecting patients with a high probability of finding mutations by genetic screening [2]. In our samples, 21% of Malaysian patients with ‘clinically suspected’ CADASIL received the definitive molecularly proven diagnosis. In contrast, if clinical suspicion is high, the remaining undiagnosed patients should be recommended for further testing of NOTCH3 exons, which were not included in this study. In addition, the discovery of new mutations expands the genetic spectrum of <italic>NOTCH3</italic>-related diseases, which will contribute to further study of this disease in the future. Correct diagnosis is not only important for the management of the patient but also crucial for genetic counselling and early diagnosis of at-risk family members.</p><p id="Par1058"><bold>Acknowledgements:</bold> The authors would like to thank the Director General of Health Malaysia for the approval to present these findings and the Director of the Institute for Medical Research (IMR) for all the support given towards this presentation.

Compared to honeybee honey, stingless bee honey has a significantly higher moisture content, water activity, and ash content, while the pH and total soluble solid content are slightly lower. Other components such as proteins, amino acids, enzymes, organic acids, mineral elements, and vitamins are also present in small amounts. Being rich in nutrients, honey provides a suitable environment for microflora growth. Microflora in honey includes yeasts, moulds, and bacteria with bacteria being the major microbes associated with stingless bee honey. Many studies have proven the presence of probiotics amongst the microflora, which includes <italic>Lactobacillus, Lactococcus</italic>, and <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>. This finding has provided additional commercial value to stingless bee honey. Hence, this study aims to screen the presence of <italic>Lactobacillus spp.,</italic> one of the most accepted probiotics, in stingless bee honey of <italic>Heterotrigona itama</italic> collected from a plantation in Mantin, Negeri Sembilan.</p><p id="Par1068"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par1069">Samples were randomly obtained from July to November 2018 from the same plantation area. The samples were cultivated in lactobacilli de Man, Rogosa, Sharpe (MRS) broth before being subjected to isolation on MRS agar. This step was carried out 3 times to further isolate the potentially different species by differentiating them according to their colony morphology. 5 colonies isolated from each month were subjected to DNA extraction using QiaAmp DNA kits. The colonies were identified via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a set of primer pairs targeting the region of 16S rRNA; LF 5’-AGCAGTAGGGAATCTTCCA-3’ and LR 5’-ATTACACCGCTACACATG-3’, targeting amplicon sizing 430bp. PCR products were sent to 1st Base Laboratories for sequencing followed by sequence alignment using BLAST on the NCBI website.</p><p id="Par1070"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par1071">Growth on MRS agar showed the growth of a few species that could be differentiated by their colony morphologies. Colonies colour ranged from whitish to brownish yellow, while other characteristics observed were sliminess, size, and shape; where there were round and slightly oval shape. Most samples subjected to PCR gave out clear single band sizing around 400bp during gel electrophoresis, while some other gave two to three, clear but faint bands ranging around the same size; 400 - 500bp. This could be explained by mixed species that co-inhibit the same honey pot. Sequencing and alignment of PCR products in the database showed that several <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species repeatedly emerged on the list.

The disease is transmitted through nasal fluids, saliva and contact act with surfaces contaminated with HFMD patients. HFMD is caused by viruses known as Enterovirus A71 (EV71). Generally, all viruses are biological things that contain specific genes of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). In this project, RNA extraction is used instead of DNA. RNA extraction is safer, stays inactivated at room temperature, and has resistance to ultraviolet sensitivity compared to DNA. Various types of light with different wavelengths are represented in the electromagnetic spectrum, and this research used Ultraviolet (UV) until Visible (VIS) spectra. This project aims to study the optical properties of EV71 RNA via UV-VIS spectroscopy for HFMD detection and to differentiate the UV-VIS light response between various samplings of EV71 RNA through spectra analysis. UV-VIS spectroscopy requires specialized methodologies to be performed. This project was implemented using absorption, transmission, and reflectance methodologies.</p><p id="Par1079"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par1080">In this study, EV71 RNA with different concentrations were used. Optical spectroscopy in the ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) range was used to observe the optical properties of all the RNAs, including absorbance, transmission and reflectance. The Ocean View software was used to capture the spectra of all honey. The spectra were collected more than 10 times for each concentration to improve the accuracy of the results. The average of the results was plotted, and analysis was performed for all spectra results.</p><p id="Par1081"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par1082">As a result of this project, the value of absorbance and reflectance is directly proportional to the concentration whereas the value of transmittance is inversely proportional to the concentration. The results of this experiment were supported by theoretical and previous studies. The data of this research need continue to be discussed and improved from time in developing a diagnostic instrument that is responsive, mobile, lowcost, and accurate. A rapid, adaptive test, such as a “test kit” capable of identifying the EV71, will significantly improve the detection of HFMD. Thus, the annual number of HFMD cases can be controlled since the appropriate treatment can be administered due to the early detection of HFMD in the early stages.</p><p id="Par1083"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par1084">Three optical properties, which are absorbance, transmission, and reflectance were studied for all EV71 RNA using optical spectroscopy in the UV-VIS ranges. An analysis was performed on the spectra results to compare the mean value of the peak spectra. Absorption and reflection have demonstrated a similar relationship between the sample concentration used and the absorbance or reflectance values. This means, when the sample concentration was high, the absorbance or reflectance value will also be increased. Contrarily, the association between sample concentration and transmittance were different. This signifies that the transmission value was low when the sample concentration was high.</p><p id="Par1085"><bold>Acknowledgement:</bold> The work was funded by the Internal Grant Scheme from the Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia (PPPI/USIM-RACER_0120/FKAB/051000/12820)</p><p id="Par1086"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par1087">[1] Guerra, A.

Mismatch repair (MMR) protein complexes often correct DNA mismatch errors. DNA errors build-up due to the MMR system’s loss of function, causing microsatellite instability (MSI), a genetic hypermutability disorder. MSI is a molecular phenotype due to a defective DNA MMR system. Recent years have seen a rise in interest in DNA MMR deficiency as a critical biomarker to predict the therapeutic efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors for various malignant neoplasms. The study aims to investigate the profile of MSI status in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients from Hospital USM.</p><p id="Par1093"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par1094">The formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks from archival colon cancer samples and adjacent normal tissue (n = 43) were randomly selected between 2018 and 2020. Genomic DNA extracted from tumors and corresponding normal tissues were used for MSI analysis using the Promega panel (5 mononucleotide markers: BAT-25, BAT-26, NR-21, NR-24, and MONO-27; and 2 pentanucleotide markers: Penta C and Penta D).</p><p id="Par1095"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par1096">Of the 43 tissue samples studied, 21 samples came from men and 22 came from women. The median age of patients in the study group was 62 years. Four tumors (9.3%) demonstrated high MSI (MSI-H), one demonstrated low MSI (2.3%), and the remaining 38 (88.4%) tumors were microsatellite stable (MSS). Our finding was comparable with other studies which show that the incidence of MSI in tumors in CRC varies from 8.8% to 20.3%. Interestingly, patients in the MSI-H group were younger, with a median age of 39 years old compared with the study population with a median age of 62 years old. In constrast, a median age of 63 years was observed in the MSS group. According to a study, patients with CRC who had MSI-H were diagnosed earlier than those with MSS (1). Most selected tissue samples arise from the distal colon whereas smaller percentage were from proximal colon (16%). Notably, the incidence of proximal lesions in the MSI-H group (75%, 3/4) was higher than in the MSS group (9%, 4/39). The findings of researcher from several countries have demonstrated that MSI is more frequent in patients with tumors localization in the proximal of the colon (2), which is also in agreement with our findings. It has been reported that MSI-H tumors respond well to immunotherapy, PD-L1 (programed cell death ligand 1), with FDA approved to treat MSI-H/MMR patients.</p><p id="Par1097"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par1098">This is an exploratory study employing a Promega panel to look at the MSI profile in our CRC patients. To associate clinical characteristics with MSI status, it is necessary to do further research with larger sample size. It would be beneficial to screen patients with MSI-H status which has a potential role in treatment management.</p><p id="Par1099"><bold>Acknowledgement:</bold> The work was funded by Newcastle University Medicine Malaysia (NUMED) (304/PPSP/6150173).</p><p id="Par1100"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par1101">[1] Obert R, et al.

It is a public health issue with immense societal and economic implications [1]. Antibiotic-resistant pathogens pose an enormous threat to the treatment of a wide range of serious infections. A periodic replacement of the existing antibiotic is necessary to prevent this exponential emergence. <italic>X. dendrorhous</italic> extracts were signified on the benefits of astaxanthin in antioxidant activity, but less emphasized for its antimicrobial activity. This study aims to assess the antimicrobial ability of astaxanthin extract of wild type and mutant <italic>X. dendrorhous</italic> obtained in our research.</p><p id="Par1107"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par1108">Antimicrobial activity of astaxanthin extracts was evaluated through the zone of inhibition using paper disc assay against seven microorganisms of industrial importance Gram-negative bacteria: <italic>Shigella boydii</italic> and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, Gram positive bacteria: <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, yeasts: <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, and fungus: <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic>. The wild type and mutant astaxanthin extracts were prepared at a concentration of 30ug/mL and dotted on autoclaved paper discs. The experiment also included a positive control of 30ug/mL of chloramphenicol for antibacterial drugs and Miconazole as a standard antifungal drug. All the plates containing bacteria were incubated at 37°C for 24 h and that of yeast and fungi at 28°C for 48 h.</p><p id="Par1109"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par1110">The standard antibiotic chloramphenicol produced inhibition zones of 12, 14, 9 and 8mm against <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, <italic>S. aureus</italic>, <italic>S. boydii</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> respectively. Meanwhile positive control Miconazole produced inhibition zones of 28, 25 and 23 mm against <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>A. niger</italic> respectively. The antimicrobial activity of both wild type and mutant extracts showed significant growth inhibition against pathogenic microbial strains. The mutant astaxanthin extract showed a slightly better inhibition effect on all the pathogens than the wild type extract, but the difference was not significant. The extracts exhibited an excellent inhibitory effect against Gram-positive <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic>, nearly as good as positive control. They exerted a milder antimicrobial capability against Gram negative <italic>S. boydii</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>. Compared to the positive control, the extracts showed moderate inhibition in <italic>S. cerevisiae, C. albicans</italic> and <italic>A. niger</italic> for yeast and fungus. Limited antimicrobial reports on astaxanthin are mainly extracted from sources like microalga <italic>H. pluvialis</italic> and crustaceans. Some contradictions can be found in the literature due to the different strains used in the determination of antimicrobial activity, extraction methods, extraction solvents and extract concentration used in the assays [2].</p><p id="Par1111"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par1112">Based on controls, both the wild type and mutant astaxanthin extracts showed impressive inhibition on Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria compared to yeast and fungus.

It generates reactive oxygen species and free radicals that cause skin oxidative damage leading to skin cancers, photosensitivity, and photo-aging problems. These contribute to synthetic sunscreens formulated with UVR filters that mostly show side effects on human health and ecology. Hence, research investigations were initiated upon natural resources that can produce UV-absorbing compounds known as mycosporine-like amino acids and mycosporine-glutaminol-glucoside. These molecules are commonly used by organisms growing at high altitudes to protect themselves from extreme UV exposure [1]. In this study, a basidiomycetous yeast, <italic>Xanthophllomyces dendrorhous</italic> wild type and its mutant strains were analyzed for their ability to produce MAA/MGGs<bold>.</bold></p><p id="Par1121"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par1122"><italic>X. dendrorhous</italic> wild type and mutant strains were revived and maintained on yeast malt agar at 4°C. Synthesis of mycosporines was induced by transferring young cultures (24hr) to YM agar plates and incubated for 4 days at 22°C in an incubator (LabCompanion SIF-6000R) with a 12:12 light: dark photoperiod. For light conditions, culture plates were left exposed to PAR+UVR while for dark conditions, plates were covered with aluminium foil. After exposure, the colonies were harvested and transferred to distilled water, centrifuged, and conserved at -20° until mycosporines extraction. Samples were extracted with 10ml of DMSO solution (2%) for 24hrs at 4°C. After 24hrs, glass beads were added to samples and vigorously agitated in a vortex mixer. Later, they were incubated for 24hrs at 45°C in a water bath and centrifuged using a microcentrifuge. The resulting supernatant was immediately measured spectrophotometrically (UV-visible) at 325 nm for mycosporines quantification. Experiments were performed in triplicate.</p><p id="Par1123"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par1124">With the aid of a UV spectrum, the mycosporine production rate was found to be the highest at 325 nm for all four strains leading to a fixed wavelength for further measurements. Yeast colonies exposed to PAR+ UVR showed higher absorbance rates concluding more mycosporines production than those grown in a dark environment. It showed that strains frequently exposed to high UV radiation have an increased tendency of mycosporine production than those with lower intensity of UV exposure. By comparing the wild type and 3 mutant strains, the results indicated that the red, white and yellow mutant colonies initially showed almost equal mycosporines production rate as the wild strain. The production rate will be further improved by introducing different inducers, growth media and culture conditions.</p><p id="Par1125"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par1126">All the four strains tested showed the detection of MAA/MGGs in the DMSO extracts. It is concluded that after photostimulation, both <italic>X. dendrorhous</italic> wild type and mutant strains have the ability to synthesize UV-absorbing compounds and further investigation should be done to discover its potential as a natural molecular sunscreen.</p><p id="Par1127"><bold>Acknowledgement:</bold> The authors would like to express their gratitude to Universiti Sains Malaysia for Research University Grant (RUI Grant no: 1001/CIPPM/8012377)</p><p id="Par1128"><bold>Reference</bold></p><p id="Par1129">[1] S.

However, this fixation process causes a protein alteration known as “cross-links.” Consequently, it made it challenging to extract proteins and characterize individual proteins. The study of proteomics is growing quickly because it has the potential to enhance disease diagnosis, risk assessment, prognosis, and therapy targeting. Consequently, as a researcher, it is important to investigate strong and efficient protein identification approaches and improve all aspects of protein analysis, such as the protein extraction method from FFPE tissue and protein digestion for mass spectrometry.</p><p id="Par1134"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par1135">For this research, FFPE human tonsillitis blocks were chosen for this research to compare the efficiency of three different protein extraction methods, including sonication, RapiGest, and Sodium Deoxycholate, from Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) tissue for proteomic analysis. These sections were cut into 4 μm thin slices of tissue to facilitate the deparaffinization process. Three sets of unstained FFPE tonsil tissue sections were excised into 1.0 cm2 for the triplicate results. For the quantification analysis, Nanodrop 2000 was used to measure the protein concentration from the extracted protein. While the determination of the protein quality, SDS-PAGE analysis was done with three different protein extraction methods. The proteins of interest are digested with an enzyme, trypsin, and the resultant peptides are examined using mass spectrometry. Protein identification will be accomplished using LC-MS/MS analysis of protein extracted from three sets of each extraction technique obtained from FFPE tonsillitis samples.</p><p id="Par1136"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par1137">The protein concentration of the samples was determined using the nanodrop 2000c. From the sonication method, the protein concentration was extremely low and inconsistent. The sodium deoxycholate method produced a greater protein concentration than RapiGest. Next, the protein quality was evaluated using SDS-PAGE following the application of the three protein extraction methods for sample fragmentation. The intensity of the band for RapiGest and Sodium Deoxycholate can be observed at 1 cm<sup>2</sup>. However, a very faint band was observed for the sonication method. This shows that the highest abundance of protein loaded into the gel is from the RapiGest and Sodium Deoxycholate, while the lowest is from the sonication method. All the proteins were then analysed via LC/MS and identified using Peak 7.5 software. A total of 668 proteins were successfully identified using the sodium deoxycholate method. In addition, a total of 387 protein samples were obtained using the sonication method. However, for the RapiGest method, the number of proteins acquired from the samples was only 89, which was the lowest. Based on the results obtained from the software, 14 proteins were found to overlap in all three protein extraction methods.</p><p id="Par1138"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par1139">In conclusion, the most efficient protein extraction method is sodium deoxycholate because the protein concentration is the highest. Adding to that, the number of proteins identified using this method is also the highest.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec340"><title>P-51 Optimization of expression and purification of soluble <italic>E. bieneusi</italic> B7XHF2 recombinant protein in <italic>E.coli</italic></title><sec id="Sec341"><title>Muhammad Danial Hakim Muhammad Hanif<sup>1</sup>, Putri Sabrina Mohamed Yusoff<sup>2</sup>, Norsyahida Arifin<sup>1</sup> and Emelia Osman<sup>2</sup></title><sec id="Sec342"><title><sup>1</sup>Institute for Research in Molecular Medicine (INFORMM), Universiti Sains Malaysia, 11800 Penang, Malaysia; <sup>2</sup>Department of Parasitology and Medical Entomology, Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, 56000 Cheras, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</title><sec id="Sec343"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Emelia Osman (emelia.osman@ukm.edu.my)</title><p id="Par1140">From The International Conference on Molecular Diagnostics &amp; Biomarker Discovery 2022 (MDBD 2022)</p><p id="Par1141">Penang, Malaysia. 11 – 13 October 2022</p><p id="Par1142"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par1143">Worldwide reports of human infections with <italic>Microsporidia</italic> mainly include immunocompromised patients [1]. One of the most prevalent microsporidian species to infect HIV/AIDS patients is <italic>Enterocytozoon bieneusi</italic> [2]. Although stool testing is the most reliable method to diagnose microsporidiosis, the infection is underdiagnosed in patients with disseminated microsporidiosis due to the absence of microsporidia spores in their stool samples. Our previous study has identified two circulating antigens of diagnostic value from the serum of immunocompromised patients. In this study, we aimed to express and purify <italic>E.bieneusi</italic> recombinant protein B7XHF2 in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> as a potential diagnostic biomarker for the detection of disseminated microsporidiosis.</p><p id="Par1144"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par1145">The B7XHF2 gene was cloned in the pET-32a(+) vector, and the recombinant plasmid was transformed into C41(DE3) <italic>E.coli</italic> host cell. Small scale expression in 200ml Terrific broth (TB) was performed to optimize the parameters of protein expression namely IPTG concentration and post-induction incubation period. Subsequently, protein expression was carried out in 2L TB medium, at a temperature of 37°C, 200 rpm before the temperature was lowered to 28°C for 4 hours post IPTG induction. The harvested cells were pelleted and lysed by sonication in a lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors and lysozyme. The filtered protein lysate was then subjected to affinity purification using Ni-NTA resin at a ratio of 1:10 (resin:lysate). Contaminating proteins were removed by gradient washing using washing buffer containing 20mM, 30mM and 40mM imidazole concentration, and finally the targeted protein was eluted by adding elution buffer with 250mM imidazole. Eluted fractions were pooled and concentrated to 300ul and the protein concentration was measured by the RCDC method (Biorad<sup>TM</sup>). Anti-histidine western blot was carried out to verify the presence of the targeted protein.</p><p id="Par1146"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par1147">In this study, the rB7XHF2 protein was highly soluble when induced with 0.5mM IPTG compared to 1.0mM IPTG. There was no significant difference in terms of protein expression when incubation was performed at 2,3,4 and 16 hours post-induction, therefore 4 hours was chosen as the best incubation period. The appearance of a 41-kDa protein on anti-histidine western blot confirmed the expression of rB7XHF2 protein, which was close to the theoretical size of 41.7 -kDa.</p><p id="Par1148"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par1149">This preliminary study has successfully expressed the B7XHF2 recombinant protein in <italic>E.coli</italic> C41(DE3) host cells.

Cytotoxin (CTX), one of the most abundant venom components, was deemed responsible for the envenomation’s local dermonecrosis. Several studies have indicated that the CTX induces cell death through different pathways, yet the molecular mechanism is inconclusive [2]. There is also limited treatment against dermonecrosis. Therefore, there is a need to search for biotherapeutics against CTX-induced dermonecrosis. In this study, we exploit the potential of tRNA-based aptamers as alternate toxin-neutralizing molecules using in silico approach.</p><p id="Par1157"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par1158">GtRNAdb database was used to identify the CTX-binding tRNA-based aptamers for the possible interacting regions with CTX [3]. The sequences of the aptamers were subjected to phylogenetic tree analysis to categorize the tRNAs into different clusters using the Clustal Omega. The tertiary structures of the consensus aptamer sequences were modeled using the RNA Composer. Later, the molecular docking of these aptamers and CTX was performed using HADDOCK web server. In addition, RING analysis was performed on each aptamer-CTX complex to determine the interacting amino acids present on the CTX and the type of interactions.</p><p id="Par1159"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par1160">Altogether, our results suggested six clusters of consensus aptamer sequences from the phylogenetic tree analysis. Among the six aptamer models generated from their respective consensus sequences, three aptamers demonstrated significant binding to CTX. Additionally, the RING analysis revealed that there were four common interacting regions between the six CTX-aptamer complexes. These four interacting regions were consistent with the CTX’s epitopes in our unpublished work. Moreover, the high binding affinity between the aptamer-CTX complexes also suggested that they were potential aptamers to antagonize CTX’s action.</p><p id="Par1161"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par1162">The current work provides insights into <italic>in silico</italic> approach to design aptamers that antagonize CTX-induced dermonecrosis.

However, till date, there are still no vaccines against strongyloidiasis, caused by <italic>Strongyloides stercoralis</italic>. Approximately 100 million people are estimated to be infected worldwide, most commonly in tropical and subtropical regions. There are very few studies on vaccine candidates for strongyloidiasis. To date, there is only one study that uses recombinant protein from <italic>S. stercoralis</italic>, Ss-IR [1]. Furthermore, another study performed immunoscreenings with anti-human IgE antibody of an <italic>S. stercoralis</italic> complementary DNA (cDNA) library, with the results that the cDNA clone A-133 having the highest diagnostic potential [2]. Seeing the protein Ss-IR and A-133 having high potential as vaccine candidate against strongyloidiasis, this study aims to investigate the effects of vaccination with rSs-IR and rA-133 on levels of serum IgG2a antibody.</p><p id="Par1172"><bold>Methodology</bold></p><p id="Par1173">rSs-IR and rA-133 conjugated with histidine tags will be expressed using <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> C41 (DE3) and purified via Ni-NTA affinity column chromatography. The purified antigens will be used for immunization of female Balb/c mice that will be divided into four test groups, namely unvaccinated control (n=6), adjuvant-only control (n=8), rA-133 treatment (n=13) and rSs-IR treatment (n=12). Priming dose will be administered via intraperitoneal route adjuvanted with Complete Freund’s Adjuvant (CFA), whereas subsequent booster doses will be administered via subcutaneous route adjuvanted with Incomplete Freund’s Adjuvant (IFA). Serum samples will be obtained via blood bled via tail snip. After that, ELISA will be performed on serum samples to monitor the level of subclass IgG2a antibodies.</p><p id="Par1174"><bold>Results and Discussion</bold></p><p id="Par1175">The IgG2a levels in mice sera increased with each administration of rSs-IR and rA-133 respectively. Furthermore, rA-133 elicited a greater increase in IgG2a serum levels compared to rSs-IR. IgG antibodies are primarily involved in anti-pathogenic adaptive immune response and long-term protection, and IgG isotype antibody production dictates the robustness of immune response following antigen immunization. The finding of a higher IgG2a production stimulated by rA-133 is a favorable outcome for the antigen as vaccine candidate, due to the important roles IgG2a play in other parasitic diseases. For instance, it has been shown that IgG2a can activate macrophages that traps tissue-migrating helminths larvae thus immobilizing it [3].</p><p id="Par1176"><bold>Conclusion</bold></p><p id="Par1177">In conclusion, this profile of high IgG2a expression shown by rA133 in this study is an important finding since more studies into parasitic carbohydrate-based vaccines are being conducted in order to generate similar antibody profiles.
