Practical challenges hinder the proliferation of these antenna arrays. This work shows how using radio-frequency microchips reduces system component count, decreases mass to ~0.1 g cm<sup>−2</sup>, and increases functionality and mechanical flexibility. We develop a general platform for large scale flexible arrays and demonstrate two different 256-elements, 30 × 30 cm<sup>2</sup> flexible arrays. By varying supply distribution methods and radiators we show how performance can be optimized for maximum power delivery or physical flexibility. The demonstrated systems conform to curved surfaces with radii of curvatures as low as 23 cm and wirelessly deliver ~ 80 mW of DC power to a 6.7 cm × 11 cm-receiver over one meter away. This paves the way towards the integration of smart arrays in flexible wearables and deployable lightweight airborne systems.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Caltech Space Solar Power Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Portfolio</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>85</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>9</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>27</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41528_2022_Article_218.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Materials Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Materials Science, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Optical and Electronic Materials</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Polymer Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Chemistry and Materials Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Radio-frequency systems, and phased arrays in particular, are the next natural frontier of flexible platforms. Although phased arrays have been known at some level for more than a century<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, their first applications can be traced back to aircraft detection radar and early telecommunication systems created prior to the second World War<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Constructive and destructive interference enables the concentration of power and a subsequent increase in gain and spatial selectivity for an array of microwave radiators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Early works leveraged this phenomenon to create high gain, fixed direction arrays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, or create frequency scanning radiators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. As more complex circuits and systems emerged, systems which dynamically adjust the phase and amplitude of the excitation of each radiator, and thereby create electronically steerable beams, became more common. The first of these steerable phased arrays were bulky arrays constructed from discrete components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Eventually monolithic microwave integrated circuits, based on compound semiconductors (e.g., GaAs), began to reduce the size of phased array implementations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Beginning in the 1970s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, silicon integrated circuits began a march of progress that has led to their complete domination of digital electronics and nearly complete domination of lower-frequency analog electronics. Radio-frequency (RF) electronics remained unconquered by silicon until around the turn of the millennium, when silicon low noise amplifiers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, power amplifiers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, phase shifters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, synthesizers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, and then complete systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> emerged. After several more years of maturation, RF integrated circuit (RFIC) based phased arrays now form the foundation of 5G systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Modern phased arrays or ‘smart antennas’ still rely on the same basic principles of operation: constructive interference created through independent control of the phase and the amplitude of each of the array’s elements. However, sophisticated digital control circuitry enables a plethora of capabilities, including beam focusing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, rapid beam steering, simultaneous multi-beam control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, and null synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. These capabilities come at the cost of increased complexity. Element phase shifters should provide full 360<sup>∘</sup> control, be linear, consume little DC power, and behave predictably and reliably in the face of mass-fabrication and environmental variations. If the phase shifters are used to modulate digital data, both high resolution and rapid re-programmability are desired. If analog data is to pass through the phase shifter it must also be high bandwidth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Amplitude modulation introduces additional concerns about power amplifier efficiency, linearity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, and tolerance of high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. For arrays that span beyond several dozens of elements, there are also system integration challenges of timing synchronization and data distribution that emerge from the increased board-level routing density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Despite those issues, phased arrays are the primary solution in today’s transceivers thanks to their enormous functional versatility, non-mechanical control, and in the case of RFIC-based arrays, cost scaling and mass-production capabilities.</p><p id="Par4">Flexibility introduces further complications in antenna design and reference distribution as well as position and orientation uncertainty for the element radiators during beam-forming. However, flexible and lightweight antenna arrays are required for a variety of emerging microwave applications. Wireless power transfer from space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, for example (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a), requires large aperture phased arrays, which can be compactly stored during launch and later deployed in orbit. Flexible smart antennas can also be useful as deployable communication relays for large events (concerts, conventions, etc), or disaster relief/emergency situations when existing infrastructure is damaged (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). <italic>Flexibility and reconfigurability</italic> are necessary for arrays attached to dynamic surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> or used in wearable applications (e.g., Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c, d). Despite their broad potential, phased arrays have not yet been used in flexible systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. While several exciting flexible RF components, such as diodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, transistors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, switches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> and antennas, have been demonstrated, the realization of complete systems requires significant additional functionality, namely, power, data, and clock distribution; local system monitoring and reconfiguration; external interface; and beam-steering. As a result, many recently demonstrated applications rely on additional rigid hardware to demonstrate the desired system functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, and RF designers have to avoid flexibility altogether and settle for flat, rigid profiles with <italic>λ</italic>/2 separated radiators.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Example applications that are enabled by flexible smart antennas.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Lightweight deployable space structures. <bold>b</bold> Ad-hoc deployable antenna arrays. <bold>c</bold> Dynamic conformal surfaces. <bold>d</bold> Wearable conformal surfaces.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41528_2022_218_Fig1_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par5">RFICs can be effective tools in the implementation of various complex flexible systems that rely on coherent addition of radio signals.

We will discuss power and control distribution challenges and solutions, as well as calibration and focusing of large flexible arrays. These function are essential to resolve the phase offsets in the system due to manufacturing variations, shape deformations, or environmental changes.

The primary structural component is a thin multi-layer flexible printed circuit board, later referred to as a flexible sheet. Antenna arrays rely on repeating patterns, and so the primary sub-unit is designed to be modular, each containing an RFIC capable of driving 16 radiators, a micro-controller unit (MCU) with non-volatile memory, several small decoupling capacitors, and accompanying wire traces. This modular sub-unit can be instantiated many times to fabricate large scale arrays of various sizes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. The use of an RFIC drastically reduces the component count compared to traditional design and thus enables mechanical flexibility. An H-tree clock distribution network synchronizes the RFICs to a central reference clock. Each sub-unit has its own power interface and can be powered in different ways (e.g., a shared global distribution network, local photovoltaic cells, etc.) based on the application. The 16 high-frequency radiator feed traces transition to the backside of each sub-unit (opposite to the RFICs) and drive a 4 × 4 pattern of radiators, spaced 0.6 <italic>λ</italic> (wavelength) apart, to improve channel-to-channel isolation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). The mounting interface is designed to accommodate a variety of antenna types, as evident in the details of our two specific implementations.

These characteristics permit the design of microwave structures with reasonable transmission line dimensions; a 50 Ω transmission line on a 75 μm kapton substrate has a width of ~ 0.2 mm and can be manufactured reliably. We use a 4-layer laminate which is the minimum required for the antenna traces, antenna ground layer, supply, and signal routing in our system. The design supports the use of a distributed power supply–for example local solar cells feeding each RFIC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>–to reduce the ohmic losses in the power distribution lines and simplify the component-side design of the flexible sheet. It also supports the use of a centralized power source, distributed to the RFICs through a low resistance flexible board strap (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). To reduce ohmic losses a high-voltage power supply distribution scheme can be used, where it is stepped-down to the required supply voltage locally by high-efficiency DC-DC converters.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>An implementation of a modular, flexible phased array platform.</title><p><bold>a</bold> The multi-layer flexible sheet is designed from multiple <bold>b</bold> sub-unit patterns.

It weighs a practically negligible 85 mg and provides 16 channels of phase-locked 10 GHz signals with individually, digitally controlled phase and amplitude, enabling the array to synthesize and steer custom beam patterns. Such level of complexity is impossible with discrete components with the given array sub-unit size, and is a critical enabler of flexible arrays.</p><p id="Par8">A functional description of each channel of the RFIC is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d. The 10 GHz signals are synthesized from a 10–100 MHz reference in two stages; first a central phase-locked loop (PLL) with programmable division ratio generates a signal close to 2.5 GHz which is distributed to the circuitry of all the individual output channels, each called a core. At each core, a second, individual PLL stage synthesizes a 10 GHz signal from the 2.5 GHz reference. Two stage frequency synthesis relaxes requirements on signal distribution circuitry and provides an opportunity for phase control within each core. Full-360<sup>∘</sup> phase control is achieved through programmable current injection into the PLL loop filter. Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e illustrate the power spectrum emitted from 256 radiators driven by 16 RFICs, in which the radiated output signal is accurately synthesized from a low frequency reference, and Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f is a photo of the IC die.</p><p id="Par9">In addition to the essential signal synthesis and amplification functions, the chip possesses several features. Volatile memory cells control the weights of a vector sum phase rotator which can be bypassed for low power operation or used to enable rapid time multiplexing of the beam direction. Two of the 16 channels possess self-sensing receivers which have been co-designed with the power amplifier, similar to<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. These parasitic receivers can be used to perform reflection sensing for phase calibration and shape estimation purposes. To achieve high on-chip circuit density for the transmitters, a non-resonant inductorless receiver architecture is adopted. The receiver chain has an overall (RF to baseband) noise figure of 10 dB, which is sufficient for its intended calibration operations and does not sacrifice the integration density or performance of the transmit circuitry. On-chip current, voltage, and temperature sensors provide system health and environmental monitoring. Important RFIC block- and system-level performance measurements are presented in the methods section. Integrated circuits are difficult to mount directly to flexible circuit boards, which typically have more strict design-for-manufacturing rules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup> than conventional printed circuit boards, where excessive bending can result in reliability issues. Consequently, the RFICs are mounted on interposers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>g), which also provide the trace fan-out necessary for interfacing with fine pitch bumps. The interposers are fabricated using a 4 layer 1 cm x 1 cm substrate board and are small enough not to limit the bend radius of the larger array.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Array Focusing</title><p id="Par10">A challenge for these arrays is that RF phase of the signal at each radiator is initially deterministic, yet unknown, and varies from one element to the next. This can be due to static fabrication and assembly variations between TX/RX channels, or dynamic effects such as temperature changes or mechanical vibrations. To resolve the phases of the signals emitted from the radiators in our arrays, we use closed-loop feedback from a remote receiver, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>h. The focusing method is discussed thoroughly in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, where a multidimensional variable-dynamic-range search algorithm is designed to work at an arbitrary distance from the antenna plane (As opposed to array calibration, which usually refers to focusing to a focal point at infinity, i.e. in the far field). This algorithm solves a major challenge in high-power arrays: as the phase settings approach the desired optimum to point to a target, the effect of changing the phase of a single element decreases (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>i). This sets severe dynamic range requirements on the focusing feedback receiver, which must handle diminishing power variation towards the end of the process. With our method, focusing starts with simultaneously varying the phases of small subsets of array elements. At this point, power readings are large and coarse tuning is achieved (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>j). As the phase variations become smaller in later iterations, we increase the number of simultaneously phases-varying elements. This increases power variations at the receiver and consequently the dynamic range, and provides fine tuning of the array (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>k). An adaptive orthogonal basis is created to guarantee full spanning of the parameter space.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>A lightweight, high power flexible phased array transmitter</title><p id="Par11">The first realization of the flexible phased array platform optimizes the specific power (radiated-power-to-mass ratio) of the array. This objective is beneficial to lightweight airborne systems such as drones, small satellites, and space-based power (SBP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> systems, in which the antenna weight comes at the expense of other functionality, or affects the economical viability of the system. The design uses a single 25 μm thick polyimide sheet with 256 air-gap dielectric patch radiators etched into a copper layer (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, b). The air gap minimizes substrate losses and provides wide-band matching compared to conventional dielectric patch antennas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Each radiator’s conductive area is further reduced by subtracting small squares from the patch copper surface. The smaller footprint reduces coupling between radiators to below −15 dB and decreases the overall metal content. Radiator feeds are cut out from the antenna sheet and the radiator array sheet is held taut by a lightweight glass fiber frame providing structural integrity. The antenna sheet is assembled on the multi-layer flexible sheet by first soldering the feeds to the carrier board transmission lines and then lifting the radiator sheet such that the antenna feeds rise from the transmission lines on the carrier board (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c).

However, distributed photovoltaic supplies are poorly suited to laboratory characterization of the array. As such we use a low resistance flexible board strap as a surrogate for local power generation. A nominal 1.8 V is supplied from a central source to each of the RFIC’s four PA quadrants. The DC supply is also converted to 1.2 V by a linear regulator for the rest of the IC circuitry, and to 3.3 V by a voltage doubler to power the sub-module MCU. These additional regulators are miniature (about 4 mm<sup>2</sup> each) and do not contribute much to the overall area or power consumption of the system. Performance is characterized in a terrestrial lab rather in the intended, much colder space environment.

EIRP is estimated by normalizing the main lobe height to contain the measured 0.8 W. This results a radiation intensity of 90.2 W rad<sup>−2</sup>, which translates to an effective isotropic power of ~ 60.5 dBm. This result is in line with an initial estimate of 63 dBm EIRP that assumed ~ 15 mW channel output power, cable loss of 3 dB, and 256 radiators with a combined directivity of 30.6 dB. The EIRP difference can be explained from the measured radiation pattern that shows higher-than-expected side lobes at −7 dB below the main lobe, which may occur due to imperfect focusing. This conclusion is supported by a calculation of directivity using our antenna range setup, of which result was 26.5 dBi due to the residual side lobes. The measured radiation patterns are in general similar to the expected analytical results. One reason for elevated side lobes in some of the patterns is that the array was focused to a target in the near filed, due to size constraints of the antenna measurement setup. This can lead to multi-path reflections having been used by the focusing process to maximize power, which can later manifest as raised side-lobes after conversion to the far field. Measurements that are different from the analytical result can also be due to optimizing the power transmitted to a single receiver. The used focusing algorithm is oblivious to the radiated field at any location other than at the receiver. Hence noise, radiator power mismatch, or external disturbances, may result in algorithmic optimum with raised side-lobes. Such non-idealities in the radiation patterns can be alleviated by calibrating the arrays at a properly sized facility in the large-scale manufacturing phase. In addition, it may be beneficial to integrate additional calibration features in the RFIC, as sometimes done to evaluate patterns and perform on-site calibration in rigid phased arrays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Antenna sheet array measurements.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Beam-steering, <bold>b</bold> deformation correction, <bold>c</bold> RF-DC wireless power transfer of about 80 mW at 1 m away from the transmitter to a small rectenna array. <bold>d</bold> Measured output voltage on a 50 Ω resistor, 1 m away from the array (top), angular power density (bottom-left) and expected power delivery distribution to the remote receiver at ~1.6 m away from the array (bottom-right).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41528_2022_218_Fig4_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par13">One potential use of our system is to wirelessly power remote instruments, such as vital sign monitors of isolated patients in a dynamic environment.

Several approaches exist to increase the bandwidth of patch antennas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup> and to reduce the size of low-dielectric radiators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>, but in our proof-of-concept we use a traditional design (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b, c), where the feed and landing-pad form an equivalent <italic>L</italic><italic>C</italic> impedance conversion circuit to match the antenna impedance to the feeding transmission line. This highly flexible prototype is designed to demonstrate operation from a centralized supply like a battery or AC mains. We distribute up to 6 V along the array (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d), and use a commercially available switching regulator for the conversion to the local 1.8 V unit. As a result, the resistive loss of the DC supply lines is reduced by a factor of 3 compared to the high-power array that was presented previously. The supply line remains thin enough to not limit the array movement. The distributed 6 V is generated from a standard 20 V laptop power brick using a 125 W capable commercial miniature DC-DC converter. The last variation to this second enhanced-flexibility design is a replacement of the tall aluminum heatsinks with a low profile solution. We assembled flat ceramic heat spreaders on top of the RFICs and covered each of the spreaders with a 165 μm thick, 40 mm × 15 mm copper strips to conduct heat away (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>e). The use of flat and bendable heat conductors enables the array to conform to curved surfaces such as airplane bodies, where the carrier surface itself participates in the heat conduction away from the chips.

The maximum demonstrated steering angle of ± 10<sup>∘</sup> and focusing range—1.6 m at the moment—are limited by the antenna range dimensions. Far-field patterns are obtained from a mathematical conversion of the near-field measurement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. As a result there are small differences in lobe direction compared to the near-field target location. Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a shows a beam pattern that closely follows the simulation of a 256-element array, with a broadside HPBW of 5.6<sup>∘</sup>. When flat, the average HPBW of the antenna is 5.6<sup>∘</sup>, <italic>σ</italic> = 0.7<sup>∘</sup> compared to expected 5.2<sup>∘</sup>. Directivity of ~ 26.5 dBi was calculated from the far field pattern, similarly to the first antenna prototype. When the antenna is convex and concave (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b and c) broadside-focused lobes are with an HPBW as expected, but the steered lobes are affected by bending, with average HPBW of 6.4<sup>∘</sup> and 6.7<sup>∘</sup>, respectively. This is partly the result of increased non linear coupling effects between neighboring synthesizers and between neighboring power amplifiers that drive each radiator. Such coupling cannot be accounted accurately by the iterative focusing process. In addition, the short range focusing results beam widening after the pattern is transformed to far-field, and sampling effects cause ripples near the phase scan boundaries. For a comparison, HPBW of the raw, <italic>near-field</italic> radiation patterns at the focusing distance, is 5.6<sup>∘</sup>, 5.1<sup>∘</sup>, and 5.9<sup>∘</sup> for flat, convex, and concave bends, respectively. It is noteworthy that bending the antenna results lower transmitted power compared to a flat configuration. The receiver rectenna voltage after focusing is lower on average by 10% and 24% in convex and concave bends, respectively, indicating average power density decrease of 0.95 dB, and 2.3 dB, respectively. In a follow-up mixed experiment we bent the flexible array to a doubly curved shape and directed it at an angle from the receiver. Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>d illustrates how focusing can correct the radiation pattern under a physical deformation. After refocusing, the receiver voltage is only 0.3 dB lower than the value obtained from flat broadside optimization–within measurement tolerance. Worst case side lobes in our steering experiments are at about −7 dB and are a mostly a results of reflections due to near-field focusing. Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>d also illustrates how the mathematical near- to far-field conversion results a deviation of the lobe center from the near field pointing direction. While this is not a fundamental problem, it highlights the importance in understanding the geometric properties of array focusing. Like the high-power implementation, this array is also capable of powering a remote pulse oximeter, but at a reduced distance of 40 cm away from the radiator. The reduction in power delivery range implies a reduced EIRP of the flexible implementation to ~52 dBm compared to the high-power lightweight antenna. The estimated EIRP value was verified by a direct measurement. The dielectric patch array was focused at a target at 6.2 m just beyond the far-field threshold of 6 m. Accounting for path loss, transmission at ~10 GHz and a horn antenna with a known receiver gain of 11 dBi, the measured EIRP is 52.7 dBm. The reduced EIRP is a result of the design choice to optimize flexibility and robustness at the expense of raw transmission power. However, the enhanced robustness enabled us to deploy the flexible array outdoors and demonstrate beam focusing at a building entrance about, 1.5 m away from the antenna surface. After refocusing, the deployed array delivered enough power to a receiver to light a high-power indicator LED (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>e), proving its functionality in the field.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Flexible array measurements, demonstrating bend radii &lt;23 cm.</title><p>Figures <bold>a</bold>–<bold>d</bold> include pre- and post-focusing 2-D near-field radiation patterns (left), beam-steering of the main lobe (center), and array formation (right). <bold>a</bold> 2-D beam-steering with flexible array in planar configuration. <bold>b</bold> 2-D beam-steering with flexible array in convex configuration. <bold>c</bold> 2-D beam-steering with flexible array in concave configuration. <bold>d</bold> 2-D beam-steering with flexible array conformed to a doubly curved shape. <bold>e</bold> Outdoor deployment and focusing to power an LED indicator.

An off-board programming interface to these microcontrollers has been implemented with both serial and parallel control.

Such features require the radiators and electronics to be mounted onto thin and lightweight carrier boards. The two arrays that we presented are fundamentally flexible substrates with cavity patch radiators. The first, high-power antenna uses 9 mm × 9 mm air-gap patches that are printed on a single-sided copper-clad Kapton layer. The Kapton and copper thicknesses are 25 μm and 34 μm, respectively. The thin antenna sheet needs additional support to remain flat. This additional support can be quantitatively evaluated by fill-factor. We currently use glass-fiber with a mass density of ≈ 2 g cm<sup>−3</sup> and 20% fill factor, which result an equivalent radiator weight of ≈ 37 mg.

Integrated circuit based arrays which radiate the fundamental signal frequency have been demonstrated beyond 100 GHz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup>. However, as array frequency increases, their size decreases. This decrease implies higher component density and increased substrate thickness relative to aperture size, both reducing flexibility. Further disincentive to pushing deep into mm-Wave frequencies is the practical consideration that small apertures are much more likely to fit on surfaces without needing flexibility. Rather than a hard upper frequency limit set by the electronics, there is a soft frequency limit above which flexibility is no longer a compelling attribute for a phased array.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Measurement details</title><p id="Par21">The presented arrays are large compared to the radiated wavelength: 30 cm × 30 cm.

Focusing the array inside the range is therefore technically in the radiative near-field (Fresnel). Near-field measurement can be mathematically transformed to far-field patterns, but the near-field focusing leads to sub-optimal far-field patterns. One solution could be to find far-field phase settings on another location and program the antenna back when placed in the range. However this has proven impractical because the antenna flexibility affects the phase setting. Therefore, the antenna broadside pattern was measured once outside the antenna range in order to verify its pattern and EIRP, and the rest of the measurements, which involve multiple automated iterations of phase steering and flexing shapes, rely on near-field focusing. The steering measurements are mathematically converted to the far field, and therefore the far field plots present small differences from the curve they would have assumed, had the focusing point been placed in the far field. Accuracy remains reasonable. The short focusing distance and limited phase sweeping range also limit the accuracy of directivity calculation. The simulated directivity is ~31 dBi for a 256-element array with a separation of 0.6<italic>λ</italic> between the elements. While the half-power beam-width of the measurement is nearly identical to simulation, the near-field calculated directivity is only 24 dBi due to significant power in side lobes. The side lobes decay when the result is transformed to far-field, where the calculated directivity improves to 26.5 dBi, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>f.
