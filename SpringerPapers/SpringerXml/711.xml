One of the major contributors to carbon emissions is transportation sector which survives mostly on conventional energy resources. In the Indian context, the transportation sector contributes about 18% of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of total emissions. To decarbonize this sector, the vehicles utilizing renewable resources such as solar PV technology would be a sustainable step. Solar energy which is abundant in nature and present everywhere can prove to be a great alternative to conventional resources. In the present study, solar PV technology is integrated with electric and hybrid vehicles. Additional literature review of solar electric vehicles including three-wheeled as well as four-wheeled is carried out.
