Herein, we present a low-cost one-pot and one-step approach for the synthesis of both N-doped graphene (NG) and N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) from self-templated organic nanoplates. By varying the FeCl<sub>3</sub> concentration in the precursor, we can control the formation of graphene or CNTs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example for the controllable synthesis of graphene or CNTs by varying the precursors’ compositions. This provides a simple and cost-effective route for the large-scale production of both NG and NCNTs for applications in catalysis. By example, we show how these unique structured nanocarbons can be applied in electrocatalysis for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The obtained NG and NCNTs show excellent ORR activities with long-term stability under alkaline conditions. The unique porous nanostructure, abundant defects, homogeneous N-doping and high N-content in the NG and NCNTs can provide abundant active sites, leading to the excellent ORR performance. This research not only displayed a simple and cost-effective approach for the large-scale production of novel carbon nanoarchitectures, but also revealed the exceptional application potential of these nanocarbons for electrocatalysis.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>22</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>21028</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>15</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep28049.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>27</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep28049" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep28049</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Nanocarbons are a large class of carbonaceous materials with tailored nanoscale dimension and unique structure dependent properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are two classic nanocarbons. Graphene is composed of sp<sup>2</sup> carbons arranged into a two-dimensional (2D) carbon sheet, while CNTs can be considered as that the 2D carbon sheet rolled up into a seamless cylinder with a nanoscale diameter. As representative 1D and 2D nanomaterials, CNTs and graphene have triggered extensive studies in both theoretical and practical aspects. Both graphene and CNTs hold many unprecedented intrinsic properties such as high Young’s modulus, large tensile strength and high electric and thermal conductivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. These intrinsic properties are further coupled with lightweight, high surface area and excellent chemical stability, offering them potential applications in many fields such as electronics, biomedicine, catalysts, composite functional materials and energy storage and conversion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Many methods have been developed for the synthesis of graphene and CNTs, including chemical vapor deposition (CVD), arc discharge and chemical or electrochemical exfoliation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Although the CVD method is successfully to produce large-area single or few layer graphene, it inevitably requires complex facilities and harsh operation conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. While the arc discharge method holds the disadvantages of using specialized facilities and high-cost. Graphene prepared by CVD or arc discharge is not suitable for catalysis applications due to its difficulties in scale up production and high-cost<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The chemical or electrochemical exfoliation methods usually suffer from using toxic chemicals, numerous steps, and low yields<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Thus, large-scale production of both graphene and CNTs with low-cost and high performance is still challenge.</p><p id="Par3">The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is considered as a key process in fuel cells and metal-air batteries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The sluggish ORR is one of the main obstacles to achieve high efficiency in fuel cells. Currently, platinum-based materials are the predominantly used catalysts for ORR, however, their scarcity and high-cost restrict fuel cells for large-scale commercial application<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Many efforts have been devoted to developing alternative catalysts with low-cost and high performance in order to replace the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Among the many alternatives, nanocarbon based metal-free or noble metal-free catalysts are recognized as the most promising candidates for ORR because of their low-cost, good stability and sustainability. As two of the most studied nannocarbons, CNTs and graphene have drawn extensive attentions due to their extraordinary intrinsic properties. Recently, heteroatom doped CNTs or graphene have been demonstrated to be promising precious-metal-free catalysts for ORR. For example, B-doped CNTs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, N-doped CNTs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, and S, N co-doped CNTs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> have been synthesized and found to exhibit an enhanced catalytic activity for ORR as compared to the pristine CNTs. Similarly, graphene doped with various elements such as B, N, P, O and S was also prepared and showed improved ORR catalytic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Among the many doping elements, N is the most widely introduced heteroatom due to its large electronegativity (3.04)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Introduction of N atoms into the carbon networks of CNTs or graphene can change their electronic structure and create charged sites, which are favorable to the molecular adsorption of O<sub>2</sub> and its reduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Herein, we have developed a cost-effective one-pot approach for the synthesis of N-doped graphene (NG) and N-doped CNTs (NCNTs). A self-templated polymer and the mixture of FeCl<sub>3</sub> with the polymer were utilized as precursors for the preparation of the NG and NCNTs, respectively. The obtained NG possesses a well-defined porous structure with large surface area, which is favorable to the mass transfer from both the electrolyte ions to electrode and the electrons to active sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Moreover, the high N content and large surface area of the NG can provide more exposed active sites, which are beneficial to the adsorption of O<sub>2</sub> and its reduction, leading to high ORR activity. Similarly, the obtained NCNTs also show excellent ORR activity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials Characterization</title><p id="Par5">The synthetic process was accomplished through a convenient set-up by annealing the precursors at various temperatures (700–900 °C) under N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). After the annealing process, porous graphene (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>) or CNTs forests were obtained (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>) shows the multilayered morphology of the NG-800 at a large scale and the NG nanosheets are stacked together. Enlarged SEM image (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>) reveals the porous structure of NG with many folds and wrinkles. The there-dimensional (3D) corrugated structure of the NG sheets was also demonstrated by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). Such a 3D structure can provide more contact interfaces, thereby providing more exposed active surface. From the high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM89">Figure S1</xref>), it can be seen that there are many “patched” graphene nanodomains. These carbons can be considered as polycrystalline graphene nanoplatelets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) images (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d–f</xref>) display the homogeneous distribution of N atoms all over the NG nanosheets. Further elemental analysis shows the high N content in the NG-800 with a mass percentage of 11.7%. The N-enrichment precursors, that is, melamine, cyanuric acid and polyethyleneimine (PEI), are responsible for the high N content in the obtained NG. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was applied to verify the surface elements of the NG-800. The presence of N element in the NG-800 is observed at a binding energy of 400.0 eV, as shown in the XPS survey spectra in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM89">Figure S2</xref>. The high resolution N 1s XPS spectrum (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>) is deconvoluted into four peaks located at 397.7, 398.5, 400.5 and 401.9 eV, coresponding to the pyridinic N (N1, 20.9%), pyrrolic N (N2, 19.2%), graphitic N (N3, 43.2%) and oxygenated N (N4, 16.6%), respectively. Among the four types of the N species, the graphitic N is the dominant species, which has been proven to be a key factor to achieve high performance in electrocatalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Raman spectrum (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h</xref>) reveals the characteristic peaks at 1352, 1575, 2820 cm<sup>–1</sup> corresponding to the D, G and 2D band, respectively. The broad D band is indicative of the presence of disorder and defects in the graphene, while the G band is related to the in-plane vibration of the sp<sup>2</sup> carbons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The integrate intensity of I<sub>D</sub>/I<sub>G</sub> ratio is calculated to be about 2.3, which also confirms the presence of defects. And these defects may provide more exposed active sites, which is beneficial to the molecular adsorption and ion-transportation in electrocatalysis. The N<sub>2</sub> adsorption-desorption measurements (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2i</xref>) demonstrate a high Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of the NG-800 (710 m<sup>2</sup>/g) with a large pore volume (1.84 cm<sup>3</sup>/g). The pore size distribution shows the pores are mainly located in the range from several nanometers to a hundred nanometer with a sharp peak located at 3.7 nm. The type-IV isotherm displays the obvious adsorption at high relative pressures (0.5–1.0 P/P<sub>o</sub>), which also confirms the existence of lots of mesopores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The obtained NG-800 possesses a well-defined porous structure with large surface area, which is favorable to the mass transfer from both the electrolyte ions to electrode and the electrons to active sites in electrocatalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The introduced N atoms in combination with the well-organized porosity and high surface area of the NG-800 may offer a great potential to achieve high performance in electrocatalysis.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic illustration of the experimental set-up for the one-pot synthesis of N-doped graphene and N-doped CNTs.

Interestingly, we found that no solid was obtained. As previous report, the annealing of MCA polymer at 550 °C could lead to g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, while g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> will be totally decomposed at temperature above 700 °C, thereby g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> can act as template to form 2D carbon structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The adsorbed PEI on the surface of MCA is carbonized and transformed into graphene nanosheets on account of the confinement by the layered g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Thus, the growth of the porous graphene occurs via a self-templated process by decomposing and carburnization of the PEI-MCA nanoplates.

The mechanisms of the synthesis process of these carbon nanostructures were investigated by using techniques of SEM, TEM, XRD, Raman and XPS. The porous NG are formed via a self-templated approach by the decomposition and carbonization of the polymer nanoplates. While the formation of NCNTs are due to the presence of FeCl<sub>3</sub> in the precursor, in which the Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions were reduced to Fe nanoparticles and act as catalysis for the growth of CNTs. The obtained nanocarbons exhibit very unique structure with many attractive properties such as large surface area, well-organized porosity and abundant introduced N atoms. The results demonstrate the excellent ORR activities of both the NG and NCNTs. The achievement of high performance in electroctalysis by these nanocarbons could be due to their unique nanostructre and properties.
