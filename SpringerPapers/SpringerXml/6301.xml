The diverse metabolism of green microalgae species additionally provides opportunities for recovery of products for feed, food, nutraceutical, cosmetic, and biopharmaceutical industries. Recently, the concept of using microalgae as part of a biorefinery model has been adopted in place of refinery methods focused on recovering one target product. This has led to producers exploring co-production of high value and high volume products in an effort to improve process economics. With numerous potential products and applications, the biomass source or specific strain must be carefully selected to accumulate extractable levels of the target molecule(s). It is additionally imperative to understand the morphology and metabolism of the selected strain to cost-effectively manage all stages of commercial production. This review will focus specifically on microalgae in the division of Chlorophyta, or green algae and their extracellular matrices (ECM), potential for commercial products, and finally describe a holistic approach for biomolecule extraction and recovery. Additionally, cell disruption and fractionation methods for recovery of biomolecules for commercial products are highlighted along with an alternative method, aqueous enzymatic processing for multiple biomolecule extraction and recovery from green microalgae. An emphasis is placed on connecting the morphological characteristics of microalgae ECM or organelle membranes to implications on separation and purification technologies.<fig id="Figa" position="anchor"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40643_2018_199_Figa_HTML.gif" position="anchor" id="MO1"/></fig></p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Microalgae</kwd><kwd>Enzymes</kwd><kwd>Biorefinery</kwd><kwd>Downstream processing</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2018</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2018</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2018</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>16</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/40643_2018_Article_199.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>ReviewPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Chemistry</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Biochemical Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Industrial and Production Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Chemistry and Materials Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par24">Microalgae, a large and diverse group of unicellular photo- and heterotrophic organisms, have significant potential for production of a vast array of valuable products for diverse industries. Microalgae use solar energy, nutrients, and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) to produce proteins, starch, lipids, and other biomolecules. Much research has been conducted in regard to using microalgae biomass as an alternative fuel source, but other valuable products can be sourced from microalgae including bioactive compounds for human health and nutrition (omega-3 fatty acids), biopharmaceutical, cosmetic, and feed industries (Skjånes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">2012</xref>; Mercer and Armenta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2011</xref>). Value-added products include carotenoids; phycobiliprotein pigments; vitamins C, E, and biotin; fatty acids (linolenic, arachidonic, etc.); and recombinant proteins (Converti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2009</xref>).</p><p id="Par25">While microalgae has demonstrated potential as an alternative and sustainable biomass source for biofuels and bioproducts, techno-economic assessments have repeatedly concluded that microalgae-derived fuels, animal feed inputs, and bulk chemicals cannot currently compete with market prices (Chauton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2015</xref>; Benemann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2013</xref>). Central to this barrier to commercialization of microalgal products are the processing techniques used to extract and recover biomolecules. The most critical step to access internally stored biomolecules is cell disruption. Current processes are energy-intensive, expensive, and/or utilize organic solvents, which has significant environmental implications. To improve process economics and promote product commercialization, processes should be robust, energy-efficient, minimize the environmental impact, and maintain product quality. Thus, alternative processing techniques such as enzymatic hydrolysis are being explored for cell disruption. Enzymatic hydrolysis, in addition to serving as pretreatment for cell disruption, can be selectively used for extraction of valuable biomolecules produced in organelles. By employing a strategy whereby algal species are classified based on ECM characteristics, enzymes specifically targeting components found in the ECM can be used to permeabilize and/or lyse the matrix prior to additional processing. Additionally, identifying structural components of organelle membranes can similarly allow for targeted enzymatic hydrolysis of organelles and facilitate extraction of biomolecules. This paper discusses traditional and emerging products and general downstream processing (DSP) of green microalgae and reviews the cell morphology of several microalgae species including <italic>Dunaliella, Haematococcus, Nannochloropsis, Spirulina, Chlorella,</italic> and <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> through classification of their ECM. Additionally, cell disruption and fractionation methods for recovery of biomolecules are discussed along with an alternative processing strategy for multiple biomolecule extraction and recovery from microalgae.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Products and downstream processing</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Commercial products</title><p id="Par26">The first unialgal cultures (<italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic>) were produced in 1890. After 1948, concurrent research efforts into new applications of algal cultures occurred in the United States, Japan, and Germany with a primary focus on algae use for food production (Burlew <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1953</xref>). This research ultimately spurred the first industrial-scale production of <italic>Chlorella</italic> biomass in Japan in the 1960s. Dried whole cells were supplied to research institutes to develop nutritional and medical applications and mass cultivation techniques, which led to the <italic>Chlorella</italic> health food industry known today (Borowitzka <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2013</xref>). This was followed by <italic>Spirulina</italic> production in Mexico in the 1970s and <italic>Dunaliella salina</italic> production in Australia in the mid-1980s (Milledge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2010</xref>). In the 1980s and 1990s, the US Department of Energy funded the Aquatic Species Program with a goal of producing oil and ultimately biofuels from microalgae. The program funding was ultimately cut due to budgetary pressures, but the foundation for generating cost-effective and scalable processing of microalgae into biofuels was set. Although microalgae from biofuels continues to be a primary goal for the research community, other microalgae-derived bioproducts have been commercially developed. Currently, the microalgae product market includes bioactive compounds from a variety of different green microalgae. Genera most commonly used for commercial production include <italic>Dunaliella, Haematococcus, Nannochloropsis, Chlorella</italic>, and <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>. Additionally, the cyanobacterium or blue-green algae <italic>Spirulina</italic> is used for commercial products. The unique metabolisms of selected green microalgae species have been exploited for the production of β-carotene using <italic>Dunaliella</italic>, astaxanthin using <italic>Haematococcus pluvialis</italic>, Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) from <italic>Nannochloropsis</italic> species, components of animal feed formulation from <italic>Spirulina</italic>, human health products from <italic>Chlorella</italic> species, and cosmetics and biofuel feedstock sourced from multiple green microalgae species. In many instances, the aforementioned microalgae species are manipulated during the cultivation stage to redirect their metabolisms toward production or accumulation of valuable products at the expense of diminished cell growth.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>β-Carotene from <italic>Dunaliella</italic></title><p id="Par27">β-Carotene is a provitamin A carotenoid with success as a natural food pigment, coloring agent, or health food (Markou and Nerantzis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2013</xref>) and has additionally been recognized for its antioxidant properties and role as an essential nutrient (Singh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">2016</xref>). The carotenoid is non-polar; lipophilic; insoluble in water, acids, and alkalis; but soluble in benzene, chloroform, and carbon disulfide. The halotolerant microalgae, <italic>Dunaliella salina</italic>, is used for the commercial production of 8.5–30% of the global β-carotene supply per year (Ericksen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par28">By the year 2018, the global market for β-carotene is expected to be US$334 million (BCC Research <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2011</xref>). Global producers include companies in Australia, Israel, India, and China. β-Carotene can comprise up to 14% dry weight of <italic>D. salina</italic> and accumulates within lipid globules in the chloroplast interthylakoid space (Markou and Nerantzis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2013</xref>; Shariati and Hadi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">2011</xref>) under stress parameters including high salinity, high temperature, high light, and nutrient limitation (Haghjou and Shariati <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2007</xref>; Nguyen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">2016</xref>). Since β-carotene accumulates under suboptimal growth conditions, manufacturers must establish a balance between biomass production and product accumulation. Biomass production can be “intensive” in which all cultivation factors are controlled to affect cell growth and chemistry or “extensive” in which growth is slowed down via cultivation in a brine solution to promote β-carotene accumulation (Raja et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">2007</xref>). Extensive production occurs in large unstirred outdoor ponds while intensive production occurs in paddle wheel stirred raceway ponds (Borowitzka <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1990</xref>). Harvesting and dewatering strategies for <italic>D. salina</italic> are complicated by the lack of a protective cell wall and natural buoyancy. Successful lab- and pilot-scale strategies for harvesting include high pH-induced flocculation–flotation and membrane filtration (Besson and Guiraud <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2013</xref>; Monte et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">2018</xref>). Extraction of β-carotene commercially can occur via traditional solvent extraction, but concerns about toxicity and residuals limit market acceptance. Patented, commercial extraction methods include supercritical CO<sub>2</sub>, biomass saponification followed by solvent extraction, or hot oil extraction (Borowitzka and Borowitzka <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1990</xref>). Other extraction methods include edible oil (vegetable oil) extraction, microwave-assisted extraction, ultrasound-assisted extraction (Kyriakopoulou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2015</xref>), and “milking” <italic>D. salina</italic> in closed photobioreactors (PBR) with the addition of an organic phase (dodecane) (Kleinegris et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Astaxanthin from <italic>Haematococcus pluvialis</italic></title><p id="Par29">Astaxanthin is a carotenoid used as a natural pigment source for aquaculture with antioxidant activities and human health implications in skin cancer pathogenesis, coronary heart disease, and infection resistance (Yaakob et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179">2014</xref>). The global astaxanthin market is predicted to be US$1.1 billion by 2020 (Industry Experts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2015</xref>). <italic>Haematococcus pluvialis</italic> is used to produce 280 metric tons of astaxanthin annually which accounts for &lt; 1% of the global market with the remaining astaxanthin sourced from other marine life, <italic>Phaffia</italic> yeast, <italic>Paracoccus</italic> bacteria, or chemical synthesis (Panis and Carreon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">2016</xref>). Astaxanthin is polar, lipophilic, and soluble in acetone, acetic acid, chloroform, pyridine, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (with heat application) (Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2008</xref>).</p><p id="Par30">Commercially, <italic>Haematococcus pluvialis</italic> is grown in indoor and outdoor PBR or hybrid pond–PBR systems to control contamination. Typically, a two-step cultivation process is used including accumulation of vegetative cells in optimal growth conditions followed by exposure to suboptimal environmental or nutrient stresses (Sarada et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">2002</xref>). During stress conditions, vegetative cells become hematocysts and accumulate astaxanthin to 1.5–3.0% dry weight (Shah et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">2016</xref>). The cells are then harvested via settling and centrifugation, disrupted rapidly with homogenization or ultrasonication to retain astaxanthin integrity, and cracked or pulverized to enhance extraction and recovery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Biofuels</title><p id="Par31">The high lipid and carbohydrate content of green microalgae confers the possibility of conversion to biofuels (Sahay and Braganza <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">2016</xref>) including biodiesel, bioethanol, biomethane, and bio-oil (Lam and Lee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2012</xref>). <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> and <italic>Nannochloropsis oculata</italic> have been successfully used for the production of biodiesel while <italic>Chlorella</italic>, <italic>Dunaliella</italic>, <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, <italic>Scenedesmus</italic>, and <italic>Spirulina</italic> sp. are all considered good candidates for bioethanol production. Additionally, <italic>Chlorella</italic> and <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> sp. can be used for biogas production. Production begins with accumulation of lipid-rich algal biomass and is followed by harvesting, dewatering, lipids/sugar extraction and conversion, and additional processing of biomass for valuable co-products (Sing et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">2013</xref>). Flocculation and subsequent flotation are commonly used for harvesting microalgae for biofuels because this technique can handle the diversity in shape, size, specific weight, and surface charge of various microalgae cells. Following harvesting and dewatering, microalgae are subject to cell disruption or pretreatment strategies. Cells can be mechanically pressed for access to lipid precursors of biodiesel or bio-oil or enzymatically hydrolyzed for access to fermentable sugars for bioethanol. Lipids are extracted with conventional solvents, green solvents, subcritical water, supercritical CO<sub>2</sub>, or co-solvent mixtures (ionic liquids/polar covalent molecules) (Sing et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">2013</xref>). Lipids are converted to biodiesel via transesterification, pyrolysis, or hydrogenation. Enzymatic saccharification hydrolyzes carbohydrates into simple sugars that are then fermented to bioethanol (Hernández et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2015</xref>). Hydrothermal liquefaction is used to produce bio-oil from microalgae in an aqueous conversion environment with no prior drying (Guo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2015</xref>). Microalgae biofuels are advantageous due to the high oil content of various species and the cultivation time. Additionally, one species can be used for multiple fuels (i.e., biodiesel produced from lipids and bioethanol production from lipid-depleted residual biomass) (Gutiérrez-Arriaga et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2014</xref>). Challenges for widespread commercialization of microalgae biofuels include the diversity in size and morphology of lipid-producing algae strains, harvest of dilute algae suspensions, and translation of laboratory- and pilot-scale techniques for commercial operations. Additionally, harvesting and dewatering operations greatly impact economically feasibility (Wu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR177">2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) from <italic>Nannochloropsis</italic></title><p id="Par32">Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is a marine-derived omega-3 fatty acid and essential fat with various human health applications (Swanson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">2012</xref>). The 2016 global market for omega-3 products is US$34.7 billion (Packaged Facts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">2012</xref>). The current source of EPA is mainly fish oil, but <italic>Nannochloropsis</italic> species are promising alternative producers (Chauton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2015</xref>) as they can produce EPA to levels of 1.1–12% dry weight depending on culturing conditions (Ma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2016</xref>; Camacho-Rodríguez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2013</xref>; Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">b</xref>). On a commercial scale, <italic>Nannochloropsis</italic> sp. are cultivated photoautotrophically using natural light and carbon dioxide from power plants or flue gas in raceway ponds. The microalgae can additionally be grown heterotrophically and mixotrophically, but on a smaller bench- or pilot-scale. Following culturing, algae cells are separated from media via filtration, flocculation, or centrifugation and then dried. EPA is extracted via solvent (hexane), refined by degumming, bleaching, or deodorization, and encapsulated (Adarme-Vega et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Animal feed formulation with <italic>Spirulina</italic></title><p id="Par33">As an edible microalgae, <italic>Spirulina</italic> is not only a human food supplement, but also valuable as an animal feed formulation component due to its high protein (60–70% dry weight), vitamin, and mineral contents (Harun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2010</xref>). Global production as of 2010 was 5000 metric ton/year (Norsker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2011</xref>) with producers in the United States, China, India, and Chile.

Microalgae-derived bioplastics are a combination of microalgae biomass and polymers/additives that are molded or extruded into their final form (articles, sheets, and films). Bioplastics from microalgae are used in the packaging, catering, gardening, medical, and automotive industries (Rajendran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">2012</xref>) and can be classified as hybrid-based plastics, cellulose-based plastics, polylactic acid, or biopolyethylene (Beetul et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2016</xref>). <italic>Spirulina</italic> and <italic>Chlorella</italic> are commonly used for bioplastic production based on their small cell size and protein composition that allows for conversion to bioplastics without prior treatment (Zeller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR186">2013</xref>). Microalgae biomass and proteins are converted into bioplastics through a process of denaturation/digestion/fermentation, plasticization, blending, and compatibilization (Wang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">2014</xref>). Plasticization improves flexibility and durability through the addition of non-volatile, organic molecules such as glycerol, sorbitol, saccharose, urea, triethylene glycol, or polyethylene glycol. Blending mixes compatible polymers such as polyethylene or poly(vinyl alcohol) to the plasticized biomass and compatibilization stabilizes the blended polymers by modifying their interfacial properties. After compatibilization, the bioplastics are molded or extruded with heat and pressure. Microalgae-derived bioplastics have relatively simple production procedures and unlike soy or other common feedstocks for bioplastics, use of microalgae has less impact on food supply (Wang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">2014</xref>).

A biorefinery model is increasingly employed whereby biomass is converted into products for different industries to maximize biomass utilization and minimize residual waste (Zhu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR189">2015</xref>). In addition, microalgae producers are exploring co-production of high value and high volume products in an effort to improve process economics (Barbosa and Wijffels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2015</xref>) and increase product range.</p><p id="Par44">Life cycle assessment studies have previously concluded that producing algal biomass with the sole intent of using the accumulated lipids (or starch) for biofuel production is not environmentally (Gnansounou and Raman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2016</xref>) or economically (Soratana et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">2014</xref>) advantageous.

To improve product (target biomolecule) accumulation, candidate algae strains have been genetically manipulated (Singh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">2016</xref>). With the accumulation of multiple products, producers will need to incorporate methods for assessing the effects of manipulating microalgae metabolism on cultivation strategies.

Commercially, green microalgae can be cultivated in open raceway ponds, photobioreactors, or hybrid systems. Open raceway ponds are cost-effective but prone to contamination, low biomass productivity, and low utilization of CO<sub>2</sub> due to constant evaporation (Tan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">2018</xref>). The ponds are also subject to limited light penetration due to dark zones and inadequate mixing. Photobioreactors allow for bulk quantity microalgae production, are less prone to contamination, and require less land for cultivation. Conversely, photobioreactors are much more costly, difficult to clean, and can experience a buildup of dissolved oxygen (Narala et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">2016</xref>; Tan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">2018</xref>). Cultivation can also occur with a combination or hybrid blend of open raceway ponds and photobioreactors that can reduce cost and improve productivity. With hybrid cultivation strategies, a dense inoculum is produced in photobioreactors with minimized risk for contamination and then introduced in raceway ponds for continued cultivation and biomass production (Tan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">2018</xref>). Hybrid cultivation is an interesting strategy for species that accumulate products in nutrient deficient or deplete conditions as photobioreactors can be used for vegetative growth and raceway ponds can be used for bioproduct accumulation (Narala et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par47">Harvesting includes solid–liquid separation by centrifugation, filtration, or gravity sedimentation (Barros et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2015</xref>) and due to the high volume of algal cultures being processed, this step is often considered to be a processing bottleneck. In fact, harvesting combined with dewatering can account for 20–30% of biomass production costs (Zhu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR189">2015</xref>). To enhance harvesting efficiency via solid–liquid separation, cells can be flocculated by chemical, electroflocculation, and bioflocculation techniques (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2015</xref>). For chemical flocculation, salts (e.g., aluminum sulfate and poly aluminum chloride) or polymers (e.g., polyacrylamide and chitosan) are added to change the surface charge of microalgae (Wan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">2015</xref>). Electroflocculation also modifies surface charge, but the process generates metal ions via a metal electrode instead of metal salts (Pearsall et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">2011</xref>). Bioflocculants are derived from bacteria, fungi, or the microalgae itself (self-flocculation). In this case, the microorganism can be added to the microalgae culture or co-cultured with the microalgae. The flocculants associate with the microalgae cell surface resulting in mixed microalgae–microorganism flocs that can be harvested (Vandamme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par48">Secondary dewatering by centrifugation or filtration is often performed to minimize the processing volume, concentrate the algal slurry, and drastically reduce the water content (Barros et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2015</xref>).

Thermal cell disruption can occur via microwave treatment, autoclaving, or freezing. Chemical cell disruption methods include organic solvent treatment, osmotic shock, and acid–alkali reactions. Biological cell disruption occurs by microbial degradation or enzymatic hydrolysis.

Existing downstream processing operations are primarily designed for the extraction and recovery of one target molecule (proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, pigments, etc.). Soluble protein extraction after cell disruption consists of lysate conditioning (pH and/or conductivity adjustment), centrifugation of cell lysate, and recovery of supernatant. Lipid extraction involves mechanical pressing, homogenization, milling, and lipophilic solvent extraction (Cuellar-Bermudez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2014</xref>). Prior cell drying or cell disruption is necessary for current industrial-scale extractions because unruptured cells do not permit solvent access to the internally stored lipids. Carbohydrate extraction requires an enzymatic or acidic pretreatment while pigment extraction occurs via conventional solvents, supercritical fluids, or pressurized liquids (Nobre et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par51">After extraction, clarification, capture/purification, and any necessary polishing steps are performed to obtain the final product.

Capture and purification occurs mostly for protein products used for human therapeutic, cosmetic, or nutraceutical purposes (Milne <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2017</xref>). Chromatographic operations and/or precipitation steps are commonly used to purify and concentrate proteins.</p><p id="Par52">For carbohydrates and lipids, conversion is necessary. Carbohydrates are converted to simple sugars via saccharification followed by fermentation into various biofuels such as bioethanol and biobutanol (Hernández et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2015</xref>). Likewise, lipids undergo transesterification to form biodiesel and byproducts (Zhu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR190">2017</xref>).

The overwhelming hurdle identified to widespread commercial production of microalgae as a bio-feedstock is the cultivation and harvesting strategy employed (Barsanti and Gualtieri <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2018</xref>; Chia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2018</xref>; Beal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2015</xref>). It has been repeatedly concluded that cultivation in photobioreactors is more costly than open raceway ponds in terms of capital investment, but when downstream processing costs are considered, the higher cell densities achievable in photobioreactors are more economically advantageous (Davis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2011</xref>). Harvesting and dewatering are time and energy-intensive steps and can account for anywhere between 10 and 50% of total operating costs due to the dilute nature of algae suspensions and large process volume (Barsanti and Gualtieri <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2018</xref>; t’Lam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">2018</xref>; Ríos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">2013</xref>).

The economics of subsequent DSP steps including cell disruption, extraction, and purification are not readily reported in literature but identified bottlenecks include overall sustainability related to energy costs and environmental impacts (Barsanti and Gualtieri <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par54">As much of the literature regarding economic evaluation of microalgae production schemes has reported on biofuels, there is a consensus that high value co-products have the potential to increase the total value of microalgae biomass (t’Lam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">2018</xref>). While a complete microalgae biorefinery process is not yet possible, there have been production facilities attempting to integrate a biorefinery concept into their business model whereby multiple high value compounds are produced in lower volumes rather than using microalgae solely for biofuel production (Barsanti and Gualtieri <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2018</xref>). In order for the biorefinery concept to be a profitable enterprise, simple and effective alternatives to the traditional process operations much be employed. As the research into these alternatives is currently occurring in academia and industry, the field as a whole would benefit from economic modeling and evaluation of downstream processing operations and sensitivity analyses to readily assess potential commercial utility of novel approaches to cell disruption and extraction of multiple bioproducts. While downstream processing includes steps such as harvesting, dewatering or drying, cell disruption, extraction, fractionation, and purification, properties (cell morphology, product localization, and physiochemistry) of the target biomolecule must be considered.

The above cell wall structure described for <italic>Haematococcus</italic> cells is for the mature red cyst with high astaxanthin content as this is the most common morphology encountered during the processing of <italic>H. pluvialis</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Traditional ECM disruption techniques</title><p id="Par60">As noted, the ECM or outermost layer must be disrupted to extract and recover biomolecules. Current cell disruption processes involve the use of energy-intensive equipment, high temperature (&gt; 50 °C) treatments, organic solvents, or highly acidic or basic buffers that can potentially decrease product extractability (Wilken and Nikolov <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175">2016</xref>). Cell disruption methods can be largely classified into two groups: mechanical and non-mechanical. Mechanical methods include bead beating, high pressure or high shear homogenization, ultrasonication, and pulsed electric field. Generally speaking, mechanical methods are less specific to the type of microalgae but are more energy-intensive than non-mechanical methods (Lee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2012</xref>). The non-mechanical disruption techniques can be further divided into thermal, chemical, or biological methods (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Chemical disruption while not energy-intensive involves the use of toxic solvents and is not suitable for industrial-scale processing (Show et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">2015</xref>). Likewise, biological disruption is a generally regarded as safe (GRAS) process but is not presently cost-effective (Vanthoor-Koopmans et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">2013</xref>; Günerken et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2015</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Cell disruption alternatives</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40643_2018_199_Fig2_HTML.gif" id="MO3"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Mechanical methods</title><sec id="Sec22"><title>Bead beating</title><p id="Par61">Bead beating is the transfer of energy from small beads made of glass, ceramics, or steel to the microalgae cell with mechanical agitation. The cell disruption occurs via compaction or solid shearing when a collision zone between beads is created. Advantages of bead beating include high disruption efficiency, high throughput, reproducibility, and temperature control (Günerken et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2015</xref>; Al hattab and Ghaly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2015</xref>). While this mechanical disruption is regarded for its high efficiency, high energy consumption and costs reduce the applicability of bead beating for microalgae cell disruption. Additional disadvantages include the creation of small cell debris and dispersion of lysate in both the soluble and solid phases, increasing downstream processing costs. Bead beating is most suitable for highly concentrated solutions with products that are easily separated or fractionated after disruption (Show et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">2015</xref>). This technique is applicable for disruption of multiple green microalgae species but particularly advantageous for thick-walled or recalcitrant species such as <italic>Nannochloropsis</italic> and <italic>Chlorella</italic>. Processors should note that while application of bead beating will disrupt these species, the resultant lysate will be difficult to fractionate as part of a biorefinery model.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>High pressure homogenization</title><p id="Par62">High pressure homogenization (HPH) is the pumping or movement of a slurry or cell suspension through a valve at high velocity resulting in shear forces that disrupt cell walls and membranes (Show et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">2015</xref>; Günerken et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2015</xref>). Advantages include scalability and reproducibility and being chemical/enzyme/toxic substance (solvent) free (GEA Niro Soavi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2011</xref>). Disadvantages of HPH include the need for low dry cell weight concentrations (dilute suspensions) which increase energy demand (Lee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2012</xref>) and the creation of small cell debris which increases separation costs (Barba et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2015</xref>). HPH is commonly used for disruption of <italic>Haematococcus</italic> cells for fish feed formulations (Chisti and Moo-Young <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1986</xref>). Additionally, species containing cellulose, algaenan, or sporopollenin such as <italic>Chlorella</italic> and <italic>Nannocholorpsis</italic> could be disrupted with HPH. While HPH has proven utility in large-scale operation, high energy demands may limit the technique to recovery of high value products (Yap et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR181">2015</xref>). HPH could additionally be applicable when cell lysates will be included as part of feed formulation and don’t require component fractionation. The technique is also suitable for cells with ECM that are thick-walled, exhibit limited permeability, and are resistant to lower energy mechanical treatments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>High shear homogenization</title><p id="Par63">High shear homogenization (HSH) is the stirring or mixing of cell suspension at high speed. Hydrodynamic cavitation and shear forces at solid–liquid interfaces disrupt cells prior to subsequent processing. The repeated suction of the cell suspension through the apparatus and subsequent exit through holes at the end of the stator tip results in reduced cellular tissue size. The processing time for HSH is short and high dry cell weight concentrations can be tolerated (Günerken et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2015</xref>). Disadvantages include the aggressive nature of the cell disruption and the difficulties of scaling HSH rotor–stator apparatus for industrial or commercial scale use. Like HPH, HSH is applicable to multiple green microalgae species but particularly suited for <italic>Chlorella</italic> and <italic>Nannocholorpsis</italic>. These species have multilayered ECM rich in polysaccharides and at present are usually used for one target biomolecule. Application of HSH is not ideal for a biorefinery processing model due to the complexity of the resulting cell extracts, which negatively impacts subsequent separation methods, but could be advantageous for cell disruption prior to protein extraction in <italic>Chlorella</italic> sp. or lipid extraction in <italic>Nannochloropsis</italic> sp.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Ultrasonication</title><p id="Par64">Ultrasonication is the application of high frequency acoustic waves for the disruption of cell walls and membranes. Disruption occurs via two mechanisms: cavitation and acoustic streaming (Gerde et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2012</xref>). Ultrasound vibrations from the emitting tip can promote cavitation or microbubbles that expand and explode to disrupt surrounding material. In acoustic streaming, the solution is mixed resulting in liquid currents with turbulence that disrupts cellular material. Ultrasonic treatment can disrupt at low temperatures and does not require additional disruption components like beads or chemicals (Al hattab and Ghaly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2015</xref>; Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">2014</xref>). Disadvantages include energy consumption, heat production (protein/metabolite denaturation), and inefficiency of disruption of certain algae species. Ultrasonication has been particularly favored for disruption of <italic>Spirulina</italic> which has an overall weak ECM but can be applied for disruption of <italic>Chlorella</italic>, <italic>Nannochloropsis</italic>, <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, and <italic>Haematococcus</italic> sp. In the later cases, ultrasonic treatment is combined with detergent treatment or solvent systems for increased efficiency and decreased cost demands (Günerken et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Pulsed electric field</title><p id="Par65">Pulsed electric field (PEF) treatment is the application of short periods (microseconds) of high voltage electric pulses into cell suspensions situated between two electrodes (Zbinden et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR184">2013</xref>). Lysed or permeated cell walls and membranes occur through electroporation-associated permeation or pore formation in response to high transmembrane voltage. Pore formation occurs and can be reversible or irreversible depending on PEF intensity (Joannes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2015</xref>). The degree of pore formation is dependent on electric field strength, shape/type of pulse, treatment time, and number or pulses (Zbinden et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR184">2013</xref>; Goettel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2013</xref>). Above a certain PEF intensity, reversible pore formation become irreversible wall/membrane disruption (Zderic et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185">2013</xref>). PEF is considered a minimally invasive or gentle disruption technique with advantages including scalability and combination with other disruption treatments. Disadvantages of PEF treatment include the need to deionize solutions for treatment and a decrease in efficiency upon release of internal cellular compounds (Günerken et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2015</xref>). PEF has broad applicability within green microalgae species such as <italic>Nannochloropsis</italic>, <italic>Haematococcus</italic>, <italic>Chlorella</italic>, and <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> as its efficiency can be optimized in terms of energy and electric field strength to permeabilize and/or partially disrupt various ECM composition. As such, PEF is a technique that can be integrated into a biorefinery process, and when combined with other techniques resulting in complete ECM lysis allow for selective bioproduct extraction at later stages.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Non-mechanical methods</title><sec id="Sec28"><title>Microwave treatment</title><p id="Par66">Microwave treatment is the uniform, non-contact heating of cellular suspensions that results in moisture evaporation and high pressure bubbles that disrupt cells (Barba et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2015</xref>; Iqbal and Theegala <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2013</xref>). Heat in the cell suspension results from rotation and vibration of dipolar molecules and ions in an electromagnetic field (Biller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2013</xref>). Advantages include short residence/processing time, scalability, high efficiency, low energy consumption, and low risk of metabolite denaturation (Günerken et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2015</xref>; Biller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2013</xref>; Pasquet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2011</xref>). Disadvantages include maintenance costs for industrial-scale treatment and need for cooling to maintain product integrity before continued processing (Al hattab and Ghaly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2015</xref>). Microwave treatment is often combined with other disruption techniques to promote not only disruption but microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) of valuable products. In particular, microwave treatment is commonly applied to <italic>Nannochloropsis</italic> and <italic>Chlorella</italic> sp. for extraction of lipids but is broadly applicable to many species for ECM disruption. The resultant lysate would likely be difficult to fractionate as part of a biorefinery process and thus microwave treatment is primarily used when biomass is intended for extraction of one molecule.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Freezing/unfreezing</title><p id="Par67">Freezing treatment or freeze–thaw cycles allow for the repeated formation of large intracellular ice crystals that promote pore formation in cell walls and membranes that rupture cells, releasing intracellular compounds (Lee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2012</xref>). Freezing can occur slowly in a − 15 to − 80 °C environment or rapidly using liquid nitrogen. Thawing is usually a slow process occurring at room temperature (Henriques et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2007</xref>). Freezing and thawing for the purpose of cell disruption are associated with high energy consumption and operational/maintenance costs. Additionally, the process is not easily scaled due to treatment or residence times required and the size of freezers necessary for industrial-scale processes. Conversely, this disruption technique does not generate heat and is often utilized at smaller scale for heat-sensitive materials. Freeze–thaw procedures are likely applicable to green microalgae species without a cell wall (<italic>Dunaliella</italic>) or a fibrillary (cellulose) cell wall (<italic>Chlamydomonas, Chlorella, and Spirulina</italic>). In these instances, a number of freeze–thaw cycles could be employed to disrupt the cell membrane or one or more layers of a stratified cell wall structure while still allowing for selective extraction of biomolecules at a later processing step.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Chemical application</title><p id="Par68">The application of solvents to microalgae is commonly used for lipid or carotenoid extraction, but can be used in coupled cell disruption–extraction procedures. The application of solvents like ethanol, methanol, chloroform, or hexane can have an enhancing effect on cell disruption when cells have been treated with another mechanical or chemical disruption technique. While sparse literature exists on solvent treatment alone, the effectiveness of solvents on disrupted cells is well documented and commonly used method for industrial-scale operations.</p><p id="Par69">Additional chemicals used for cell disruption include acidic solutions (hydrochloric and sulfuric acid), alkaline substances (lime or sodium hydroxide) (Harun and Danquah <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2011</xref>), lysine, acetone, methanol, or DMSO (Steriti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">2014</xref>) which are typically added to cells at high temperatures (120–160 °C). Advantages of chemical treatment of cells for disruption include low energy input and scalability (Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2013</xref>). However, chemical application is not considered to be mild and can have detrimental effects including pigment degradation and protein denaturation. Additional disadvantages include the need for a continuous supply of chemical/solvent, corrosion of equipment by acids or alkalis, and chemical disposal (Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2013</xref>).

The stress produced can be hyperosmotic in which cells shrink due to fluid diffusion to the exterior of the cell or hypoosmotic in which cells swell and burst in response to fluid diffusion into the cell. Salts commonly used for osmotic shock disruption include sorbitol and sodium chloride (Bickerton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2016</xref>; Drira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2017</xref>).

Use of osmotic shock for green microalgae cell disruption isn’t ECM dependent but freshwater species should be exposed to hypertonic conditions and marine species to hypotonic conditions (Yoo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182">2012</xref>). For bioproduct extraction, hypotonic conditions are ideal but disadvantages include inefficiency and the high salinity of resulting wastewater.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Algicidal microorganisms</title><p id="Par71">Algicidal microorganisms, previously used for mitigating algal blooms (Bai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2012</xref>), can be applied to microalgae cultures for cell wall/membrane disruption and degradation thought to occur via enzymatic reaction (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">b</xref>; Munoz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">2014</xref>; Lü et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2013</xref>). Microorganisms (bacteria, cyanobacteria, microalgae themselves, and viruses), co-cultured with microalgae, secrete lytic enzymes to disrupt the cell wall. Interestingly, the co-cultured organisms can be isolated from known microalgae predators and previous work has demonstrated a degree of selectivity and specificity that can be achieved using predator-derived organisms. <italic>Chlorella</italic>, <italic>Nannochloropsis,</italic> and <italic>Dunaliella</italic> species have been successfully disrupted using this technique (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">b</xref>; Wang and Yuan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">2014</xref>; Lenneman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2014</xref>). Advantages of algicidal lysis include cost, elimination of need for external enzyme application during downstream processing, high selectivity, and mild extraction conditions (pH, temperature, etc.) (Demuez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2015</xref>). Disadvantages include the need for careful selection of microorganisms, difficulties in establishing optimized co-culturing techniques, and controlling the degree of disruption.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Enzymatic hydrolysis for ECM disruption</title><p id="Par72">The above described mechanical and non-mechanical cell disruption techniques are typically employed as part of a process that focuses on the recovery of one target biomolecule while wasting or inadvertently damaging other potentially valuable biomass components. This highlights the need for selective and targeted disruption of the microalgae cell for recovery of multiple biomolecules. One solution that allows for a biorefinery approach to microalgae biomass processing is enzymatic hydrolysis. Enzymatic hydrolysis of microalgae cell walls and membranes is a mild disruption alternative that allows for processing conditions (mild temperatures, neutral pH, no contact with organic solvent) that maintain the quality and yield of multiple biomolecules. The targeted nature of an enzyme to a specific substrate plays a prominent role in selective disruption and extraction in addition to protecting target biomolecule integrity throughout the disruption process. Potential limitations include the cost of commercial enzymes, lack of knowledge about optimal or compatible enzyme formulations for cell disruption, and the requirement for holding tanks to accommodate long incubation periods (Günerken et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2015</xref>). Enzyme immobilization or removal following disruption is also necessary for some high value product formulations. As highlighted in “<xref rid="Sec19" ref-type="sec">The diversity of extracellular matrices</xref>” section, microalgae have vastly diverse ECM but are generally composed of proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. Thus, enzymes targeting each of these components have potential for disrupting the microalgae cell.</p><sec id="Sec34"><title>Proteases</title><p id="Par73">Proteases, an enzyme group that breaks down or cleaves proteins, specifically target amino acid sequence motifs. There are seven families of proteases including serine, cysteine, threonine, aspartic, glutamic, metallo-, and asparagine. Proteases can act near the end of polypeptide chain (exopeptidase) or within the chain (endopeptidase). Protease activity is largely dependent on pH and temperature and varies widely from one enzyme to another. Common proteases with potential for microalgae cell wall/membrane disruption include trypsin, lysozyme, collagenases, papain, and autolysins (Gerken et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2013</xref>; Mahdy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2014a</xref>; Horst et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2012</xref>). Preliminary screening of enzymes indicated that proteases may catalyze cell wall disruption for <italic>C. vulgaris</italic> cells (Mahdy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2014b</xref>).

This enzyme group includes glucosidases, galactosidases, amylases, cellulases, chitinases, and pectinases among many others. A common application of carbohydrases in microalgae processing is for saccharification prior to fermentation of simple sugars for biofuel production. As the green microalgae cell wall and/or membrane often contain various polysaccharides, carbohydrase cocktails with multiple enzyme activities are employed to break down the complex polysaccharides. Like proteases, optimum conditions for carbohydrases vary widely depending on type and organism source and selected conditions greatly influence enzyme activity. Horst et al.

Phospholipase B cleaves both acyl chains and phospholipase C and phospholipase D cleave before and after the phosphate, respectively. Like most cell membranes, the main lipid component of microalgae membranes are phospholipids. Thus, phospholipases have potential applicability in disrupting microalgae cell membranes. Phospholipase conditions for optimum activity are between pH 7.0–9.0 and 25–37 °C.

In green microalgae, the chloroplast and lipid droplets are common storage sites of biomolecules and the morphology of each along with cell disruption methods are discussed in the following sections.</p><sec id="Sec39"><title>Chloroplast structure and disruption strategies</title><p id="Par79">The chloroplasts of green microalgae are the site of photosynthesis and carbon fixation (Engel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2015</xref>) and thus, the chloroplast has a great capacity for accumulation of endogenous proteins, starch, lipids, and pigment/carotenoids (Franklin and Mayfield <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2005</xref>). Additionally, green microalgae have well-developed genetic engineering toolkits and can be engineered to produce high value “foreign” or recombinant proteins along with high volume products (lipids) within the chloroplast.</p><p id="Par80">Understanding morphology and internal structure allows for appropriate selection of disruption techniques for recovery of products from the chloroplast. Microalgae chloroplasts can occupy a large percentage of total cell volume (up to 60%) and are usually cup or basal shaped (Munoz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">2014</xref>). The chloroplast is generally surrounded by a double envelope membrane and composed internally of thylakoids in bands stacked in irregular patterns. Thylakoids are rich in protein but have membranes dominated by lipids (Simionato et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">2013</xref>). Other components of microalgae chloroplast include photosynthetic pigments, chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> and chlorophyll <italic>b</italic>, and carotenoids α- and β-carotene and xanthophylls such as astaxanthin, lutein, zeaxanthin, and neoxanthin (Gong and Bassi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2016</xref>; D’Alessandro and Filho <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par81">Previous research into disruption of green microalgae chloroplasts has been for purposes including studying chloroplast proteins, exploring chloroplast DNA and protein synthesis processes, and for identifying proteins induced under specific culturing conditions (Balczun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2006</xref>; Bayer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2015</xref>; Flores-Pérez and Jarvis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2017</xref>). In these instances, researchers isolated intact chloroplasts and then disrupted the organelles using techniques such as freeze–thaw rupture, enzymatic hydrolysis with trypsin and chymotrypsin, and osmotic shock with hypotonic lysis buffers (Bayer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2015</xref>; Flores-Pérez and Jarvis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2017</xref>). When the chloroplast is disrupted for the purpose of microalgae biorefining, the proteinaceous nature of the outermost membrane can be targeted using a biological-based disruption technique like enzymatic hydrolysis. While use of enzymes for biorefining microalgae is in the development phase, the selective nature of enzymatic hydrolysis has obvious advantages to current chloroplast lysis techniques such as freeze–thaw rupture and osmotic shock. These methods would likely result in a complex lysate requiring additional fractionation steps.</p><p id="Par82">While the protein composition in the membrane can be diverse, general use proteases or cocktail mixtures can potentially cleave and digest peptide bonds. Trypsin, a general serine protease, can cleave various protein substrates. The relatively mild conditions to achieve optimum activity make trypsin a viable candidate for targeting microalgae organelles, particularly the chloroplast. Metalloproteases, which have reported lytic activity against cell walls (Wu and Chen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR176">2011</xref>), also have potential in enzymatic hydrolysis of organelle membranes. Bacterial proteases with endopeptidase activities in the neutral pH range can cleave proteins from a variety of sources which could likely include the membranes of microalgae chloroplasts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec40"><title>Lipid droplet structure and disruption strategies</title><p id="Par83">Within the microalgae cell, lipid droplets (LD) are the major site of neutral lipid storage (Goold et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2014</xref>) and additionally contain valuable products such as carotenoids and pigments. Under nitrogen-replete conditions, green microalgae contain one or two lipid droplets but LD synthesis and accumulation are activated in the presence of stress conditions including nutrient depletion (-N, -Fe, -S, -P), high light, hypoxia, increased salinity, or chemical application (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">2009</xref>). When stress conditions persist, a metabolic shift or reorganization occurs which leads to the formation of carbon reserves (starch and oil) and a downregulation of photosynthesis and protein synthesis.</p><p id="Par84">The LD comprised a core of triacylglycerols surrounded by a monolayer of polar lipids and proteins interspersed throughout (Goold et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2014</xref>). For many microalgae species, the major proteins in the LD membrane are generally hydrophobic, maintain the size/structure of LD, and prevent fusion of multiple LD (Moellering and Benning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2009</xref>). In <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> and <italic>D. salina</italic>, the most abundant LD membrane protein has been termed major lipid droplet protein (MLDP) (James et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2011</xref>; Davidi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2012</xref>) while those in <italic>H. pluvialis</italic> and <italic>Nannochloropsis</italic> sp. have been termed <italic>Haematococcus</italic> oil globule protein (HOGP) and lipid droplet surface protein (LDSP), respectively (Peled et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">2011</xref>; Vieler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">2012</xref>). <italic>Chlorella</italic> sp. contain a homolog of caleosin, an oil-body surface protein found in higher plants, as the most abundant protein in their LD (Lin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2012</xref>).</p><p id="Par85">Expellers, presses, or lipophilic solvents are used to disrupt LD and access encased lipids or carotenoids but require prior drying of microalgal biomass (Mubarak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">2015</xref>). These methods are additionally disadvantageous because of slow processing times and the requirement of large biomass quantities (Harun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2010</xref>). Lipophilic solvents can be polar or non-polar and include <italic>n</italic>-hexane, ethanol, 1-butanol, dimethyl ether, and mixtures of chloroform/methanol, <italic>n</italic>-hexane/ethanol, <italic>n</italic>-hexane/isopropanol among others (Neto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">2013</xref>). At an industrial scale, <italic>n</italic>-hexane is the most used solvent for lipid extraction while chloroform/methanol (1:2 v/v) is common for laboratory scale extractions. Mixing polar and non-polar solvents has been demonstrated to promote solvation and lipid recovery (Yoo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182">2012</xref>; Ghasemi Naghdi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2014</xref>). Although organic solvents have a long and established history in lipid extraction, the handling and toxicity of the volumes required for commercial scale operations have encouraged development of alternatives for disrupting LD membranes and accessing internal products.</p><p id="Par86">As an alternative to conventional techniques of LD disruption, enzymatic hydrolysis could be employed to target the monolayer of polar lipids or the most abundant membrane protein (MLDP, HOGP, LDSP, caleosin) in LDs. Lipases/phospholipases that can be applied to the ECM for disruption exhibit similar potential for lipid droplet disruption. Additional characterization of lipids in the polar monolayer would allow for selection of a candidate phospholipases/lipases for cleavage and digestion of the lipid droplet membrane. For example, when targeting esters or triglycerides, enzyme preparations with these known substrate specificities could aid in the cleavage of membrane lipids in the lipid droplet.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>Future directions of aqueous enzymatic processing</title><p id="Par87">When used for recovery of proteins and oil from microalgae, AEP includes biomass conditioning for maximum enzyme activity, primary enzyme addition, incubation for cell wall disruption and protein solubilization, solvent or detergent-based extraction of biomolecule, and finally centrifugation and biomolecule recovery (Huo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2015</xref>; Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2016</xref>; Wu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178">2017</xref>). An alternative and holistic approach to aqueous enzymatic processing was developed including biomass (biomolecule) production, harvesting, enzymatic degradation of cell wall, enzymatic degradation of organelle membranes, and product separation and fractionation (Soto Sierra et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">2017</xref>). With this process, enzymes were used for cell disruption and for catalyzing product release from internal cellular compartments. There also exists an opportunity for enzymes to disrupt naturally occurring emulsions, facilitating more efficient product separation and fractionation.</p><p id="Par88">After extensive literature review of existing applications of aqueous enzymatic processing, a methodical approach to AEP of various microalgae species was conceived (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) by our research group. This systematic approach focuses on the structural composition of the ECM and any product-containing organelles and allows for the processor to select candidate enzymes to facilitate disruption. Considerations before beginning aqueous enzymatic processing include selection of target products, identification of microalgae species for target product accumulation and corresponding ECM, enzyme targets in the ECM, enzyme targets in product-containing organelles, requirements for additional product processing, and an integration of product streams into final product processing operations.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Aqueous enzymatic processing scheme workflow and design considerations</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40643_2018_199_Fig3_HTML.gif" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p id="Par89">To assess the applicability of the developed methodology, an evaluation of literature employing enzymatic hydrolysis was conducted with the goal of investigating the methods employed by researchers using microalgae species with similar ECM characteristics. As previously described in “<xref rid="Sec19" ref-type="sec">The diversity of extracellular matrices</xref>” section, <italic>Nannochloropsis</italic> and <italic>Haematococcus</italic> species share cell wall characteristics that include being cellulose containing (fibrillary) and possessing multilayered organization. Enzymes tested for disruption include various commercial enzyme cocktails of cellulases, hemicellulases, amylases, and glucosidase among others. Carbohydrase activity and specificity have demonstrated potential in targeting the polysaccharide-rich nature of <italic>Nannochloropsis</italic> and <italic>Haematococcus</italic> cell walls (Machado et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2016</xref>; Zuorro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR191">2015</xref>). Likewise, <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, <italic>Chlorella</italic>, and <italic>Spirulina</italic> species possess multilayered cell walls primarily composed of metabolites including proteins, lipids, and polysaccharides (not including cellulose). Proteases, carbohydrase cocktails, and combined carbohydrase–protease cocktails have been used to target the various metabolites in the cell walls of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, <italic>Chlorella</italic>, and <italic>Spirulina</italic> species (Cho et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2013</xref>; Choi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2010</xref>; Liang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2012</xref>; Mahdy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2014b</xref>; Soto Sierra et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">2017</xref>). As <italic>Dunaliella</italic> species possesses a thin plasma membrane instead of a cell wall, enzymes are not used for pretreatment but rather for biomolecule (carotenoid/pigment) extraction.</p><p id="Par90">Recently, a methodology for native protein and lipid extraction and recovery from wild-type <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> was described (Soto Sierra et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">2017</xref>) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Candidate enzymes selected to potentially target the cellulose-deficient, hydroxyproline-rich cell wall included lysozyme, trypsin, collagenase, and a <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>-derived autolysin. Cell wall disruption efficiency was assessed with qualitative and quantitative methods including counting of intact cells after treatment and the application of non-ionic detergents or fluorescent dyes capable of penetrating and staining organelles of cells with disrupted cell walls. Cell wall disruption and native protein release was achieved using gamete autolysin produced by <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> cells. Analysis revealed that autolysin treatment at 35 °C for an extended period solubilized more that 50% of the total protein and resulted in partially disrupted chloroplasts. Following this enzymatic cell wall disruption, remaining proteins and lipid droplet localization in the chloroplast was confirmed. The composition of the chloroplast and lipid droplet membranes was further explored to determine candidate enzymes for cleavage of membrane components and product release. Enzymes include trypsin, Alcalase<sup>®</sup>, DSM metalloprotease (Maxipro<sup>®</sup>), and Glucanex<sup>®</sup>. The highest lipid release (73%) occurred with the application of trypsin to gamete autolysin-treated cells. In summary, a proof of concept study was conducted to enzymatically hydrolyze the cell wall and organelle membranes of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> cells. While native proteins and lipids were extracted and/or released from intracellular compartments, optimized conditions for enzyme application and incubation in addition to fundamentally understanding the enzyme–biomolecule interactions are required. Future efforts should include assessing and modeling the enzymatic hydrolysis approach for multiple biomolecule extraction and recovery for large-scale processing operations.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>An alternative and holistic approach to aqueous enzymatic processing of microalgae for biorefining</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40643_2018_199_Fig4_HTML.gif" id="MO5"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec42" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par91">Global interests are increasingly pursuing sustainable and renewable sources of energy and other bioproducts. Microalgae has a demonstrated history as a viable biomass source, but established processing techniques have often proved to be cost prohibitive mainly due to energy investments, scalability, and an underutilization of biomass components. The development of extraction and purification methods have traditionally focused on single product recovery and thus may not be suitable or compatible with multiple bioproduct recovery. Researchers have begun using alternative processing techniques such as enzymatic hydrolysis to disrupt microalgae cells and extract and recover multiple biomolecule product precursors with the goal of improving process economics.</p><p id="Par92">To fully realize the effect of alternative processing strategies such as aqueous enzymatic processing, better characterization of microalgae ECMs, organelle membrane compositions, and resultant biomolecule fractions are necessary. Such characterization will allow for producers to assess the effects of enzymatic treatment on the functionality of target biomolecules. This will provide new opportunities for applications of aqueous enzymatic processing for biomolecule recovery or as an enhancing method for traditional recovery schemes. Additionally, connecting morphological characteristics of microalgae ECM and their organelles to implications on process design can serve to improve bioproduct recovery yield and process economics. Thus, researchers and producers can overcome barriers to commercialization by tailoring the processing techniques to both characteristics of the biomass source and target biomolecules.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Authors’ contributions</title><sec><p>CD and LRW developed manuscript concept, review topics, and structure.
