Since the pioneering theoretical work by Marcus more than 60 years ago<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, efforts on understanding of ET in enzymes in biological reactions and biological systems have been made constantly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. ET in enzymes governs the basic biochemical reaction in the electron transport chain of two most important metabolic processes, i.e., photosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and respiration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. It has also been proposed that ET plays crucial roles in many other biological processes in living systems, such as avian magnetoreception<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, olfaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and vision<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In addition to the importance of intracellular ET, extracellular ET plays critical roles in many different biogeochemical applications. For example, ET from microbes to extracellular electron acceptors via microbial nanowires<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> or secreted compounds such as quinones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and flavins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> are important in organic matter degradation, subsurface bioremediation and nutrient cycling in soils and sediments. Although the importance of its role has long been highlighted, study of the quantum mechanical ET in biological systems was previously limited to mathematical modelling and theoretical conjecture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Specific ET pathways encoded in protein structures determine the biological processes by providing low-lying electronic states via a superexchange-mediated mechanism through a tunnelling barrier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Despite the great advancement in theoretical understanding of quantum biology recently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, experimental observation of quantum biological electron tunnelling has still been limited. Particularly, experimental visualisation of real-time quantum biological electron tunnelling (QBET) in biological systems is technically challenging.</p><p id="Par4">In addition to the critical function of ET in living biological systems, understanding ET in enzymes is also very important in biofuel cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, nanoreactors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and biosensors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Traditionally, electrochemical techniques have been adopted to characterise ET between the redox active sites of immobilised enzymes and the supporting electrodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The molecular ET in enzymes was detected previously via direct physical contact of the enzymes with an electrode using electric wiring or plugging enzymes into nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and gold nanoparticles (GNPs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. These methods were applied for the measurement of ET in enzymes or enzyme assembles. Recent studies of molecular tunnel junctions (MTJs) have shown the capability of ET capture via quantum tunnelling through single molecules or self-assembled monolayers (SAMs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Typically, in the MTJs, two electrodes bridged by the molecules are utilised to capture the ET through the molecules via quantum tunnelling with an applied bias voltage.</p><p id="Par5">On the other hand, plasmonic nanostructures with subnanometer-scale gaps provide a new platform for the investigation of quantum electron tunnelling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. When two plasmonic nanostructures are placed in close proximity with each other, plasmon response differs with the gap distance. If the gap is larger than a few nanometres (2–5 nm), strong plasmon coupling will promote local field enhancement at the gap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. However, as the gap distance becomes smaller, the system enters the quantum regime. The quantum nature of the electrons significantly alters the plasmon response. When the distance is less than a few nanometers (2–5 nm), the main quantum effect is nonlocal charge screening. As the gap further decreases to the threshold tunnel-distance at the sub-nanometer scale, the spill-out of plasmon-induced surface electrons can tunnel across the gap through a potential barrier at the optical resonant frequencies, and the quantum tunnelling is the main quantum effect in this regime.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> The threshold tunneling distance is found to be about 0.3~0.5 nm in vaccum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. However, the potential barrier can be lowered with the introduction of MTJs formed with linker molecules, and the tunnelling distance can be increased above subnanometer via through-bond tunneling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Using electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) method, Tan et al. recently described ET across the MTJs at length scales in the quantum gap (0.4–1.3 nm)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. All these previous methods are excellent demonstrations for validating ETs via tunnel junctions with an applied bias voltage. However, they are not suitable for visualising quantum biological ET in living molecules within live cells due to the wiring problem of electrodes on molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> or large scale of metallic substrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, which are unfeasible for inserting into cells. Moreover, EELS-based quantum plasmonic detection method cannot be applied for live cells imaging due to the high-energy of the electron beam<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Here, we report the first observation of QBET in living enzyme cytochrome <italic>c</italic> (Cyt <italic>c</italic>), which plays key functions in many metabolic processes as well as life and death decisions, such as respiration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, apoptosis activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, the regulation of many diseases, such as diabetes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> and neurodegenerative disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. By using a biological tunnelling junction, real-time ET dynamics during Cyt <italic>c</italic> reduction process was observed at the molecular level via QBET spectroscopy. Finally, ET dynamics during apoptosis and necrosis in living cells were discerned by quantifying the oxidation and reduction of Cyt <italic>c</italic>. This study opens up a non-invasive and wireless optical means to transmit fundamental knowledge of QBET in biological systems via plasmonic optical antennas, with significant implications for future precision diagnostics and therapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Quantum electron tunnelling behaviour in a tunnel junction</title><p id="Par7">Plasmonic GNPs serve as optical antennas which enable real-time spectroscopic molecular imaging in living cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. These optical antennas also enable molecular ET imaging of enzymes and the transmitting of QBET dynamics in live cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). We took Cyt <italic>c</italic> as an example of enzymes for the capture of ET.

Cellular organelles show broad scattering spectra in the visible range, which is distinct from the spectra of GNPs with plasmonic peaks (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1c</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>QBET imaging in a tunnel junction. <bold>a</bold> Schematic of GNPs used as optical antennas for intracellular QBET imaging in living cells. <bold>b</bold> Schematic illustration of GNPs for the detection of Cyt <italic>c</italic> released from mitochondria to cytosol.

Cyt <italic>c</italic> (C) is conjugated with a GNP (Au, A) via linker molecules (barrier molecule, B), which forms a quantum tunnel junction with a potential barrier. The GNP serves as an optical antenna with wavelength-specific surface plasmon (SP) resonance with strong light scattering when excited with white light irradiation. Free conduction electrons are elevated from Fermi level (<italic>E</italic><sub>F</sub>) to a higher energy level (SP state), and collectively oscillate at the GNP surface at the resonant light frequency. This system permits the plasmon resonance energy transfer (PRET) from the GNP to the conjugated Cyt <italic>c</italic> molecules. When the gap in the tunnel junction enters the quantum regime with a subnanometer distance, the spill-out of plasmon-induced surface electrons can tunnel across the gap at optical resonant frequencies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, and quantum electron tunnelling and transfer will coexist with PRET, playing key function in the modulation of the spectrum. Due to the linker molecules in the junction, the tunnel barrier height in the gap between the GNP and Cyt <italic>c</italic> is lower than that in vacuum without linker molecules, which facilitates electron tunnelling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, allowing ET from GNP to Cyt <italic>c</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). The height of potential barrier (<italic>φ</italic><sub>0</sub>) is the offset between the Fermi level of the GNP and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the linker molecule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The width of tunnelling barrier is the length of the linker molecule. The molecule is excited to the excited state (|e &gt; ) after the electron tunnelling and transfer. As a result of the electron tunnelling, we observe quantised dips located at Cyt <italic>c</italic> absorption peaks in the scattering spectrum of the GNP (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>) (see the discussion in Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>), enabling optical capture of QBET in the tunnel junction.

The plasmonic resonance enables plasmon-induced electrons tunnelling from GNP to Cyt <italic>c</italic> at the resonant optical frequencies, and the matched frequencies with absorption peak of Cyt <italic>c</italic> induce the electronic excitation of the Cyt <italic>c</italic> at the specific wavelength.

Decreasing dip depths at both 520 and 550 nm, corresponding to the absorption peaks of Cyt <italic>c</italic> (Red.), were captured as the barrier width was increased (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). An effective tunnelling distance of 11.5 Å was obtained. No discernible dips were found with a barrier width of 15.3 Å, indicating that the electron was not able to tunnel through such a long barrier width. Similar to the reduction case, the electron was not able to tunnel through the barrier width of 15.3 Å (no dip captured) in the A/B/C (Ox.) tunnel junction (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). The dip depths with different barrier widths for A/B/C (Red.) (520 and 550 nm) and A/B/C (Ox.) (530 nm) junctions are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>. Experimental data were exponentially fitted, giving a dip decay constant of 0.41, 0.42, and 0.44 Å<sup>−1</sup> at 520, 530 and 550 nm, respectively. In the A/B/C tunnel junction, the captured ET from the quantised dips of the scattering spectra is resulted from the accumulation of a large number of electrons tunnelling, and can be estimated by the area integral of the dips (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>). The exponentially fitted values of tunnelling decay rate (<italic>β</italic>) for the electrons corresponding to the wavelengths of 520, 530 and 550 nm are 0.61, 0.63 and 0.64 Å<sup>−1</sup>, respectively, with an average tunnelling decay rate of 0.63 Å<sup>−1</sup>. This value is consistent with those measured from larger-area molecular junctions by Akkerman et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, who report <italic>β</italic> values within 0.57–0.66 Å<sup>−1</sup> for SAMs of alkanethiols sandwiched within a gold electrode and a conductive polymer electrode. These values are smaller than the theoretical values of 1.46, 1.48 and 1.51 Å<sup>−1</sup> based on a single electron tunnelling through the barrier (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). A major factor inducing this difference between the theoretical and experimental values is the accumulation of a large number of electrons in the experiments due to surface plasmon excitation. This accumulation of electrons can induce a significant difference in the tunnelling behaviour from a single electron. Another factor may be the hopping of electrons in the junction, which significantly decreases the average height of the barrier, eventually increasing the electron transfer rate. The tunnelling can also involve either intermolecular tunnelling though the carbon backbone of the molecule or intramolecular charge transport that involve multiple molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. It should be noted that Cyt <italic>c</italic> is macromolecular protein composed of 104 amino acid residues, and the iron ion is in the centre of the heme <italic>c</italic> structure inside the protein, the transferred electron can be transiently located at either the protein surface or any amino acid residues, and also can be released into the surrounding media. In either case, the electron cannot reduce the Cyt <italic>c</italic> (Ox.) into Cyt <italic>c</italic> (Red.). That is why we did not capture the reduction of Cyt <italic>c</italic> (Ox.) into Cyt <italic>c</italic> (Red.) in the electron transfer process.</p><p id="Par11">The dips are measured in a discrete manner at specific molecular resonance wavelengths (molecular electronic states), and the depths of the measured dips differ from linker to linker molecules with subnanometer scale distance-dependent modulation. This is why we call the dips “quantised”, and these phenomena indicate that quantum electron tunnelling and transfer through the potential barrier plays key function during the dip generation. The quantised dips coincide precisely at frequencies that match electronic excitation frequencies of Cyt <italic>c</italic> (absorptions peaks). We suggest that, electron transfer from GNP to Cyt <italic>c</italic> with subsequent electronic excitation of Cyt <italic>c</italic> results in quantised energy loss in GNP governed by the general time-independent Schrödinger equation, which results in the dip generation in the scattering spectrum of the GNP. There may be other quantum mechanisms underlying the dip generation that are not fully understood yet. For general energy transfer processes, such as plasmon-induced resonance energy transfer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> and fluorescence resonance energy transfer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, the effective distance can go up to 10 nm, which is much larger than the 1.15 nm reported in our system. Previous study shows that the new peak of the spectrum will be red shifted with respect to the original one due to the localised surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Indeed, we have also observed small shift (&lt;1 nm) in the scattering spectrum of the GNP-Cyt <italic>c</italic> conjugation after the binding of Cyt <italic>c</italic> on the GNP surface (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). The theory of LSPR also explains well localised changes on plasmonic particle due to the changes of permittivity of surrounding media with the binding of biomolecules on particle surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. However, the LSPR theory does not allow to explain the captured quantised dips in the spectrum at specific electronic states of molecules in the conjugation. Even though original plasmonic spectrum is slightly red-shifted, the quantised dips in the spectrum is a dominant signal in our system, which is much more discernible than the spectrum redshift. This is why we are proposing a new mechanism that was previously not discussed for quantum tunnelling in between plasmonic particle and biomolecule. This tunnelling method provides a new way to capture the quantum electron transfer in between nanoplasmonics and biomolecules, which is not possible to observe specific electronic states of molecules using spectrum shift method</p><p id="Par12">In order to further demonstrate that electron transfer via quantum tunnelling through the potential barrier in the tunnel junctions plays key function in the generation of the quantised dips, we performed additional experiments with aromatic linker molecules, HS(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)<sub><italic>n</italic></sub>COOH (<italic>n</italic> = 1, 4-Mercaptobenzoic acid, 4MBA; <italic>n</italic> = 2, 4′-mercapto-biphenyl-4-carboxylic acid, 4MB4CA) (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>), to form tunnel junctions with different potential barrier between the GNP and Cyt <italic>c</italic>. The barrier height defined by the offset between the Fermi level (−5.5 eV) and the LUMO of the linker molecules are calculated to be ~4.93 and 3.65 eV for tunnel junctions formed with the representative linker molecules of MPA (HS(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>COOH, 3-mercaptopropionic acid) and 4MBA, respectively (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>). Due to the <italic>π</italic>-electron system in the aromatic phenyl rings, the aromatic molecules HS(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)<sub><italic>n</italic></sub>COOH have smaller HOMO-LUMO gap than the carboxyl-terminated alkanethiol HS(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub><italic>n</italic></sub>COOH, resulting in smaller potential barrier height in the tunnel junctions. Consequently, the junctions formed by aromatic linker molecules (4MBA and 4MB4CA) show a higher tunnelling efficiency with greater quantised dip depth in the scattering spectra than that of alkane linkers with similar molecular length (Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d, e</xref>). The dip depths at the wavelengths of 520, 530, and 550 nm with gap distances formed by different linker molecules is also shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>, while the accumulated quantised ET is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>. The average tunnelling decay rate <italic>β</italic> for the linker molecules of HS(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)<sub><italic>n</italic></sub>COOH for the electrons at the three resonant wavelengths is measured to be 0.31 Å<sup>−1</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>). This value is smaller than the average of 0.63 Å<sup>−1</sup> for HS(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub><italic>n</italic></sub>COOH due to the smaller potential barrier height of HS(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)<sub><italic>n</italic></sub>COOH. This barrier height-dependent variation in the tunnelling behaviour further supports that the electron tunnelling through a barrier formed by the liker molecules exists and plays critical roles in the quantised dip generation, and QBET in this system can be captured from these dips using this tunnel junction. To keep the experimental condition consistent, we used MPA as a linker molecule and the barrier molecule to form the tunnel junction in the following experiments.</p><p id="Par13">Although we observed similar phenomenon of quantised energy states (dips) within the broad scattering spectra of GNP-Cyt <italic>c</italic> conjugations before<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, and explained that the dips were due to the PRET only from GNP to Cyt <italic>c</italic> based on dipole-dipole interaction without considering electron transfer. At that time, we were not able to discern that quantum electron tunnelling and transfer during the dip generation process due to the limited knowledge and limited experimental data (i.e., no tunnelling junction experiments). The results shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> demonstrate that the generated quantised dips are highly dependent on the tunnel barrier width within the subnanometer scale, and these dips also significantly differs with potential barrier height. These results support that quantum electron tunnelling through the barrier formed by the linker molecules exists and plays critical roles in the dip generation.

This intracellular ET imaging is critical for better understanding of ET in governing cell death and provides new opportunities for precision intracellular molecular diagnostics and therapeutics. Cell death occurs via two different forms: apoptosis, a regulated natural process to maintain a balance of cellular multiplication, which plays a key role in maintain the balance of cell types and numbers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> as well as the regulation of disease such as neurodegenerative diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>; and necrosis, a pathological process that occurs when cells are exposed to extreme conditions that are very different from the homeostatic condition. Although apoptosis and necrosis are morphologically and biochemically distinct, these cell death processes occur simultaneously in cells or tissues subjected to the same drug treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. The difference between apoptosis and necrosis is mainly inflicted by genes and metabolic states of cells and its response to insults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. To explore the difference in molecular level and to visualise the ET in Cyt <italic>c</italic> redox dynamics for each process, we used generic agents, ethanol and Triton X-100, to induce apoptosis and necrosis in cells, respectively.

For more detailed information on Cyt <italic>c</italic> redox dynamics, we utilise the A/B/C tunnel junction for cytosolic quantitative QBET imaging of Cyt <italic>c</italic> redox dynamics. The GNPs modified with barrier linker molecules (A/B) were endocytosed by a living cell, and eventually conjugated with intracellular Cyt <italic>c</italic> to form A/B/C complex for QBET measurement.</p><p id="Par17">In intact cells, Cyt <italic>c</italic> resides in the inner mitochondrial membrane, and cytosolic Cyt <italic>c</italic> level is very low, thus we are unable to detect any QBET induced dips at the scattering spectra of the GNP (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Upon apoptotic stimulus via ethanol treatment, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation is increased via outer mitochondrial membrane pore or channel formation, which promotes the release of Cyt <italic>c</italic> from mitochondria. The released Cyt <italic>c</italic> is quickly reduced by cytosolic reductants and enzymes. Accordingly, the QBET in A/B/C (Red.) tunnel junction with dips at 520 and 550 nm were captured. Distinct morphologic changes were observed during apoptosis process, including cell shrinkage, cell membrane blebbing to form apoptotic bodies, and nucleus rupture (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>), which are the characteristic features of apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Significant changes in the QBET signals were also captured in the cytosol after the ethanol exposure (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). There is a heterogeneity in the signals detected from different GNPs at different intracellular locations (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>) due to different intracellular environments, the concentration of released Cyt <italic>c</italic>, redox states of Cyt <italic>c</italic>, as well as the amount of Cyt <italic>c</italic> conjugated to GNPs. Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref> shows the dip changes in the whole process of apoptosis (based on more than 80 gold nanoparticles in more than 10 cell repeats).

After the exposure of 3.0 h, a small dip at 530 nm was also captured. The dip depths became stable after about 3.5 h of the exposure with an average intensity difference (Δ<italic>I</italic>: dip changes compared to values at 0 h) of about 8.9%, 4.2% and 13.5% at 520, 530, and 550 nm, respectively. These results show that in addition to Cyt <italic>c</italic> (red.), Cyt <italic>c</italic> (Ox.) also exists in cytosol at the late stage of apoptosis. At this late stage, the nucleus was ruptured (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>), and the cytosolic reductants might be exhausted. Many studies show that Cyt <italic>c</italic> (Ox.) is more active for caspase-9 activation and apoptosome assembly for apoptosis activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, while another study showed that redox state of Cyt <italic>c</italic> is not a cause but a reporter of cell state during apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, our real-time QBET imaging reveals that the time at which the redox state of Cyt <italic>c</italic> is measured is critical. At the time point when the apoptotic stimulus applied, the cell still stays intact and healthy, thus the released Cyt <italic>c</italic> is quickly reduced in the cytosol by cytosolic reductants and enzymes.

However, only the 50 nm GNPs had the necessary overlap between its plasmonic resonant peak and the absorption peak of the conjugated molecule (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref>).</p><p id="Par19">Although both apoptosis and necrosis eventually cause cell death, the molecular dynamics of Cyt <italic>c</italic> during these two processes are presumably different due to the difference in inherent biological mechanisms. We stimulated cells with Triton X-100 (0.17 mM) to induce necrosis and utilised QBET junction spectroscopy to image Cyt <italic>c</italic> redox dynamics in the process of necrosis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>). In contrast to apoptosis where the cell membrane was kept intact, the cell membrane was gradually damaged and cellular organelles were released outside the cell during necrosis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>). Significant changes in real-time QBET signals at different locations inside the cell were also captured with Cyt <italic>c</italic> redox changes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref> and Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">16</xref>). Heterogeneity due to different cellular environments, Cyt <italic>c</italic> concentrations and total amount of conjugated Cyt <italic>c</italic> contribute to different dip depths detected in QBET signals. Dip depth measurements are also affected by changes in redox states of Cyt <italic>c</italic>, which showed clear differences in the dip depths at different wavelength positions during necrosis (530 nm for oxidised Cyt <italic>c</italic>, 520 and 550 nm for reduced Cyt <italic>c</italic>). Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h</xref> shows dip changes in the necrosis process based on more than 10 cell repeats, with three different time-dependent distribution of dips (Cyt <italic>c</italic> redox) in a cyclic behaviour. Due to the different dynamics of enzymatic oxidation and reduction inside the cell, this cyclic behaviour of Cyt <italic>c</italic> redox is different from the situation in apoptosis. Dips at 520 and 550 nm were captured after 0.5 h of the exposure, indicating the detection of Cyt <italic>c</italic> (Red.). This initial stage of necrosis is similar to what has been observed for the first stage of apoptosis where cell stays intact and healthy and the released Cyt <italic>c</italic> is quickly reduced by cytosolic reductants. The dips were gradually changed to 530 nm after 2.0 h of the exposure, indicating the reoxidation of Cyt <italic>c</italic>. This is the second stage of necrosis in which increasing in the mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation exposed Cyt <italic>c</italic> to COX and reoxidation occurred. At ~3.0 h of the exposure, the dips at 520 and 550 nm reached a minimum, indicating maximum reoxidation. At this stage, the cell membrane was damaged and organelles were released into the extracellular environment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>h, <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). The internal reductive environment was destroyed and the release of COX from mitochondria exhausted the capacity of cytosolic reductants. These factors result in an increased oxidised cellular environment, allowing maximum oxidation of Cyt <italic>c</italic>. After 3.5 h of the exposure, the dips at 520 and 550 nm appeared again. This is due to cell rupture via continuous treatment of Triton X-100 and the mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation induced the release of both Cyt <italic>c</italic> (Red.) and Cyt <italic>c</italic> (Ox.) from mitochondria.</p><p id="Par20">The cellular environment provides reductive enzymes to reduce Cyt <italic>c</italic> in the cytosol. Without this reductive environment, we hypothesise that the released Cyt <italic>c</italic> from mitochondria should be found in both oxidised and reduced forms. To show that the detected signal at 520, 530 and 550 nm in the final stage of both apoptosis and necrosis was a result of the release of both Cyt <italic>c</italic> (Ox.) and Cyt <italic>c</italic> (Red.) from mitochondria, we performed similar QBET imaging at the surface of mitochondria using mitochondria extracts. Similarly, the dips at 520, 530 and 550 nm were captured at mitochondria surface (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">17</xref>) due to the release of both Cyt <italic>c</italic> (Ox.) and Cyt <italic>c</italic> (Red.). Our data indicates that both oxidised and reduced forms of Cyt <italic>c</italic> reside in the mitochondria and the detection of any redox form greatly depends on the internal cellular environment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par21">Although we utilised PRET technique for the optical detection of Cyt <italic>c</italic> in live cells before<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, we were not able to discern the ET dynamics of Cyt <italic>c</italic> in live cells. In this study, we demonstrated not only the experimental evidence of quantum electron tunneling in the junction, but also pioneering biological experiments using the QBET junction as a biological reporter to distinguish the ET dynamics in the processes of cellular apoptosis and necrosis. The results demonstrate that QBET junction spectroscopy is a powerful method to detect specifically the oxidative state from the reductive state of Cyt <italic>c</italic>, dynamics of ET, and its ability to report the relative concentration of Cyt <italic>c</italic> through the depth of the quantised resonant dips. Redox oscillation determines cellular functions and plays critical role in cancer as well, and there are many hypotheses of biological oscillations in metabolic redox reactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. However, there is no real-time method for ET imaging during redox oscillations non-invasively. The beauty of QBET junction spectroscopy is its ability to distinguish different states (i.e. oxidation and reduction), and ET dynamics during redox oscillations due to the different enzymatic activities in cell death process through the non-invasive molecular imaging of Cyt <italic>c</italic>. It is noted that plasmonic resonance peak can be shifted due to particle aggregation, but the quantised dips of QBET signals are still detectable if the scattering spectra show an overlap with Cyt <italic>c</italic> absorption peaks (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">17b</xref> and Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). It is also noted that only a fraction of GNPs endocytosed by the living cell form functional A/B/C tunnel junctions for QBET detection. No dip signatures were detected for unconjugated GNPs while the detection of different dip signatures (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">18</xref>) indicates the conjugation of other molecules to the GNPs. However, we are unable to identify the biomolecules corresponding to the different dips in the present study. Therefore, we limit the scope of this study to detecting Cyt <italic>c</italic> with clear quantised dips at different redox states. However, the QBET technique shows potential for the discovery and detection of various biomolecules in living cells. Based on the observation of more than 20 cells and 200 GNPs, we found that about 48% of GNPs form functional A/B/C tunnel junctions for QBET detection of Cyt <italic>c</italic> in living cells.</p><p id="Par22">We obtained the first quantum biological electron tunnelling in live cells and living enzymes. The non-invasive and real-time optical imaging of ET dynamics of Cyt <italic>c</italic> in living cell during the cell death process was accomplished by the QBET junction spectroscopy. The QBET with different tunnelling barrier widths was demonstrated in A/B/C tunnel junction. We captured the real-time QBET signal during Cyt <italic>c</italic> reduction process and the different redox dynamics during cell death process. We experimentally verified the theoretical conjecture of biological ET using QBET junction spectroscopy in particular in live cells. We are now able to optically capture the quantum electron tunneling in living enzymes in a wireless and noninvasive manner. QBET junction spectroscopy pushed the boundary of live cell imaging to overcome the limitations of traditional ET imaging methods, which are invasive and unfeasible for living cell. Although we only show the capture of ET in live cells using Cyt <italic>c</italic>, this technique provides many new possibilities for the capture of biological ET in other enzymes as well as other biomolecules in living biological systems. This direct visualisation of quantum electron tunneling demonstrated in this study has many potentials for the future studies of quantum electron transfer in biological systems, and provide new insight into the quantum mechanisms in governing cellular processes as well as life and death. The ability of QBET junction spectroscopy to distinguish between apoptosis and necrosis is also fundamental as apoptotic death is controlled while necrotic death can cause inflammation and septic shock to the body. Visualisation of real-time ET processes and molecular profiles with temporal and spatial occurrence in live cells with QBET junction spectroscopy will also lead to new avenues for precision molecular diagnostics and therapeutics. It could also provide new insight into the fundamental driving force of biological oscillations due to the different reduction and oxidation of enzyme in living systems, which are the most critical information for the energy harvesting and healthy life.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Experimental setup</title><p id="Par23">The experimental setup is based on an inverted dark-field microscope and a monochrometer.
