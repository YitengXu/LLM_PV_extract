Numerous artificial antennae have been developed. However, they are limited in their cascade energy-transfer abilities because of a lack of control over complex chromophore aggregation processes, which has impeded their advancement. Here we report a viable approach for addressing this issue by using a light-harvesting porous polymer film in which a three-dimensional π-network serves as the antenna and micropores segregate multiple dyes to prevent aggregation. Cascade energy-transfer engines are integrated into the films; the rate and efficiency of the energy-funneling engines are precisely manipulated by tailoring the dye components and contents. The nanofilms allow accurate and versatile luminescence engineering, resulting in the production of thirty emission hues, including blue, green, red and white. This advance may open new pathways for realising photosynthesis and photoenergy conversion.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>10933</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>9</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep08867.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>14</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep08867" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep08867</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Light harvesting initiates photosynthetic processes, whereas antennae serve as a photon engine that pump excitons to a reaction center, where photoenergy is transformed into chemical energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Nature produces light-harvesting antennae by organising multiple chlorophyll units into ring or wheel-like structures and these structures constitute a vectorial cascade energy-transfer diagram that enables the long-distance yet rapid and efficient pumping of excitons before annihilation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Inspired by the intricate mechanism observed in nature, artificial antenna systems for pumping excitons have long been pursued<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, given the promise of applications in solar energy storage and conversion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, light amplification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, sensing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and luminescent materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In particular, the development of controlled cascade energy transfer may lead to the next generation of optoelectronic materials for energy transduction and conversion. Although linear polymers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and dendrimers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> can covalently link energy-donor, relay and acceptor units into cascade energy-transfer systems to make luminescent polymers, the compositions and contents of these building blocks cannot be freely tailored; to achieve optimised structures for these systems, tedious synthesis is unavoidable. Moreover, the aggregation of polymer chains and the folding of dendritic branches result in complicated interactions among components. These drawbacks must be addressed before custom luminescent materials with easily tunable luminescence, improved efficiency and low cost can be produced. Small chromophores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> have be developed for light harvesting via supramolecular assemblies; however, control over the aggregates of multiple components is still semi-empirical, whereas specific interactions and the delicate conditions that are required for maintaining the desired assembled states largely limit the scope of their applications. Porous materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> have been utilised to build up supramolecular host-guest systems for light harvesting and energy transfer. Nevertheless, these systems are limited to bi-component energy donor and acceptor systems; a porous material that can be used to achieve controlled cascade energy transfer is unprecedented.</p><p>Porous organic polymers (POPs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, a class of cross-linked, amorphous polymers with permanent porosity, have emerged as a new platform for the construction of functional and stable porous materials. The development of various chemical reactions, building blocks and synthetic methods has generated a wide range of POPs with specific structures and outstanding properties, driving the rapid growth of the field. POPs have exhibited tremendous potential for adsorption and separation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, catalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, energy storage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> and optoelectronics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. However, POPs are usually obtained as unproceessable powders. Recently, we established an electrochemical approach for the preparation of POP films, providing a new platform for functional exploration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.</p><p>Herein, we report light-harvesting POP films into which controllable cascade energy transfer is integrated, leading to a new generation of customisable luminescent materials that are engineered to be easily tailored. The POP films are synthesized with a controlled thickness via the previously reported electrochemical method and emit bright blue luminescence. The three-dimensional π-network drastically enhances the interface of energy transfer to relay and acceptor dyes, whereas the nanopores within the film permit segregated molecular docking of multiple laser dyes with desired properties and in specific proportions. Mechanistic studies reveal that the light-harvesting films allow the integration of a cascade energy-transfer engine that functions in a vectorial and highly efficient manner and enables total control over the speed and efficiency of the energy transfer through tuning of the distribution and types of dye introduced. We show the accuracy and versatility of luminescence engineering with the POP films in producing thirty different luminescence hues, including blue, green, red and white (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). By virtue of the antenna effect and dye confinement, the films exhibit considerably amplified luminescence and gain exceptional quantum efficiencies. Replacement of the dyes with redox-active components may lead to application of the present technology for highly efficient photosynthesis and photoenergy conversion.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Synthetic scheme and cascade energy transfer diagram.</p><p>(a), Schematic representation of the synthesis of POP films by the electro-oxidative coupling reaction.

The POP thin films were formed on an ITO electrode via multicycled cyclic voltammetry (CV) of TPSC. During the first cycle of the positive CV scan, the oxidative potentials of carbazole and spirobifluorene were 0.95 and 1.15 V, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Two reductive peaks that appeared at 0.99 and 0.73 V during the negative scan were assigned to the reduction of the cations of spirobifluorene and dimeric carbazole, respectively. Consequently, we employed a potential range between −0.8 and 1.0 V for the film deposition; this positive potential can only oxidise the carbazole units, whereas the sufficiently low negative potential ensures the complete reduction of the dimeric carbazyl cations and removal of their counterions (PF<sub>6</sub><sup>−</sup>) from the films<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. From the second cycle in the continuous CV scan (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S1b</xref>), the current attributed to the oxidation of dimeric carbazoles at 0.83 V increased with increasing cycle number; thus, more dimeric carbazole formed and the POP films progressively grew on the electrode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.</p><p>The electro-oxidative coupling reaction took place with near 100% efficiency and the resulting POP films were highly cross-linked and insoluble in organic solvents. Infrared, electronic absorption and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) measurements revealed that the content of the monomeric carbazole unit in the films is negligible (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S2, S3a and S4</xref>). The size and shape of the POP films were determined by the electrodes employed; films of 0.5 × 1.5 cm<sup>2</sup> were utilised in this study. This method allows good control over the film thickness by simply tuning the number of scan cycles. A series of thin films with controlled thickness were synthesised, where each cycle resulted in an increase in the film thickness of approximately 2 nm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S5 and S6</xref>). We conducted Kr adsorption isotherm measurements and observed that the POP films were highly porous and exhibited exceptional Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of 2190 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S7a</xref>). The BET surface areas of the POP films were independent of the film thickness (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S7b</xref>). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) revealed that the films had homogeneous microporous textures with pore diameters of approximately 2 nm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S8</xref>). Our strategy offers a high throughput method of synthesising highly cross-linked POP films with controlled thickness.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Electronic features of POP films</title><p>The as-synthesized POP films retained the absorption band of the spirobifluorene unit at 350 nm and also displayed an absorption band at 310 nm, assignable to the dimeric carbazole, which was red shifted by 22 nm from the band of the monomeric carbazole unit of TPSC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S3a</xref>). This redshift, together with an enhanced absorption coefficient, indicated extended π-conjugation in the electronic structure of the films. Upon excitation at 350 nm, the films emitted a brilliant blue luminescence at 434 nm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S3b</xref>), with an absolute fluorescence quantum yield of 19%. The POP films exhibited the same absorption and emission spectra and had similar fluorescence quantum yields, irrespective of film thickness. We observed that the films significantly depolarised the fluorescence, resulting in a polarisation value of only 0.012, whereas TPSC exhibited a much larger polarisation value of 0.052 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S3c</xref>). These observations suggest that the photogenerated excitons in the POP films are not localised but can migrate over the three-dimensional π-network<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Exciton migration has been observed to facilitate the transfer of energy in both natural and artificial light-harvesting systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Light harvesting and one-step energy transduction</title><p>The micropores of the POP films are useful for docking laser dye molecules that enable the POP skeletons to harvest photons and channel the excitation energy to the dye molecules with high efficiency, thus building up one-step energy transduction systems. To select a suitable candidate for the laser dye, the paring of the excitation and emission bands was investigated using fluorescence spectroscopy (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The excitation and emission wavelengths of the POP films were 350 and 434 nm, respectively (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>), whereas those of the green laser dye coumarin 6 (C6) were centered at 421 and 500 nm, respectively (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). Therefore, the emission band of the POP films is overlapped with the excitation band of coumarin 6 to a large degree, thereby allowing the formation of a singlet-to-singlet energy transfer pathway from the POP antennae to the coumarin 6 energy acceptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. We prepared the POP⊃C6 films by immersing the POP films into CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> solutions containing different concentrations of coumarin 6 for 12 h and subsequently rinsed them with CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> until the rinse solution was still clear after use. We optimised the film thickness for energy transfer and observed that 20-nm thick films could be tuned to have various coumarin 6 contents and that the energy transfer process could be managed in a controlled manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S9</xref>). Thus, twelve 20-nm thick films were prepared to bear different loadings ranging from 0 to 3.19 mol% of coumarin 6, as determined by XPS measurements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S10a, b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Table S1</xref>). However, the maximum coumarin 6 content that could be attained was 15.1 mol% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S10i, j</xref>), by virtue of the high surface area of the POP films.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Fluorescence excitation and emission spectra.</p><p>(a–e), Normalized fluorescence excitation (dotted curve) and emission (solid curve) spectra of (a) the POP films (dotted blue curve monitored at 434 nm, solid blue curve upon excitation at 350 nm), (b) coumarin 6 (dotted green curve monitored at 500 nm, solid green curve upon excitation at 423 nm, in CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>), (c) the POP⊃C6 films (3.19 mol% coumarin 6; dotted green curve monitored at 500 nm, solid green curve upon excitation at 350 nm), (d) Nile red (dotted red curve monitored at 600 nm, solid red curve upon excitation at 556 nm, in CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>) and (e) the POP⊃C6×NR films (3.19 mol% coumarin 6 and 5.41 mol% Nile red; dotted red curve monitored at 608 nm, solid red curve upon excitation at 360 nm).

As the coumarin 6 content was increased from 0 to 3.19 mol%, the green luminescence of coumarin 6 increased in intensity, whereas the blue emission from the POP skeletons decreased, giving rise to directed energy funneling from POP network to coumarin 6 and producing a series of luminescence colours gradually engineered to range from deep blue to brilliant green (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). Usually coumarin 6 in solid or aggregated states exhibits different luminescence behaviour from that in dilute solution (monomeric state) by showing characteristic redshifted emission band and decreased luminescent efficiency. Notably, the emission wavelength at 500 nm observed for the POP⊃C6 films is the same as that of monomeric coumarin 6, which indicates that the coumarin 6 molecules are segregated from each other and “independently” confined in the pores. These luminescence spectral changes revealed the energy transfer from the POP skeletons to coumarin 6. Indeed, the efficiency (Φ<sub>ENT</sub>) increased in a sigmoidal fashion and reached 94% as the coumarin 6 content approached 3.19 mol% (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>), while the energy transfer speed is solely dependent on the coumarin 6 content (see below). For the POP⊃C6 film (3.19 mol% coumarin 6), approximately 30 TPSC units (calculated by 94/3.19) harvested the photons and funnelled the excitation energy to one coumarin 6 molecule, demonstrating an outstanding antenna effect. As an example, the green luminescence intensity of the POP⊃C6 film (3.19 mol% coumarin 6) upon excitation of the POP skeletons is 31-fold higher than that measured from the direct excitation of coumarin 6 itself (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f</xref>). As a control, the spin-coated TPSC films did not exhibit good energy transfer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S11</xref>). Because coumarin 6 exhibits an absolute fluorescence quantum yield (76%) that is higher than that of the POP film (19%), the enhanced energy transfer efficiency of the dosed films, taking the site isolation effect into account, effectively increases the fluorescence quantum yields of the POP⊃C6 films (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>). The green-luminescent POP⊃C6 film (3.19 mol% coumarin 6; <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3g</xref>) exhibited a fluorescence quantum yield as high as 64%.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Cascade energy transfer.</p><p>(a), One-step energy transfer from POP network to coumarin 6 as evident by the fluorescence spectral changes of the POP film (20-nm thick) containing varied coumarin 6 content (0 to 3.19 mol%) upon excitation of the POP skeleton.

To build up such an engine, we introduced a second laser dye as energy-accepting counterpart to constitute a two-step energy transfer and relay system. We observed that the laser dye Nile red (NR) serves as an energy-accepting counterpart when trapped within the pores of the POP⊃C6 films. Nile red emits a deep-red fluorescence at 600 nm with an excitation band at 554 nm (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>); this excitation wavelength overlaps with the emission of the POP⊃C6 films and thus could be used to form a cascade energy transfer from the POP network to coumarin 6 and then relay from coumarin 6 to Nile red. We prepared twelve POP⊃C6×NR films for luminescence engineering by fixing the coumarin 6 content at 3.19 mol% and tuning the Nile red loading from 0 to 5.41 mol% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S10c-f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Table S1</xref>). The XPS spectra of the POP⊃C6×NR films demonstrated that no coumarin 6 is released into the solvent during the loading of Nile red (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S10d, f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Table S1</xref>). This result is reasonable because the film adopts a 3D crosslinked network structure, which prevents the leach of the dyes once loaded. The film is highly porous, in which only few pores trap coumarin 6, as indicated by the content of dyes in the films. Therefore, the presence of coumarin 6 trapped only in a few pores does not affect the diffusion of Nile red into the films; there are still many pores that are open and accessible to Nile red in the films. Notably, a maximum Nile red loading of 19.4 mol% was attained (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S10k, l</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Table S1</xref>).</p><p>The cascade energy transfer process is easily evident by the colour change in luminescence. Upon excitation of the POP skeleton, the POP⊃C6×NR films exhibited increased red emission from Nile red and decreased green emission from coumarin 6 as the content of Nile red increased from 0 to 5.41 mol%, giving rise to tuned emission spanning from bright green to deep red (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3c and 3g</xref>). The energy transfer from the POP framework to coumarin 6 is almost complete (Φ<sub>ENT</sub> = 94%), whereas the energy relay from coumarin 6 to Nile red is solely dependent on the content of Nile red with an increased efficiency in a sigmoidal fashion reaching 93% as the Nile red content increased to 5.41 mol% (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>). Remarkably, the high Φ<sub>ENT</sub> values for the cascade energy transfer gave rise to a significant antenna effect; the POP⊃C6×NR film emitted a 24-fold amplified red luminescence upon excitation of the POP skeleton in comparison with the direct excitation of Nile red (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2g</xref>). The fluorescence quantum yields of the green-to-red luminescent films were dependent on the Nile red content and changed from 64% for green luminescence to 36% for red luminescence (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>), which was very close to that of monomeric Nile red (38%). The similarities in the fluorescence wavelengths and quantum yields of the POP⊃C6×NR films and monomeric Nile red moieties indicate that the Nile red molecules are spatially segregated from other dye molecules and are “independently” confined within the nanopores. Therefore, the POP films can dock two types of laser dye molecules in tailored combinations and in a segregated manner, resulting in complete energy transfer and manageable energy relay systems that enable a new mechanism for blue-to-green-to-red luminescence engineering.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Light harvesting and cascade energy-transfer engine with incomplete energy relay</title><p>The above POP films enable complete energy transfer from POP network to coumarin 6 and tunable energy relay from coumarin 6 to Nile red. The cascade engines were further explored to manipulate the efficiency and speed (see below) of two steps by reducing the energy transfer efficiency. The incomplete energy transfer would leave blue, green and red luminescence, opening a window to produce white emission. For this purpose, we decreased and optimised the coumarin 6 content at 0.63 mol%, whereas the Nile red content was tuned from 0.3 mol% to 0.75 mol% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S10g, h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Table S1</xref>). The energy-transfer efficiency from the POP film to coumarin 6 is 71% and the relay efficiency from coumarin 6 to Nile red is 29–55% (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref>). The measured absolute fluorescence quantum yields of these five white emissions ranged from 37% to 50% (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3f</xref>). Remarkably, the POP⊃C6×NR film containing 0.75 mol% Nile red emitted a white light (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3g</xref>) with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.33, 0.31) (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3h</xref>), which is very close to the CIE coordinates (0.33, 0.33) of standard pure white light.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Luminescence engineering traits</title><p>We plotted the luminescent colour tracks of the aforementioned thirty POP films by mapping their CIE coordinates (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3h</xref>). The original POP film has CIE coordinates of (0.15, 0.06), which change along a straight line (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3h</xref>, white arrow) between the original POP film and coumarin 6 (0.18, 0.60), as the coumarin 6 content increases. Therefore, twelve different luminescence colours, including blue, sky blue, blue green and green, were produced upon docking with various amounts of coumarin 6. By further docking Nile red in the films, the CIE coordinates changed along another line (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3h</xref>, white arrow) between coumarin 6 (0.18, 0.60) and Nile red (0.62, 0.38). Along this line, we demonstrated that twelve different luminescence colours, including green, yellow-green, yellow, orange, red and deep-red, were successfully engineered. In addition, the POP⊃C6×NR films can be engineered with coumarin 6 at content levels other than the loading of 3.19 mol% used to make the range of previously described films, which would allow the predesigned generation of various luminescent colours. As exemplified by the POP⊃C6×NR film containing 0.63 mol% coumarin 6, white luminescence can also be engineered along a new track on the CIE map (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3h</xref>, black arrow).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Mechanistic insights</title><p>We calculated the effective distance between coumarin 6 and Nile red in the cascade energy relay process. We assumed that four TPSC molecules circled a pore (in agreement with the simulation and BET results), leading to a pore size of 2.3 nm. For the POP⊃C6×NR film with 3.19 mol% coumarin 6 and 5.41 mol% Nile red, the maximum and minimum distances between coumarin 6 and Nile red molecules were estimated to be approximately 9 and 4 nm, respectively. The distance between coumarin 6 and Nile red is much lower than the Förster distance of energy transfer, thus enabling the cascade energy relay to occur effectively within the POP⊃C6 × NR films.</p><p>To gain insight into the energy transfer and cascade energy relay dynamics, we conducted time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy of the POP, POP⊃C6 and POP⊃C6×NR films upon excitation of the POP skeletons. The POP films exhibited an average lifetime (τ<sub>0</sub>) of 2.12 ns (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>, blue curve).

As the Nile red content increased from 0.30 mol% to 5.41 mol% (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>, red curve), the POP⊃C6×NR films exhibited a considerably decreased lifetime (τ<sub>DA</sub>) and finally reached a value of only 0.34 ns (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4e</xref>, solid circles; <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

The film made with 0.75 mol% Nile red exhibited three different decay profiles when monitored at 410, 503 and 600 nm, whereas their lifetimes were 1.82, 2.21 and 3.14 ns, respectively (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>).

Remarkably, the rate-determining step of cascade energy transfer is solely dependent on the relative amounts of dyes in the films. Our results reveal that the films trigger vectorial and highly efficient cascade energy transfer through their channels at a high yet manageable speed, which enables predesignable and precise engineering of their luminescence. Because dye molecules in this system can be replaced with redox-active components, the cascade films can be useful for the development of photocatalytic and photoenergy conversion systems.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have integrated controlled cascade energy transfer and relay engines into light-harvesting POP films. The porous polymer network with extended π-cloud delocalisation increases the interface for exciton pumping and energy transfer, whereas the nanopores offer ‘independent rooms’ for the spatially segregated molecular dockings of laser dyes. The synthetic control over the incorporated dye components and their relative compositions results in the generation of controlled cascade energy transfer systems that can be tuned in a straightforward and precise manner. The efficiency and speed of the cascade energy transfer were controlled by the dye components and their loading in the films and were exploited to achieve energy-transfer efficiencies of near 100% and energy-transfer rate on the order of 10<sup>9</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>. We demonstrate the accuracy and versatility of luminescence engineering by developing films that luminesce with thirty different emission hues, including the three primary colours and pure white. Another significant finding is that the films gain the highest fluorescence quantum efficiencies of the corresponding laser dyes as a result of site segregation effect, whereas the antenna effect of the POP skeletons greatly amplifies the green and red emissions by 30- and 24-fold compared with the emissions generated by direct excitation of the laser dyes. Our strategy may open new possibilities for the development of cascade systems for luminescent and lasing materials, artificial photosynthesis and photoenergy conversion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>POP films</title><p>The electro-oxidative coupling reaction was performed using a standard one-compartment, three-electrode electrochemical cell attached to an ALS/CHi 610C electrochemical workstation.
