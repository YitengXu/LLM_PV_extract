In this work, to investigate the origin of these contradictory results, the effects of the nanomorphologies of small-molecule acceptors on the environmental stability of polymer:small-molecule blends are demonstrated. Investigations on the environmental stabilities of polymer:fullerene blends of poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-<italic>b</italic>:4,5-<italic>b</italic>′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-<italic>b</italic>]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7):phenyl-C<sub>61</sub>-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) with contrasting nanomorphologies of PCBM reveal that dispersed PCBM in a mixed phase is the critical factor that causes triplet-mediated singlet oxygen generation and, hence, the severe photooxidation of PTB7, whereas an aggregated PCBM phase stabilizes PTB7 by reducing the formation of PTB7 triplet excitons. In addition, the photooxidation of PTB7 substantially degrades hole transport in the PTB7:PCBM blends by destroying the crystalline PTB7 phases within the films; this effect is strongly correlated with the efficiency losses of the PTB7:PCBM organic solar cells. These conclusions are also extended to polymer:nonfullerene blends of PTB7:ITIC and PTB7:Y6, thereby confirming the generality of this phenomenon for polymer:small-molecule organic solar cells.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">The effects of nanomorphologies of acceptors on the environmental stability of donor:acceptor blends were investigated.

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par4">Long-standing research efforts have been made to discover conjugated polymer donors and small-molecule acceptors with excellent optical and electrical properties and have bolstered the field of organic solar cells (OSCs), resulting in an increase in device efficiencies from 3 to &gt;18% in the past decade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. These excellent device efficiencies originate from the complex morphologies of polymer:small-molecule bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blends, which consist of a mixed phase and pure crystalline or amorphous phase of both donor and acceptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. A mixed phase achieves ultrafast charge separation after photoexcitation, whereas a pure phase achieves efficient transport of separated charges to the electrode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However, a weakly crystalline phase facilitates the fast diffusion of extrinsic species, such as molecular oxygen and water, making OSC devices prone to degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In particular, exposure to light and molecular oxygen has been identified as a primary origin of degradation as a result of triplet-mediated singlet oxygen generation or anion-mediated superoxide generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, both of which substantially limit the environmental stability of OSCs. Although device encapsulation can form a physical barrier against the diffusion of molecular oxygen into a device<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, encapsulation technology greatly increases fabrication costs, making OSCs far from a low-cost renewable energy source. Identifying the exact degradation mechanism of OSC devices and improving their intrinsic stability are therefore critical steps toward their commercialization.</p><p id="Par5">Most previous related studies have found that pristine films of amorphous organic semiconductor materials are more vulnerable to degradation than their crystalline counterparts. Compared with films composed of crystalline materials, films composed of amorphous materials include a higher volume fraction of amorphous phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. This high volume of amorphous phase increases the diffusion of extrinsic species through the films. In addition, amorphous materials exhibit poor planarity of their conjugated backbone compared with their crystalline counterparts and are therefore vulnerable to photoinduced conformational changes, followed by rapid photooxidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. For polymer:small-molecule blends, however, their environmental stability is difficult to predict because it changes without a distinct trend as the combination of polymer and small-molecule changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. For example, fullerenes, such as phenyl-C<sub>61</sub>-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), have been shown to stabilize numerous polymer donors under illumination in ambient air by quenching singlet excitons and scavenging radicals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. However, these results contradict some previous studies that have shown that PCBM accelerates the photooxidation of polymer donors by increasing triplet-mediated singlet oxygen generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The reasons for these different stabilization/destabilization effects of PCBM remain unclear. This lack of clarity is partly attributable to previous studies that typically addressed dissimilar material systems that contained different volume fractions of dispersed and aggregated PCBM phases, considering that a previous study reported that the change in the photooxidative stability of pristine PCBM depends on the nanomorphology of PCBM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Although this previous study was limited to the environmental stability of pristine PCBM, we expect that the degree of fullerene aggregation could also cause different stabilization/destabilization pathways in conjugated polymer:fullerene blends. That is, the relative volume fractions of the dispersed phase and aggregated phase might strongly influence the environmental stability of OSC devices.</p><p id="Par6">The exact mechanism by which oxidized conjugated polymer donors degrade OSC devices is also poorly understood. Polymer donors undergo a change in chemical structure upon photooxidation, such as the cleavage of their side chains or oxidation of their backbone; such changes typically lead to a loss of extended π-conjugation in the polymer donors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. This loss of conjugation is accompanied by a broadening of the bandgap; thus, most studies on oxidized donor polymers have highlighted the loss of light absorption in describing the efficiency loss in OSC devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, the loss of efficiency is generally much larger than the loss of light absorption, with a weak correlation observed between them. That is, the diminished electrical properties caused by oxidized donor polymers could further contribute to efficiency loss in OSC devices, considering that a previous study has reported that the photooxidation of donor polymers accompanies morphological degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">Herein, we systematically investigate the influence of the nanomorphology of a small-molecule acceptor on the environmental stability of OSC devices based on polymer:small-molecule blends. We address this issue in a system composed of poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-<italic>b</italic>:4,5-<italic>b</italic>′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-<italic>b</italic>]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7) and PCBM. Although OSC devices based on PCBM exhibit lower efficiencies than those based on nonfullerene acceptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, the highly miscible nature of PCBM is an advantage in controlling the nanomorphology of PCBM in blends<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. By varying the weight ratio (wt%) of PCBM, we prepared (1) a pristine PTB7, (2) an 80:20% PTB7:PCBM blend, which mainly contains dispersed PCBM, and (3) a 50:50% PTB7:PCBM blend, which contains not only dispersed PCBM but also aggregated PCBM due to the increased weight fraction of PCBM. These three films were subjected to aging under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination in dry air (20–30% RH), and their environmental stabilities were compared. This enabled us to distinguish the effects of dispersed PCBM and aggregated PCBM on the environmental stabilities of PTB7:PCBM blends. Surprisingly, we found that the environmental instabilities of the PTB7:PCBM blends stemmed from the dispersed PCBM in the mixed phase, which led to the severe photooxidation of PTB7 after only a few minutes of illumination in dry air. We showed that dispersed PCBM accelerated the formation of PTB7 triplet excitons by bimolecular recombination, leading to the generation of singlet oxygen, followed by the photooxidation of PTB7. However, the aggregated PCBM phase suppressed the photooxidation of PTB7 by alleviating the formation of PTB7 triplet excitons. In addition, the accelerated photooxidation of PTB7 in the PTB7:PCBM blend enabled us to investigate the influence of oxidized PTB7 on the efficiency of PTB7:PCBM OSC devices. We found that oxidized PTB7 substantially degrades hole transport in the films by decreasing the fraction of the crystalline PTB7 phase, thereby decreasing the number of hole transport pathways within the films. In particular, hole transport in the PTB7:PCBM blends degrades much faster than light absorption, which shows a strong correlation to the efficiency loss in OSC devices. These results signify the importance of controlling the nanomorphologies of small-molecule acceptors to achieve high environmental stability of polymer:small-molecule blends.

The probe wavelength was selected by two monochromators (Ritsu, MC-10C). To suppress scattered light and emission, an appropriate optical cutoff filter was equipped before and after the sample. The temporal evolution of ΔOD was reduced with a high-gain Si photodiode (Hamamatsu Photonics, S1722-01). The signal from the photodiode was preamplified and then sent to a main amplifier (Costronics Electronics) with an electronic bandpass filter to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. The resultant amplified signal was collected using a digital oscilloscope (Tektronix, TDS2022), which was synchronized with the trigger signal of a laser pulse from a Si photodiode (Thorlabs Inc., DET10A).

In addition, the PL of the 80:20% PTB7:PCBM blend was quenched by ~99% (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref>). These results indicate that the added 20 wt% of PCBM was mainly dispersed in the PTB7 matrix in the 80:20% PTB7:PCBM blend, confirming the presence of a two-phase morphology composed of a crystalline PTB7 phase and a mixed phase (dispersed PCBM in amorphous PTB7 phase).

A detailed analysis of the PL quenching efficiencies of the blends is discussed in the Supporting Information (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref>).

In addition, pristine PCBM showed almost unchanged absorption after 120 min of aging, indicating that PCBM has a higher photooxidative stability than pristine PTB7 (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S7</xref>). However, the 80:20% PTB7:PCBM blend suffered severe loss in absorption: its optical density in the 500–800 nm region decreased by 60% after 120 min of aging, which is five times greater than the optical density loss of pristine PTB7 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). These results show that a small fraction of PCBM can promote a substantial loss in the absorption of PTB7. Given the destabilization effect of PCBM, the loss in absorption of PTB7 should become increasingly severe with an increasing fraction of PCBM in the PTB7:PCBM blends. However, the 50:50% PTB7:PCBM blend showed a relatively smaller decrease in optical density (~50%) after 120 min of aging compared to the 80:20% PTB7:PCBM blend despite the additional 30 wt% of PCBM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>).

Moreover, new absorption peaks emerge at 1300, 1490, 1656, and 1640 cm<sup>−1</sup> in the spectra of all three blends after 120 min of aging; however, the peaks in the spectrum of the 80:20% PTB7:PCBM blend are more intense than those in the spectra of the pristine PTB7 and the 50:50% PTB7:PCBM blend (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). According to the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, the absorption bands at 1300 and 1656 cm<sup>−1</sup> are consistent with the FTIR spectrum of 1,4-benzoquinone, and those at 1490 and 1640 cm<sup>−1</sup> correspond to the FTIR spectrum of 2-ethyl-1-hexene. Thus, these peaks indicate that photooxidative structural changes of PTB7 involve the cleavage of the ether groups on the benzodithiophene during aging. The increase in absorption in the 300–400 nm region for the aged 80:20% PTB7:PCBM blend is supportive evidence for the formation of 1,4-benzoquinone, which has an absorption profile near 300 nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Therefore, the 50:50% PTB7:PCBM blend exhibited enhanced photooxidative stability compared with the 80:20% PTB7:PCBM blend, similar to the trend observed in the UV–Vis spectra. These results indicate that the photooxidation of PTB7 is strongly dependent on the nanomorphology of PCBM, as indicated by the 50:50% PTB7:PCBM blend, which includes both dispersed PCBM and aggregated PCBM, showing improved environmental stability compared with the 80:20% PTB7:PCBM blend, which includes mainly dispersed PCBM. That is, the destabilization effect of dispersed PCBM and the stabilization effect of aggregated PCBM coincide for the PTB7:PCBM blends, whose environmental stability is determined by the relative volume fractions of dispersed PCBM and aggregated PCBM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Photooxidation pathways facilitated by dispersed PCBM in PTB7:PCBM blends</title><p id="Par19">To enable a detailed discussion of the photooxidation pathways in the PTB7:PCBM blends containing PCBM with different nanomorphologies, we collected the TA spectra of the pristine PTB7 and PTB7:PCBM blends.

In addition, a singlet fission pathway can be excluded because the blends were excited under a very weak excitation fluence. Therefore, the formation of triplet excitons in the blends can be conjectured to originate predominantly from the bimolecular recombination of dissociated polarons. Consequently, triplet excitons can be generated in all the films even though their yield varied as a function of the weight fraction of PCBM.</p><p id="Par22">We next examined how the variation in the yield of triplet excitons affected the photooxidation of PTB7 according to the nanomorphologies of PCBM within the PTB7:PCBM blends. As previously mentioned, the transient signal on a time scale of microseconds was fitted with a monoexponential decay function for the pristine PTB7 and with the sum of an exponential decay and a power-law decay for the 80:20% and 50:50% PTB7:PCBM blends (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>). Among the fitting parameters, the preexponential factor was used to calculate the density of triplet excitons. That is, the ΔOD(<italic>t</italic>) of the transient signals was converted into the density of triplet excitons, <italic>N</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), according to the Beer–Lambert law: <italic>N</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) = ΔOD(<italic>t</italic>)<italic>N</italic><sub>A</sub>(1000<italic>ɛL</italic>)<sup>−1</sup>, where <italic>N</italic><sub>A</sub> is Avogadro’s constant, <italic>ɛ</italic> is the molar absorption coefficient, and <italic>L</italic> is the film thickness. The <italic>ɛ</italic> value of another conjugated polymer (<italic>ɛ</italic> = 8.7 × 10<sup>3 </sup>M<sup>−1</sup> cm<sup>−1</sup>) with a backbone similar to that of PTB7 was used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, assuming that the <italic>ɛ</italic> values of the triplet excitons of the two polymers are not substantially different from each other. The density of triplet excitons was larger in the PTB7:PCBM blends than in pristine PTB7 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>), suggesting that the formation yield of triplet excitons resulting from the bimolecular recombination of the PTB7:PCBM blends overwhelmed the yield generated by the direct ISC from the singlet states of pristine PTB7. Interestingly, the density of triplet excitons in the PTB7:PCBM blends was influenced by the nanomorphology of the PCBM. The photoexcitation of the 80:20% PTB7:PCBM blend yielded a higher density of triplet excitons than the photoexcitation of the 50:50% PTB7:PCBM blend. These results indicate that dispersed PCBM accelerated the formation of PTB7 triplet excitons, whereas the presence of aggregated PCBM lessened the formation of PTB7 triplet excitons.</p><p id="Par23">Other authors have reported that electron delocalization by fullerene aggregation effectively reduces the formation of triplet excitons of a polymer donor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. The spin-triplet charge-transfer (CT) states generated by the bimolecular recombination of free charges can either relax to form polymer triplet excitons or redissociate into free charges (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S10</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>; as the CT state became increasingly delocalized, the relaxation to a polymer triplet was suppressed because of the facilitated redissociation of the CT states into free charges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. The higher density of triplet excitons in the 80:20% PTB7:PCBM blend than in the 50:50% PTB7:PCBM blend in our results can be reasonably explained in the same context. That is, in the 80:20% blend, PCBM is dispersed rather than aggregated; the CT states generated by bimolecular recombination should therefore be relatively more localized compared with those generated in the 50:50% blend. This difference would reduce the redissociation of the CT states into free charges and increase the generation of triplet excitons, resulting in lower <italic>J</italic><sub>SC</sub>, FF, and PCE values for the 80:20% PTB7:PCBM OSC devices than for the 50:50% PTB7:PCBM OSC devices (Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref>).</p><p id="Par24">We then focused on the mechanism of photooxidation of the blends. In OSCs, photooxidation by singlet oxygen has been widely reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In general, photooxidation by singlet oxygen requires the formation of triplet excitons with lifetimes longer than several hundreds of nanoseconds and an energy level of triplet states suitable for generating singlet oxygen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. As we previously mentioned, the former condition was satisfied for all the blends. To confirm the latter condition, we evaluated the energy level of the singlet state of PTB7 from the intersection point of the normalized absorption and emission spectra (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S11</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. The energy level was estimated to be ~1.7 eV; consequently, the triplet state of PTB7 was estimated to be slightly above 1.0 eV on the basis of empirical relationships with conjugated polymers, in which the triplet state lies ~0.6–0.7 eV below the singlet state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. This triplet energy level above 1.0 eV implies that the formation of singlet oxygen (0.98 eV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> from the triplet states of PTB7 was energetically favorable. Our experimental results show good agreement between the degree of photooxidation and the yield of PTB7 triplet excitons, strongly supporting our hypothesis that the generation of triplet-mediated singlet oxygen is the main cause of the photooxidation of the PTB7:PCBM blend.</p><p id="Par25">From the above results, the effects of the nanomorphologies of PCBM on the photooxidation of the PTB7:PCBM blends can be summarized as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref> (see also Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S10</xref>). The photooxidation of the pristine and blend films is mainly caused by the singlet oxygen produced by the energy transfer from the triplet excitons of PTB7 to oxygen molecules. The yield of PTB7 triplet excitons is larger in the PTB7:PCBM blends than in the pristine PTB7 because the existence of PCBM in the blends leads to the formation of large amounts of triplet excitons by the bimolecular recombination of free charge carriers (denoted as the “destabilization pathway” in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>), while only a small amount of triplet excitons can be formed in the pristine film by ISC. Among the blends, the triplet yield is larger in the 80:20% PTB7:PCBM blend than in the 50:50% PTB7:PCBM blend. This is because in the 50:50% blend, the destabilization pathway is partially suppressed by the aggregated PCBM phase, which reduces the formation of triplet excitons by the delocalization of electrons in the aggregated phase (denoted as the “stabilization pathway” in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). Therefore, the degree of photooxidation was most severe in the 80:20% blend, followed by the 50:50% blend and pristine PTB7.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Significant deterioration of hole transport in PTB7:PCBM blends by photooxidized PTB7</title><p id="Par26">The accelerated photooxidation of PTB7 by dispersed PCBM led to a 50–60% loss in absorption in the PTB7:PCBM blends after 120 min of aging (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). However, the efficiency loss in the PTB7:PCBM OSC devices is two orders of magnitude (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>); thus, the loss in absorption alone cannot account for the loss of efficiency. Factors other than the loss in absorption, such as the degradation of electronic properties, likely contributed to the efficiency loss in the PTB7:PCBM OSC devices. As previously mentioned, the photooxidation of PTB7 is associated with an alteration of the chemical structure; we therefore speculated that the photooxidation of PTB7 would also affect the hole transport properties of the PTB7:PCBM blends.</p><p id="Par27">The deterioration of hole transport by photooxidation could be observed indirectly by collecting the photocurrent density (<italic>J</italic><sub>ph</sub>) vs. effective voltage (<italic>V</italic><sub>eff</sub>) curves and EQE spectra of the fresh and aged PTB7:PCBM OSC devices.

Surprisingly, oxidized PTB7 caused substantial deterioration of the hole transport properties. The hole currents of the 80:20% PTB7:PCBM blend, which exhibited severe photooxidation, decreased substantially.

The evolution of the volume and nanoscale packing of the crystalline PTB7 phases in the pristine PTB7 and blends during aging was investigated by using GIWAXS (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>, with detailed parameters in Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S5</xref>). For all the PTB7:PCBM blends, the volume of the crystalline PTB7 phase decreased, and its π–π stacking distance increased after aging. In particular, the 80:20% PTB7:PCBM blend, which showed severe photooxidation, underwent substantial morphological degradation during aging compared with the pristine PTB7 and 50:50% PTB7:PCBM blend. The intensity of its (100) reflection decreased by 40% after aging, indicating a loss of the lamellar structural order of the side chains due to the photooxidation-induced side-chain cleavage of PTB7. In addition, the intensity of its (010) reflection substantially decreased by 60% after aging, indicating reduced π–π stacking of the backbone moieties, possibly because side-chain cleavage increases the conformational diversity of the PTB7 backbone. The π–π stacking distance of this blend, as extracted from its (010) reflection in the GIWAXS pattern, increased from 3.90 to 4.22 nm after aging, which is unfavorable for the hopping transport of holes. The evolution of the GIWAXS patterns of the pristine PTB7 and the 50:50% PTB7:PCBM blend showed similar trends, with relatively small variance compared with the evolution of the GIWAXS patterns of the 80:20% PTB7:PCBM blend. These GIWAXS results are strongly correlated with the UV–Vis results of the PTB7:PCBM blends (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). The evolution of the 0–0 to 0–1 vibronic peak ratio, which indicates the degree of crystallinity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, gradually decreased with increasing aging time, correlating with a gradual blueshift of the overall absorption spectrum. These results indicate that a structural change in PTB7 caused by photooxidation substantially disrupts the long-range structural order of the crystalline PTB7 phases.

Our work demonstrates that these contradictory results are consequences of the contradictory effects of the nanomorphologies of small-molecule acceptors, i.e., dispersed acceptors and aggregated acceptors. In the case of polymer:fullerene blends, PTB7:PCBM, a blend that contains mostly dispersed PCBM, undergoes severe photooxidation under illumination in dry air, whereas a blend containing both dispersed PCBM and aggregated PCBM exhibits a relatively enhanced environmental stability compared with a blend composed mainly of dispersed PCBM. The dispersed PCBM accelerates the formation of PTB7 triplet excitons by bimolecular recombination, resulting in the generation of singlet oxygen and, hence, the severe photooxidation of PTB7. In contrast, the aggregated PCBM alleviates the formation of PTB7 triplet excitons through delocalized CT states, leading to the stabilization of PTB7. We also investigated the effect of oxidized PTB7 on the hole transport properties of PTB7:PCBM blends to explain the substantial efficiency losses of the PTB7:PCBM OSC devices. For all of the investigated PTB7:PCBM blends, aging resulted in more severe degradation of hole transport than the loss of light absorption, which exhibited a strong correlation with the efficiency losses in the PTB7:PCBM OSC devices. The deterioration of hole transport is mainly driven by the loss of the crystalline PTB7 phase due to photooxidation of the PTB7 chains, resulting in diminished hole transport pathways within the films. We extended our conclusions to the polymer:nonfullerene blends PTB7:ITIC and PTB7:Y6, thereby confirming the generality of this phenomenon in polymer:small-molecule organic solar cells.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant (2020R1A2C3004477, 2021R1A4A1030944) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT, Korea.
