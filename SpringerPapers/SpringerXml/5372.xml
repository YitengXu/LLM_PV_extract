id="Abs1"><title>Abstract</title><p id="Par1">As a vital step towards the industrialization of perovskite solar cells, outdoor field tests of large-scale perovskite modules and panels represent a mandatory step to be accomplished. Here we demonstrate the manufacturing of large-area (0.5 m<sup>2</sup>) perovskite solar panels, each containing 40 modules whose interfaces are engineered with two-dimensional materials (GRAphene-PErovskite (GRAPE) panels). We further integrate nine GRAPE panels for a total panel area of 4.5 m<sup>2</sup> in a stand-alone solar farm infrastructure with peak power exceeding 250 W, proving the scalability of this technology. We provide insights on the system operation by analysing the panel characteristics as a function of temperature and light intensity. The analysis, carried out over a months-long timescale, highlights the key role of the lamination process of the panels on the entire system degradation. A life-cycle assessment based on primary data indicates the high commercial potential of the GRAPE panel technology in terms of energy and environmental performances.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Demonstration of scalability, manufacturability and outdoor operation is key to the deployment of perovskite solar cells. Now, Pescetelli et al. fabricate a large number of perovskite solar modules, assemble them in panels and integrate them in an outdoor 4.5 m<sup>2</sup> solar farm infrastructure whose operation is monitored over 12 months.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>EC | EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation H2020 | H2020 Excellent

id="Sec1"><title>Main</title><p id="Par3">Among the third generation of photovoltaics (PVs), perovskite solar cell (PSC) technology is the most promising one to hit the PV market. This development has progressed with an impressive pace, allowing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs to surpass the ones of other commercial thin-film solar cell technologies (CdTe, (Cu,In)GaSe<sub>2</sub>, amorphous Si) and approach the state-of-the-art PCE of single crystal silicon (c-Si) solar cells (26.1%) (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>). Coupled with the exceptional PV performance, the low manufacturing cost of PSCs (&lt;38.8 US$ m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup>) (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>) is particularly attractive for large-scale production of modules and panels, enabling the design of novel tandem configurations together with c-Si and other thin-film PVs. Remarkably, the PSC technology has the potential to reach a levelized cost of electricity less than 20€ MWh<sup>−1</sup> (refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>).</p><p id="Par4">In this context, the demonstration of effective fabrication processes for large-area perovskite solar modules (PSMs) and their integration into a solar farm operating in outdoor conditions are key challenges from an industrial perspective. Hence, the main prerequisites for the full exploitation of PSC technology are: the engineering of cell architecture able to retain the lab-scale devicesʼ performances during the upscaling process; the design of effective module interconnection; the establishment of panel lamination processes compatible with thermal and chemical stability requirements of the PSC materials and the panel stability.</p><p id="Par5">In the past few years, strong efforts have been devoted to the fabrication of large-area PSMs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. However, there are not yet reports concerning field tests of m<sup>2</sup>-sized solar farms and their real-life operation in outdoor conditions. Outdoor testing of laboratory-scale PSCs is still limited and mainly focused on the analysis of temperature coefficients of power, neglecting accurate short-circuit current (<italic>I</italic><sub>SC</sub>), open circuit voltage (<italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub>) and fill factor (FF) dependence on both the irradiance and the temperature conditions as those occurring during outdoor operation. Consequently, additional data and knowledge are needed to evaluate the stability and degradation of large-scale PSMs and panels under real operation conditions, enabling the energy yield of a perovskite-based solar farm to be forecasted.</p><p id="Par6">To bridge the gap between laboratory prototypes and outdoor operating solar farms, we exploit the know-how developed in the use of graphene and other two-dimensional materials for interface engineering of PSCs and PSMs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, realizing panel-scale 2D materials-enabled PV perovskite (GRAphene-PErovskite, GRAPE) demonstrators. Such knowledge was the key to success in designing, assembling and constructing a stand-alone solar farm consisting of 4.5 m<sup>2</sup> total panel area. The GRAPE panels consist of state-of-the-art mesoscopic n-i-p PSMs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>) based on graphene-doped electron transporting layers (ETLs) and functionalized MoS<sub>2</sub> (fMoS<sub>2</sub>) buffer layers inserted between the perovskite and the hole transporting layer (HTL). Our holistic approach includes the development of the required solar farm infrastructure, the integration of GRAPE panels and the design and installation of required peripherals (that is, power electronics, real-time data acquisition systems and a weather station). The continuous monitoring and the direct correlation of the environmental conditions with the outdoor performance of the GRAPE panels provide true metrics for assessing the lifetime of the proposed technology, while offering valuable information on the potential for the commercialization of this technology. In this scenario, the life-cycle assessment (LCA) methodology is used to evaluate the environmental footprint and sustainability of the GRAPE technology. Importantly, the assessment of the energy production and stability and the LCA of the proposed technologies allow to reach a technology readiness level (TRL) 7 (system prototype demonstration in operational environment). To the best of our knowledge, no previous analyses on perovskite-based PVs have been so far reported up to this TRL, which will be of interest for the PV industrial sector.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Two-dimensional materials-based modules and panels</title><p id="Par7">Two-dimensional materials were produced in an industrial pilot production plant through wet-jet milling (WJM) and/or liquid-phase exfoliation techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.

Lastly, the choice of PTAA as the HTL was motivated by its intrinsic thermal stability up to 85 °C (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>), a temperature set by the International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS) and International Electrotechnical Commission stability test protocols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.

This choice led to a high production yield of the PSMs with a low failure rate, which is typically determined by the ETL/perovskite/HTL stack removal (that is, the P2 laser process; Supplementary Information provides further details)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.

Even if these results are important at such device scale, the spread of PCE data distribution across 360 PSMs is currently attributed to the complex fabrication process that includes 16 different steps, as described hereafter. It is expected that the PCE spread will be reduced by a fully automated PSM fabrication.</p><p id="Par10">The as-produced PSMs were sorted in terms of their maximum power point (MPP) performance, while special attention was paid during their assembly into several GRAPE panels by hybrid series/parallel connections (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>), aiming at properly balancing their PV metrics distribution. Each panel consists of five parallel connected strings realized by connecting eight modules in series, resulting in 40 PSMs per panel (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3a</xref>). A low-temperature cross-linkable ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) has been used as sealing material (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3b</xref>) being compatible with a standard PV lamination process used in commercially viable PV technologies. The primary module was sealed with a Kapton foil capable to prevent module degradation induced by the possible release of acetic acid by EVA during the panel’s operation and to avoid the back electrode delamination during EVA melting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Such precaution allowed us to establish a low-temperature (85 °C) lamination approach that limited the degradation of the thermally sensitive materials contained in the PSMs. We formulated a multi-step lamination protocol (Methods) compatible with the temperature/pressure boundary conditions imposed by the perovskite-based modules.</p><p id="Par11">The performance of each GRAPE panel was initially assessed by performing outdoor characterizations at the Energia Solare TEst e Ricerca (ESTER) facility of the Centre for Hybrid and Organic Solar Energy, just after the fabrication process and before its installation in the solar farm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>).

To further elucidate the trend of the solar farm metrics, the thermal stress of the stand-alone system has been evaluated during ‘hot days’ in the June 2020–June 2021 period in Crete, focusing on temperature as the external parameter determining the solar farm performance. The temperature of the panels during the day followed the trend of the ambient temperature. However, the panel temperature was higher than the ambient one, and the peak temperature was reached in the afternoon, almost one hour after the maximum irradiance (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">18a</xref>). Despite the temperature of GRAPE panels reaching values as high as ~50 °C (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">18a</xref>), the energy produced by the solar farm was very close to that estimated for a solar farm operating at standard test conditions (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">18b</xref>).</p><p id="Par18">Notably, the temperature sensitivity of the PV performance is typically regulated by an internal balance between charge generation and recombination processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.

The failure of the module lamination is mainly related to the low-temperature cross linking of EVA and the process (85 °C) that was chosen to avoid degradation of the PSMs during their encapsulation. In fact, the lamination temperature used in the present work is close to the maximum temperature reached by the panels in some hot days in Crete (~70 °C, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14c</xref>).

The possibility of building a life-cycle inventory largely based on high TRL primary data permits us to make a robust assessment compared with other LCA studies published in literature (Supplementary Discussion <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">16</xref>) in which most of the information is not experimentally derived. In our analysis, the chosen functional unit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> is 1 kWh of generated electricity by the solar farm. To increase the level of information, the reference flow corresponding to one PSM module based on GRAPE technology of 121 cm<sup>2</sup> (active area = 81 cm<sup>2</sup>) was used to characterize the eco-profile of the manufacturing phase. The life-cycle data inventories (Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>) include all the input and output flows related to materials and energy requirement characterizing the module manufacturing process, the outdoor station lamination and the operational phase (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">27</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">28</xref>). Due to the lack of primary data on the end-of-life phase of the PV solar farm, the modelling of this life-cycle phase is excluded from the analysis. The Environmental Footprint (EF) 2.0 method was used to perform the life-cycle impact analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, thus, providing eco-profiles characterized according to 16 environmental categories (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref> and description in Supplementary Information). To determine data quality and representativeness, the pedigree uncertainty matrix (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>) was applied to demonstrate that the LCA data accuracy is ~97–98% for the identified impact categories (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>).</p><p id="Par28">Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows the PSM manufacturing process (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>) and the characterization of its eco-profile (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). The largest impact on all the EF categories is given by Step 15 ‘Gold evaporation’.

To this regard, LCA results of a hypothetical GRAPE module using a graphene-based back electrode for the PSMs are reported in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>, showing the environmental benefits associated with gold replacement. Another environmental hotspot that could be mitigated through material replacement is associated with the consumption of silver in Step 4A and Step 6A. Notably, this consumption could be reduced by implementing a full P1/P2/P3 laser process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. From the energy-consumption point of view, the second-most costly contribution to the eco-profile is represented by Step 5, that is, ‘Compact layer deposition’, due to the electricity consumed during the spray pyrolysis deposition. Feasible minimization of the environmental impact of this step could be addressed by performing a low-temperature process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. This could lead to an improvement in the deposition efficiency and a consistent reduction of this step burden on the overall environmental profile. We should also point out that the very low quantities of 2D materials present in the PSM (0.2 mg of graphene and 0.6 mg of fMoS<sub>2</sub>) do not represent an environmental hotspot for the eco-profile of the PSM based on GRAPE technology (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>LCA of the GRAPE module and solar farm.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, Workflow of the PSM manufacturing and panel assembling based on GRAPE technology. <bold>b</bold>, Characterization results of the PSM manufacturing environmental profile.

Deposition uniformity, post processing (solvent, gas, vacuum or other quenching techniques), P1–P2–P3 laser processes on large areas represent just some of the criticalities that need to be considered during PSM upscaling. For this reason, to develop a large number of modules, we opted for a solution inspired by the silicon technology, namely a panel made connecting submodules. These submodules were fabricated on a substrate area (11 × 11 cm<sup>2</sup>), which guaranteed an optimal trade-off between PCE and reproducibility.</p><p id="Par38">The first step of module fabrication consists of the patterning of the FTO-covered glass substrates (Pilkington, 8 Ω/□ (110 × 110 mm<sup>2</sup>)) by a raster scanning laser (Nd: YVO<sub>4</sub> pulsed at 80 kHz average fluency 700 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>, λ = 350 nm) to isolate adjacent cells (P1 process) composing the final module. After the patterning process, each substrate was cleaned by ultrasonic bath using detergent with de-ionized water, acetone and isopropanol (10 min for each step). A screen-printed metal mask was applied over the FTO glass substrate to prevent compact TiO<sub>2</sub> (cTiO<sub>2</sub>) deposition over the cell interconnection and contact area. The graphene-doped compact TiO<sub>2</sub> (cTiO<sub>2</sub> + G) blocking layer (40 nm) was deposited by spray pyrolysis at 460 °C a solution consisting of 0.16 M Ti(AcAc)<sub>2</sub> and 0.4 M AcAc in EtOH doped with graphene ink (1 vol%). Subsequently, the compact layers were annealed for 30 min at 460 °C. The metal mask was subsequently removed from the samples using a HCl in de-ionized water solution. The same graphene ink (1 vol%) was used to dope the solution of mesoporous TiO<sub>2</sub> (mTiO<sub>2</sub>) paste (30 NR-D, GreatCell SolarDyesol) in EtOH (1:5 wt/wt). The resulting graphene-doped mTiO<sub>2</sub> (mTiO<sub>2</sub> + G) solution was deposited on the substrate by spin coating at 3,000 r.p.m. for 20 s and subsequently annealed in air for 30 min at 480 °C to obtain a 120 nm-thick scaffold layer. The perovskite layer was deposited in a N<sub>2</sub>-filled glove box after cooling down the samples to room temperature. The perovskite solution was obtained by mixing FAI (1 M), PbI<sub>2</sub> (1.1 M), MABr (0.2 M), PbBr<sub>2</sub> (0.2 M) and CsI (1.5 mM) in a mixture of anhydrous DMF/DMSO (4:1 vol/vol). After 30 min of stirring at room temperature, the perovskite was spin coated onto the samples, using an anti-solvent method. In particular, a two-step programme at 1,000 r.p.m. for 10 s and 5,000 r.p.m. for 30 s was used to deposit the perovskite precursor solution. During the second step, 1 ml of CB was poured on the spinning substrate 7 s before the end of the programme. Immediately after spin coating, the substrates were annealed at 100 °C for 1 h to form a perovskite crystal structure resulting in a compact perovskite layer with a thickness of 450 nm. The fMoS<sub>2</sub> interlayer was deposited by thermal-assisted spray coating by keeping the perovskite substrate at 80 °C during the deposition process. Subsequently, the photoelectrode was covered by a PTAA (10 mg ml<sup>−1</sup>) solution in toluene, doped with tBP 7 µl ml<sup>−1</sup> and LiTFSI (170 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> in ACN) 10 µl ml<sup>−1</sup> and spin coated at 1,600 r.p.m. for 25 s. At this stage, a second laser process (P2) was carried out to clean the FTO interconnection areas by setting the laser fluence at 248.8 mJ cm<sup>−2</sup> and a raster scanning distance at 2 µm for a total P2 area of 400 µm approximately, to ensure high quality and reproducibility over hundreds of devices. The modulesʼ aperture ratio is 82%, as achieved by a cell width of 9 mm and a dead area of 2 mm. Finally, a high vacuum chamber (10<sup>−6</sup> mbar) was used to thermally evaporate the 150 nm Au back electrode. Lastly, adjacent cell isolation from the CE side was achieved by a third laser ablation (P3 process) with a fluence of 306 mJ cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> and a raster scanning distance of 3 µm for a total ablated width of 120 µm.</p><p id="Par39">Current–voltage (<italic>I</italic>–<italic>V</italic>) characteristics of unmasked and encapsulated modules were acquired in air by using a solar simulator (ABET Sun 2000, class A) calibrated at AM1.5 and 100 mW cm<sup>−2</sup> illumination with a certified reference Si cell (RERA Solutions RR-1002). Incident power was measured with a Skye SKS 1110 sensor. The class of the solar simulator was measured with a BLACK-Comet UV–vis spectrometer.

A thorough screening of commercial and research lamination materials was preliminarily performed to assess their compatibility with the PSM lamination process. A cross-linkable EVA was chosen as the encapsulant material because of its low lamination temperature of 85 °C (1 h at a maximum pressure of 1 atm). The latter permitted the optimum lamination of all the PSMs, while avoiding temperature-sensitive materials degradation. Moreover, the presence of a primary Kapton encapsulation in the PSM (Supplementary Information section ‘Panel assembly and lamination’ provides further details) reduced the impact of the acetic acid that is released by the EVA during the panel’s operation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Perovskite modules were laminated between a front glass and a back sheet, consisting of a structure of polypropylene (PP)-aluminium-polyethylene terephthalate (PET)-PP foil.</p><p id="Par41">More in detail, panel laminations were performed using: a commercial PV laminator (Core2 Model from Rise technology) equipped with a cooling system to guarantee a high reproducibility on the lamination procedure and to reduce the exposure time of the PSC functional materials to potentially critical temperatures; a back sheet (Icosolar CPO 3 G alu) made of an aluminium foil, minimizing the panel weight while providing a hermetic barrier to O<sub>2</sub> and water vapour from the backside; an edge sealer (HelioSeal PVS 101) in the butyl-based tape version to facilitate the application. This component was laminated together with primary sealer to reduce sideways water vapour permeation; a cross-linkable EVA with a lamination temperature of 85 °C (38-CTU-AL ultra-clear from Xinology) as the main sealing material to encapsulate the PSC modules, protecting the latter from oxygen contamination while allowing for a low-temperature lamination approach.</p><p id="Par42">We developed the following multi-step lamination procedure: (1) the panel is put in a moderate vacuum condition (1 mbar), (2) the temperature is progressively increased by 10 °C min<sup>–1</sup> until 60 °C and held for 30 min, (3) the temperature is further increased with a rate of 10 °C min<sup>–1</sup> until 85 °C, (4) the pressure is increased with a rate of 150 mbar min<sup>–1</sup> until 1,000 mbar and then held for 60 min and (5) a forced cooling step is then performed with a rate of –7 °C min<sup>–1</sup> until 55 °C.</p><p id="Par43">Looking at the final module and panel performance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), the upscaling from modules to panels results in a PCE reduction of almost 30%. Although a reduction of PCE is often observed during the upscaling of any PV technologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>, possible strategies to mitigate the performance drop of our technology are: (1) reducing the temperature stress during the lamination process by adopting advanced encapsulant materials recently proposed for PSCs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup> (2) increasing the light transmittance by increasing the optical transparency of the lamination glass over the perovskite absorption range and (3) minimizing the electrical performance mismatch between the PSMs composing a GRAPE panel. Nevertheless, we point out the PV performances achieved for our GRAPE panels, to the best of our knowledge, represent the current state of the art at such scale.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Panel testing</title><p id="Par44">The ESTER lab, in which the GRAPE panels were initially tested, consists of three separate units (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>): solar-weather, spectral and PV test. The solar-weather unit provides measurements of the three separate components of solar irradiance (direct, diffuse, reflected), the global horizontal solar irradiance and the standard weather parameters (for example, temperature, humidity and wind speed). The spectral unit measures the solar spectral irradiance in the spectral range 350–1,700 nm. The PV unit consists of four stands that can hold approximately 15 PV panels of medium size. The stand n. 1 is a south-oriented frame with variable tilt angles. The stand n. 2 is a sun tracker. The stand n. 3 can mount flexible PV panels on curved surfaces, while stand n. 4 can be tilted and oriented in various directions providing a high experimental versatility in the PV modules test configuration. The stands are equipped with irradiance sensors (pyranometers and reference cells of various technologies). Each PV module is continuously connected to a MPP tracker (MPPT) developed and provided by ISAAC-SUPSI, Lugano, CH. The energy produced by operating panels is dissipated via a resistive load. The data are collected by a Campbell Scientific CR1000 data logger via RS485. Moreover, every 10 min, <italic>I</italic>–<italic>V</italic> curves of each module are traced and stored in the database together with the 1 min rate MPP data. Short-, medium- and long-term monitoring activities of GRAPE panels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup> were carried out at the facility.

This array configuration was suggested by electrical simulations of the solar farm, aiming to avoid shading effects in the early morning and in the late afternoon. The installed mounting structures can be adjusted, allowing any difference of the ground height/slope to be compensated. The PV panels were electrically interconnected in a parallel string configuration consisting of nine in-parallel PV panels with a total surface area of 4.5 m<sup>2</sup>. Notably, some of the panels were fabricated six months before launching the solar farm with a total of nine panels because of the three-month lockdown related to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p id="Par46">The optimization of the MPP estimation was performed based on the development of a suitable MPP tracker driven by a specific algorithm. The produced energy of the solar farm was extracted using commercial charging regulators (BlueSolar MPPT 100/30, Victron Energy) and an inverter (Phoenix Inverter Smart 1600VA, Victron Energy). Thus, the energy was stored in batteries (four 6 V, 260 Ah commercial sunlight batteries connected in series) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7c</xref>).
