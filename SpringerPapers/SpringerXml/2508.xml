While high pressures and temperatures are required for the reaction, plasmonic photoexcitation of the Ag catalyst enables epoxidation at near-ambient conditions. Here, we use surface-enhanced Raman scattering to monitor the plasmon excitation-assisted reaction on individual sites of a Ag nanoparticle catalyst. We uncover an unconventional mechanism, wherein the primary step is the photosynthesis of graphene on the Ag surface. Epoxidation of ethylene is then promoted by this photogenerated graphene. Density functional theory simulations point to edge defects on the graphene as the sites for epoxidation. Guided by this insight, we synthesize a composite graphene/Ag/α-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalyst, which accomplishes ethylene photo-epoxidation under ambient conditions at which the conventional Ag/α-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalyst shows negligible activity.

Although the nature of the active site of the catalyst is often deducible from electronic structure simulations or ultrahigh vacuum single-crystal studies, but under realistic working conditions, the catalyst can be appreciably different in structure and mechanism from the idealization. Moreover, under reaction conditions, the catalytically active phase can involve a dynamically changing surface structure and/or composition, which is not reflected in a steady-state picture. In situ studies under working conditions are therefore of central importance in atomic-level elucidation, design, and optimization of industrially relevant catalysts.</p><p id="Par4">The epoxidation of ethylene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>) to ethylene oxide (EO), a major feedstock for several organic chemicals and plastics, is practiced on a massive scale of ~2 × 10<sup>7</sup> tons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> and tens of billions of dollars worth of annual production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.

However, accomplishment of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> epoxidation at moderate pressures and temperatures is desirable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> from the point of view of reducing heat energy input, enhancing energy efficiency, mitigating thermal damage and deactivation of the catalyst, and further enhancing EO selectivity by reducing high-temperature-favored processes such as isomerization of EO to acetaldehyde<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and full oxidation to CO<sub>2</sub>.

Using in situ surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), we interrogate surface chemical events occurring in real time on individual domains of the photocatalyst. The interrogation reveals an active phase and working mechanism of the photocatalyst deviating markedly from the presupposed picture of a pristine metal surface. The primary step in the photocatalysis is the dynamic photosynthesis of graphenic carbon from the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> precursor. The in situ photogenerated graphene serves to actively promote further C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> epoxidation. Armed with the insight that the active photocatalytic phase involves graphenic carbon and not just the pristine metal surface, we prepare a composite graphene/Ag/α-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> photocatalyst. This composite photocatalyst accomplishes epoxidation at ambient temperature and pressure conditions, where a conventional Ag/α-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> photocatalyst shows low activity.

Here, an emitter refers to a discrete light-absorbing, light-scattering domain, consisting of one or a few Ag NPs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). The single-domain spatial resolution and high sensitivity of SERS allowed us to capture reactants, intermediates, and products stochastically formed on the catalyst surface (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), which are otherwise undetectable in spatially averaged measurements, due to their short lifetimes on the surface and/or low steady-state concentrations.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>In situ SERS study of Ag NP-photocatalyzed C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> epoxidation. <bold>a</bold> Schematic of experimental setup, where a home-made reaction flow cell is mounted in an optical microscope for in situ SERS study.

After C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> is introduced, distinct SERS bands are seen to emerge (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d, e</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>) in some cases, following an induction period. Nearly 40% of all individual emitters monitored (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) showed such dynamic chemical activity. The remaining ~60% of the emitters show non-responsive SERS spectra under C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> flow (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, f</xref>), possibly due to the absence of an electromagnetic field hotspot for ample SERS amplification (e.g., single Ag NPs in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>) or due to a significantly oxidized, inactive Ag surface. We did not study this non-responsive class of emitters further, instead focusing our attention on the responsive sub-population.</p><p id="Par8">The SERS bands observed under reaction conditions (i.e., C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> flow) are well-defined with peak maxima at ~1340 and ~1570 cm<sup>−1</sup>, which can be assigned, respectively, to the D and G bands of graphenic carbon. The presence of vibrational overtones at 2650 cm<sup>−1</sup> (2D mode), 2890 cm<sup>−1</sup> (D + G mode), and 3160 cm<sup>−1</sup> (2G mode) further confirms the assignment of the SERS spectrum (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>) to graphenic carbon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) characterization, discussed later, provides visual evidence of the formed graphene. We confirm that C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> acts as the direct precursor for graphene generation from the results shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d, e</xref>, where the emergence of graphene features is observed to be correlated with the introduction of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>. Thus, it appears that the condensation of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> to graphene on the Ag surface is a primary step under the photo-epoxidation conditions.</p><p id="Par9">As per recent reports, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> monomers can undergo condensation reactions at high temperatures (e.g., 770–970 K) on transition metal surfaces (e.g., Rh (111) to form extended graphene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>)</sup>. In the present case, the ambient temperature formation of graphenic carbon appears to be photoactivated by visible-light excitation of the plasmon-resonant Ag NPs. The graphene is formed from condensation of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> monomers via a photo-driven process on the Ag NP surface. On the basis of recent plasmon-assisted bond-dissociation reactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, we propose that the plasmon-excited Ag NP surface and/or surface-adsorbed O<sub>2</sub> is involved in hot electron-assisted hydride abstraction from the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>. The resulting carbene species can polymerize to form graphene.</p><p id="Par10">Such photosynthesis of graphene at ambient temperature ought to be contrasted from the formation of amorphous carbon or coking of catalyst surfaces known in high-temperature catalytic cracking processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In the latter processes, hydrocarbon reactants and/or products, particularly of the aromatic kind, strongly adsorb on the catalyst surface, where they gradually accumulate followed by chemical reactions to produce amorphous carbon deposits of low volatility, resulting in poisoning of the catalyst. Whereas surface carbon formation or coking is known to contaminate or poison the metal catalyst; the in situ generated graphenic carbon in our case appears to promote C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> photo-epoxidation, as described in the next section.</p><p id="Par11">The 2D band of the in situ generated graphene (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>) is significantly weaker in intensity compared to that for free-standing, pristine graphene (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>). It is known that a suppressed 2D band is a signature of disruption in the electronic structure of graphene, like those caused by molecular adsorbates, lattice defects, and/or graphene–metal substrate electronic interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Based on this known characteristic, the weak 2D band appears to be an indicator of the electronic contact of the in situ generated graphene fragment with the Ag NP surface, n-doping of the graphene by Ag, and/or unterminated bonds of the fragments. Also, it must be noted that the graphenic carbon bands (see Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>) can be assigned either to graphene or to graphene oxide, which can inter-change with each other under laser irradiation in ambient air: graphene can photo-oxidize into graphene oxide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and the latter can be reduced back to graphene by laser excitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, assisted by the light-absorbing Ag NP.

The composite of this in situ formed graphenic carbon with the plasmonic Ag NP constitutes the catalytically active phase of the photocatalyst. This atomic-level insight coupled with DFT simulations sheds light into an unconventional role of crystalline carbon as a promoter in the photocatalysis and also allows us to engineer an improved photocatalyst for ambient-condition C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> epoxidation.

Ten microliters of this colloid, which has a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) absorption band maximum at ~432 nm (see Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>), were diluted with 40 µL of Nanopure water.

Then, 10 µL of the diluted NP dispersion was drop-casted onto the coverslip and allowed to dry at room temperature to obtain well-segregated NP emitters. The coverslip-supported sample was then subjected to a cleaning method for removing citrate ligands from the surfaces of the NPs. The sample-coated coverslip was heated in a vacuum desiccator at 80–90 °C for 5 h (including time for ramping up to high temperature) and then allowed to cool. After such pretreatment, a large fraction of the Ag NP emitters was found to be free of background SERS signal from citrate. The coverslip was incorporated into the flow cell. Briefly, a precleaned glass slide was blow dried with N<sub>2</sub> gas. A polyethylene tube (Instech laboratories, 0.076 cm inner diameter) was inserted into the 1 mm hole (the inlet of the flow cell) and glued using 5 min Loctite epoxy. The epoxy was allowed to polymerize for 20 min after mixing. The 2.5 mm hole was left unsealed to serve as the outlet for the flow cell.

The duration of the pretreatment varied from one sample to another, but generally a 10 min exposure was sufficient to yield Ag NP emitters with no SERS backgrounds. Note that this method can cause some oxidation of the Ag NP surface; however, we found the SERS response to be qualitatively consistent with samples cleaned by vacuum baking.

In the case of (i) and (ii), imaging was conducted on the central region of the TEM grid, which had been laser-treated. Micrographs were acquired by an Orius CCD camera with an exposure time of 0.1 s and an acquisition time of 1 s. Micrographs were analyzed in ImageJ or Digital Micrograph software. Fast-Fourier transforms of selected regions were performed to determine lattice fringe distances. Scale bars were also included in ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Data availability</title><p id="Par57">Data supporting the findings of this manuscript, Matlab codes, and computational input files are available from the corresponding authors upon reasonable request.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by the Arnold and Mabel O.
