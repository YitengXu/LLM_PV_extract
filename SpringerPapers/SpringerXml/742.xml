However, increased energy consumption, operator energy cost and the potential environmental impact of increased greenhouse gas emissions and the exhaustion of non-renewable energy resources (fossil fuel) pose major challenges to cellular network operators. The specific power supply needs for rural base stations (BSs) such as cost-effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability and reliability can be satisfied by taking advantage of the technological advances in renewable energy. This study investigates the possibility of decreasing both operational expenditure (OPEX) and greenhouse gas emissions with guaranteed sustainability and reliability for rural BSs using a solar photovoltaic/diesel generator hybrid power system. Three key aspects have been investigated: (i) energy yield, (ii) economic factors and (iii) greenhouse gas emissions. The results showed major benefits for mobile operators in terms of both environmental conservation and OPEX reduction, with an average annual OPEX savings of 43% to 47% based on the characteristics of solar radiation exposure in Malaysia. Finally, the paper compares the feasibility of using the proposed approach in a four-season country and compares the results against results obtained in Malaysia, which is a country with a tropical climate.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Mobile base station</kwd><kwd>Energy efficiency</kwd><kwd>Off-grid hybrid energy systems</kwd><kwd>Cost-effectiveness</kwd><kwd>Environmental impacts</kwd><kwd>HOMER</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>9</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-collection-editor</meta-name><meta-value>Xianfu Lei, Diomidis S.

In 2013, the number of mobile subscribers reached 6.8 billion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], of whom 1 billion were in rural areas (off-grid sites) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. To access these new markets and provide a service to potential customers in remote rural areas, the number of BSs has been increased to fulfil the needs of mobile subscribers and increase the coverage area. According to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], BSs are considered the primary source of energy consumption in cellular networks, accounting for 57% of the total energy used and putting the cellular operators under immense pressure to solve the problem of electricity supply in a reliable and cost-effective way. However, electrical grids are typically not available in these remote locations due to the geographical limitations (challenging terrain) that make access to these sites difficult. Therefore, supplying power to an off-grid BS is a significant challenge. Traditionally, a diesel generator (DG) is used to supply electrical power to a base station at an off-grid site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Nevertheless, the concept of using DGs to power BSs has become much less viable for network companies looking to expand and deliver their services to potential new customers for the following reasons:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par3">Economic aspect: most of the costs go to the fuel, which is expensive, and the fuel price will continue to increase in the future. Additionally, the transfer of fuel to these remote places characterised by challenging terrain may require special means of transport, such as helicopters, which increases the cost of the operation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> presents the costs of operating DGs, which include the initial capital cost, installation cost, operating and maintenance (O&amp;M) cost and fuel cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>Net costs of operating a DG</bold> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]<bold>.</bold></p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13638_2015_284_Fig1_HTML.gif" id="MO1"/></fig></p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par4">Environmental impact: air pollution by harmful components emitted from diesel fuels such as carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides causes global warming, the depletion of the ozone layer, cancer, genetic mutations and acid rain.

Accordingly, increasing awareness of the environmental impact of greenhouse gas emissions and the exhaustion of non-renewable energy resources (fossil fuel) has highlighted the critical need to improve the energy efficiency of cellular networks.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par5">Technical issues: the efficiency of the DG system is low, with only approximately 30% of the fuel energy being converted to electrical energy and the rest lost as heat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In addition, BS sites supplied by DGs are not reliable; 65% of the telecom service losses are due to outages resulting from a variety of the failures from which these generators suffer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. When a failure occurs, the input of substantial time and money is generally required to bring a technician on site to perform the necessary repairs.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par6">These drawbacks have motivated cellular network operators to search for solutions to both promote environmental conservation and reduce capital and operational costs. The specific power supply requirements for rural BSs, such as cost-effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability and reliability, can be met by utilising the technological advances in renewable energy. The network equipment deployed in these remote locations must be optimised so that they save energy while providing the best service with the largest coverage feasible. If network companies can install renewable energy supplies for their remote sites, they would gain access to hundreds of millions of potential new customers. Furthermore, by adopting renewable energy sources, network operators can reduce their operating expenses and have a positive impact on the environment via the reduction of harmful gas emissions.</p><p id="Par7">The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents studies that have investigated the possibility of reducing both the OPEX and greenhouse gas emissions through the use of renewable energy systems in different zones of the world. Section 3 discusses the potential for using renewable energy to supply the BSs in remote places in Malaysia, and Section 4 describes the use of solar energy in Malaysia, including the characteristics of the solar radiation of Malaysia and the barriers to using solar photovoltaic (SPV) panels in Malaysia, as well as some recommendations. In Section 5, the system architecture for the hybrid power model to supply long-term evolution (LTE)-BS is described, and Section 6 presents the mathematical model. Section 7 briefly introduces the hybrid optimisation model for electric renewables (HOMER) software, a hybrid power system modelling tool used in this study, and Section 8 includes the simulation configuration. Section 9 presents the results and discussion. Section 10 presents the comparison and estimation of the feasibility of using the solar energy approach in Germany by using Malaysia as the central point of reference, and Section 11 concludes this paper.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Related studies</title><p id="Par8">Over the last 5 years, significant developments have been made in integrating electrical grids and renewable energy into a smart grid to manage the power supply of BS sites.

However, some barriers that affect the performance of SPV panels should be considered, as power shortages are not admissible in the cellular network sector.</p><p id="Par17">One of the major drawbacks of using solar cells is shade, which may dramatically reduce the power produced by the solar cell. In some seasons, tropical countries experience heavy rain and cloudiness that may continue for several days, causing battery banks to run out of charge more quickly. To solve this problem, the present study suggests the hybridisation of the solar power system with existing backup DG in rural areas, which will provide BSs with a sustainable and reliable power supply, especially if the battery lifespan is short.</p><p id="Par18">Dirt, dust, tree debris, moss, sap, water spots, mould, etc. on solar panels have a significant impact on the performance of solar power systems. Cleaning the panels is also a problem. The SPV panels are installed at relatively high sites to maximise their access to the sunlight, and moss and grass grow quickly on the panels, increasing the cost of cleaning the panels. Therefore, we recommend installing solar panels on tilted roofs (with tilts of as little as 5° to 10°) to allow wind, rain and gravity to remove most debris and dust naturally.</p><p id="Par19">In addition, the rapid growth of the surrounding trees will shade the panels, decreasing the performance of PV panels. Solar PV panels mounted on high poles also attract lightning strikes, the destructive voltage of which destroys the electronic components. Furthermore, the bypass diodes, which are mounted in the termination box under each panel, may crack under high humidity, heat and short circuits. One of the solutions is to engage trained educated villagers to operate, maintain and manage the solar panels.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>System architecture</title><p id="Par20">Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> is a schematic showing two subsystems: the BS and the hybrid energy source.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>System model of an adaptive power management scheme for remote LTE-BS.</bold></p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13638_2015_284_Fig5_HTML.gif" id="MO5"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec7"><title>Base station subsystem</title><p id="Par21">The BS, a centrally located set of equipment used to communicate with mobile units and the backhaul network, consists of multiple transceivers (TRXs), which in turn consist of a power amplifier (PA) that amplifies the input power, a radio-frequency (RF) small-signal transceiver section, a baseband (BB) for system processing and coding, a DC-DC power supply, a cooling system and an alternating current (AC)-DC unit for connection to the electrical power grid.

Between all the components in a base station, solar cells have been found to be the most expensive in terms of capital cost. Hence, solar cells have a lifetime of 20 years, which is the same as the project lifetime, so neither BS nor the solar cells require replacement during the 20-year period. In addition, the next-generation network, i.e. fifth generation (5G), is predicted to be implemented in the next 20 years, based on historical evolution from the previous legacy network cycle, e.g. 3G and 2G. The Malaysian annual real interest rate was 3.25% in 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. HOMER makes a decision in each time step to meet the power needs at the lowest cost, subject to the constraints of the dispatch strategy chosen in the simulation and a set point of 80%. The system must supply electricity to both the load (base station system) and the backup power system each hour. In the present study, the backup power needs 10% of the hourly load requirement to retain enough spare capacity to serve the load even under a sudden 10% decrease in the renewable energy output within an hour. Moreover, several sets of sizes will be considered in the simulation, taking into account the SPV, inverter and number of batteries needed to achieve cost-effective, reliable and efficient performance in the optimisation process. The efficiency of the inverter is assumed to be roughly constant over the working range (e.g. 90%, based on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]), and the battery efficiency is taken to be 85%.

Hence, the average daily solar radiation is estimated 3 kWh/m<sup>2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In addition, Germany represents a four-season country climate, which is useful for comparison purposes to validate the feasibility of the proposed off-grid solar energy approach in two different climates, i.e. tropical (Malaysia) and four season (German). The comparison is based on three key aspects: technical criteria, energy yield analysis and economic analysis. By taking into account the main differences in the average daily solar radiation, annual real interest rate of 1% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], SPV cost of $2/watt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and diesel price $1.65/L in Germany [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and $0.70/L in Malaysia.</p><p id="Par70">Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref> includes a summary of the technical and economic criteria for the optimal design of the hybrid SPV/DG system for both Malaysia and Germany. The lower solar radiation rates lead to larger solar system size. For Germany, the average daily solar radiation is 3 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>, which is equivalent to 58.8% of the average daily solar radiation in Malaysia. The designed system specification using the HOMER software consists of a 3.5 kW SPV array, a 1 kW DG, a 2.16 kAh/6 V storage battery (360 Ah × 6 units) and a 1.5 kW inverter for the same LTE-BS load. Although the solar system size for Germany is larger than the solar system size for Malaysia (as shown in Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>), the initial capital cost in Germany is less than the initial capital cost in Malaysia because the price of solar system components is cheaper in Germany. However, the NPCGermany is higher than NPCMalaysia, which is approximately doubled.

The initial capital cost is directly proportional to the size of the system. However, the initial capital cost of the project in Germany is lower than in Malaysia because the price of the solar system components in Germany is lower than in Malaysia. The total maintenance and operation costs for Germany are higher than for Malaysia because the size of the solar system larger than the Malaysian solar system leads to high operating and maintenance costs. Replacement costs depend significantly on the discount factor which is given in Equation <xref rid="Equ9" ref-type="disp-formula">9</xref>. If the real interest rate increases, the discount factor will decrease, and the replacement cost will also decrease. The real interest rate for Malaysia is 3.25% and for Germany is 1% for quarter 3 of 2014, so the discount rate for Malaysia is higher than for Germany which is reflected in the total replacement costs. The fuel cost represents the bulk of the NPC, which amounted to 48% of the total project cost for Malaysia and 70% for Germany. Hence, NPCGermany is double the value of NPCMalaysia. NPC estimation in HOMER also considers the salvage cost (based on Equation <xref rid="Equ10" ref-type="disp-formula">10</xref>), which is the residual value of the power system components at the end of the project lifetime.<fig id="Fig15"><label>Figure 15</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>NPC comparison between Malaysia and Germany.</bold></p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13638_2015_284_Fig15_HTML.gif" id="MO15"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par73">This study examined the feasibility of the integration of a solar power system with a DG to supply power to remote BSs in off-grid sites of Malaysia to minimise both the OPEX and carbon emissions. Three key aspects have been investigated: (i) energy yield analysis, (ii) economic analysis and (iii) greenhouse gas emissions. When the solar radiation rates increase, the energy produced from the solar power system will increase, which has the positive effect of reducing the emission of polluting gases and the operating cost of the system. In summary, the bulk of the initial cost of the system is the cost of the SPV due to its inherent high cost. Meanwhile, the bulk of the annual operating and maintenance costs go to the DG, and the bulk of the replacement cost goes to the DG and batteries. However, the average annual OPEX savings of the hybrid system was 43% to 47% depending on the solar radiation rate. Comparison between Malaysia and Germany shows that Malaysia’s climatic conditions are desirable for wide utilisation of the proposed off-grid hybrid system due to the high amount of solar radiation received throughout the year, in addition to lower project cost in the long run.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia for the financial support of this work, under the Grant Ref: ETP-2013-072.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">International Telecommunication Union (ITU) statistics database; available: <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Pages/stat/default.aspx" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Pages/stat/default.aspx</ext-link>, accessed 26.Aug.2014.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kanzumba</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Herman</surname><given-names>JV</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Hybrid renewable power systems for mobile telephony base stations in developing countries</article-title><source>Renew Energ.</source><year>2013</year><volume>51</volume><issue>2013</issue><fpage>419</fpage><lpage>425</lpage></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>3.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Tao</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Horneman</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Network energy saving technologies for green wireless access networks</article-title><source>IEEE Commun.
