In the past decades, various systems have been developed but most of them suffer from low activities, a narrow range of absorption and poor quantum efficiencies (Q.E.) due to fast recombination of charge carriers. Here we report a dramatic suppression of electron-hole pair recombination on the surface of N-doped TiO<sub>2</sub> based nanocatalysts under enhanced concentrations of H<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>−</sup>, and local electric field polarization of a MgO (111) support during photolysis of water at elevated temperatures. Thus, a broad optical absorption is seen, producing O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> in a 1:2 molar ratio with a H<sub>2</sub> evolution rate of over 11,000 μmol g<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> without any sacrificial reagents at 270 °C. An exceptional range of Q.E. from 81.8% at 437 nm to 3.2% at 1000 nm is also reported.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Chemical fuels, produced from light, afford an alternative to fossil fuel, but conversion materials suffer from low photon-to-fuel efficiencies.

Therefore, solar-light-driven water splitting has attracted increasing attention, being considered as a promising approach to convert solar energy into chemical energy in the form of hydrogen fuel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. TiO<sub>2</sub>-based materials have been widely studied as highly efficient photocatalysts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> since the first photoelectrochemical (PEC) water-splitting system was demonstrated in 1972<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, due to its earth abundance, chemical and thermal stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, the wide bandgap of 3.2 eV limits TiO<sub>2</sub> for use in solar-light-driven photocatalysis: the solar spectrum lies mainly in the visible to infra-red range with a ultraviolet (UV) component of only 4%. Consequently, much effort has been expended in band structure engineering to narrow the bandgap down to the visible-light region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. A breakthrough relying on anion-doped TiO<sub>2</sub> was reported by Asahi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> in 2001 and one decade later, Chen et al. published work on deeply hydrogenated black TiO<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, both of which exhibited an impressive visible-light absorption and enhanced photocatalytic activity. Therefore, a coloured TiO<sub>2</sub> was considered as a panacea for the photocatalytic water-splitting reaction. Defects such as oxygen vacancies and doped nitrogen are believed to provide intermediate band levels or extra states that can trap electrons, and contribute to enhanced visible-light absorption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Since then, visible-light-driven oxygen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and hydrogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> evolution from water has been extensively studied for each gas separately, with the help of various sacrificial reagents. For example, Han and Hu have recently reported an enhanced hydrogen production using the input of methanol as a hole scavenger at elevated temperatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Although the methanol thermal decomposition contributes to the overall hydrogen production, the additional capital cost for the methanol input and the unwanted organic by-products would largely hinder the practical application of this work. In fact, there have been few reports of a high rate of water splitting for the simultaneous oxygen and hydrogen evolution over TiO<sub>2</sub>-based materials without additive(s). Also, extraordinary visible-light absorption does not necessarily result in high QE or photocatalytic activity: for example, the QE decreased sharply from 90 to &lt;3% once ultraviolet irradiation was switched to visible light<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> but the reason behind this sudden drop was rarely discussed. In a water-splitting reaction over oxide systems, photoreduction of protons for hydrogen evolution is generally believed to be the kinetic facile process, but oxygen evolution from OH<sup>−</sup> is a slow fundamental step<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, which means the photogenerated electron–hole (exciton) pair must have a sufficient lifetime to react with both the dissociative H<sup>+</sup>/OH<sup>−</sup> species from the water molecule to allow the photocatalysis to happen. Different approaches such as shape and facet engineering, heterojunction formation, co-catalyst deposition and internal electric fields to enable charge carrier separation have been explored to suppress the electron–hole recombination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Despite the progress that has been made, the activity and QE in the current photocatalytic systems is still far behind that required for practical applications. As a result, new strategies are urgently needed to improve the water-splitting efficiency.</p><p id="Par5">Here, we report a direct photocatalytic water-splitting reaction which can use solar energy efficiently at elevated temperatures, showing greatly enhanced H<sub>2</sub> evolution rates and QEs in a broad spectral range over the Au/N-doped TiO<sub>2</sub>/MgO (111) nanocatalyst due to the prolonged exciton lifetime in this system. We believe that the above work is a major milestone in the quest to harness solar energy via H<sub>2</sub> for future energy-storage applications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Preparation and characterisations of the photocatalyst</title><p id="Par6">The TiO<sub>2</sub> (P25) powder was treated by temperature ramping in a NH<sub>3</sub> flow to a specific temperature <italic>T</italic> to obtain N-doped TiO<sub>2</sub> with different nitrogen-doping concentrations denoted as N-P25-T. Then this was characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), low-energy ion scattering (LEIS), UV–visible absorption spectroscopy (UV–vis), Raman spectroscopy and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) techniques to gauge structural, surface and spectroscopic changes due to the N inclusions (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>). N 1s XPS spectra showed two characteristic peaks, located at 396.4 and 400.7 eV, which can be assigned to N substituted at oxygen sites (substitutional N) and interstitial N atoms, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. It is noteworthy that only interstitial N is detected at low N doping (N-P25-550), while for higher N concentrations, both substitutional and interstitial N are present, and the latter levels off at a further higher N concentration according to Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>. LEIS was also used to determine the distribution of nitrogen in the top few layers of the N-P25-620 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). Although the two forms of N were undifferentiated by the LEIS, the N peak gradually decreased after sputtering several times with highly energetic Ar<sup>+</sup> and finally disappeared, whereas both the Ti and O peaks grew, indicating that nitrogen must have penetrated from the top surface into a subsurface region.</p><p id="Par7">As seen from Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>, an additional broadened absorption edge of N-P25-550 (P25 TiO<sub>2</sub> after ammonia treatment) corresponding to 500 nm (visible) is observed compared with 395 nm (UV) for pristine P25, and higher ammonia treatment temperatures lead to a more significant increase and broadening of the additional absorption edge in both visible-light and infra-red absorption regions. Raman spectra of N-doped TiO<sub>2</sub> also exhibit different degrees of peak weakening and broadening (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>), implying the disruption of the TiO<sub>2</sub> lattice by interstitial N and oxygen vacancies due to N substitution in the subsurface (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>). The above observations are consistent with the fact that doping the electronegative N species into anatase TiO<sub>2</sub> can create Ti<sup>3+</sup> and oxygen vacancies at different energy levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. The photoexcitation of these colour centres and doped nitrogen providing extra intraband levels to the conduction band is thought to account for our observed broad region of strong light absorption extending from the visible to the infra-red.</p><p id="Par8">Where photocatalytic splitting of water is concerned, the excited electron–hole pairs that can reach to the surface of the photocatalyst for their reactions with water molecules to form hydrogen and oxygen are more important than those pairs remaining in the bulk. Despite the creation of excited oxygen vacancies (holes) and electrons, their stability on this particle surface is still uncertain. On the other hand, the oxygen vacancies can trap unpaired electrons from the semiconductive oxide, which is detectable by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Thus, EPR measurements were carried out after N-P25-550 was freshly prepared and exposed to air for different time ranges (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Interestingly, after the sample was exposed to air at ambient conditions for 1.5 h, 40% of the EPR signal that is indicative of the presence of surface oxygen vacancies gradually disappeared and after 24 h, only 23% of the original signal remained (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). This is attributed to the fact that oxygen sources in air (i.e., O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O), when in contact with the particle surface, may gradually replenish the surface oxygen vacancies and redistribute the electrons, approaching that of pristine TiO<sub>2</sub>. This could explain the fact that N-doped TiO<sub>2</sub> or hydrogenated TiO<sub>2</sub> do not necessarily show good photocatalytic water-splitting activity under visible-light illumination in air even though the remaining oxygen defects in bulk can exert a strong visible-light absorption.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>EPR patterns of the N-doped TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalysts. <bold>a</bold> N-doped TiO<sub>2</sub> N-P25-550 (freshly prepared) at different times. After being treated in NH<sub>3</sub> at 550 °C for 8 h, the EPR of the freshly made sample was measured immediately.

Thus, the surface oxygen vacancies formed in N-doped TiO<sub>2</sub> are vulnerable to oxygen sources at room temperature, but at elevated temperatures, the faster subsequent reactions can regenerate them to sustain the surface photocatalytic processes. Density functional theory calculations have also demonstrated that nitrogen doping leads to a large reduction in the formation energy of oxygen vacancies, indicating that oxygen vacancies are more easily generated after nitrogen doping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, in accordance with our EPR results.

It is interesting to note that the photocatalytic activity of N-doped TiO<sub>2</sub> in water is highly dependent on applied temperatures. However, the activity does not rise linearly with increasing the kinetic and entropic contributions upon using higher temperatures where more surface oxygen vacancies are also formed. Apparently, the activity reaches a maximum value for H<sub>2</sub> production when the temperature rises to near 270 °C but declines rapidly on further increasing the temperature. It has been reported that the ionic dissociation of H<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>−</sup> from water is also temperature dependent, which can be promoted by four orders of magnitude compared with that at room temperature (about 1 × 10<sup>−14</sup>), peaks at around 260–270 °C and then rapidly declines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Thus, our observed volcanic response of photocatalytic activity versus temperature appears to match with the reported temperature-dependent ionisation constant of water. We discounted the effect of the associated saturated water pressure in the batch reactor as no promoting effect was observed in an equivalent N<sub>2</sub> pressure without heating.

Almost all the reported photocatalytic water-splitting TiO<sub>2</sub>-based systems suffer from an extremely low QE in the visible-light region (rarely exceeding 3% at 420 nm), which largely hinders any potential practical applications. For our photocatalytic system, the QE was evaluated at 270 °C at wavelengths of visible light and in the near-infra-red (NIR) region by using band-pass filters (the UV–vis spectra of filters are shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>). As illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, the QE becomes larger with decreasing the wavelength and an impressive QE of 76.7% is obtained at 437 nm. Such high QE values in the visible-light region have only been reported by chalcogenide systems with anticipated photocorrosion issues and with the addition of a sacrificial reagent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Here, we demonstrate that this robust N-doped TiO<sub>2</sub> system can give an equally high QE at elevated temperatures. Excitingly, this photocatalytic system can operate even at 1000 nm (1.24 eV), almost the minimum threshold energy required for water splitting with a QE of 2.7%. To the best of our knowledge, this system is the first example that the overall water-splitting reaction can be accomplished under NIR irradiation with a considerable QE, whilst an exceptional photoactivity and QE in the visible region at 270 °C greatly exceeds the values reported for TiO<sub>2</sub> systems (Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>).</p><p id="Par14">Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was used to investigate the recombination of photoexcited electron–hole pairs. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, both the introduction of oxygen vacancies via N doping and the subsequent Au deposition are able to prolong the exciton lifetime, leading to an increase to 2.56 ns from the 1.12 ns of pristine P25. It is widely agreed that the separation of photoexcited charge carriers plays an important role in the photocatalysis; therefore, TRPL can also be a powerful technique to understand the effect of using an elevated temperature. As a result, the TRPL experiments were first conducted in air without water at different elevated temperatures to see if the increase in temperature could make any difference to the exciton lifetimes. It is interesting to find that the measurements showed no apparent change with solely the temperature increase (as shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>). Bear in mind that the photocatalytic water-splitting activity is dramatically increased at an elevated temperature and peaked at 270 °C, which coincides with the maximal water dissociation constant. It is therefore obvious that the significant temperature effect observed in the presence of water is due to the increased concentration of both H<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>−</sup> from the water dissociation. This can largely contribute to the enhanced photocatalytic performance at elevated temperatures. The TRPL measurements were subsequently carried out in different H<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>−</sup> concentrations by soaking the N-P25-620 sample in acidic or alkaline solutions with various pH at ambient temperature to mimic the high-temperature conditions and to correlate to exciton lifetimes. As expected, the exciton lifetimes increased dramatically; as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b, c</xref>, the fastest recombination rate was obtained at pH = 7 where there were the lowest concentrations of H<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>−</sup>, and the exciton lifetimes apparently increased with a higher concentration of H<sup>+</sup> or OH<sup>−</sup>, and H<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>−</sup> showed a similar effect on the charge separation and the exciton lifetimes were prolonged to the same degree (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). Clearly, the adsorption of H<sup>+</sup> or/and OH<sup>−</sup> near the surface of the semiconductor could create a local electric field (LEF) which can attract the counter- charged electron or hole species, hence suppressing their recombination rate and enhancing the overall photocatalytic activity. As stated, the dissociation of H<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>−</sup> from water becomes more favourable at higher temperatures and peaked at around 270 °C. Consequently, at elevated temperatures, the exciton lifetime is prolonged compared to that at room temperature due to the simultaneously enhanced H<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>−</sup> concentrations, which allows chemical reactions to take place. It is noted that the correlation of pH with photocatalytic activity at a fixed temperature could have a more complex relationship since the increase in the H<sup>+</sup> concentration in using a lower pH will simultaneously decrease the concentration of OH<sup>−</sup> due to the water dissociation constant and will affect the overall kinetics. Thus, the addition of acid or alkali to the catalytic system may prolong the exciton lifetime, but it concomitantly decreases the concentration of counterions (OH<sup>−</sup> or H<sup>+</sup>) due to the ionisation equilibrium at room temperature, which is unfavourable for the overall kinetics of photocatalysis, whereas the use of high temperatures can increase both H<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>−</sup> at the same time by the promoted water ionisation, which is a promising and efficient way to promote the photocatalytic water-splitting performances.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements of N-doped TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalysts under different conditions. <bold>a</bold> N-doped P25 treated by ammonia at different temperatures and promoted by Au. <bold>b</bold> N-P25-620 after being soaked in acidic solutions with different pH. <bold>c</bold> N-P25-620 after being soaked in alkaline solutions with different pH. <bold>d</bold> Au/N-P25-620/MgO(111), Au/N-P25-620/MgO(110) and Au/N-P25-620/MgO(100) with Au/N-P25-620 included as a reference (exciton lifetimes and errors are shown in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). <bold>e</bold> Schematic illustration of the local electric field of polar MgO(111) nanocrystals with negative and positive ion-terminated surfaces can assist the photocatalytic water splitting to H<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> via H<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>−</sup> surrounding the N-doped TiO<sub>2</sub> catalyst particle</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2019_12385_Fig3_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par15">To prolong the exciton lifetimes with stronger LEFs, polar MgO (111) as a support was blended with Au/N-P25-620 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>).

Indeed, Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref> shows that MgO (111) prolongs the exciton lifetime from 2.56 to 5.76 ns, whereas the non-polar MgO (100) or (110) shows no apparent influence. Accordingly, the photocatalytic activity at 270 °C over N-P25-620/MgO (111) gives a much enhanced and stable hydrogen evolution rate of 11,092 μmol g<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> with O<sub>2</sub> to H<sub>2</sub> at a 1:2 ratio (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>), while non-polar Au/N-P25-620/MgO (100) or (110) shows no rate promotion compared to that without the MgO support. The QEs can be further promoted to 81.8% at 437 nm and 3.2% at 1000 nm with the inclusion of MgO (111) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> and Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>).

After blending with the Au/N-P25-620, the mixtures showed a similar pattern as the Au/N-P25-620 alone. In other words, the enhancement of the photocatalytic performance could not be due to the change of oxygen vacancy concentrations, considering the different behaviours between polar MgO (111) and its non-polar counterparts. We believe that the use of polar- faceted MgO (111) can introduce an LEF, which prolongs the exciton lifetimes and therefore enhances the photocatalytic water- splitting activities. A ten-cycle stability test was carried out for the Au/N-P25-620, which showed stable photocatalytic activities (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>). The used catalyst was also characterised with XRD and EPR after the ten-cycle reaction (as shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14</xref>), which again suggested the good stability of the Au/N-P25-620/MgO (111) photocatalyst.</p><p id="Par16">For further exploration of the LEF effect and to rule out the artefacts introduced by different sizes and morphologies of the MgO supports, which might lead to different interfaces and catalytic behaviours, we studied different sizes of N–TiO<sub>2</sub>, and mixed each of them with the same MgO (111) support.

Visible-light-driven water-splitting performance was then evaluated over these photocatalysts, and indeed as we expected, smaller particle sizes led to a more obvious enhancement of the activities caused by LEF. The LEF effect was quantified by the enhancement factor that was determined as the ratio of the hydrogen evolution rates between N–TiO<sub>2</sub>/MgO (111) and N–TiO<sub>2</sub>. Clearly, the enhancement factors increased as the particle sizes decreased; as shown in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>, the hydrogen evolution rate of sol–gel-prepared N–TiO<sub>2</sub> (9.7 ± 0.3 nm) increased by a factor of 2.07 after it was mixed with MgO (111), while that of the N-P25-620 (35.3 ± 4.7 nm) increased by only 1.64 times when mixed with the same polar oxide support.</p><p id="Par17">We have further studied the LEF effect of a polar-faceted support material by using other polar oxides such as CeO<sub>2</sub> (100) nanocubes (NCs) and ZnO (0001) nanoplates (NPs).

Their photocatalytic water-splitting activities apparently varied with different supports: all the polar-faceted materials showed a dramatic enhancement on the photocatalytic activities, whereas the non-polar oxides hardly showed any influence. In addition, it is also noteworthy that the photocatalytic activities well correlated with the polarity of the polar-faceted oxides in almost a linear manner (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">17</xref>).

The XPS results show that nitrogen species have been incorporated into the TiO<sub>2</sub> lattice as both substitutional and interstitial N, respectively. The facilitated formation of surface oxygen vacancies in the presence of these N inclusions is also confirmed by EPR. It is evident that the photocatalytic splitting of water by visible light depends critically on the N and the surface oxygen vacancy content of N-doped TiO<sub>2</sub>. We have also found that these surface defects as catalytically active centres are replenished rapidly by contact with oxygen sources at room temperature, leading to poor photoactivity despite the existence of bulk defects that can take up visible light. However, oxygen vacancies can be regenerated when heated to elevated temperatures. The TRPL measurements show that the both introduction of oxygen vacancies and deposition of a metal co-catalyst are essential in prolonging the exciton lifetime to enable superior water-splitting activity under visible-light illumination. More importantly, the exciton lifetime can also be prolonged via LEFs formed by high concentrations of adsorbed H<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>−</sup> resulting from enhanced water ionisation at elevated temperatures, especially on a catalyst surface with MgO (111) inclusion. Under these conditions, both H<sub>2</sub> evolution and regeneration of the electron-depleted oxygen vacancies (hole) to produce O<sub>2</sub> are greatly facilitated.

Samples were scanned at 2<italic>θ</italic> angles of 5–90<sup>o</sup>. XPS measurements were performed on a PHI Quantum-2000 photoelectron spectrometer (Al Kα with 1486.6 eV operating at 15 kV, 35 W and 200-µm spot size) and an Omicron Sphera II hemispherical electron energy analyser. Raman spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer Raman Station 400F spectroscopy system with a laser excitation of 532 nm. Samples were exposed for 10 s for each scan and eight scans were adopted for each measurement. UV–vis DRS was obtained from a Perkin Elmer Lambda 750 S UV–vis spectrometer at room temperature. In all, 50 ± 5 mg of each sample was loaded and pressed onto a sample holder, and UV–vis spectra were recorded within the wavelength range of 200–1200 nm. Continuous-wave EPR spectra were obtained by using an X-band (9.4 GHz) Bruker EMX EPR spectrometer. All measurements were carried out at 293 K. All X-Band spectra were collected over a 300 Gauss field range and 15 scans were adopted for each measurement. The signal intensity versus electron-spin numbers were calculated from the double integral of a defined peak range of the spectra. TRPL spectroscopy was obtained from a bespoke micro-photoluminescence set-up. HAADF-STEM analysis was performed in the JEOL-JEM2100 Aberration-Corrected Transmission Electron Microscope at the Diamond Light Source, UK. The solid-state magic-angle spinning NMR experiments were carried out by using a Bruker Avance III 400WB spectrometer at room temperature for both <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>31</sup>P nucleus. Particularly, the high-power decoupling was thus used for the quantitative <sup>31</sup>P analysis. The radio frequency for decoupling was 59 kHz.

The reactions were carried out in a close 25-mL stainless-steel autoclave system equipped with two quartz windows (10 mm in diameter and 18 mm in thickness). In a typical experiment, 5 mg of catalyst is added to 10 mL of Milli-Q H<sub>2</sub>O in a glass lining (20 mm i.d. ×24 mm o.d. ×52 mm height) under vigorous magnetic stirring (750 rpm); then the autoclave was pressurised with 2 bar of Ar gas as the inert gas after being well sealed. The mixture in the reactor would then be allowed to heat up to reach the designated temperature at its saturated equilibrium pressure of water.</p><p id="Par31">The use of water vapour at low pressure was also studied instead of the liquid water at its saturated pressure. The photocatalytic activity was determined by measuring the amounts of hydrogen and oxygen evolved. The reactions were carried out in the same windowed autoclave set-up, but the photocatalyst was first deposited onto a glass slide and put into the autoclave, facing towards the light-irradiation path through the silica window. A fixed amount of water was added into the autoclave at room temperature. This amount of water was calculated to generate the required pressure when totally vaporised at 270 °C. As a result, variable pressures of water vapour were established below the saturated pressure of water at 270 °C. After the addition of water, the reactor was allowed to reach the designated temperature with added Ar as a reference gas.</p><p id="Par32">Tungsten light (70W, Glamox Professional 2000) was then applied through the quartz windows to provide visible-light irradiation after the autoclave reached a certain temperature. The irradiation power in the centre of the autoclave was measured to be 45 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>. After a 2-h reaction, the autoclave was cooled down naturally to room temperature, and the amounts of hydrogen and oxygen were measured by gas chromatography (GC) equipped with thermoconductivity detectors (TCD) with He and N<sub>2</sub> as carrier gases, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>QE measurements and calculation</title><p id="Par33">The apparent QE was measured in the same autoclave and the conditions were kept the same as those for a typical photocatalytic test, while the autoclave was then irradiated by a 300-W Xenon lamp (Newport) by using band-pass filters of 385 ± 40, 437 ± 10, 575 ± 25, 650 ± 20, 750 ± 20 and 1000 ± 10 nm, respectively.
