Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are increasingly used in mosquito traps because they improve energy efficiency and battery longevity relative to incandescent bulbs. This study evaluated the efficacy of a new ultraviolet LED trap (Mosclean) against standard mosquito collection methods.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The study was conducted in controlled semi-field settings and in field conditions in rural south-eastern Tanzania. The Mosclean trap was compared to commonly used techniques, namely CDC-light traps, human landing catches (HLCs), BG-Sentinel traps and Suna traps.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">When simultaneously placed inside the same semi-field chamber, the Mosclean trap caught twice as many <italic>Anopheles arabiensis</italic> as the CDC-light trap, and equal numbers to HLCs. Similar results were obtained when traps were tested individually in the chambers. Under field settings, Mosclean traps caught equal numbers of <italic>An. arabiensis</italic> and twice as many <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes as CDC-light traps. It was also better at trapping malaria vectors compared to both Suna and BG-Sentinel traps, and was more efficient in collecting mosquitoes indoors than outdoors. The majority of <italic>An. arabiensis</italic> females caught by Mosclean traps were parous (63.6%) and inseminated (89.8%). In comparison, the females caught by CDC-light traps were 43.9% parous and 92.8% inseminated.</p></sec><sec id="ASec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">The UV LED trap (Mosclean trap) was efficacious for sampling <italic>Anopheles</italic> and <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes. Its efficacy was comparable to and in some instances better than traps commonly used for vector surveillance. The Mosclean trap was more productive in sampling mosquitoes indoors compared to outdoors. The trap can be used indoors near human-occupied nets, or outdoors, in which case additional CO<sub>2</sub> improves catches. We conclude that this trap may have potential for mosquito surveillance. However, we recommend additional field tests to validate these findings in multiple settings and to assess the potential of LEDs to attract non-target organisms, especially outdoors.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Malaria</kwd><kwd><italic>An. arabiensis</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>An.

id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par11">The World Health Organization, through its Global Technical Strategy for Malaria Elimination (GTS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and Global Vector Control Response initiative (GVCR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], has called for strengthening and integration of surveillance as a core component of strategies against mosquito-borne diseases. To operationalize this agenda, endemic countries need low-cost and scalable monitoring tools, as well as a simplified set of indicators for surveillance. For malaria and other vector-bone diseases, surveillance plays a major role in: (i) tracking transmission; (ii) assessing susceptibility of vectors to interventions; (iii) measuring receptivity in specific locations; and (iv) predicting disease outbreaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Various traps have been developed and used for mosquito sampling and surveillance, often for experimental studies but also for programmatic purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Some of the traps have also been considered as control intervention when used as mosquito trapping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A major setback for many of the existing techniques is poor scalability due to their physical structure and cost.</p><p id="Par12">The human landing catch (HLC) is the most direct and scalable method for measuring human biting rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and is regarded as the gold standard for collecting host-seeking mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, using humans directly as bait to collect mosquitoes has multiple limitations. For example, this technique: (i) is expensive in large-scale operations; (ii) exposes humans to mosquito bites and thus increases the risk of infections in field settings; (iii) is labor-intensive; and (iv) needs close supervision, high skills and motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. To address these shortcomings, new ways of safely carrying out HLCs have been proposed and tested, e.g. the human-baited double net (HDN) and mosquito electrocuting grid trap (MET) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Another common trap is the Center for Disease Prevention and Control light trap (CDC-light trap), improved by Sudia &amp; Chamberlain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and widely used for indoor collections of host-seeking <italic>Anopheles</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The CDC-light trap uses incandescent light bulbs, battery cells and a motor-driven fan, all of which make it expensive and difficult to maintain in many settings. Despite these challenges, the CDC-light trap is still considered one of the simplest trapping techniques, requiring only light as an attractant.</p><p id="Par13">Recent developments in trapping technologies and improved understanding of mosquito olfactory systems have resulted in several new trapping devices for malaria vectors. Some of these exploit the olfactory behaviors and biting preferences of mosquitoes, e.g. BG-Sentinel trap, Suna trap, Ifakara tent trap and BG-malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The BG-Sentinel trap and Suna trap are simple and portable tools which can be used to sample day-biting and night-biting mosquitoes including <italic>Anopheles</italic> and <italic>Aedes</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Others, such as the Ifakara tent trap, allow exposure-free sampling in rural and urban settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. One drawback of these traps is that they usually require synthetic lures, such as Ifakara lure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], Mbita lures (MB5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] or carbon dioxide gas (CO<sub>2</sub>) to mimic human odors. Others such as the Ifakara tent trap and human-baited double net traps, are large, bulky and inconveniently require human volunteers as bait.</p><p id="Par14">Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are also increasingly being tested for arthropod trapping. Compared to standard incandescent light bulbs used in CDC-light traps, the LED technology provides: (i) higher energy efficiency; (ii) longer battery life; (iii) lower costs per unit time of trapping; (iv) options for specific wavelengths targeting different arthropod species; and (v) greater trapping efficiencies.</p><p id="Par15">CDC-light traps have previously been modified by replacing the incandescent bulbs with LEDs emitting blue, green or red light to achieve higher trapping efficiencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. For example, Costa-Neta et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] showed that LED lamps emitting blue (470 nm) or green (520Â nm) light consistently caught high numbers of <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes, regardless of the lunar cycles. Silva et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] also showed the superiority of green-LEDs over incandescent light for catching different species of sand flies in Brazil. Elsewhere, in Egypt, red-LEDs attracted more <italic>Phlebotomus papatasi</italic> sand flies than either blue or green LEDs or incandescent bulbs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Lastly, tests on woodland mosquitoes in Florida revealed differential attractiveness of species to LEDs of different colors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">The Mosclean trap is a simple LED trap which utilizes ultraviolet (UV) emitting diodes combined with a titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) plate for photocatalytic conversion to produce CO<sub>2</sub>. The trap is created by Sensor Electronic Technology Inc. (Columbia, SC, USA) and Seoul Viosys (Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea), using proprietary UV LED technology (violedsâ¢). It has been previously demonstrated as highly efficacious for trapping <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> and <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], but to our knowledge has yet to be tested against <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes anywhere.</p><p id="Par17">The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of the Mosclean trap in catching malaria vectors and other mosquitoes in south-eastern Tanzania in comparison to the CDC-light trap, BG-Sentinel trap and Suna trap.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Description of the semi-field system and study areas for field experiments</title><p id="Par18">Experiments were conducted under both semi-field and field settings.

Four houses were selected randomly in each of the study villages and recruited after obtaining consent from the household heads. In each hut, either a Mosclean trap or CDC-light trap was set beside a bed inside a room where one adult volunteer slept under bednet. Since coverage of insecticide-treated nets wasâ&gt;â90% in these villages, we conducted our study with these rather than untreated nets as used in the semi-field tests. Based on the trap assignment schedule, huts 1, 2, 3 and 4 each received either of the two trap types. No additional lures were added to the traps. The traps (1st Mosclean trap, 2nd Mosclean trap, 1st CDC-light trap and 2nd CDC-light trap) were rotated each night between each of the houses over 12 nights, following a 4âÃâ4 Latin square design, replicated four times. The tests lasted from 18:00 to 06:00 h each night. Both Mosclean and CDC-light traps were suspended 150 cm above ground, towards the feet of the sleepers.

In studies measuring malaria vector biting risk, it is common to assess proportions of biting that occur indoors <italic>versus</italic> proportions that occur outdoors, so as to determine where the biting risk is greater and also whether interventions such as ITNs and IRS are addressing the full spectrum of exposure. Unfortunately, despite recent innovations such as the electric grid traps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and human-baited double net traps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], there are no appropriate trapping systems other than HLCs that consistently and accurately assess these proportions. The Mosclean trap was therefore assessed to determine if it would be suitable for collections both indoors and outdoors. Four households were selected randomly in each village and recruited following consent from the head of household. Mosclean traps were then set either indoors or outdoors at each of the houses. When used indoors, the trap was set beside an occupied bednet. However, when outdoors, the trap was placed approximately 5 m from the house, but next to an adult volunteer sitting under a bednet. The Mosclean trap outdoors was set 5 m from the house, aiming to catch mosquitoes flying close to the human dwellings. The traps were 150 cm above ground, whether indoors or outdoors. Each morning the mosquitoes caught indoors and outdoors were sorted by taxa, sex and physiological status, and the numbers recorded and compared.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par39"><italic>Tests to compare field efficacies of the Mosclean, BG-Sentinel</italic> and <italic>Suna traps outdoors</italic></p></list-item></list>
These experiments was conducted outdoors using a 4âÃâ4 Latin square design in which trap locations were randomly assigned at the start of each round of four sampling nights. Two variants of Mosclean trap were used, one supplemented with CO<sub>2</sub> gas from yeast-molasses fermentation and another without additional CO<sub>2</sub>. Four locations were identified in each of the two villages, approximately 100 m apart. The four trap types, standard Mosclean trap with no additional bait, CO<sub>2</sub>-baited Mosclean trap, CO<sub>2</sub>-baited Suna trap and CO<sub>2</sub>-baited BG-Sentinel trap, were rotated nightly between the four outdoor locations over four-night cycles. Each morning, mosquitoes caught by each trap were sorted by taxa, sex and physiological status, and the numbers recorded and compared.

This study evaluated a new LED trap that emits UV light as the primary mosquito attractant. The trap was compared to existing trapping methods including CDC-light traps with incandescent light bulbs, as is commonly used for trapping mosquitoes inside human dwellings. Other traps tested were the BG-Sentinel trap and Suna trap. The tests were conducted both indoors and outdoors, in both semi-field settings against laboratory-reared mosquitoes and field settings against wild mosquito populations. Although the main target was the malaria vector <italic>An. arabiensis</italic>, the field tests also revealed moderate to high efficiencies against other mosquito species. Overall, the Mosclean trap was at least as efficacious as HLC, and twice as efficacious as the CDC-light trap when used indoors for sampling the malaria vectors in the semi-field, although the difference not being statistically significant. Similarly, in the field settings, the trap caught slightly more <italic>An. arabiensis</italic> than CDC-light trap. For <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes, the Mosclean trap also caught twice as many as the CDC-light trap.</p><p id="Par54">Mosquito traps employ odor and visual stimuli to activate and attract mosquitoes from a distance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Insects typically visualize objects in the ultraviolet, blue and green wavelengths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The Mosclean trap was developed to exploit host-seeking behavior of mosquitoes in relation to both olfactory and visual stimuli. The trap utilizes titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) which, releases CO<sub>2</sub> by a photocatalyst reaction during the operation. It also emits optimized high efficiency UV LEDs (wavelength of 365 nm) to attract mosquitoes. An additional advantage is that the lamp can run for more than 10,000 hours and therefore requires less frequent replacements than the incandescent lamps used on the CDC-light trap which typically runs for 1200 hours or less [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">Previous trials in South Korea had also showed that LED traps caught significantly higher numbers of host-seeking mosquitoes compared to traditional light traps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. This may indicate the importance of natural human cues, and also host biomass, which directly influence biting densities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. In our outdoor-indoor tests, the traps were set near volunteer-occupied mosquito nets. However, there was likely a greater concentration of host cues indoors due to a higher number of people indoors compared to outdoors, resulting in a higher number of catches indoors. In tests where the Mosclean trap was placed either indoors or outdoors, <italic>An. funestus</italic> mosquitoes appeared highly endophilic, just as previously observed by Ngowo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The trap was more efficacious indoors than outdoors for catching this vector species, which now mediates more than 80% of transmission in the study area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Nearly seven times the number of <italic>An. funestus</italic> and nearly two times the number of <italic>An. arabiensis</italic> were caught indoors compared to outdoors.</p><p id="Par56">In this study, the Mosclean trap was also evaluated against HLCs in the semi-field, but not in the field due to ethical concerns. In the semi-field tests with laboratory-reared <italic>An. arabiensis</italic>, the trap was as effective as HLCs in both competitive and non-competitive settings (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The HLC method has multiple disadvantages which limit its application for field studies. It is labor-intensive and needs close supervision, is expensive and may expose human volunteers to potentially-infectious bites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. To address these issues, innovative methods have been developed as substitutes, but many of these alternatives do not completely address the challenges. For example, mosquitoes trapped by the mosquito electrocuting trap (MET) dry quickly, making it unsuitable for scientific investigations, such as dissection for parity and insemination status, which require fresh samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In Burkina Faso [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], a human decoy trap (HDT) was recently demonstrated to catch significantly higher numbers of <italic>Anopheles</italic> spp., <italic>Culex</italic> spp. and <italic>Mansonia</italic> spp. than HLC. However, HDTs are not easily scalable as they need human volunteers and a supply of boiled water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], making them expensive to conduct.</p><p id="Par57">The Mosclean trap was also efficient outdoors for trapping <italic>An. arabiensis</italic> mosquitoes, compared to other trapping devices previously used for the same purpose (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). It caught more malaria vectors and had higher trapping efficiencies, which were further enhanced when CO<sub>2</sub> was added. The Suna trap has been observed to perform well in catching <italic>An. gambiae</italic> in semi-field settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and <italic>An. funestus</italic> in field settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], and is therefore considered an effective field trapping technique. In this study, the field-trapping efficiencies of the Mosclean trap exceeded both the BG-Sentinel trap and Suna trap.</p><p id="Par58"><italic>Anopheles arabiensis</italic> mosquitoes caught by the traps were dissected to assess epidemiological importance. This examination revealed that more than half of host-seeking mosquitoes caught by Mosclean trap indoors were parous. The values are comparable to or slightly higher than those obtained in CDC light traps (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Furthermore, nearly 90% of the females caught indoors were inseminated. Together, these findings suggest that the physiological status, and approximate age of the collected mosquitoes is likely to be similar between the Mosclean trap and CDC light trap. Past studies have shown similar observations of high parity rates among indoor malaria vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].</p><p id="Par59">The version of Mosclean traps used was less expensive than other commercially available traps. For example, the Suna trap and BG-Sentinel trap are listed by the manufacturer at US$ 168.11 per unit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], while the CDC-light trap is listed at US$ 106.00 per unit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. By comparison, the Mosclean trap is available for US$ 67.05 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Because of their higher energy efficiency, Mosclean traps are also expected to use less battery power than the other traps.</p><p id="Par60">One limitation is that the UV-LED technology may trap other non-target organisms when used in field settings, especially outdoors, potentially making the trap less environmentally friendly. Another limitation is that we did not measure the quantities of CO<sub>2</sub> gas produced by the TiO<sub>2</sub> component of the Mosclean trap as claimed by the manufacturer. These issues need to be investigated before the trap can be considered as a replacement in regular surveillance programs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par61">The UV LED trap (Mosclean trap) demonstrated substantive efficacies for trapping of <italic>Anopheles</italic> and <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes, and was better indoors than outdoors. The trap was either comparable with or better than existing comparator traps, and could have potential for mosquito surveillance. It is easier to use, cost-friendly and less noisy during its operation. The trap can also be used indoors near human-occupied bednets (the human acting as non-exposed bait) or outdoors, in which case it is beneficial to add other baits such as CO<sub>2</sub> gas. Importantly, the Mosclean trap catches mosquito populations of high epidemiological importance, with high proportions of parous and insemination females. However, the potential of LED traps, including the Mosclean trap, to catch non-targeted organisms should be investigated further, especially when used outdoors. Furthermore, more studies should be undertaken to validate these findings in other areas and to assess the efficacy of the Mosclean trap against a greater diversity of mosquito species.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>A special thanks to volunteers Mr Steven Kipande, Mr Andrew Kafwenji and Mr Joseph Kipande for collection of mosquitoes in the semi-field experiments.
