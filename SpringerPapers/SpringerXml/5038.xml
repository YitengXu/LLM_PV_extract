The resulting cell consists of a CGO (Gd-doped CeO<sub>2</sub>) scaffold-based oxygen electrode that is infiltrated with LSC (La<sub>0.6</sub>Sr<sub>0.4</sub>CoO<sub>3-δ</sub>) and CGPO (Gd, Pr-co-doped CeO<sub>2</sub>) nanocomposite infiltrates and a Ni/YSZ fuel electrode modified with nano-CGO infiltrates. Constant-current tests at + 0.5 A/cm<sup>2</sup> and  − 0.5 A/cm<sup>2</sup> are carried out, followed by cycling between fuel-cell and electrolysis modes at ± 0.5 A/cm<sup>2</sup> and ± 1.25 A/cm<sup>2</sup>. Under the reversible operation at ± 0.5 A/cm<sup>2</sup>, the cell showed lower degradation rates than under the single mode operation, with cell voltage degradation of 1.23%/kh in fuel cell mode and 0.53%/kh in electrolysis mode. During the cycling operation at ± 1.25 A/cm<sup>2</sup>, the overall degradation rate under the electrolysis mode was only 0.46%/kh. Compared to the previously tested cells with only LSC infiltrated oxygen electrodes, the cell tested in this work shows better durability with degradation rates of less than half of the previous tests. The results in this work demonstrate that infiltrating nano-electrocatalysts into both electrodes is an effective solution to boost cell performance and durability under reversible operation.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">731224</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Innovationsfonden</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012774</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">0143-00009B</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Ming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>53</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Minerals, Metals &amp;

However, renewables like wind and solar power are intermittent, and sometimes they are not available when needed. Thus, to balance the use and demand requests, efficient and inexpensive energy conversion and storage systems are required to store the intermittent renewable energies and further convert them into other energy forms. Electrolysis technologies can convert renewable electricity into hydrogen from water or carbon monoxide from carbon dioxide. Furthermore, synthetic gases like methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), methanol (CH<sub>3</sub>OH), and other CO<sub>2</sub>-neutral fuels are likely to be produced through syngas (CO + H<sub>2</sub>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> A reversible solid oxide cell (rSOC) can be operated as either a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) or a solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) depending on its operating conditions. Under SOEC mode, electrical energy is converted into chemical energy and stored as H<sub>2</sub> or syngas through steam or co-electrolysis of steam and CO<sub>2</sub>. Syngas can be further converted into liquid hydrocarbon fuels through catalytic chemical processes such as Fischer–Tropsch synthesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> Under SOFC mode, the produced H<sub>2</sub> or syngas can be used as fuel to generate electricity and heat. By combining the SOFC and SOEC in one device, an rSOC can convert the surplus off-peak electricity from renewables into H<sub>2</sub> or syngas through electrolysis and use the produced gas to generate cheap electricity during the peak hours. Jensen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> described a novel storage method consisting of an rSOC combined with sub-surface CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> storage. The round-trip efficiency exceeded 70%, and the storage cost was only 0.03$/kWh according to their estimation.</p><p id="Par3">Good performance and long-term durability are required for the commercialization of rSOC technology. In the past decade, different electrode materials, microstructure of the electrodes, and operating conditions have been studied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> Lang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> reported the long-term durability performance of an SOC stack consisting of 30 electrolyte-supported cells (ESCs) supplied by Sunfire. The stack was operated for 3370 h in constant SOEC mode at 820°C followed by 2500 h in reversible SOFC/SOEC mode with the steam utilization of 70%. A higher degradation rate of 1.2%/kh under SOEC mode was found during the reversible operation, higher than that under constant SOEC operation (0.5%/kh) at −520 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>. Under SOFC mode during the reversible operation, the degradation was higher, i.e., 3.1%/kh at 750°C. Optimizing the operating conditions for reversible cycling was suggested to decrease the stack degradation. In the EU-funded project REFLEX (Analysis of the European energy system under the aspects of flexibility and technological progress), the effects of current density, steam content, and the utilization degree were studied for the load cycling operation on the Ni/YSZ-based cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> Differently, they found that at a high current density ( − 1.2 A/cm<sup>2</sup>), the degradation rates under the SOEC mode significantly decreased during the load cycling operation compared to the constant SOEC operation. From the post-mortem investigation, microstructural changes such as detachment of Ni particles, Ni migration, and silica-rich impurities were observed in the fuel electrode after the load-cycling operation.</p><p id="Par4">The EU-funded project BALANCE (Increasing penetration of renewable power, alternative fuels and grid flexibility by cross-vector electrochemical processes) aimed to accelerate the development of European rSOC technology by identifying and analyzing the national activities and coordinating research efforts into all aspects of rSOC. In the previous work, Sun et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> studied the effect of different cell types, operating temperatures, and applied current density on the rSOC performance. A comparable degradation rate of &lt; 7%/kh was achieved for SOEC cells with either LSC/CGO composite oxygen electrode operated at ± 0.5 A/cm<sup>2</sup> or LSC infiltrated oxygen electrode at ± 1.25 A/cm<sup>2</sup>. They also found that high degradation mainly originated from the Ni/YSZ electrode. On the other hand, Tong and Ovtar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> successfully improved the cell performance and durability by infiltrating electrocatalysts into the porous electrodes. Inspired by the previous studies, the present work focuses on the electrochemical performance of a nano-engineered rSOC, with both electrodes infiltrated with nano-electrocatalysts. The performance and durability of the cell during the galvanostatic SOFC/SOEC operations and the reversible operation at both ± 0.5 A/cm<sup>2</sup> and ± 1.25 A/cm<sup>2</sup> are studied.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Experimental</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cell Specifications and Infiltration Procedure</title><p id="Par5">The cell tested in this work was a Ni/YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) fuel electrode supported cell (size of 5.3 × 5.3 cm<sup>2</sup> with an active area of 16 cm<sup>2</sup>) produced at DTU.

Each reversible cycle consisted of 3 h under SOFC mode and 20 h under SOEC mode plus 1 h for the transition periods, with the same gas compositions and current densities as in the previous constant condition tests. In each reversible operation cycle, the operation started with changing the gas composition to 12.8 L/h H<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> (H<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> = 50/50) to the fuel electrode compartment and 59.1 L/h air to the oxygen electrode compartment and then ramping up the current density to 0.5 A/cm<sup>2</sup> with a step of 0.125 A/cm<sup>2</sup>. After operating for 3 h, the current density was ramped down to OCV, followed by changing the gas compositions and applying the current density to −0.5 A/cm<sup>2</sup> for the 20 h SOEC operation. This reversible operation was run for 840 h with 33 cycles. EIS characterization was performed at a certain time during this reversible operation. After that, the current density was brought up to ± 1.25 A/cm<sup>2</sup>.

Therefore, the electrochemical processes regarding the peaks in different frequency ranges are concluded as the following: P1 is associated with the oxygen ions transport through the ionic conducting network in the electrodes and electrolyte. The major contribution is most likely from the YSZ network in the fuel electrode since the cell has a thick Ni/YSZ support layer, and the CGO scaffold in the oxygen electrode is a highly ionic conducting material. P2 is associated with the electrochemical process that occurred in the triple-phase boundaries (TPBs) from the Ni/YSZ fuel electrode.

The cells tested in the previous work were in the same batch as the cell tested in this work, i.e., Ni/YSZ support layer, Ni/YSZ active electrode, YSZ electrolyte, CGO barrier layer, and porous CGO scaffold. Differently, the CGO scaffold was infiltrated with only LSC electrocatalyst, and no modification to Ni/YSZ was done in Sun et al.’s work. Data on the degradation rates based on cell voltage were extracted from Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref> and are presented in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">II</xref>. Under the constant operation mode, the cell in this work shows better performance under SOEC operation (2.14%/kh) than the cell infiltrated only with LSC (3.7%/kh). However, under galvanostatic SOFC operation, a lower degradation rate was found in the previously tested cell with a value of -1%/kh. During the reversible operation, lower degradation rates are seen for the cell tested in this work. Under the SOFC mode, the degradation rates in this work decreased by a factor of two compared to the previous tests at both ± 0.5 A/cm<sup>2</sup> and ± 1.25 A/cm<sup>2</sup>. Under the SOEC mode, the degradation rate is found to be 0.53%/kh compared to that of 4% in the previous test at ± 0.5 A/cm<sup>2</sup>. At ± 1.25 A/cm<sup>2</sup>, the cell voltage seems to be stable until the last 180 h (8 cycles), when it started to increase significantly with a degradation rate of 3.61%/kh. During the entire operating period at ± 1.25 A/cm<sup>2</sup>, the degradation rate is found to be 0.46%/kh, significantly improved compared to that of 6.3%/kh in the previous test.

In Tong et al.’s work,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> the role of infiltrated CGO in mitigating the degradation of the Ni/YSZ fuel electrode has been discussed. CGO nanoparticles which have mixed electronic and ionic conductivity play the role of facilitating the dissociation of H<sub>2</sub>O as well as providing additional active sites for hydrogen evolution reaction on the Ni/YSZ. This extends the TPBs sites from Ni-YSZ-gas to Ni-CGO-gas as well as the two-phase boundary (2 PB) of CGO-gas (i.e., the surface of the CGO particles that are located on Ni grains). In this work, we also speculate that the CGO nanoparticles provide extra active sites on the Ni/YSZ electrode, thus improving cell durability for both constant and reversible operations. Further SEM analysis will be performed in our future work to validate the above speculations.</p><p id="Par19">Hauch et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> also found that load cycling operation leads to a decreased degradation rate. In their study, the cell was produced by Elcogen with an LSC oxygen electrode, CGO barrier layer, YSZ electrolyte, and Ni/YSZ fuel electrode. It was noticed that the degradation rates were significantly reduced at high current density load cycling operation (0.6 A/cm<sup>2</sup>, −1.2 A/cm<sup>2</sup>), especially under SOEC mode. The degradation rates under the SOEC mode were found to be &lt; 3%/kh compared to that of 66–68%/kh under the 250 h constant SOEC operation. In another study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> reverse current treatment (RCT) was operated to reactivate the degraded Ni/YSZ fuel electrode. After the degradation under the CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis with impurities or harsh steam electrolysis, the cells were treated with RCT, with cycles of 10 min in FC mode and 10–50 s in EC mode at various current densities (± 0.5—± 3 A/cm<sup>2</sup>). The cells were degraded before the RCT treatment with increased resistance. However, R(Ni/YSZ TPB) decreased significantly after the RCT, indicating an increased TPB length in the fuel electrode active area. From their post-mortem SEM images, it was observable that additional Ni nanoparticles were formed in the weakened interface or detachment between the Ni particles and YSZ backbone, thereby adding the electrochemical active sites in the active fuel electrode structures via subsequent RCT. Graves et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> also observed that the reversible operation of the Ni/YSZ supported SOC had negligible degradation compared to SOEC operation. They employed LSM/YSZ as the oxygen electrode. From the SEM images, they found that the main degradation of their SOEC cell operated at −1 A/cm<sup>2</sup> was the microstructure deterioration that occurred near the oxygen electrode/electrolyte interface, while the reversible cycling operation might slow down the O<sub>2</sub> bubble formation near the interface where high internal O<sub>2</sub> pressure builds up during high current density electrolysis operation. The oxygen bubble formation can be resolved by employing the LSCF/CGO oxygen electrode, which has much faster oxygen evolution reaction (ORR) kinetics than LSM/YSZ. The degradation of Ni/YSZ then becomes the bottleneck for long-term operation of SOEC cells with LSCF/CGO oxygen electrode, though with a degradation rate smaller than that with LSM/YSZ. Trini et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> used focused ion beam (FIB)-SEM characterization and 3D reconstruction to study the degradation mechanism of the cell under SOEC and SOFC modes. They found that the cell under SOEC operation had much higher degradation compared to that under SOFC operation with the same durability testing conditions, where 24 L/h H<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O (H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O = 50/50) was supplied to the fuel electrode and 50 L/h O<sub>2</sub> to the LSCF/CGO oxygen electrode at 800°C and ± 1 A/cm<sup>2</sup>. They observed from the 3D reconstruction that Ni depletion or Ni migrating away from the electrode/electrolyte interface is the main cause for SOEC degradation. Such Ni depletion or redistribution was not observed in the SOFC operation. Chen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> reported post-mortem analysis of the cells (Ni/YSZ-YSZ-LSM/YSZ) tested under steam and co-electrolysis conditions at 800–850°C and various current densities (0.5–1.5 A/cm<sup>2</sup>). In the SEM images, the formation of ZrO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles on Ni grains in the active fuel electrode region close to the fuel electrode/electrolyte interface was observed in the cells tested at high current density (≥ -1 A/cm<sup>2</sup>). This introduces the detachment of the Ni–Ni and Ni-YSZ and deteriorates the Ni percolation in the active electrode, eventually resulting in the Ni/YSZ fuel electrode degradation. In our study, based on the electrochemical analysis, we speculate that the reversible operation, e.g., switching from the SOEC to SOFC mode in one cycle, slows down the degradation processes in Ni/YSZ happening in constant SOEC operation. At low current density (± 0.5 A/cm<sup>2</sup>), the reversible operation retarded the Ni migration under electrolysis mode, while at high current density (± 1.25 A/cm<sup>2</sup>), both Ni migration and formation of ZrO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles during electrolysis operation seem to be inhibited or retarded. The contribution of the LSC/CGO oxygen electrode to the overall cell resistance and degradation is rather small; thus, the effect of reversible operation on the oxygen electrode degradation is difficult to clarify in the current work. The remaining degradation in reversible operation could be caused by the processes like Ni coarsening, which is not affected by the mode of operation. Further analysis will be conducted and will be reported in the future work.</p><p id="Par20">To quantitatively deconvolute different contributions from different electrochemical processes, the complex-non-linear-squares (CNLS) fitting method was used to fit the equivalent circuit model to the EIS data.

The EIS spectra before and after the SOEC constant operation and ± 0.5 A/cm<sup>2</sup> reversible operation were measured under the same operation conditions, with 8 L/h H<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O (H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O = 20/80) supplied to the fuel electrode and 11 L/h air supplied to the oxygen electrode. The EIS spectra measured before and after ± 1.25 A/cm<sup>2</sup> reversible operation were with different gas compositions: 20 L/h H<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O (H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O = 20/80) to the fuel electrode and 24 L/h air to the oxygen electrode. Therefore, the values before/after constant SOEC and ± 0.5 A/cm<sup>2</sup> reversible operation cannot be compared directly with the ones before/after ± 1.25 A/cm<sup>2</sup> reversible operation. From the simulated values, it can be noticed that the area specific resistance (ASR) increased slightly after each operating period. Among the different contributions to ASR, only <italic>R</italic><sub>s</sub> decreased. For example, ASR increased from 0.573 Ω cm<sup>2</sup> before the constant SOEC operation to 0.609 Ω cm<sup>2</sup> after the ± 0.5 A/cm<sup>2</sup> operation while the value of <italic>R</italic><sub>s</sub> decreased from 0.227 to 0.205 Ω cm<sup>2</sup>. During the ± 1.25 A/cm<sup>2</sup> operation, ASR increased from 0.45 to 0.478 Ω cm<sup>2</sup> with a decrease of <italic>R</italic><sub>s</sub> from 0.218 to 0.203 Ω cm<sup>2</sup>. The decrease of <italic>R</italic><sub>s</sub> might be due to the improved contacting during the testing. In comparison, R(ion) originated from the oxygen ionic transport network increased from 0.021 to 0.059 Ω cm<sup>2</sup>. From the previous research,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> it was concluded that R(ion) is mainly from the Ni/YSZ electrode, which has a much thicker and poorer ionic conducting network than that of the oxygen electrode. Resistance corresponding to the Ni/YSZ TPB process also increased from 0.077 to 0.088 Ω cm<sup>2</sup> after constant SOEC and ± 0.5 A/cm<sup>2</sup> reversible operation, from 0.075 to 0.082 Ω cm<sup>2</sup> after ± 1.25 A/cm<sup>2</sup> reversible operation. In comparison, the resistance from the oxygen electrode barely changed during the entire testing, suggesting that CGPO and LSC infiltrated oxygen electrode has stable performance during the galvanostatic and reversible operation. It is also observable that the gas conversion and gas diffusion resistances were both decreased by half after increasing the gas flow from 8 L/h H<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O to 20 L/h H<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O. This proves that the gas conversion and gas diffusion resistances are related to the gas flow supplied to the porous-structured electrode.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> When a higher gas flow is supplied to the porous structure, the volume of the stagnant layer over the electrode is decreased, thereby gas diffusion resistance is reduced.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Summary of the simulated values of Rs and resistances originated from different electrochemical processes under OCV at 700°C.

The cell showed good initial performance and excellent durability during both types of operation. The degradation rates under both SOFC and SOEC modes during the reversible operation were found to be lower than those during constant current operation at ± 0.5 A/cm<sup>2</sup>, suggesting that reversible operation can decrease its degradation compared to the galvanostatic operation. Especially under SOEC mode, the degradation under the reversible operation was 0.53%/kh, four times smaller than that under the galvanostatic operation at −0.5 A/cm<sup>2</sup> (2.14%/kh). The simulated results from the CNLS analysis demonstrate that the resistance mainly from the Ni/YSZ electrode increased during the constant SOEC and ± 0.5 A/cm<sup>2</sup> operation, whereas other contributions have only minor changes. This leads to an increase in ASR from 0.573 to 0.609 Ω cm<sup>2</sup> considering the value of <italic>R</italic><sub>s</sub> was decreasing. During the ± 1.25 A/cm<sup>2</sup> operation, ASR increased from 0.45 to 0.478 Ω cm<sup>2</sup>, where the increased resistance contributions originated from both electrodes.</p><p id="Par22">Compared to the previously tested cells with only LSC-modified oxygen electrodes, the cell tested in this work showed better cell durability during the reversible operation. The degradation rates under SOFC mode were decreased by a factor of two during both ± 0.5 and 1.25 A/cm<sup>2</sup> reversible cycling. During the ± 1.25 A/cm<sup>2</sup> reversible operation under the SOEC mode, the cell voltage degradation rates decreased significantly by a factor of 13, with a value of 0.46%/kh compared to 6.3%/kh from the previous work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> Findings in this work demonstrate that infiltrating the electrocatalysts on both electrodes is an effective method of boosting the cell performance and durability under the reversible operation and show the high potential of the improved Ni/YSZ-based cell for use at high current density r-SOC applications.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work is supported by the project “BALANCE-Increasing penetration of renewable power, alternative fuels and grid flexibility by cross-vector electrochemical processes” under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement no. 731224).
