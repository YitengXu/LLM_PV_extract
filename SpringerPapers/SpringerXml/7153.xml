The objective of our study was to determine the type and frequency of chromosomal aberrations and polymorphisms in men with different degrees of spermatogenic failure in comparison to men with normozoospermia, in order to find some correlations between cytogenetic findings and the abnormal results of semen analysis.</p><p id="Par9"><bold>Methods:</bold> In our study, we have performed cytogenetic analysis in 901 infertile men, divided into 5 groups according to semen analysis—normozoospermia, asthenozoospermia, oligoasthenozoospermia, severe male factor and azoospermia.</p><p id="Par10"><bold>Results:</bold> The frequency of polymorphisms was similar in all groups (11–16%, without significant differences). The frequency of numerical and structural aberrations increases with the degree of the spermatogenic failure (3.5% in normozoospermia, 5.6% in asthenozoospermia, 9.8% in oligoasthenozoospermia, 9% in severe male factor and 13.5% in azoospermia). We have found significantly higher incidence of numerical chromosome aberrations in severe male factor (7%) and azoospermia (9.3%). Oligoasthenozoospermia was associated with chromosomal translocations, as it occurs in 45% of cases with translocation, compared to 20% in the group with normal karyotype.</p><p id="Par11"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We revealed that chromosomal translocations are significantly associated with oligoasthenozoospermia, whereas numerical chromosomal aberrations—with severe male factor and azoospermia. These are important aspects of genetic counseling for those cytogenetic findings. Chromosome polymorphisms don’t seem to disturb significantly spermatogenesis and their impact should be studied in regard to unsuccessful pregnancy achievement, even in patients with normozoospermia.</p><p id="Par12"><bold>References:</bold></p><p id="Par13"><bold>Grants:</bold></p><p id="Par14"><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>EP01.002 Comparison of carrier status among patients with or without family history of disease using targeted and expanded panels</title><sec id="Sec5"><title><bold>Karen Phaik Har Lim</bold><sup>1</sup>, Bridgette Meyers<sup>1</sup>, Ezen Choo<sup>1</sup>, Trevor Smart<sup>1</sup>, Sindhu Arun<sup>1</sup>, Nina Sanapareddy<sup>1</sup>, Dianne Keen-Kim<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="FPar2"><title><sup>1</sup>Natera Inc., San Carlos, United States</title><p id="Par15"><bold>Background/Objectives:</bold> Targeted carrier screening (CS) based on ethnicity or family history (FH) is common. However, many families lack background ethnic or genetic information. In this study, we compared the impact of using expanded versus targeted disease panels on patients with and without patient reported FH.</p><p id="Par16"><bold>Methods:</bold> Results from Horizon<sup>TM</sup> CS with 27-genes (<italic>N</italic> = 19,397) or 274-genes (<italic>N</italic> = 58,327) performed between January 2020–June 2021 were analyzed. FH among carriers was determined by ICD-10 code Z84.81. Cases without an ICD10 code were excluded.</p><p id="Par17"><bold>Results:</bold> Among 77,724 individuals undergoing CS, those with FH were more likely to be carriers (59.3%; 2598/4,379) than those without FH (55.4%; 40,623/73,345). However, the 274-gene panel was more likely to identify carriers with FH (67.6%; 2236/3309) or without FH (65.0%; 35,745/55,018) than the 27-gene panel (33.8%; 362/1,070 and 26.6%; 4,878/18,327, respectively). Interestingly, patients without FH were more likely to be carriers of variants in a single gene (34.3%; 18,862/55,018) than patients with FH (31.9%; 1055/3309) (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).</p><p id="Par18"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In this cohort, FH was associated with an increased positive rate. However, the expanded panel was better at identifying carriers than the targeted panel regardless of FH, and was more effective at identifying variants in a single gene without FH. Taken together, these results indicate that the use of expanded CS is more effective than targeted CS.</p><p id="Par19"><bold>References:</bold></p><p id="Par20"><bold>Grants:</bold></p><p id="Par21"><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> Karen Phaik Har Lim Full-time employee of Natera Inc., Option to own stock in Natera Inc., Bridgette Meyers Full-time employee of Natera Inc., Option to own stock in Natera Inc., Ezen Choo Full-time employee of Natera Inc., Option to own stock in Natera Inc., Trevor Smart Full-time employee of Natera Inc., Option to own stock in Natera Inc., Sindhu Arun Full-time employee of Natera Inc., Option to own stock in Natera Inc., Nina Sanapareddy Full-time employee of Natera Inc., Option to own stock in Natera Inc., Dianne Keen-Kim Full-time employee of Natera Inc., Option to own stock in Natera Inc.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>EP01.003 Chromosomal heteromorphisms as a risk factor for reproductive failure</title><sec id="Sec7"><title><bold>Mariya Levkova</bold><sup>1;2</sup>, Maria Tsvetkova<sup>1;2</sup>, Tsanka Ruseva<sup>2</sup>, Mari Hachmeriyan<sup>1;2</sup>, Milena Stoyanova<sup>1;2</sup>, Valentina Miteva<sup>1;2</sup>, Dinnar Yahya<sup>1;2</sup>, Lyudmila Angelova<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="FPar3"><title><sup>1</sup>Medical University Varna, Medical genetics, Varna, Bulgaria; <sup>2</sup>University Hospital St Marina Varna, Laboratory of Medical genetics, Varna, Bulgaria</title><p id="Par22"><bold>Background/Objectives:</bold> Chromosomal heteromorphisms are normal variations, which could be detected at specific chromosomal regions. Despite being considered normal findings, it is possible that these heteromorphisms are associated with reproductive failure (RF).</p><p id="Par23"><bold>Methods:</bold> A total of 661 women with unexplained RF (primary infertility and recurrent miscarriages) and 139 female control subjects, who had at least one child, were investigated by conventional cytogenetic analysis. GTG differential banding technique was applied, and approximately 10 metaphases were analyzed per patient. A t-test was performed.</p><p id="Par24"><bold>Results:</bold> Mean age of the patients with RF was 33.00 years, and of the control subjects—29.95 years. 61 (9.38%) of the case subjects had a chromosomal heteromorphism, and of the control subjects—seven (5.03%).

Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) refers to menopause before the age of 40 due to diminished ovarian reserve. Often, recurrent miscarriages (RM) represent a prelude to POI due to possible overlapping molecular etiologies<sup>1</sup>. Although rather common conditions (~1% of women), knowledge on (mono)genic causes of POI/RM is limited, hindering patient management.</p><p id="Par31"><bold>Methods:</bold> We aim to develop a nationwide cohort of idiopathic POI and RM cases to be systematically analyzed for genetic causes, using exome sequencing of patients and their affected family members. Inclusion criteria follow international guidelines: menopause &lt;40 yrs/3 or more miscarriages; anamnesis, family history, questionnaire, relevant laboratory findings (e.g. FSH &gt; 25 IU/l).</p><p id="Par32"><bold>Results:</bold> The study pipeline to recruit idiopathic POI/RM patients has been developed at the Women’s Clinics of Tartu University Hospital and East-Tallinn Central Hospital. Additional affected cases were identified from the Estonian Biobank (EstBB) database. From 768 EstBB participants with the ICD-10 diagnosis of POI, only 21 fit our stringent study criteria.</p><p id="Par33"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Research of idiopathic POI and RM is challenged due to insufficient clinical data to distinguish genetic <italic>vs</italic> non-genetic causes, and highly intimate nature of these conditions. Genetic research is alerted as timely counselling of women with high risk to POI/RM will have immediate impact to their reproductive decision making.</p><p id="Par34"><bold>References:</bold> 1.

These phenomena suggest an association between PMD and aberrant genomic imprinting, likely involving CDKN1C and IGF2. Another type of PMD involving the biparental genome has also been reported. However, the frequency and etiology of biparental PMD are still not fully understood.</p><p id="Par38"><bold>Methods:</bold> Twenty-five macroscopic PMD specimens were genotyped by DNA microarray or short tandem repeat analysis. DNA methylation analysis using bisulfite pyrosequencing was performed on 15 placenta-specific imprinted differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and 36 ubiquitous imprinted DMRs. Allelic expression of imprinted genes was examined by RT-PCR using single nucleotide polymorphisms. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on four biparental PMD specimens.</p><p id="Par39"><bold>Results:</bold> Genotyping revealed that approximately 30% of macroscopic PMD specimens were biparental, while the rest exhibited ABM. DNA methylation of most DMRs in PMD specimens with ABM displayed the paternal epigenotype. Importantly, biparental PMD specimens exhibited aberrant hypomethylation at six placenta-specific DMRs. Five imprinted genes associated with these DMRs were biallelically expressed. Aberrant hypomethylation was also observed at eight ubiquitous DMRs, including GRB10, but not ICR1 or ICR2, which regulate the expression of IGF2 and CDKN1C, respectively. WES did not reveal any pathological genetic abnormalities.</p><p id="Par40"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our data clarify the prevalence of biparental PMD and ABM-related PMD. The results strongly implicate that the hypomethylation of DMRs, including placenta-specific DMRs and GRB10, but not ICR1 or ICR2, plays a role in the pathogenesis of biparental PMD.</p><p id="Par41"><bold>References:</bold></p><p id="Par42"><bold>Grants:</bold> JSPS, AMED, MHLW.</p><p id="Par43"><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>EP01.006 Different IVF culture media do not affect the methylome of IVF children</title><sec id="Sec13"><title><bold>Rebekka Koeck</bold><sup>1;2</sup>, Jorg Tost<sup>3</sup>, Florence Busato<sup>3</sup>, Dimitri Consten<sup>4</sup>, Jannie van Echten-Arends<sup>5</sup>, Sebastiaan Mastenbroek<sup>6</sup>, Yvonne Wurth<sup>4</sup>, Heleen Zandstra<sup>2</sup>, Ron van Golde<sup>2</sup>, John Dumoulin<sup>2</sup>, Han Brunner<sup>2;7</sup>, Aafke van Montfoort<sup>2</sup>, Masoud Zamani Esteki<sup>1;2</sup></title><sec id="FPar6"><title><sup>1</sup>Maastricht University, Maastricht, Netherlands; <sup>2</sup>Academic Hospital Maastricht, Maastricht, Netherlands; <sup>3</sup>CEA - centre National de Recherche en Genomique Humaine, Évry, France; <sup>4</sup>St. Elisabeth-TweeSteden Hospital, Tilburg, Netherlands; <sup>5</sup>University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; <sup>6</sup>Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, Netherlands; <sup>7</sup>Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, Netherlands</title><p id="Par44"><bold>Background/Objectives:</bold> A growing number of children born are conceived through in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures that have been linked to increased risks of adverse perinatal outcomes and altered growth profiles in the resultant children. These outcomes are also influenced by the media used for embryo culture and this effect is hypothesized to be mediated epigenetically, e.g. through DNA methylation. Therefore, we investigated the methylome in IVF offspring who underwent embryo culture in different media.</p><p id="Par45"><bold>Methods:</bold> We profiled the umbilical cord blood (UCB) methylome of 106 IVF-neonates cultured in G5 or HTF, and the saliva methylome of 120 9-year-old IVF children, cultured in G3 or K-SICM, using the Infinium Human Methylation EPIC BeadChip. Analyses were carried out separately on UCB and saliva samples using empirical Bayes moderated mixed effects linear models adjusted for potential confounders. Methylation outliers represent values more than three interquartile ranges from the upper or lower quartiles.</p><p id="Par46"><bold>Results:</bold> In both comparisons (UCB and saliva) we identified no significant methylation differences between the culture medium groups in terms of: (i) systematic differences at single CpG sites or regions, (ii) imprinted sites/genes or birth weight associated sites, (iii) stochastic differences presenting as DNA methylation outliers or differentially variable sites, and (iv) epigenetic gestational age acceleration (UCB samples only).</p><p id="Par47"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The IVF culture media investigated did not lead to methylome difference in the resultant neonates/children, suggesting that any culture medium induced epigenetic alterations resolve prenatally. To investigate environmental-epigenetic interactions occurring earlier during human development, epigenetic profiling of preimplantation embryos is required.</p><p id="Par48"><bold>References:</bold></p><p id="Par49"><bold>Grants:</bold> March of Dimes (6-FY13-153).</p><p id="Par50"><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>EP01.007 Mosaic runs of homozygosity in first trimester spontaneous abortions with normal karyotype</title><sec id="Sec15"><title><bold>Gleb Drozdov</bold><sup>1</sup>, Igor Lebedev<sup>1</sup>, Tatyana Nikitina<sup>1</sup>, Anna Kashevarova<sup>1</sup>, Elizaveta Fonova<sup>1</sup>, Ekaterina Tolmacheva<sup>1</sup>, Elena Sazhenova<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="FPar7"><title><sup>1</sup>Tomsk National Research Medical Center of Russian Academy of Sciences, Research Institute of Medical Genetics, Tomsk, Russian Federation</title><p id="Par51"><bold>Background/Objectives:</bold> Runs of homozygosity (ROH) are considered as pathogenic factor for human health. It’s deleterious effect can be realized through the homozygotization of recessive mutations or imprinting disorders, highlighting the need to map such regions. Given the high frequency of mosaicism in embryos and the limitations of aCGH in detecting it, we decided to analyze different tissues of embryonic and extraembryonic origin, including parental samples.</p><p id="Par52"><bold>Methods:</bold> Eleven trios (mother, father, SA) were investigated by SurePrint G3 Human CGH+SNP 4 × 180K microarrays (Agilent Technologies, USA). Euploid placental tissues were separated into chorionic villi (CV) and extraembryonic mesoderm (EM).</p><p id="Par53"><bold>Results:</bold> Twenty-four ROHs were found in 10 samples. Seventeen ROHs were present in both tissues, while two were confined to CV (5q14.3, 8p23.3-23.1) and five to EM (4q28.2-28.3, 8q11.21-q11.23, 8q24.11-q24.12, 18q12.3, 18q12.1-12.2). Since none of the ROHs were inherited, we hypothesized that they resulted from a combination of identical parental haplotypes. SNP-analysis showed no uniparental disomy within homozygous regions. We hypothesize that a trisomy rescue could have occurred before divergence of embryonic and extraembryonic lineages. As a result, in one cell lineage a chromosome with a different haplotype was lost leading to ROH, and in another a chromosome with the same haplotype was lost keeping heterozygosity within the region. Therefore, ROH would be found in one tissue and heterozygosity of the same region in another.</p><p id="Par54"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This study highlights the underestimated level of mosaic ROHs in abnormal human reproduction.</p><p id="Par55"><bold>References:</bold> non.</p><p id="Par56"><bold>Grants:</bold> Russian Science Foundation №21-65-00017, <ext-link xlink:href="https://rscf.ru/project/21-65-00017" ext-link-type="uri">https://rscf.ru/project/21-65-00017</ext-link>.</p><p id="Par57"><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>EP01.008 A significant drop in sperm DNA fragmentation in a complete teratozoospermic patient post smoking cessation and its impact on ART outcome: case report</title><sec id="Sec17"><title><bold>Dina Faris</bold><sup>1;2</sup>, Suher Zada<sup>1</sup>, Mohamed Faris<sup>2</sup></title><sec id="FPar8"><title><sup>1</sup>The American University in Cairo, cairo, Egypt; <sup>2</sup>Dr Faris Medical Center, cairo, Egypt</title><p id="Par58"><bold>Background/Objectives:</bold> We assessed Sperm DNA Fragmentation in patients with 100% abnormal sperm morphology and its correlation with live birth rate post Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection.

The aim of this study was to determine the potential genetic cause of infertility in two SCOS brothers that had no common infertility-related genetic abnormalities.</p><p id="Par73"><bold>Methods:</bold> Two brothers were subjected to testicular biopsy and diagnosed with SCOS. DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood and whole-exome sequencing was performed. Variants were called, annotated, while those variants with a frequency higher than 1% in databases, intron, and synonymous were removed. The remaining variants were assessed by the Exomiser software and researched in literature.

For chromosome preparations, testicular tissues were treated with colchicines, hypotonic solution and then fixed on the glass slides. TLs were assessed using quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (Q-FISH) as relative values: by dividing the telomeric fluorescence by the subtelomeric fluorescence measured in ImageJ 1.51. Intercellular variability was estimated as the fold change between the TL measured in each spermatogonia/spermatocyte and the mean TL value across all of the studied spermatogonia/spermatocytes of an individual.

Besides aberrations of sex chromosomes, structural autosomal aberrations are associated with infertility, i.e. low sperm counts. Meiosis in translocation carriers results in chromosomally normal/balanced or unbalanced gametes. There is evidence that presence of translocations impairs spermatogenetic/meiotic processes. However, studies on spermatogenic progression in translocation carriers are scarce.</p><p id="Par153"><bold>Methods:</bold> In order to investigate associations between cytogenetic aberrations and spermatogenesis status, we retrospectively analysed 4663 males from one fertility centre and assessed cytogenetics, semen parameters, and testicular histology.</p><p id="Par154"><bold>Results:</bold> We found cytogenetic aberrations in 9.3% (432/4663) with 1.3% (60/4663) being structural autosomal aberrations. Carriers of reciprocal translocations (RT, <italic>n</italic> = 28) and Robertsonian translocations (ROB, <italic>n</italic> = 15) showed large variation in sperm counts, ranging from normozoospermia to azoospermia. Testicular histology in azoospermic patients with RT (<italic>n</italic> = 5) and ROB (<italic>n</italic> = 2) revealed marked differences in spermatogenic progression. We observed that some RT and ROB carriers showed meiotic arrest in most seminiferous tubules and a smaller proportion with full spermatogenesis. Interestingly, in other carriers with the same aberration type, we found in the majority of seminiferous tubules a complete absence of germ cells. To exclude further genetic causes for the spermatogenic failure in translocation carriers, we currently perform exome sequencing.</p><p id="Par155"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Translocation carriers, even of the same aberration, i.e. the common der(13;14)(q10;q10), show large variation in sperm counts and spermatogenic progression.

The large deployment of exome/genome sequencing (ES/GS) appears as a strong opportunity to improve PD but faces the difficulties of returning diagnosis in a short turnaround time and interpreting genomic data with incomplete clinical/imaging data. We present the French multicentric AnDDI-prenatome study of prenatal trio-ES.</p><p id="Par188"><bold>Methods:</bold> Rapid trio-ES (delay maximum 42 days) was performed, in parallel or after array-CGH, in pregnancies (10–34 weeks of gestation) with 2 ultrasound abnormalities. Only ACMG class 4 and 5 variants were considered for positive diagnosis.</p><p id="Par189"><bold>Results:</bold> 19 different centers included 150 pregnancies. ES was performed in first intention in 81/150 and after normal array-CGH in 60/150. The median delay was 28 days for positive diagnosis and 26 days for negative ones. The diagnostic rate was of 42% in first intention and of 27% after normal array-CGH. The concordance rate between ES and array-CGH was of 100% to detect CNV. Altogether, a causal diagnosis was identified in 50/150 foetuses, rising to 54/150 after VUS investigation. The pregnancy management could have been modified in 79% of the cases.</p><p id="Par190"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The AnDDI-prenatome study shows that prenatal ES is feasible with acceptable turnaround in France, with a major interest in pregnancy management. Despite prenatal incomplete clinical/imaging data, its diagnostic yield appears similar to postnatal ES.

Currently fetal sex diagnosis could be obtained using invasive procedures such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling, which are associated with a 1% risk of miscarriage. Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis based on circulating cell-free fetal DNA created new possibilities of early detection of fetal sex.

Approximately 25–50% of individuals with HPE have a chromosome abnormality. Analysis of recurrent chromosomal anomalies led to the identification of 12 candidate regions (HPE1 to HPE12). SHH, the major gene implicated in holoprosencephaly, was isolated from the critical region HPE3 on chromosome 7q36.

It is caused by mutations, or less frequently deletions of TWIST1 gene leading to its haploinsufficiency. Clinical presentation is variable, with coronal craniosynostosis, facial dysmorphism, hand and foot anomalies being the most common manifestations. We present a case of prenataly diagnosed SC-like syndrome due to complex chromosomal rearrangement involving chromosomes 5, 7, and 11.</p><p id="Par279"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 32-year-old women was referred to genetic counselling in 28th gestation week of her third pregnancy due to presence of ultrasound anomalies. Brachicephaly, hypertelorism, flat face, micrognathia, relative macroglossia and small posterior fossa were noted.</p><p id="Par280"><bold>Results:</bold> Karyotype analysis was performed on blood sample obtained by cordocenthesis. De novo translocation involving chromosomes 7 and 11 was found- 46,XY,t(7;11)(p15.5;q21)dn. Subsequent chromosomal microarray analysis (Agilent Sureprint G3 Human 8x60K) revealed presence of three microdeletions on chromosome 7: 7p21.1-p15.3 (4,82 Mb including TWIST1 gene), 7p12.1-p11.2 (1.3Mb), 7q21.11 (2,9 Mb), and one on chromosome 5 (5p12-p11, 581Kb).</p><p id="Par281"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Complex chromosomal rearrangements involving TWIST1 gene are very rare cause of SC syndrome. Prenatal manifestations in our case were consistent with TWIST1 haploinsufficiency, however, additional clinical manifestation can be expected due to presence of multiple microdeletions in proband.

Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II (CDAII) is caused by pathogenic variants in the <italic>SEC23B</italic> gene following an AR inheritance. Patients usually manifest with mild to moderate anemia, although in some cases blood transfusion may be required. Prenatal clinical manifestation as hydrops foetalis and intrauterine death is barely described. We present here two new cases of severe CDAII presenting with hydrops foetalis.</p><p id="Par286"><bold>Methods:</bold> Two pregnant women were referred to the Foetal Medicine Unit of our Hospital at 26 and 18 weeks of gestation, respectively. Ultrasound findings showed fetal ascites and pericardial effusion resulting in severe hydrops foetalis in both cases. They underwent prenatal exome sequencing in fetal DNA.</p><p id="Par287"><bold>Results:</bold> Molecular results showed pathogenic and probably pathogenic variants c.325G&gt;A (p.Glu109Lys) and c.1648C&gt;T; (p.Arg550*) in <italic>SEC23B</italic> (fetus 1), and c.2101C&gt;T (p.R701C) and c.2102G&gt;A (p.R710H) in <italic>SEC23B</italic> (fetus 2). The variants were in heterozygous state in their respective healthy parents. Although some of these variants have previously been reported, there is no clear genotype-phenotype correlation considering the type of variant.</p><p id="Par288"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Challenges in prenatal exome include the unknown fetal presentation of several genetic conditions that are recognized in postnatal settings. Indeed, our study provides further evidence of the presentation of CDAII as hydrops fetalis, expanding the clinical spectrum of this condition. Moreover, a categorical molecular diagnosis enables an early and adequate prenatal management to improve the prognosis of CDAII and to offer an appropriate genetic counseling to the families.</p><p id="Par289"><bold>References:</bold></p><p id="Par290"><bold>Grants:</bold></p><p id="Par291"><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec79"><title>EP02.018 Non-indicated invasive tests yield higher percentage of Ashkenazi Jewish patients</title><sec id="Sec80"><title><bold>Moran Echar</bold><sup>1</sup>, Amir Peleg<sup>1</sup>, Jumana Haddad-Halloun<sup>1</sup>, Lena Sagi-Dain<sup>1;2</sup></title><sec id="FPar39"><title><sup>1</sup>carmel medical center, Haifa, Israel; <sup>2</sup>The Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine Technion, Haifa, Israel</title><p id="Par292"><bold>Background/Objectives:</bold> The risk for clinically significant copy number variants in uneventful pregnancies is estimated at about 1%.

The percentage of Ashkenazi patients performing invasive testing due to maternal age over 35 years (76.0%) and in younger women (81.0%) was significantly higher compared to the rate of Ashkenazi patients undergoing indicated testing (61.4%). A significant decline in patients from other origins was noted in non-indicated vs. indicated tests.</p><p id="Par295"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Higher rates of Ashkenazi patients performing non-indicated invasive tests can be explained by various factors, including socio-economic status, religious beliefs, language barriers, and geographic factors.

Ion GeneStudio S5 System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Ion Reporter platform were used.</p><p id="Par347">Three patients were clinically diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, two with cone-rod dystrophy, and one with unspecific retinal anomaly and cataract.</p><p id="Par348"><bold>Results:</bold> Two of the patients diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa and one of the patients with cone-rod dystrophy carried pathogenic variants in ABCA4 gene. The third retinitis pigmentosa patient had a pathogenic missense in RHO gene. An indel in CDHR1 gene and a missense variant in RGR gene were found in the other patient with the cone-rod dystrophy. Only a pathogenic variant in CRYBB2 gene, causative for cataract, was found in the last patient.</p><p id="Par349"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Molecular diagnosis of RDs is essential in order to clarify the clinical presentation and evaluate the prognosis of age-related visual impairment, as well as the genetic of these highly heterogenous group of diseases.

So, 333 families were studied through classic genotyping methods or targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). The last up-date of adRP data was reported on 2018 with 258 unrelated adRP families.</p><p id="Par447"><bold>Results:</bold> Overall, 70% of our adRP cohort has been characterized with an increase of diagnosis rate of ~+10% from 2018.

Interleukin-5 (IL5) partly controls eosinophil production and survival; and response to anti-IL5 agents in asthma is correlated with baseline eosinophil counts. However, it is not clearly understood whether eosinophil levels are causally related to COPD and other respiratory phenotypes. We investigated causality between eosinophils and: lung function, acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD), asthma-COPD overlap (ACO), moderate-to-severe asthma, and respiratory infections.</p><p id="Par534"><bold>Methods:</bold> We performed Mendelian randomization using 151 variants from genome-wide association studies of blood eosinophils in UK Biobank/INTERVAL, and respiratory traits in UK Biobank/SpiroMeta, using methods relying on different assumptions for validity. We performed multivariable analyses using eight cell types for traits where there was possible evidence of causation by eosinophils.</p><p id="Par535"><bold>Results:</bold> Causal estimates derived from individual variants were highly heterogeneous. This may arise from pleiotropy. The average effect of raising eosinophils was to increase risk of ACO (weighted median OR per SD eosinophils 1.44 [95%CI 1.19,1.74]), and moderate-severe asthma (weighted median OR 1.50 [95%CI 1.23,1.83]), and to reduce FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC and FEV<sub>1</sub> (weighted median estimator, SD FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC: −0.054 [95%CI −0.078,−0.029]. Effects on lung function were more prominent in individuals with asthma.</p><p id="Par536"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Broad consistency between methods suggests eosinophils have a causal effect, though of uncertain magnitude. However, given the heterogeneity in results from individual instrumental variables, it is possible that these variants impair respiratory health via pleiotropic mechanisms, rather than by raising eosinophils. Our results suggest anti-IL5 agents may be useful in management of other respiratory conditions, including people with both asthma and COPD.</p><p id="Par537"><bold>References:</bold></p><p id="Par538"><bold>Grants:</bold></p><p id="Par539"><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> Anna Guyatt: None declared, Catherine John: None declared, Alexander T Williams: None declared, Nick Shrine: None declared, Nicola F Reeve: None declared, Ian Sayers: None declared, Ian P.

They have been histopathologically classified as Alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of the pulmonary veins (ACDMPV), Acinar dysplasia (AcDys), Congenital alveolar dysplasia (CAD), and other unspecified primary pulmonary hypoplasias (PHs). LLDDs are caused by heterozygous alterations involving FOXF1 (ACDMPV), TBX4, FGF10, or homozygous variants involving FGFR2 (AcDys, CAD, and PHs).

LLDDs include alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins (ACDMPV), acinar dysplasia (AcDys), congenital alveolar dysplasia (CAD), and other primary pulmonary hypoplasias (PHs). They are caused by heterozygous alterations involving FOXF1 (80-90% of ACDMPV) and TBX4 or FGF10 (65% of AcDys, CAD, and PHs).

It can induce preterm birth, fetal distress, and stillbirth. Typically, ICP was diagnosed in the third trimester of pregnancy. This study aimed at constructing a predictive model utilizing clinical features and plasma cell-free RNA (cfRNA) to predict ICP in early pregnancy.</p><p id="Par660"><bold>Methods:</bold> Detailed clinical information and plasma cfRNA were collected from 149 pregnant women (ICP, <italic>N</italic> = 43, control, <italic>N</italic> = 106) between 13 and 25 gestational weeks with a bile acid measurement &lt;10 µmol/L. A predictive model was constructed and validated in an independent cohort of 54 pregnant women (ICP, <italic>N</italic> = 11, control, <italic>N</italic> = 43).</p><p id="Par661"><bold>Results:</bold> The liver function indicators, including TBA (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) were elevated in women subsequently diagnosed as ICP. Consistently, liver-specific signatures in plasma cfRNA were significantly higher in pregnancies with ICP, and gene set enrichment analysis found that pathways related to bile acid transport and liver function were enriched in up-regulated genes. The integrated predictive model was more accurate, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.87 compared with the models derived for clinical features (AUROC, 0.75) and plasma cfRNA (AUROC, 0.80).</p><p id="Par662"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Altogether, the combination of clinical information and plasma cfRNA can identify liver-specific signatures in early pregnancy and effectively predict subsequent ICP.

Large population studies on bleeding tendency in OI are very sparse, while other connective tissue disorders with easy bruising have much more relevant research. This paper reviews the clinical aspects of bleeding and bruising in OI based on the self-bleeding assessment tool (BAT) questionnaire among a large cohort of OI patients.

The most common features are teeth agenesis, absent or reduced sweating (anhydrosis or hypohidrosis), hypotrichosis and dysplastic nails. The oral and dental findings include tooth agenesis, microdontia, abnormal shaped teeth and decreased salivary flow. More than 163 ED phenotypes have been reported with different patterns of inheritance, however the X-linked hypohidrotic ED (OMIM#305100) caused by EDA gene represents the most frequent type. Only 75 ED phenotypes were linked to 77 genes which makes molecular diagnosis challenging and drives the search for potential disease-causing variants.</p><p id="Par698"><bold>Methods:</bold> Fifteen ED Patients from 12 Egyptian families were subjected to oro-dental and general clinical examination focusing on the skin, and other ectodermal elements.

Laboratory results shows anemia, hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, high alkaline phosphatase, low 25(OH)D. There is MRT data for hydrocephalus. The molecular genetic analysis was performed by NGS (panel, that includes the associated with osteopetrosis genes).</p><p id="Par706"><bold>Results:</bold> The clinical manifestation, laboratory tests and x ray changes make the diagnosis osteopetrosis highly likely. It was confirmed by genetic testing, that revealed a novel homozygous pathogenic variant, c.205C&gt;T (p.Gln69*) in TCIRG1. The couple of parents are carriers of the mutation.</p><p id="Par707"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Early diagnosis is important to direct the appropriate treatment to prevent the disease progression before irreversible sequelae occur. The surveillance and treatment are managed by multidisciplinary team. The only treatment of infantile malignant osteopetrosis is haemopoetic stem cell transplantation.

Conversely, the additional congenital defects in this patient might be novel manifestations, expanding the phenotype of AEBP1 biallelic mutations. Although a different concomitant etiology for cleft palate and foot phalanges agenesis cannot be formally excluded, the connection of AEBP1 protein with TGF-beta and WNT pathways, for instance through the interaction with frizzled receptors, may suggest an intriguing common underlying etio-pathological mechanism.</p><p id="Par795"><bold>References:</bold></p><p id="Par796"><bold>Grants:</bold></p><p id="Par797"><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec210"><title>EP05.024 Steroid sulfatase deficiency in Tunisian patients: awareness of STS pseudogene technical trap</title><sec id="Sec211"><title><bold>hamza CHOUK</bold><sup>1</sup>, Sarra Saad<sup>2</sup>, Rima Gammoudi<sup>2</sup>, Lobna Boussofara<sup>2</sup>, sarra dimassi<sup>3</sup>, ALI SAAD<sup>3</sup>, Mohamed Denguezli<sup>2</sup>, Dorra H’mida<sup>3</sup></title><sec id="FPar103"><title><sup>1</sup>Higher Institut of Biotechnology of Monastir, Department of Cytogenetics, Molecular Genetics and Human Reproduction Biology, Sousse, Tunisia; <sup>2</sup>Faculty of Medicine of Sousse, Department of Dermatology, Sousse, Tunisia; <sup>3</sup>Faculty of Medicine of Sousse, Department of Cytogenetics, Molecular Genetics and Human Reproduction Biology, Sousse, Tunisia</title><p id="Par798"><bold>Background/Objectives:</bold> X-linked recessive ichthyosis (XLI) is a genetic disorder that affects the skin, caused by a deficiency of the steroid sulphatase enzyme encoded by the <italic>STS</italic> gene (OMIM # 300747).

Here we describe on a 4-year-old male CED patient whose features include dolichocephaly, multi suture craniosynostosis, facial dysmorphism, narrow thorax, limb shortening, and brachydactyly. The patient presented early-onset chronic kidney disease and early onset of retinal degeneration.

Moreover, she showed a delay in the replacement of the inferior deciduous incisors.

There are three main EB categories: simplex, junctional, and dystrophic. EB can be inherited in recessive (AR) or dominant (AD) manner, AR form being the most severe.</p><p id="Par842"><bold>Methods:</bold> Here we present three cases of EB, two cases of dystrophic EB (DEB) and one case of simplex EB (SEB), genetically analysed by NGS sequencing. All three patients present bullous lesions and skin exfoliation, diagnosed by dermatologist.</p><p id="Par843"><bold>Results:</bold> Following sequencing, we determined three different mutations. One of the patients with DEB has been identified with a missense homozygous mutation (c.425A&gt;G) in COL7A1 gene, also known as the most common variant among DEB patients. For the other patient with DEB, two different heterozygote mutations have been identified, both in COL7A1 gene (frameshift c.5960del, missense heterozygote c.425A&gt;G). The frameshift c.5960del mutation is less common; therefore, there are few information available for this mutation. The sequencing analysis for the SEB patient revealed a missense heterozygote mutation (c.1400T&gt;C) in KRT5 gene. The two DEB variants have been associated with AR inheritance, while SEB variant has been associated with AD inheritance.</p><p id="Par844"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The first conclusion reached is that the same EB type with similar manifestations can be determined by different mutations.

Accumulative evidence demonstrates that Toll-like receptors (TLRs) may represent the link between immune activation and tissue fibrosis. Releasing of endogenous TLR ligands and their binding to TLR receptors complexed to autoantibodies might be one of the mechanisms that initiate fibrotic events.

They reported a history of diverse cutaneous and extracutaneous symptoms affecting the ectodermal appendages. Our aim was to find the underlying genetic cause of this autosomal dominant ectodermal dysplasia associated with hypotrichosis, hyperpigmentation, hypohidrosis and syndactyly for our patients.</p><p id="Par878"><bold>Methods:</bold> Detailed physical examination was done for both affected family members. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed in both patients. Results were confirmed by Sanger sequencing in the patients and the unaffected parents of the index.</p><p id="Par879"><bold>Results:</bold> WES identified the heterozygous variant c.1922C&gt;T; p.(Ala641Val) in exon 14 of TP63 (NM_003722.5) in father and son. The variant could not be detected in the unaffected wife/mother. The parents of the index both did not carry the variant, which indicates a de novo pathogenic variant.</p><p id="Par880"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Since the first description of a TP63 variant, the broad spectrum of molecular defects within this gene became increasingly clear. Each patient with a TP63 mutation reported displayed a plethora of distinct cutaneous and extra-cutaneous symptoms, reflecting the clinical heterogeneity of these disorders. The symptoms of the here described family do not fit into any of the TP63-related entities. The findings of our patients and critical review of the literature point to a phenotype diversity associated with TP63 mutations. It seems therefore reasonable to critically question the old clinical classification and to overcome the historical terminology. We propose the use of the term TP63-associated disorder for the future.</p><p id="Par881"><bold>References:</bold></p><p id="Par882"><bold>Grants:</bold></p><p id="Par883"><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec232"><title>EP05.037 A novel frameshift variant of EDAR gene in a patient diagnosed with hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia</title><sec id="Sec233"><title><bold>Mert Coşkun</bold><sup>1</sup>, Aslı Toylu<sup>1</sup>, Alp Peker<sup>1</sup>, Özden Altıok Clark<sup>1</sup>, banu nur<sup>2</sup>, ercan mihci<sup>2</sup></title><sec id="FPar114"><title><sup>1</sup>Akdeniz University School of Medicine, Department of Medical Genetics, Antalya, Turkey; <sup>2</sup>Akdeniz University School of Medicine, Pediatric Genetics, Antalya, Turkey</title><p id="Par884"><bold>Background/Objectives:</bold> Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED) is a hereditary disease characterized by the triad of hypohidrosis, anodontia/hypodontia and hypotrichosis signs. In this study we present a patient with clinical diagnosis of HED. The patient had periorbital hyperpigmentation, low-set ears, short philtrum in addition to the characteristic clinical findings of the disease. His mother and father were second cousins. We aimed to analyse DNA sequence of the reported candidate genes for HED disease in order to confirm the diagnosis of the patient.</p><p id="Par885"><bold>Methods:</bold> Genomic DNA was extracted from the patient’s peripheral blood sample.

We describe the prevalence, clinical and radiological characteristics of scoliosis in KdVS.</p><p id="Par939"><bold>Methods:</bold> In this international retrospective cohort study, 54 participants with KdVS were included. Mean age of participants was 13.6 years (SD 8.4). We retrospectively analyzed participants’ spine radiographs, MRI’s and corresponding radiology reports for scoliosis and additional anomalies.

At the time of inclusion, most curves (60%) were below 30°. Participants with scoliosis received less often physiotherapy (p 0.002).

However, systematic studies on the relevance of rare variants (MAF &lt; 1%) in MPHL development are lacking.

The pathoetiology of preeclampsia is believed to have defects of trophoblast differentiation and trophoblast invasion in placenta. Recent clinical trials showed that aspirin is an effective agent for preeclampsia prevention but the drug acting mechanism needs further investigation. Elevated Fibronectin (FN) expression in maternal circulation and placenta has been shown to be associated with preeclampsia, however, the role of FN in human pregnancy and its pathoetiology in preeclampsia is unclear.</p><p id="Par962"><bold>Methods:</bold> FN knockdown (si-FN) and exogenous treatment of recombinant FN protein in HTR-8/SV neo cells.</p><p id="Par963"><bold>Results:</bold> In our presenting study, FN was upregulated in the placenta of preeclamptic patients and aspirin suppressed trophoblast FN expression in a dose-dependent way.

Genes associated are involved in the TGF-β/BMPs signaling pathway; arteriovenous malformations in lungs (pAVMs) are a clinical sign of HHT. <italic>Matrix Gla Protein</italic> (<italic>MGP</italic>) encodes for an extracellular protein, which inhibits BMP2 and BMP4, regulating ALK1 and VEGF expression. It also plays a protective role in pAVMs development in HHT-mouse model. The study aims to search for <italic>MGP</italic> variants in HHT patients.</p><p id="Par1011"><bold>Methods:</bold> In 40 pAVMs-HHT patients and 11 non-pAVMs HHT relatives, the whole <italic>MGP</italic> gene was sequenced by Sanger.

They are present in heterozygous and homozygous state in pAVMs patients, while they are present only in heterozygous state in non-pAVMs patients. The haplotype reconstruction on chromosome 12 was possible for 12 families.

Haplotype reconstruction suggests a common pattern for the totality of HHT-patients.

Recently, promising approaches to calculate case excess scores (CE) and etiological fractions (EF) and gnomAD-derived constraint metrics scores have been reported that estimate the likelihood that rare variants in specific genes or regions are pathogenic. Our objective was to study the usability of these scores into diagnostic variant interpretation, using our clinical cardiomyopathy cohort.</p><p id="Par1084"><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients (<italic>N</italic> = 2002) referred for clinical genetic diagnostics underwent NGS testing of 55-61 genes associated with cardiomyopathies. Previously classified likely pathogenic (LP) and pathogenic (P) variants were used to validate the use of data from CE, EF and gnomAD constraint analyses for (re)classification of associated variant types in specific cardiomyopathy subtype-related genes. Next, we applied these constraint data to interpret and (re)classify 1229 variants (identified in 812 patients) previously classified as VUS.</p><p id="Par1085"><bold>Results:</bold> Using constraint scores in variant interpretation and classification, the classifications of (L)P’s was corroborated in 94% (354/378) of cases. Moreover, 23 unique VUSs were reclassified to LP, increasing the diagnostic yield with 1.2%. In addition, 106 unique VUSs (5.3% of patients) were prioritized for co-segregation or functional analyses.</p><p id="Par1086"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our analysis confirms that the use of constraint metrics data can improve cardiogenetic variant interpretation and classification. We therefore recommend the inclusion of constraint scores in variant interpretation protocols and to also apply these in other cohorts and disorders.</p><p id="Par1087"><bold>References:</bold></p><p id="Par1088"><bold>Grants:</bold></p><p id="Par1089"><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec289"><title>EP06.022 A case report of a truncating variant altering the extreme C-terminal region of desmoplakin (DSP) suggests its crusial functional role</title><sec id="Sec290"><title><bold>Eleni-Malena Pantou</bold><sup>1</sup>, POLYXENI GOURZI<sup>1</sup>, Alexandros Tsoutsinos<sup>2</sup>, Dimitrios Degiannis<sup>1</sup>, Aris Anastasakis<sup>3</sup></title><sec id="FPar142"><title><sup>1</sup>Onassis Cardiac Surgery Center, Molecular Immunopathology and Histocompatibility Unit, Division of Genetics, Kallithea-Athens, Greece; <sup>2</sup>Onassis Cardiac Surgery Center, Department of Pediatric Cardiology, Kallithea-Athens, Greece; <sup>3</sup>Onassis Cardiac Surgery Center, Unit of Inherited and Rare Cardiovascular Diseases, Kallithea-Athens, Greece</title><p id="Par1090"><bold>Background/Objectives:</bold> Homozygous DSP truncating mutations located in the C-terminal region of DSP are known to mainly cause Carvajal syndrome, an autosomal recessive syndromic form of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy with an extra-cardiac cutaneous phenotype.</p><p id="Par1091"><bold>Methods:</bold> The index case and her relatives underwent full cardiological assessment.

Approximately 50% of all CAD-related deaths are attributed to sudden cardiac death (SCD) and the proportion of all SCDs resulting from CAD are about 80%. Four etiologies exist for SCD, comprising CAD, cardiomyopathies, cardiac channelopathies, and aortopathy. Ryanodine receptors (RyRs), of which, three members are known, are calcium (Ca2+) release channels located on the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum (ER/SR). RyR2 is the major (Ca2+) channel in cardiomyocytes, in which mutations can lead to cardiac arrhythmia and SCD. Due to several evidence on the contribution of rare variants to CAD, we aimed at identifying the potential rare disease-causing variants in Iranian patients with premature CAD and a positive family history for the disease.</p><p id="Par1105"><bold>Methods:</bold> Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on the proband of each family followed by Sanger sequencing for confirmation of the results and co-segregation study.</p><p id="Par1106"><bold>Results:</bold> We identified two heterozygous missense variants, p.Arg3260Trp and p.Thr1730Met, in <italic>RYR2</italic> gene (OMIM:*180902) in two unrelated families with history of CAD and SCD.

One of the major pathways with a significant influence on CAD is lipid metabolism. Sitosterolemia 1 [STSL1;MIM:#210250], characterized by elevated cholesterol and plant sterols (xenosterols) in plasma, is associated with premature coronary atherosclerosis that results from mutations in a member of ABC transporters, known as ABCG8. Sterolins, comprised of ABCG8 and ABCG5, form an obligate heterodimer that pumps xenosterols/cholesterol out of enterocytes and hepatocytes back into the intestinal lumen and bile canaliculi. This function is severely affected upon <italic>ABCG5/8</italic> mutations. In our study, we aimed at identifying the potential rare disease-causing variants in Iranian patients who show familial clustering of premature CAD (PCAD).</p><p id="Par1112"><bold>Methods:</bold> Whole-exome sequencing was performed on the proband of each family followed by Sanger sequencing for confirmation of the results and co-segregation analysis.</p><p id="Par1113"><bold>Results:</bold> We identified a likely pathogenic missense variant [c.G562C(p.V188L)] in <italic>ABCG8</italic> gene (MIM:*605460) in an Iranian family affected by PCAD with autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.

He has been studied by Cardiology Unit for thoraco-abdominal aneurism that required prothesic replacement. Among his clinical background chronical hypertension, vertebral cerebellar artery dissection, bruising and dissection of right kidney artery has been referred. The anatomo-pathologic analysis post splenectomy reveled compatible features with muscular fibrodysplasia on splenic artery.

We assessed the association between OSA, clinical factors, PRS and CVD events using multivariate Cox proportional hazard regressions.</p><p id="Par1151"><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 442 study participants (67% men; average 64 years old) had moderate or severe OSA (AHI ≥ 15/h). Of those, 77 experienced a CVD event during a mean follow-up of 7 years. A 10% increase in the CAD PRS was significantly associated with CVD events in a model adjusted for all cofounding factors (HR = 1.22, 95% CI (1.02–1.5), <italic>P</italic> = 0.03). Adding the PRS to the clinical risk factors significantly improved CVD event prediction (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03).</p><p id="Par1152"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> A CAD PRS is significantly associated with the occurrence of CVD in individuals with moderate or severe OSA. The addition of a CAD PRS has the potential to improve risk stratification of OSA patients, thereby enabling more personalized treatment management.</p><p id="Par1153"><bold>References:</bold></p><p id="Par1154"><bold>Grants:</bold></p><p id="Par1155"><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec307"><title>EP06.036 Development and validation of a new cardiac screening test</title><sec id="Sec308"><title><bold>Skevi Kyriakou</bold><sup>1</sup>, Achilleas Achilleos<sup>1</sup>, Michaella Georgiadou<sup>1</sup>, Charalambos Loizides<sup>1</sup>, Christos Lemesios<sup>1</sup>, Michalis Nicolaou<sup>1</sup>, Chrisovalando Soteriou<sup>1</sup>, Charalambos Kkoufou<sup>1</sup>, Louiza Constantinou<sup>1</sup>, Krystallo Christou<sup>1</sup>, Antonia Matsentidou<sup>1</sup>, Michalis Spyrou<sup>1</sup>, Stelia Pissaridou<sup>1</sup>, Demetra Panayiotou<sup>1</sup>, Kyriakos Tsangaras<sup>1</sup>, Elena Kypri<sup>1</sup>, Marios Ioannides<sup>1</sup>, George Koumbaris<sup>1</sup>, Philippos Patsalis<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="FPar151"><title><sup>1</sup>NIPD Genetics, Nicosia, Cyprus</title><p id="Par1156"><bold>Background/Objectives:</bold> Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of illness and death worldwide. There are many types of congenital cardiovascular diseases, ranging from simple to complex diseases with severe life-threatening symptoms. Overlapping symptoms can make it challenging to identify the underlying cardiovascular condition. We have developed and validated an NGS-based targeted cardiac screening test for the detection of multiple genetic conditions with complex phenotypes.</p><p id="Par1157"><bold>Methods:</bold> The test was developed using hybrid-capture enrichment followed by next generation sequencing. Custom target capture sequences (TACS) were designed to capture all coding exons and flanking regions of 292 disease associated genes. A blind validation study was performed on samples with unknown variant status and samples that were found to carry a genetic disorder previously identified by an independent lab to determine the sensitivity and specificity of single nucleotide variant (SNV), INDEL and copy number variant (CNV) detection.</p><p id="Par1158"><bold>Results:</bold> SNVs and INDELS were detected at sensitivity of 100% (CI: 79.4–100%) and specificity of 100% (CI: 99.8-100%). The algorithm was designed to detect CNVs at high-resolution with high sensitivity and specificity when applied to single or few exon CNV. All variants were confirmed by an orthogonal method.</p><p id="Par1159"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We have developed and validated a cardiac screening test of a great diagnostic and prognostic importance.

Coronary artery disease accounts for the majority of SCD in the older population whereas cardiomyopathies and arrhythmogenic abnormalities predominate in younger SCD victims (&lt;40 years) with a significant genetic component. Purpose of this study was to define the portion of underlying genetic heart diseases among young Kazakhstani unexplained SCD victims revealed by massive next-generation sequencing (NGS).</p><p id="Par1175"><bold>Methods:</bold> We included 12 forensic cases of unexplained SCD victims aged less than 40 years.

The data were evaluated bioinformatically and detected sequence variants were assessed using common databases and applying in silico prediction tools.

We performed an observational and genetic study by NGS sequencing of patients with HCM and found a novel variant in the MYH7 gene (NM_000257.4:c.1955G&gt;A) which putatively causes a p.Arg652Lys missense protein change. This previously non-described variant was found in twelve families with HCM. Out of 8 families that were clinically characterized 64% of carriers developed HCM. The LV hypertrophy was asymmetric septal in 75% of cases, with LV outflow tract obstruction in 28%. The incidence of a composite of serious adverse cardiovascular events (sudden death, aborted sudden death, appropriate implantable cardiac defibrillator discharge, an embolic event, or admission for heart failure) was observed in five (20%) patients. This p.Arg652Lys variant was classified as likely pathogenic (LP) and associated with the development of HCM for the following reasons: 1) It is found in patients with HCM, but not in controls, 2) There is evident segregation with HCM, and 3) It is located in an active site of the protein where a variant in the same amino acid has already been clearly established as pathogenic (p.Arg652Gly). Interestingly, the exclusive presence of the variant in our region could correspond to a founder effect in the Balearic Islands, Spain, which we have further investigated. IBD/coalescent-based allele dating analysis reveals that the origin of this allele is 96 generations away which would correspond to 1900-2400 years ago.</p><p id="Par1184"><bold>Conclusion:</bold>.</p><p id="Par1185"><bold>References:</bold></p><p id="Par1186"><bold>Grants:</bold></p><p id="Par1187"><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec315"><title>EP06.040 DNA libraries preparation optimization for sequencing of long DNA fragments using Nanopore sequencing for patients with heart disorders</title><sec id="Sec316"><title><bold>Diana Samatkyzy</bold><sup>1</sup>, Aidana Gabdulkayum<sup>1</sup>, Saule Rakhimova<sup>1</sup>, Ulykbek Kairov<sup>2</sup>, Ulan Kozhamkulov<sup>1</sup>, Makhabbat Bekbossynova<sup>3</sup>, Ainur Akilzhanova<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="FPar155"><title><sup>1</sup>Laboratory of Genomic and Personalized Medicine, Center for Life Sciences, National Laboratory Astana, Nazarbayev University, Nur-sultan, Kazakhstan; <sup>2</sup>Laboratory of Bioinformatics and Computational Systems Biology, Center for Life Sciences, National Laboratory Astana, Nazarbayev University, Nur-sultan, Kazakhstan; <sup>3</sup>National Research Cardiac Surgery Center, Nur-sultan, Kazakhstan</title><p id="Par1188"><bold>Background/Objectives:</bold> Heart failure (HF) is characterized by the failure of the heart’s function and may be a result of cardiomyopathy, which brings to cardiovascular death and disability.

All individuals with CdLS were submitted to molecular analysis (16 individuals carrying pathogenic variants in NIPBL, two in SMC1A, one in RAD21 and one in HDAC8). Cardiac function was evaluated using conventional echocardiography, tissue doppler imaging (TDI), two-dimensional speckle tracking and biochemical analyses.</p><p id="Par1197"><bold>Results:</bold> The analytical markers of cardiovascular risk and cardiac function showed no alterations.

Pathogenic variants have been identified in more than 350 genes, but at least 40% of patients remain undiagnosed (Stenton, 2020).</p><p id="Par1224"><bold>Methods:</bold> Next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods were applied for 24 patients in a group of 80 unrelated individuals with suspected mitochondrial disease after exclusion of mtDNA mutations by whole mtDNA (Sanger) sequencing. Gene panels for mitochondrial and other neuromuscular disorders were performed for 8 patients, whole exome sequencing was performed for 16 patients.</p><p id="Par1225"><bold>Results:</bold> In the study four patients (16.7%) were found to have pathogenic variants in POLG, SURF1, PNPLA8, RRM2B, and BTD genes. SURF1 gene is involved in the biogenesis of the cytochrome c oxidase complex. POLG and RRM2B genes are involved in mtDNA synthesis, pathogenic variants lead to qualitative or quantitative changes in mtDNA. The protein encoded by PNPLA8 gene is essential for maintaining efficient bioenergetic function through tailoring mitochondrial membrane lipid metabolism. Pathogenic variants in the genes CACNA1A, DDX3X, TPP1, YARS and ANO5, leading to other neuromuscular diseases, were identified in six patients (25.0%).

These alterations can be associated with numerous hormonal, genetic and often physical alterations. The micropenis consists in the presence of a stretched penile length of less than 2–2.5 SD for age, can represent a clinical sign of various forms of DSDs.</p><p id="Par1239"><bold>Methods:</bold> In the present study we report the case of a 5-year-old child with isolated micropenis, a typical feature of 46,XY DSD, showing low basal and post hCG stimulation testosterone levels. Molecular analysis using a NGS panel of 50 genes involved in DSDs was performed. Then a serum steroid profiling for the child was also determined by Liquid Chromatography coupled to Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) analysis.</p><p id="Par1240"><bold>Results:</bold> NGS analysis evidenced the presence of an heterozygous mutation in the CYP17A1 gene.

We studied a highly consanguineous Palestinian family of two boys affected with GSD-III. WES testing was performed on DNA samples from the two boys and their parents. No pathogenic variants were found, but a homozygous deep intronic variant of uncertain significance (VOUS) AGL:c.1735+130A&gt;G, in intron 13 was identified in both probands. Our objective was to discover the genetic basis for the disease in this family.</p><p id="Par1303"><bold>Methods:</bold> cDNA sequencing and qRT-PCR methods were used to evaluate alternative splicing and gene expression.

But, expression analysis using qRT- PCR showed lack of expression of exons 28-30, at the end of the gene, in the two probands. Long-range PCR of genomic DNA revealed a homozygous deletion of 5.5Kb.

The older boy has a history of learning difficulties but was considered as healthy until the age of 17. He then showed signs of a decompensated heart insufficiency and was diagnosed with non-compaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC) and died at the age of 19. The younger brother had been diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) at the age of 3 years. He also showed learning difficulties. At the age of 16 he showed progressive heart insufficiency. The family´s third child is completely healthy.</p><p id="Par1366"><bold>Methods:</bold>.</p><p id="Par1367"><bold>Results:</bold> A homozygous missense variant in <italic>MALSU1</italic> (<italic>C7orf30</italic>) was detected in genomic DNA of the two patients. Both parents and the healthy brother were heterozygous carriers. <italic>MALSU1</italic> encodes an assembly and stability factor of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosomes (mt-LSU), suggesting a critical role in mitochondrial translation for MALSU1. Protein modelling suggested substantial destabilization of MALSU1 through this variant. Western blot analysis confirmed significant reduction of protein expression in cells of the homozygous family members. Comparative seahorse analysis of fibroblasts of the two homozygous and the heterozygous brother showed a decrease in mitochondrial activity in the homozygous samples but not in the heterozygous sample. Ongoing Western blot analysis of mitochontrial translated proteins versus cytosolic synthesized proteins will show if the MALSU1 variant influences mitrochondrial protein synthesis.</p><p id="Par1368"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Mutations in mito-ribosomal proteins are a common cause of mitochondrial protein synthesis deficiencies.

Gene expression profiling was performed on whole blastocyst embryos, by RNA-Sequencing.</p><p id="Par1426"><bold>Results:</bold> Transcriptomic analyses showed a similarly decreased gene expression pattern in embryos from the mitochondrial group, altering a number of differentiation factors and nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. Expression of oxidative phosphorylation genes was most impacted, cell survival and autophagy were also severely decreased, questioning embryonic viability.</p><p id="Par1427"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The presence of a pathogenic mitochondrial variant induces changes in gene expression programs of human preimplantation embryos and probably compromises development, cell differentiation and survival of the embryo. While identification of reliable markers of normal embryonic development is urgently needed in assisted reproductive technologies, we suggest considering the under-expressed genes reported here as predictive biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction during preimplantation development.</p><p id="Par1428"><bold>References:</bold> None.</p><p id="Par1429"><bold>Grants:</bold> This work was supported by the “Association Française contre les Myopathies” (Grant Number: 20304) and the “Fondation des Maladies Rares” (Grant Number: GenOmics_202003003).</p><p id="Par1430"><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec382"><title>EP08 Immunology and Hematopoietic System</title><sec id="Sec383"><title>EP08.001 Revisiting diagnostic procedures in patients with hereditary red blood cell membranopathies– Description of 9 new genetic variants</title><sec id="Sec384"><title><bold>Friederike Haeuser</bold><sup>1</sup>, Heidi Rossmann<sup>1</sup>, Anke Adenaeuer<sup>1</sup>, Berhnhard Laemmle<sup>2;3;4</sup>, Claudia Paret<sup>5</sup>, Karl J.

Although the most common hereditary hemolytic disease in Caucasians, hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is underdiagnosed, because mild clinical course is common and only the minority of patients have been genetically characterized so far. We aimed to develop a simple strategy to confirm the suspected diagnosis of HS using an NGS (next generation sequencing)-based approach.</p><p id="Par1432"><bold>Methods:</bold> 12 patients with clinical and laboratory signs of HS and one patient with initially inconclusive laboratory results, were genetically (exome sequencing) and phenotypically (standard laboratory tests) characterized.

The disease is caused by mutations in <italic>ETV6</italic>, a gene encoding a transcription factor that plays a key role in haematopoiesis. Since ETV6-RT has been discovered only in 2015, many aspects of this disease still remain unknown. For this reason, we studied the pathogenic effect of seven germline missense variants identified in thrombocytopenic patients.</p><p id="Par1440"><bold>Methods:</bold> We performed bioinformatic analysis and gene reporter assays on a target promoter of ETV6 to determine the potential effect of the variants. Western Blot and immunofluorescence assays were used to evaluate the pathogenic mechanism.</p><p id="Par1441"><bold>Results:</bold> Analysing thrombocytopenic families by NGS approach, we identified seven different germline missense variants in <italic>ETV6</italic> gene, including four novel amino acid substitutions.</p><p id="Par1442">Consistent with bioinformatic analysis, we demonstrated the pathogenicity of all but two variants, whose protein products are no longer able to migrate into the nucleus, impairing the ETV6 repressive activity.

Understanding the mechanism by which mutations exert their effect is important to clarify the ETV6 role during megakaryopoiesis, to identify possible therapeutic approaches to correct platelet biogenesis and to prevent the onset of leukaemia in ETV6-RT patients.</p><p id="Par1444"><bold>References:</bold></p><p id="Par1445"><bold>Grants:</bold></p><p id="Par1446"><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec387"><title>EP08.003 Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type 1 with Clinical and Genetic Characteristics</title><sec id="Sec388"><title><bold>Asli Subasioglu</bold><sup>1</sup>, Roya Gasimli<sup>2</sup>, Derya Sema Yaman Kalender<sup>3</sup>, Baris Onder Pamuk<sup>3</sup></title><sec id="FPar190"><title><sup>1</sup>Izmir Katip Çelebi University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Genetics, Izmir, Turkey; <sup>2</sup>Ege University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Biology, Izmir, Turkey; <sup>3</sup>Izmir Katip Çelebi University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Internal Diseases, Endocrinology Clinic, Izmir, Turkey</title><p id="Par1447"><bold>Background/Objectives:</bold> Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1 is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by polyendocrinopathy and enteropathies [1,2], resulting from a mutation in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene located on chromosome 21q22.3 [3].

HBB gene mutations can lead either to the decreased beta-chains synthesis and beta-thalassemia or to the beta-chains conformation changes and hemoglobinopathy. Thalassemia is the most common inherited disease in the world however the diagnostics is still a complicated complex process. Our aim was to characterize the molecular genetic and laboratory features of HBB gene mutations and to evaluate the prevalence of beta-thalassemia in Russia due to a little data about it.</p><p id="Par1479"><bold>Methods:</bold> The first group consisted of 268 patients with supposed inherited anemia in accordance with clinical and laboratory data.

Sequencing the HBB gene has revealed a heterozygote beta+-thalassemia variant (HBB:c.*113A&gt;G) inherited from father. MLPA and array analysis, performed in the probands and the parents, have shown a maternally inherited interstitial triplication of the alpha-globin gene cluster on chromosome 16p13.3 (approx. 900 kb), for which the mother was 25% mosaic. One child inherited eight alpha-genes, without the beta+-thalassemia variant of father. The triplicated segment involves the complete alpha-globin gene cluster and 18 additional protein coding genes.

Laboratory investigations indicated a mild normochromic normocytic anaemia, without microspherocytosis, with important persistent reticulocytosis (&gt;3%), mild inconstant thrombocytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, very low haptoglobin values, direct positive Coombs test; and significantly high values (&gt;10%) of double negative TCR αβ populations, of vitamin B12 (3757pg/ml) and IL-10 (103pg/ml) were assessed.

The function of QRICH1 is largely unknown but it is likely to play a key role in the unfolded response of endoplasmic reticulum stress. Ververi-Brady syndrome (VBS; MIM:#617982) is a rare developmental disorder, characterized by mild developmental delay, mildly impaired intellectual development and speech delay and mild dysmorphic facial features, and loss of-function variants in QRICH1 were implicated in its etiology.</p><p id="Par1593"><bold>Methods:</bold> We examined 2 patients with epilepsy, developmental and speech delay.

While it is known that parkinsonism is associated with cognitive impairment, data on juvenile-onset parkinsonism and intellectual disability are still limited to a few case reports. We present two siblings from a consanguineous Syrian family: a 4-year-old patient with severe speech delay, behavioral problems, gait difficulties and delayed global development, and his less severely affected 14-year-old sister with delayed global development and gait difficulties.</p><p id="Par1619"><bold>Methods:</bold> Morphological examination, fragile X syndrome, Whole Exome Trio analysis, MRT scans and histological staining of skin biopsy were performed.</p><p id="Par1620"><bold>Results:</bold> A Whole Exome Trio analysis revealed a homozygous and likely disease-causing variant c.280delC, p.(Leu94TrpfsTer40) in the PTRHD1 gene of both siblings.

Genetic variants in components of the NPC have been shown to cause a range of neurological disorders, including intellectual disability and microcephaly. Here we present two siblings who present with a phenotype of microcephaly, ataxia and severe intellectual disability. Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) identified biallelic variants in TPR and we undertook functional genomics analysis to evaluate pathogenicity.</p><p id="Par1677"><bold>Methods:</bold> WGS and RNAseq were used to search for pathogenic variants, and identified candidate variants in TPR. Functional analysis in patient fibroblasts evaluated pathogenicity of TPR variants.

Functional analyses in patient fibroblasts demonstrate significantly reduced TPR levels by western blot, decreased colocalization of TPR to NPCs, and decreased TPR-containing NPC density.

Here, by combining exome sequencing with in silico analyses, we identified a patient affected by severe ID and cognitive regression, carrying a novel loss-of-function mutation of the semaphorin 3E (<italic>SEMA3E</italic>) gene, which encodes for a key secreted cue that controls brain development in mouse.</p><p id="Par1861"><bold>Methods:</bold> ad hoc in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed.

This approach has entered the medical practice as an effective diagnostic test transforming the molecular diagnosis and clinical management of undiagnosed genetic diseases.</p><p id="Par1928"><bold>Methods:</bold> We performed exome sequencing using SureSelectXT Human All Exon V6 technology (Agilent Technologies) and Comprehensive Exome Panel technology (Twist Bioscience). Sequencing reads were analyzed using DRAGEN software. Trio annotation and prioritization was performed with an in-house pipeline that allowed the detection of candidate SNVs and CNVs, based on genetic and phenotypic priorization.</p><p id="Par1929"><bold>Results:</bold> We present the analysis of 804 trios referred to our lab since 2018. Patients were mainly children with neurodevelopmental disorder (92%). The genetic etiology was potentially elucidated in 344 probands, achieving a 43% genetic diagnostic rate. Among these patients, 176 harbored de novo variants, 66 hemizygous maternally inherited variants, 45 in compound heterozygous variants, 27 newly homozygous variants and 30 variants inherited from parents.

The main clinical features reported include the association of cognitive impairment, cleft lip and/or palate and facial dysmorphisms. Up to date, 16 variants submitted in ClinVar database were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic and 44 as uncertain significance. Regarding phenotypic descriptions other than intellectual disability, nine patients from five families have been published.</p><p id="Par1935"><bold>Methods:</bold> We summarize the clinical features and variants of the patients previously reported in the literature and compare them with an additional patient from our clinic.</p><p id="Par1936"><bold>Results:</bold> We report a 4-year-old male patient with mild global developmental delay, dysmorphic facial features, brain encephaloclastic lesions and symptomatic focal epilepsy. There is a maternal family history of epilepsy. Clinical exome analysis revealed a maternally inherited truncating variant in the PHF8 gene. Unlike those previously reported, there is no personal or family history of cleft lip/palate.</p><p id="Par1937"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Features like autism spectrum disorder, brain encephaloclastic lesions and epilepsy could be part of the phenotypic spectrum of Siderius type X-linked intellectual disability. There is a high number of uncertain significance variants in the PHF8 gene published in public databases, therefore further phenotype characterization of these patients could be helpful to interpret such variants and provide an accurate diagnosis, that can be beneficial for surveillance, prognosis assessment and familial genetic counselling.</p><p id="Par1938"><bold>References:</bold></p><p id="Par1939"><bold>Grants:</bold></p><p id="Par1940"><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec518"><title>EP09.050 Case study: deep phenotyping of a case with paternally inherited 16p11.2 duplication and 22q11.2 duplication</title><sec id="Sec519"><title>Jente Verbesselt<sup>1</sup>, Inge Zink<sup>2;3</sup>, <bold>Jeroen Breckpot</bold><sup>1;4</sup>, Ann Swillen<sup>1;4</sup></title><sec id="FPar255"><title><sup>1</sup>KU Leuven, Department of Human Genetics, Leuven, Belgium; <sup>2</sup>KU Leuven, Department of Neurosciences, Research Group Experimental Oto-Rhino-Laryngology, Leuven, Belgium; <sup>3</sup>UZ Leuven, Department of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology, Head &amp; Neck Surgery, MUCLA, Leuven, Belgium; <sup>4</sup>UZ Leuven, Centre for Human Genetics, Leuven, Belgium</title><p id="Par1941"><bold>Background/Objectives:</bold> Some recurrent copy number variants (CNVs), such as 16p11.2dup and 22q11.2dup, are associated with significant risk for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), although associated phenotypes are heterogeneous and familial transmission rates are high.

Finally, the predicted interaction between HMGB1 and other genes involved in neurodevelopmental disorders (SMARCA4, SMARCA2, SMARCD1) raises the hypothesis of a common epigenetic signature.</p><p id="Par1986"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Thus, as for many microdeletion syndromes, the search for the genetic basis and the genes responsible for the pathology has been greatly facilitated by high-throughput exome and genome sequencing. Indeed, this cohort allows us to propose HMGB1 as a major gene of the 13q12.3 microdeletion syndrome and as a new gene for intellectual disability. Finally, this study shows once again the importance of international data sharing in the context of rare diseases.</p><p id="Par1987"><bold>References:</bold></p><p id="Par1988"><bold>Grants:</bold></p><p id="Par1989"><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec532"><title>EP10 Neurogenetic and Psychiatric Disorders</title><sec id="Sec533"><title>EP10.001 Pipelines to investigate both small and large variants from a small amyotrophic lateral sclerosis family</title><sec id="Sec534"><title><bold>Sandrine Chan Moi Fat</bold><sup>1</sup>, Emily McCann<sup>1</sup>, Lyndal Henden<sup>1</sup>, Kelly Williams<sup>1</sup>, Dominic Rowe<sup>2</sup>, Jennifer A Fifita<sup>1</sup>, Ian P Blair<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="FPar262"><title><sup>1</sup>Macquarie University Centre for Motor Neuron Disease Research, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Health and Human Sciences, Sydney, Australia; <sup>2</sup>Faculty of Medicine, Health and Human Sciences, Macquarie University, Department of Clinical Medicine, Sydney, Australia</title><p id="Par1990"><bold>Background/Objectives:</bold> Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease. To date, 90% of ALS cases still have an unknown genetic cause. Most research has focused on small nucleotide level variants only. This project extends ALS gene discovery to consider large structural variation (SVs) by using bioinformatic pipelines to identify both small and large genetic alterations in a small ALS family with limited power for traditional gene discovery methods.</p><p id="Par1991"><bold>Methods:</bold> Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on two affected individuals from a family with ALS history (MQ52). To identify candidate small nucleotide variants, shared variant analysis was carried out to filter for nonsynonymous and indel variants absent/extremely rare from public controls. To identify SVs, we have developed a comprehensive pipeline that calls SVs from WGS data using multiple tools such as Manta, Lumpy and MetaSV. The Duphold tool is then used to filter SVs based on quality scores, followed by annotation using Reciprocal Overlap Annotator and AnnotSV to generate a list of shared or overlapping SVs between the two affected individuals.</p><p id="Par1992"><bold>Results:</bold> Initial analysis of family MQ52 identified 14 small variants and 80 novel/rare SVs, of which 44 SVs lie in coding regions. This SV pipeline is undergoing refinement and resultant SVs will be validated using established PCR techniques.</p><p id="Par1993"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our gene discovery pipelines can successfully identify both small and large variants that potentially cause disease within small ALS families. Given that SVs have been largely understudied in ALS, discovery of ALS-linked SVs could help to elucidate the missing genetic architecture of ALS.</p><p id="Par1994"><bold>References:</bold></p><p id="Par1995"><bold>Grants:</bold></p><p id="Par1996"><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec535"><title>EP10.002 Clinical spectrum and genetic characteristics of four patients with autism spectrum disorders and 15q11-q13 duplication syndrome</title><sec id="Sec536"><title><bold>Daniela Avdjieva-Tzavella</bold><sup>1</sup>, Stoyan Bichev<sup>2</sup>, Tsvetina Veleva<sup>3</sup>, Trayan Delchev<sup>3</sup>, Maria Sredkova-Ruskova<sup>3</sup>, Savina Hadjidekova<sup>4</sup></title><sec id="FPar263"><title><sup>1</sup>University Pediatrics Hospital, Medical University, Department of Clinical Genetics, Sofia, Bulgaria; <sup>2</sup>University Hospital “Majcin Dom”, National Genetic Laboratory, Sofia, Bulgaria; <sup>3</sup>University Pediatrics Hospital, Medical University, Department of Clinical Genetics, Sofia, Bulgaria; <sup>4</sup>Medical University, Department of Medical Genetics, Sofia, Bulgaria</title><p id="Par1997"><bold>Background/Objectives:</bold> Chromosomal copy number variants (CNV) are the most common genetic lesion found in 5–10% of all patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

We used a deep learning approach to predict the tissue specific functional effect of variants in epilepsy patients.</p><p id="Par2054"><bold>Methods:</bold> Whole genome sequence data are available for 493 epilepsy patients and 201 controls. We computed the predicted expression change of variants using the deep learning algorithm ExPecto<sup>1</sup>. We used python’s statsmodels to conduct logistic regressions by comparing patients and controls functional variants’ burden among different groups of genes such as known epilepsy genes and genes intolerant to loss-of-function variants.</p><p id="Par2055"><bold>Results:</bold> Variants were filtered based on an expression change threshold. It corresponds to the value at which directionality prediction becomes perfect when compared to known eQTLs from GTEx. Using only variants that passed the threshold, we performed a logistic regression to compute the functional variants’ burden in known epilepsy genes. Preliminary results show no difference between groups. Nevertheless, future regressions will focus on single genes and the magnitude of the expression change.</p><p id="Par2056"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Deep learning algorithms are incredibly powerful tools to predict variant functional effects. Those methods are especially useful in neurology since brain tissues can only be acquired post-mortem.

The reported associations have not been validated by replication efforts so far. Therefore, we decided to check them in a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset for RLS.</p><p id="Par2069"><bold>Methods:</bold> Candidate gene studies were extracted from PubMed. GWAS data was available from the International-EU-RLS-GENE-Consortium<sup>1</sup> which included 17,220 individuals of European ancestry.<sup>2</sup> Single variant association tests were performed with SNPTEST software. Study power was calculated with the genpwr package in R.</p><p id="Par2070"><bold>Results:</bold> Across all identified studies, five different variants located in the genes <italic>ADH1B, GABRR3, HMOX1, MAOA</italic>, and <italic>VDR</italic> were reported as significantly associated with RLS. We did not replicate these associations in our dataset and no other variants located in these genes reached genome-wide significance either. Power calculations showed that our study had sufficient power (close to or 100%) to detect the reported associations of these variants, even when accounting for biased effect size estimates due to winner’s curse.</p><p id="Par2071"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our results indicate that the reported associations were rather false-positive than true-positive associations to RLS.

Little is known about the impact of genetic variation on dicarbonyl metabolism. Genome-wide association studies of the sensorimotor disorder restless legs syndrome (RLS) have identified significant association signals in and close to <italic>GLO1</italic>, which encodes the key MG-detoxifying enzyme, glyoxalase-1 (GLO1). Therefore, we decided to study dicarbonyl levels and their genetic basis in RLS patients and controls.</p><p id="Par2085"><bold>Methods:</bold> Three dicarbonyls (MG, GO, 3-DG) were measured in serum of 246 RLS patients and 482 controls from a population-based cohort (KORA) using liquid-chromatography-mass-spectrometry. Phenotypic information included demographic data, laboratory parameters, and comorbidities. Samples were genotyped on the Axiom® array. Association analyses were done using regression models, MDS and bidirectional stepwise RDA analysis.</p><p id="Par2086"><bold>Results:</bold> Validating our dataset, we replicated known associations of the dicarbonyls to clinical phenotypes, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, age, obesity, impaired liver, and renal function. These were in accordance with significant associations to objective disease parameters such as waist-to-hip ratio and glomerular filtration rate amongst others. As a novel finding, MG levels were significantly lower in RLS cases compared to controls across all age and sex groups (p = 4×10<sup>-23</sup>). GWAS on dicarbonyl levels revealed only signals below the genomewide significance-threshold, likely due to the limited sample size.</p><p id="Par2087"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our study provides first evidence for a role of dicarbonyls in RLS, indicating potential new treatment options.

Clinical features include gait ataxia and action tremor, while some patients demonstrate parkinsonism, cognitive deficits and peripheral neuropathy. Consequently, FXTAS is often misdiagnosed as spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) or Parkinson’s disease (PD). Herein, we sought to investigate the frequency, genotypic and phenotypic profile of FXTAS in two cohorts of Greek patients with movement disorders, one with late-onset cerebellar ataxia and the other with PD.</p><p id="Par2099"><bold>Methods:</bold> In total, 92 index patients with late-onset cerebellar ataxia (negative for SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7 repeat expansions) and 171 with PD (negative for p.A53T in <italic>SNCA</italic>) were selected. All cases had no male-to male transmission.

In-depth analysis was also performed to highlight the genotype- phenotype correlation.</p><p id="Par2220"><bold>Results:</bold> Next Generation Sequencing yielded pathogenic variants in MECP2 gene in 11 patients, IQSEC2 gene in two, and in FOXG1, CDKL5, SHANK3, HNRNPH2 and ATP6V0A1 in one case each, leading to phenotypic presentations ranging from typical Rett syndrome to Phelan-McDermid Syndrome and a congenital variant of Rett syndrome. While 14 mutations have been reported in literature, we report four novel mutations – two in MECP2, and one each in CDKL5 and HNRNPH2 genes.

With more than 165 pathogenic variants reported in the literature, the majority are missense variants (49%) localized especially in exon 15 (25%) affecting the catalytic domain of <italic>ALDH7A1</italic>. In South Tunisia, the c.1364T&gt;C (p.Leu455Pro) pathogenic missense variant is known for its founder effect.</p><p id="Par2344">The aim of our study is to determine the frequency of this founder variant.</p><p id="Par2345"><bold>Methods:</bold> This is a retrospective study including patients with suspected PDE addressed by neonatology or child neurology departments to the medical genetics department from 2016 to 2021.

An essential regulatory component of these endomembrane organelles is the minor lipid, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P), generated by four distinct phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase enzymes (PI4K, PI4KB, PI4K2A, PI4K2B) in mammalian cells. Data from animal models and human genetic studies suggest vital roles of the PI4K enzymes for the development and functions of various organs and nervous system.

Possible causes of neuroregression include genetic, metabolic, degenerative, infectious, neoplastic, and vascular, but it is commonly perceived as a pivot sign of a genetic disease.

Many individuals with dysautonomia have neurocardiac involvement characterized by postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), orthostatic hypotension, and vasovagal syncope (VVS). Autonomic perturbations have multiple known molecular etiologies ranging from aberrant development and adult stem cell maintenance, to defects in ion-channels, metabolism of neurotransmitters, inflammation, and neurodegeneration.

The pathogenicity of TBP41-49 intermediate alleles remains controversial. We previously detected for the first time the co-segregation of STUB1 variants causing Spinocerebellar ataxia 48 (SCA48) with intermediate alleles of TBP in two families suggesting an interplay between the two loci. This STUB1/TBP co-segregation was recently confirmed in a study that however proposed a digenic inheritance to explain the full disease penetrance of STUB1 variants in SCA48 families.</p><p id="Par2441"><bold>Methods:</bold> We systematically sequenced the TBP CAG/CAA repeats in 34 probands with STUB1 variants, and search for STUB1 pathogenic variants in 49 probands carriers of intermediate or pathogenic alleles of TBP to precisely delineate the interaction between these two loci.</p><p id="Par2442"><bold>Results:</bold> Recurrent pathogenic or novel STUB1 variants were found in half of the TBP cohort, all carriers of intermediate alleles. TBP41-49 carriers were detected in 26% of STUB1 probands. Clinical comparison of SCA48 patients revealed that the carriage of TBP-intermediate alleles was significantly associated with the risk of developing cognitive impairments (p = 0.0129) and with a faster progression of the disease until death (p = 0.0003). Statistical analyses revealed that pathogenic effects of TBP-intermediate alleles on STUB1 carriers start from TBP repeats = 40. Importantly, twelve STUB1 probands presenting with the full SCA48 clinical phenotype (ataxia and dementia) had normal TBP37-39 alleles, excluding a systematic digenic inheritance.</p><p id="Par2443"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Altogether, our work shows that TBP-intermediate alleles act as a disease modifier of SCA48 that increases the severity of the disease with important consequences for genetic counseling of SCA48 patients.</p><p id="Par2444"><bold>References:</bold></p><p id="Par2445"><bold>Grants:</bold></p><p id="Par2446"><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec655"><title>EP10.080 A Homozygous Variant in CHMP3 is Associated with Complex Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia</title><sec id="Sec656"><title><bold>Nada Danial Farran</bold><sup>1</sup>, Eran Cohen<sup>2;3</sup>, Fadia Zagairy<sup>2</sup>, Ido Livneh<sup>3</sup>, Bannan Mwassi<sup>1;2;3</sup>, Maisa Hresh<sup>2</sup>, Elana Chervinsky<sup>1</sup>, Ula Alaimi<sup>1</sup>, Morad Khayat<sup>1</sup>, Nina Ehilevitch<sup>4</sup>, Karin Weiss<sup>4</sup>, Stavit A.

Segregation analysis confirmed a homozygous state among five affected individuals of a kindred family. Primary patient’s fibroblasts showed significantly reduced levels of VPS24 protein through immunoblot. Electron microscopy disclosed accumulation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes in patient’s fibroblasts, which correlated with higher levels of autophagy markers, p62 and LC-II.

The disease severity is mainly influenced by the copy number of <italic>SMN2</italic>, a nearly identical gene, which produces only low amounts of full-length (FL) mRNA. Here we describe the first example of retrotransposon insertion as a pathogenic <italic>SMN1</italic> mutational event.

The incidence of KS is about 1/32,000 of live births. The clinical features of this syndrome are highly variable, making the diagnosis of Kabuki-like phenotypes difficult and that are often mistaken for other diagnostic problems.

However, direct non-medical and indirect costs were valued at 399,924 USD, exceeding direct medical costs. Decreased life expectancy, lost work capacity, need for special education, caregiver time cost, and other factors have a more significant economic burden than medical care. Given the scale of the economic and societal impact, not enough studies have so far researched the overall burden of congenital anomalies. More research should be focused on prevention possibilities to reduce this impact. It is known that many congenital anomalies are linked to genetic causes.

Pathogenic variants in COL12A1 cause a rare form of congenital connective tissue/myopathy overlap syndrome subsumed under the classification of “myopathic Ehlers‐Danlos syndrome (EDS)”. The aim of the present study was to identify the genetic cause of complex phenotype in a pedigree affected by ARS.</p><p id="Par2731"><bold>Methods:</bold> A Bulgarian family presented with an autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern for ARS that affected mother and the two children was recruited.

It largely consists of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), which mediate binding to PP1. The C-terminus of PPP1R7, which functions as an LRR-cap, is needed to maintain physiological levels of PPP1R7.</p><p id="Par2753"><bold>Methods:</bold> SNP array, WES trio analysis on peripheral blood gDNA and mRNASeq from muscle biopsy has been performed. Immunoblot and mitotic-progression analyses were performed on fibroblasts from the patient and matched controls.</p><p id="Par2754"><bold>Results:</bold> The patient is an eight-years old girl with developmental delay and hypotonia. She is carrier of a partial isodisomy of chromosome 13 (no pathological mutations have been identified in this region) and a heterozygous de novo p.Trp302* variant in the PPP1R7 gene, predicted to encode a C-terminally nicked variant of PPP1R7. Further studies on the patient’s fibroblast revealed that this mutation is associated with a 76% drop in the PPP1R7 protein level. The concentration of PP1 was also decreased by some 45%. However, these fibroblasts did not accumulate measurable DNA damage or mitotic defects.</p><p id="Par2755"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> A heterozygous mutation in PPP1R7 results in the expression of a protein with a nicked C-terminus and is associated with a decreased global level of both PPP1R7 and PP1 proteins.

They are characterised by shared clinical features, affecting growth, development and metabolism [1]. Beckwith-Wiedemann (BWS; MIM #130650) and Silver Russel (SRS; MIM #18860) syndromes are ones of the most frequent and well known IDs. They are usually presenting as respectively overgrowth and growth retardation diseases. Here we present a patient with very suggestive clinical presentation of BWS, who thanks to imprinting disorders’ multilocus screening strategy, was surprisingly diagnosed as SRS.</p><p id="Par2797"><bold>Methods:</bold> Clinical study and methylation-specific multiplex-ligation-dependent probe amplification assay (MS-MLPA) using screening for more than 5 imprinting loci at the same time, were performed in a 2 months Tunisian boy displaying suggestive Beckwith-Wiedemann clinical features.</p><p id="Par2798"><bold>Results:</bold> Our patient presented macroglossia, umbilical hernia and facial dysmorphism, fulfilling two major and one minor criteria of BWS [2]. MS-MLPA analysis showed no (epi)genetic defects at the 11p15 locus (GF2/H19 and CDKN1C/KCNQ1OT1). However, it revealed a loss of methylation in the chromosome 7p12.1 involving <italic>GRB10</italic>.</p><p id="Par2799"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In our Patient, loss of methylation of <italic>GRB10</italic> gene known as a defect related to SRS, is miming a BWS. In fact, besides sharing clinical characteristics, ID can also show overlapping molecular alterations. An imprinting disorders’ multilocus screening strategy is strongly required for molecular diagnosis.</p><p id="Par2800"><bold>References:</bold> 1: Congenital imprinting disorders; Eggermann et al.

She was born at 37 weeks gestation to a 25-year-old G2P2 mother. There was no parental consanguinity. The birth weight was &lt;3th percentile. She was admitted to neonatal intensive care unit due to respiratory distress and malnutrition. The body weight, height, head circumference were &lt;3th percentile at the time of her most recent assessment. Her development was globally delayed. She had dysmorphic features including a broad forehead, frontal bossing, microcephaly, hypotonic facial appearance, sparse scalp hair, periorbital fullness, broad nasal root, malar hypoplasia, low set small dysplastic ‘satyr’ ears, open mouth posture. No organ anomaly was detected. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral subarachnoid enlargement in the frontal area. Echocardiography examination showed an atrial septal defect. Lumbar lordosis and scoliosis were skeletal features.</p><p id="Par2806"><bold>Results:</bold> The karyotype and Array CGH analysis were reported as normal.

Though a clinical scoring system has been consented recently, the clinical diagnosis remains a challenge due to the non-specifity of the major clinical features. The clinical heterogeneity is mirrored by the molecular heterogeneity of SRS: Molecular alterations of at least three genomically imprinted regions (##11p15, 7q32, 14q32) are associated with a SRS phenotype, but additionally imprinted and non-imprinted loci have been suggested as SRS (candidate) region as well (e.g. #1q12, 8q12, 16).</p><p id="Par2851"><bold>Methods:</bold> More than 1100 patients had been referred for SRS testing, they were all analysed by multilocus methylation assays to identify clinically relevant alterations at imprinted loci.

We report a case of FEVR with hearing loss and mental developmental delays, associated with a biallelic FZD4 mutation. Previous cases have not reported hearing loss and developmental delay.</p><p id="Par2858"><bold>Methods:</bold> Case report. History, ocular examination, fluorescein angiography (IVFA), cell-based signalling assays, and genetic testing with interpretation were performed in the setting of patient care.</p><p id="Par2859"><bold>Results:</bold> By 4 months old, the patient had stage 5 FEVR bilaterally. Sensorineural hearing problems were first noted at 2 years. The patient had developmental delays in walking and language, and wears hearing aids. IVFA of the parents revealed stage 1 and stage 2 FEVR. Genetic testing revealed two heterozygous variants in the FZD4 gene in the patient. Segregation in each parent confirmed on allele in each. Signalling assays revealed that biallelic mutations have significantly worse signalling activity when compared to the heterozygous mutations.</p><p id="Par2860"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We present the first report of syndromic FEVR due to a biallelic FZD4 mutation with hearing deficit, developmental delays, and more severe retinal phenotype.</p><p id="Par2861">The signalling assays showed the biallelic mutation had a compounded effect of the heterozygous mutations, which corroborates the clinical phenotypes seen in the patient and parents.

CMA on biopsies from dark and light skin, however, indicated mosaicism for an apparent partial 3q duplication. A subsequent karyotype was normal. However, FISH on hundreds of cells showed a few to carry an extra structurally abnormal chromosome (ESAC) consisting of two 3q26.1qter segments arranged head-to-head with neocentromere formation. This thus revealed the chromosomal aberration to instead be a partial 3q tetrasomy, with partial loss of the ESAC upon cell incubation. The aberration was found to be maternally derived and no uniparental disomy of chromosome 3 was seen.

It is characterized by the involvement of the <bold>E</bold>piphyses, <bold>V</bold>ertebrae, <bold>E</bold>ars and <bold>N</bold>ose, <bold>PLUS</bold> associated findings. So far, five individuals presenting with EVEN-PLUS and biallelic variants in <italic>HSPA9</italic> have been published, showing a very distinctive craniofacial phenotype with extremely underdeveloped nose and narrow and triangular nares. We describe two additional siblings showing the distinctive radiological findings of EVEN-PLUS, but milder facial features. We report biallelic variants in <italic>HSPA9</italic> in these individuals, and in the original EVE-dysplasia family. In addition, we review the clinical features of these cases and those described in the literature to refine the phenotype of this disorder, and provide in silico 3D modelling data to support the pathogenicity of the unreported variants.</p><p id="Par2930"><bold>Methods:</bold> WES (TruSeq Exome Kit, Illumina), Sanger sequencing, SWISS-MODEL software, Chymera Software.</p><p id="Par2931"><bold>Results:</bold> Compound heterozygous variants p.Ile124Thr and p.Arg126Trp were identified in both siblings, and a homozygous p.Thr362Ile variant was found in the original EVE-dysplasia family.

Their clinical identification is important since CCR carriers can display various phenotypes. We report the CCR involving chromosomes 5 and 6 which is characterized using a combination of aCGH, G-banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).</p><p id="Par2937"><bold>Methods:</bold> Two-year-old boy was referred because of aortic coarctation, perimembranous VSD, nasolacrimal duct narrowing and facial dysmorphia. Molecular karyotyping on proband and his parents was performed on the SurePrint G3 Human CGH 8x60k microarray (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). In order to precisely determine the breakpoints involved in the paracentric inversion, conventional karyotyping and FISH analysis were performed.</p><p id="Par2938"><bold>Results:</bold> aCGH revealed an 8,35 Mb deletion at the 5p14.1p13.2 region (5:27788557_36143306, hg19) containing 25 OMIM genes. In addition, an interstitial deletion of 1.9 Mb at the chromosomal region 5p12p11 (5:44208999_46114984, hg19), and terminal deletion of 3.49 Mb at chromosomal region 6q27 (6:165030335_168524228, hg19) were detected.

Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) are a group of metabolic disorders caused by mutations in genes necessary for the addition of oligosaccharides to certain proteins or lipids. Congenital disorder of glycosylation type Im (DOLK-CDG) is a rare autosomal recessive CDG caused by mutations in DOLK gene that lead to a variable clinical spectrum.</p><p id="Par2961"><bold>Methods:</bold> We present the case of an 8 months old girl with facial dysmorphism, inverted nipples, hepatosplenomegaly, important axial hypotonia, dilation of bilateral ventricles, failure to thrive and convulsions. Because our patient presented a particular combination of clinical features, a metabolic disease was suspected, with possible additional genomic imbalances. Therefore, genetic testing using WES-CNV and subsequent aCGH was performed for the proband.

Although each RASopathy has a unique phenotype, secondary to the common underlying pathway dysregulation, they exhibit numerous overlapping phenotypic features, such as dysmorphic facial features, cardiac malformations, cutaneous and ocular abnormalities, neurocognitive impairment, lymphatic anomalies and an increased tumour risk. A recurrent gain-of-function variant in the <italic>ARAF</italic> gene, member of the Ras/MAPK pathway, has been associated with lymphatic anomalies. MEK inhibition treatment has been proved to resolve the lymphatic phenotype associated with this recurrent somatic variant and to ameliorate severe lymphatic complications refractory to any other treatments in patients affected by a RASopathy.

Emerging data have implicated that the expression and function of hepatic bile acid uptake transporter NTCP (sodium-taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide) are altered in hepatocellular carcinoma. NTCP, encoded by the SLC10A1 gene (solute carrier family 10 member 1), is a key transport protein involved in the enterohepatic recirculation of bile acids. We aimed to systematically analyze SLC10A1 expression and its prognostic role in HCC using various open databases.</p><p id="Par3210"><bold>Methods:</bold> SLC10A1 expression in HCC was assessed using UALCAN and GEPIA database.

However, only a small fraction are high penetrant mutations occurring in DNA mismatch repair, causing Lynch Syndrome. Most of the mutations are low-penetrant variants, contributing to an increased risk of familial colorectal cancer, and often in additional genes and pathways. Aim of this study was to identify such variants.</p><p id="Par3227"><bold>Methods:</bold> Whole exome sequencing was performed on constitutional DNA extracted from blood of 48 patients with suspected familial colorectal cancer. Variant calling was performed to detect single nucleotide, small insertion/deletion and copy number variants. In silico prediction tools and available literature-based evidence were used to investigate for disease association of detected variants.</p><p id="Par3228"><bold>Results:</bold> This study identifies several causative germline variants in genes known for their association with colorectal cancer. Additionally, several variants have been identified in additional genes normally not included in relevant gene panels for colorectal cancer that potentially may be associated with an increased risk for cancer.</p><p id="Par3229"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Identification of variants in atypical genes that potentially can be associated with familial colorectal cancer indicates a larger genetic spectrum of this disease, not limited only to mismatch repair genes. Whole exome sequencing provides the possibility to explore this larger spectrum. Usage of multiple in silico tools based on different methods and combined through a consensus approach increases the sensitivity of predictions and narrows down a large list of variants to the most significant ones.</p><p id="Par3230"><bold>References:</bold></p><p id="Par3231"><bold>Grants:</bold> Cancer Institute NSW (Grant-number:12/ECF/2-34); Liaison committee between Helse Midt-Norge RHF and NTNU.</p><p id="Par3232"><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec870"><title>EP13.008 STK11 deletion breakpoints characterization by Nanopore long read sequencing with CRISPR/Cas9 or adaptive sampling enrichment</title><sec id="Sec871"><title><bold>Albain Chansavang</bold><sup>1;2</sup>, Abderaouf Hamza<sup>3</sup>, Sébastien Jacques<sup>2</sup>, Ingrid Laurendeau<sup>2</sup>, Aurélie Toussaint<sup>1</sup>, Véronique Duchossoy<sup>1</sup>, Virginie Benoit<sup>1</sup>, Patrick Nitschké<sup>4</sup>, Frédéric Tores<sup>4</sup>, Pierre Laurent-Puig<sup>5</sup>, Solenne Farelly<sup>6</sup>, Camille Tlemsani<sup>2</sup>, Audrey Briand-Suleau<sup>1;2</sup>, Franck Letourneur<sup>2</sup>, Marion Dhooge<sup>6</sup>, Ivan Bieche<sup>2</sup>, Julien Masliah-Planchon<sup>3</sup>, Eric Pasmant<sup>1;2</sup>, Nadim Hamzaoui<sup>1;2</sup></title><sec id="FPar429"><title><sup>1</sup>Hôpital Cochin, APHP.Centre Université de Paris, Fédération de génétique et médecine génomique, Département de médecine génomique des tumeurs et cancers, Paris, France; <sup>2</sup>Institut Cochin, Inserm U1016, CNRS UMR8104, Université de Paris, CARPEM, Paris, France; <sup>3</sup>Institut Curie, Unité de génétique somatique, Service de génétique, Paris, France; <sup>4</sup>Institut Imagine, Paris, France; <sup>5</sup>Hôpital Européen Georges-Pompidou, AP-HP, Université Paris Descartes, Paris, France, Service de Biochimie, Pharmacologie et Biologie Moléculaire, Paris, France; <sup>6</sup>Hôpital Cochin, APHP.Centre Université de Paris, Service de Gastroentérologie et Endoscopie, Paris, France</title><p id="Par3233"><bold>Background/Objectives:</bold> Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (MIM 175200) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by pathogenic variants in the STK11 gene.

Inclusion criteria: personal/family history of at least 2 cancer events among cutaneous/uveal melanoma, pancreatic cancer (PC), kidney cancer, mesothelioma.

The effect of FAM13A knockdown on cell proliferation (MTS assay, cell tracking VPD450 dye), cell cycle (BrdU assay), migration (wound healing assay), invasion (Boyden chamber assay), apoptosis (APC, 7AAD assays) and cytoskeleton phenotype (F-actin staining) was examined under the conditions of hypoxia (1% O2) and normoxia (21% O2).</p><p id="Par3289"><bold>Results:</bold> Significant reduction in cell proliferation after FAM13A knockdown was observed after hypoxia for both cell lines. The S phase cell cycle arrest in FAM13A depleted A549 cells under hypoxia condition was indicated. The FAM13A inhibition significantly suppressed migration of A549 and CORL-105 cells in both oxygen concentrations.

In routine diagnostics, a combination of methods is used to decipher different types of genetic variants, i.e. single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions/deletions (indels), structural variants (SVs) and copy number variations (CNVs).</p><p id="Par3304"><bold>Methods:</bold> We used a bioinformatic approach to analyze clonal evolution and genetic architecture in patients with myeloid neoplasia based on SNVs, indels, SVs and CNVs. Eight patients were comprehensively analyzed using karyotyping, fluorescence in-situ-hybridization, array-CGH and a custom NGS panel.</p><p id="Par3305"><bold>Results:</bold> Clonal evolution was reconstructed manually, integrating all mutational information (SNVs/indels/SVs/CNVs). Altogether, we differentiate between three cases: 1) The CNV occurred prior to the SNV/indel, but in the same cells. 2) The SNV/indel occurred prior to the CNV, but in the same cells. 3) SNV/indel and CNV exist in parallel, independent of each other.

However, the proportion of patients responding to treatment is not high. There are other ICs in addition to ICs blocked, whose expression in the tumor may be one of the reasons for the low efficiency of PD-L1/PD-1 blockade. The aim was to study the correlation of IC gene expressions and their connection with GC development.</p><p id="Par3517"><bold>Methods:</bold> The paired samples of the gastric tumor and morphologically normal tissue were studied. Two groups were distinguished: non-metastatic and metastatic GC. The expression level of mRNA was measured by RT-PCR.</p><p id="Par3518"><bold>Results:</bold> The expression profiles of the <italic>PD-L1, IDO1, CEACAM1, PVR, TDO2, CD276, GAL9, ADAM17</italic> genes were studied.

Universal testing for founder BRCA1/BRCA2 variants, found in 2.5% of Ashkenazi Jews (AJ), fulfills WHO criteria for disease screening. We analyzed the cost-effectiveness of BRCA1/BRCA2 population screening (PS) in AJ, as an alternative strategy to two existing strategies for identifying unaffected carriers: international family history (IFH)-based guidelines (corresponding to &gt;10% carrier probability) and cascade testing (CT) (≥25% carrier probability, according to familial variant).</p><p id="Par3551"><bold>Methods:</bold> A decision analytic model was performed to estimate screening and treatment costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for PS vs. IFH-based testing and CT in Israel.

The progression of the malignancy is followed by proliferation of precancerous lesions, called polyps. There are two distinct pathways, achieving the attraction for researchers. First, the conventional adenoma-carcinoma pathway, which involves in progression of non-advanced tubular adenomas to larger in size or villous lesions with the potential of developing invasive carcinoma. Second, the serrated pathway which is thought to be originated from distinct traditional or sessile serrated polyps that estimated high-risk to become malignant. Non-coding RNAs participate in the gene expression regulation, demonstrate the effective role in previously described pathways. Different profiles of noncoding expression were observed between the precancerous lesions.</p><p id="Par3591"><bold>Methods:</bold> Based on scientific literature reviews and bioinformatics analysis, non-coding panels were introduced to distinguish different pre-cancerous lesions.

Preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) has long been accepted as a method to improve survival and lifetime quality of the patients. However, physiologic effects of these therapies largely depend on resistance of cells to radiation, type of CT agents and individual responses. As one of the signaling cascades involved in chemo- or radiation- resistance, the present study focused on several proteins involved in pTEN/mTOR pathway to explore their prognostic significance.</p><p id="Par3614"><bold>Methods:</bold> pTEN, mLST8 and REDD1, were quantified using qRT-PCR method in samples collected from tumor and adjacent healthy tissues. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess expression-survival relation and correlations among all proteins and clinicopathological features were statistically analyzed.</p><p id="Par3615"><bold>Results:</bold> PTEN expression showed strong correlation to tumor response (p:0.003) and lymph node response (p:0.003). Mean survival for high vs. low expression of PTEN profile was 72.82 vs 66.47 months, but not statistically significant. There was a negative correlation between tumor response and REDD1 with a considerable trend toward significance (rs: −0.271; p: 0.079), and it was found to be correlated significantly with metastasis (rs: 0.370; p:0.015).

They can be detected as chromosomal breaks or gaps on metaphase spreads. Currently, replication stress in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) was only studied in S-phase and early stages of mitosis. Cytogenetic mapping of CFs is complicated due to peculiarities of cell cycle regulation, repair and apoptosis conferred by pluripotency. In this study, we performed cytogenetic mapping of aphidicolin-sensitive fragile sites in human iPSC line RCMGi001-A.</p><p id="Par3657"><bold>Methods:</bold> RCMGi001-A cell line was derived by reprogramming of fibroblasts with homozygous CFTR F508del mutation using CytoTune™-iPS 2.0 Sendai Reprogramming Kit. Cells were cultured in Essential 8 medium in presence of aphidicolin for 16-22 hours, arrested with nocodazol, followed by standard metaphase spread preparation. Differential staining was performed using Actinomycin D and DAPI.</p><p id="Par3658"><bold>Results:</bold> Totally 300 breaks induced by replication stress were mapped in the human iPSC line. The most frequently recurring breaks were found at bands on chromosomes 2, 6, 9, 10, and 12 that contain long genes some of which are associated with Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease and a number of enzymes and ion channels expressed in brain cells. The identified breaks only partially coincide with the regions of spontaneous recurrent chromosomal aberrations previously reported in human iPSCs.</p><p id="Par3659"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This research may help to uncover the biomarkers of genetic instability in cultured cells and will help to understand the mechanisms of induction and functional relevance of chromosomal aberrations.

Among RCs, ring chromosome 20 [r(20)] is one of the less understood. Between mosaic patients with r(20) syndrome reported in the literature, females seem to be the more frequent (64%), with a r(20) that maintain intact subtelomeric sequences with no genomic imbalances.

The age of onset of seizures, 8 years-old, is inversely correlated with the degree of mosaicism in blood. Most cases are sporadic, however rare familial cases have also been reported. The phenotype could be related to ring structure, due to a silencing effect to nearby genes (<italic>CHRNA4</italic>, <italic>KCNQ2</italic>) or intrinsic instability with recombination or loss of the ring. The mechanism through which r(20) causes the typical manifestations remains unanswered.

However, phenotypic spectrum of this microdeletion is extremely variable which can be partially explained by the size and location variability of the microdeletion. However, this phenotype variability was also reported in some inherited cases from a parent with a different phenotype.

The guidelines were extensively tested by external groups on a set of 30 variants across a range of non-coding regions, and subject to community feedback.</p><p id="Par4026"><bold>Results:</bold> We provide guidance for when variants in non-coding regions are considered ‘interpretable’, highlight examples of mechanisms through which non-coding region variants can cause disease, detail how candidate regulatory regions should be defined, and outline considerations or adaptations for nine ACMG/AMP rules. Our testers highlighted key barriers to use of the guidelines in a diagnostic setting, including access to epigenetic data, unfamiliarity with functional assays, access to output from in silico prediction tools, and general uncertainty in ‘correctness’ of classified variants. We are developing workshops to up-skill clinical scientists and increase widespread usability of the guidelines.</p><p id="Par4027"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> These recommendations aim to increase the number and range of non-coding region variants that can be interpreted clinically. This will lead to an increase in new diagnosis for rare disease patients and catalyse the discovery of novel disease mechanisms.</p><p id="Par4028"><bold>References:</bold></p><p id="Par4029"><bold>Grants:</bold></p><p id="Par4030"><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> Jamie Ellingford: None declared, Joo Wook Ahn: None declared, Richard Bagnall: None declared, Diana Baralle: None declared, Stephanie Barton: None declared, Christopher Campbell: None declared, Kate Downes: None declared, Sian Ellard: None declared, Celia Duff-Farrier: None declared, David FitzPatrick: None declared, John Greally: None declared, Jodie Ingles: None declared, Neesha Krishnan: None declared, Jenny Lord: None declared, Hilary Martin: None declared, William Newman: None declared, Anne O’Donnell-Luria Paid member of the Scientific Advisory Board of Congenica., Simon Ramsden: None declared, Heidi Rehm: None declared, Ebony Richardson: None declared, Moriel Singer-Berk: None declared, Jenny Taylor: None declared, Maggie Williams: None declared, Jordan Wood: None declared, Caroline Wright: None declared, Steven Harrison: None declared, Nicola Whiffin: None declared.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1082"><title>EP17.006 Quality control of NGS libraries with daisy chains</title><sec id="Sec1083"><title>Carmen Rothmund<sup>1</sup>, Vera Rykalina<sup>2</sup>, Rainer Dr. Nitsche<sup>2</sup>, <bold>Annika Dorn</bold><sup>2</sup></title><sec id="FPar533"><title><sup>1</sup>Roche Diagnostics Deutschland GmbH, Mannheim, Germany; <sup>2</sup>Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany</title><p id="Par4031"><bold>Background/Objectives:</bold> DNA library preparation for next-generation sequencing (NGS) demands for accurate qualification and quantification.

Current variant filtering strategies and interpretation guidelines by the ACMG focus on amino-acid level evidence and filter out non-coding or synonymous variants although they may alter splicing or RNA regulation.</p><p id="Par4039"><bold>Methods:</bold> We implemented an analytical pipeline to assess variants-of-uncertain-significance (VUS) predicted to impact RNA with the aim to decipher their pathogenicity. After selection of pre-filtered variants by an interdisciplinary team, molecular investigations based on fast and cheap techniques were performed on RNA extracted from patients’ blood.</p><p id="Par4040"><bold>Results:</bold> Besides confirmation of predicted impact on splicing, sequence or structure of some selected variants, a number of unexpected effects were observed. For example, a variant in an intronic canonical splicing signal of <italic>DNAH11</italic> predicted to induce in-frame exon skipping and/or partial intronic retention ultimately leads to premature polyadenylation of mRNA. Also, a variant in an intronic cis- regulatory splicing element of <italic>NEB</italic> produced an unexpected broad range of alterations of the sequence, the structure and the balance of alternative isoforms.</p><p id="Par4041"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This RNA-based analytical approach has the ability to clarify a number of DNA-based interpretation of variants by cost-effective functional characterization of their impact at the RNA level in an accessible patients’ tissue (blood).

Maternal cell degradation is the main cause of false-negative NIPT results. In this study, we explore the possibility of using mtDNA as a marker of sample quality.</p><p id="Par4047"><bold>Methods:</bold> The study includes 3089 samples from patients with both normal and pathologic pregnancies subjected to WGS-based NIPT analysis. Samples were transported in Streck Cell-Free DNA BCT blood collection tubes to NIPT laboratory for 1-14 days. MtDNA rate is calculated as the ratio of mtDNA reads to the total read number.</p><p id="Par4048"><bold>Results:</bold> Previously, we showed that fetal fraction size negatively correlates with mtDNA rate, suggesting that mtDNA-enriched samples contain higher levels of maternal DNA thus masking fetal DNA [1]. The mtDNA rate increases during sample transportation, which can be attributed to hemolysis. Moreover, the mean mtDNA rate is about 2 times higher (p &lt; 0.01) in samples transported during a cold season, indicating that these samples are more prone to degradation due to unstable temperature conditions.</p><p id="Par4049"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> According to our data, mtDNA has great potential in routine tracking of NIPT sample quality.

With this study, we aimed to explore the gene-disease association evidence for 38 different genes and significance of large biodatabank for the classification process.</p><p id="Par4055"><bold>Methods:</bold> The ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework for evaluation of gene-disease associations was applied. The assessed genes had no publicly available gene-disease assessment in ClinGen database, and 28 genes had no registered OMIM phenotype. Internal CENTOGENE biodatabank with exome/genome data from previously tested individuals, in addition to data available in the literature or public databases were used for gene classification. According to the framework, definitive, strong, moderate, limited, or no known disease relationship can be reached.</p><p id="Par4056"><bold>Results:</bold> A strong level of evidence has been reached for 26,3% of the genes, moderate for 21,1%, limited for 50,0%, and no known disease relationship for 2,6% of the genes. A higher total number of points has been reached for 57,8% of the genes when using our biodatabank compared with using only externally obtainable data, allowing to increase the final level of classification in 21,1% of the genes.</p><p id="Par4057"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our results demonstrate the importance of careful assessment of gene clinical validity data, along with the use of genetic data repositories.

We aimed to assess if exome sequencing (ES) is suitable as a first-tier-method for CNV detection.</p><p id="Par4106"><bold>Methods:</bold> First, we evaluated diagnostic yield through CNV analysis in an ES cohort comprising 2,151 individuals. Second, we analyzed the recall rate for CMA-detected CNVs in ES for 19 individuals and cross-checked results with whole genome sequencing (WGS) data (triplet analysis). Third, we evaluated the recall rate of 32 clinical relevant alterations (27 CNVs, 5 aneuploidies) detected via CMA in real.</p><p id="Par4107"><bold>Results:</bold> Overall diagnostic yield in our ES cohort was 43.1%, with yield through CNV analysis of 3.1%: 69 clinical relevant CNVs were found. In our triplet analysis, the recall rate for 41 (via WGS data verified) CMA-detected CNVs was 58.5% (24 of 41) regardless of coverage of the corresponding region in ES, and was 100% (24 of 24) with consideration of sufficient coverage in ES.

Considering the low proportion of cases with CNVs as underlying genetic defect and high sensitivity of ES for the detection of CNVs, we suggest ES as a comprehensive first-tier diagnostic test for SNV and CNV analysis in individuals with suspected Mendelian diseases without a tentative diagnosis.</p><p id="Par4109"><bold>References:</bold></p><p id="Par4110"><bold>Grants:</bold></p><p id="Par4111"><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1104"><title>EP17.019 Efficiency of three computer-aided facial phenotyping algorithms (DeepGestalt, GestaltMatcher, D-Score) - comparative diagnostic accuracy study</title><sec id="Sec1105"><title>Alisa MV Reiter<sup>1</sup>, Jean Tori Pantel<sup>1</sup>, Magdalena Danyel<sup>1</sup>, Denise Horn<sup>1</sup>, Claus-Eric Ott<sup>1</sup>, <bold>Martin Atta Mensah</bold><sup>1;2</sup></title><sec id="FPar544"><title><sup>1</sup>Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Institute of Medical Genetics and Human Genetics, Berlin, Germany; <sup>2</sup>Berlin Institute of Health at Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, BIH Biomedical Innovation Academy - BIH Charité Digital Clinician Scientist Program, Berlin, Germany</title><p id="Par4112"><bold>Background/Objectives:</bold> Genetic syndromes often show characteristic facial features. Computer-assisted tools to phenotype patient faces achieve remarkable sensitivities. However, current machine-learning based models lack the class ‘inconspicuous face’.

Only a few studies compare different approaches.</p><p id="Par4113">D-Score is a new tool aiming to distinguish dysmorphic faces from inconspicuous control faces.</p><p id="Par4114"><bold>Methods:</bold> Using 323 images of patients with 17 genetic syndromes and 323 matched inconspicuous control images, we determined the clinical utility of the D-Score, GestaltMatcher, and DeepGestalt algorithms, evaluating sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, number of diagnoses supported, and potential biases such as age, gender, and ethnicity.</p><p id="Par4115"><bold>Results:</bold> Whereas gender and ethnic background had only minor effects on the accuracy, it was higher in younger age groups and for certain syndromes. While D-Score only classifies binarily, DeepGestalt comprises 292 different syndromes and GestaltMatcher 1187 (overlap 276). GestaltMatcher and DeepGestalt showed high top-10-sensitivities (90%, 95%). Syndromes with mild facial dysmorphism were prevalent among false positives (e.g., Angelman: DeepGestalt FPR 84%, GestaltMatcher FPR 92%).

This is especially problematic for promoter variants, which can alter gene expression. Transcription factor binding is often modelled in silico by position-weight matrices (PWMs). These are relatively simple models, and studies have shown that the more advanced transcription factor flexible models (TFFMs) outperform PWMs. TFFMs are based on hidden Markov models and can account for complex positional dependencies as well as variable-length nucleotide patterns.</p><p id="Par4150"><bold>Methods:</bold> Our new web-based application FABIAN-variant uses both PWMs and TFFMs to predict whether or not DNA variants alter transcription factor binding. The application contains 1,224 novel TFFMs and 3,790 classical PWMs for 1,387 different transcription factors. For each transcription factor, the software combines the results of different models for a final prediction. The software is written in C++ for speed.

However, while identification of small variants follows standardized workflows, there is no agreement on methods for detection of Copy Number Variants (CNVs). A plethora of WES-based CNV callers have been developed, each showing good performance towards only a limited range of CNV classes/sizes. As clinical CNVs extend from large rearrangements to single genes, more versatile approaches are needed to be of enhanced diagnostic use.</p><p id="Par4197"><bold>Methods:</bold> MIXER is a machine learning method exploiting the naturally occurring presence of one or two copies of the non-pseudoautosomal X-chromosome WES regions in male and female samples, respectively, to simulate deletion/duplication states.</p><p id="Par4198"><bold>Results:</bold> Compared to popular tools (GATK4 gCNV, ExomeDepth, DECoN, CNVkit, EXCAVATOR2), MIXER showed higher stability, identifying in NA12878 WES sample both synthetic deletions and duplications (0.87 and 0.82 F1-score, respectively) encompassing from 2 to &gt;50 target regions. Evaluated on a collection of WES data (<italic>n</italic> = 251) sequenced by the Epi25 collaborative, MIXER correctly discovered all clinical exonic CNVs previously identified by SNP-arrays.</p><p id="Par4199"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> CNVs are an important source of clinical variation. Providing the WES diagnostic setting with robust and flexible methods is essential, but current tools have biases that prevent their ready use in clinical practice. MIXER, introducing an original machine-learning solution, establishes itself as a way to reduce this gap towards higher accuracy and wider applicability.</p><p id="Par4200"><bold>References:</bold></p><p id="Par4201"><bold>Grants:</bold> This study partly uses WES and SNP-array data generated by Epi25 Collaborative, <ext-link xlink:href="https://epi-25.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://epi-25.org</ext-link>.</p><p id="Par4202"><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1129"><title>EP18.013 Evaluation of TCRγ generation probability using Bayesian statistics</title><sec id="Sec1130"><title><bold>Anastasia Smirnova</bold><sup>1;2</sup>, Ilgar Mamedov<sup>2;3</sup>, Thierry Mora<sup>4</sup>, Aleksandra Walczak<sup>4</sup>, Tatyana Grigoryeva<sup>2</sup>, Yuri Lebedev<sup>2</sup>, Dmitriy Chudakov<sup>1;2;5</sup></title><sec id="FPar556"><title><sup>1</sup>Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, Moscow, Russian Federation; <sup>2</sup>Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Department of Genomics of Adaptive Immunity, Moscow, Russian Federation; <sup>3</sup>Dmitry Rogachev National Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russian Federation; <sup>4</sup>ENS, Université PSL, CNRS, Sorbonne Université, Université de Paris, Laboratoire de Physique de l’Ecole Normale Supérieure, Paris, France; <sup>5</sup>Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University, Department of Molecular Technologies, Moscow, Russian Federation</title><p id="Par4203"><bold>Background/Objectives:</bold> T cell receptors (TCRs) have an essential role in adaptive immunity against tumor cells and viral infections. They are formed during V(D)J recombination, which includes a selection of the genomically encoded segments (V, D, and J for α/γ chains; or V and J for β/δ), their trimming and insertions of random nucleotides on the junctions. Previously, Murugan’s group described this process with Bayesian methods and suggested the models to estimate the probability of recombination event distribution for TCRβ and TCRα [1]. In this study, we present the first computational model for TCRγ with proven robustness and reliability.</p><p id="Par4204"><bold>Methods:</bold> As a DNA source, we used PMBC samples obtained from healthy donors and enriched with TCRγ sequences using multiplex PCR.

Many gene-based methods have been proposed recently. Since their power depends on the underlying genetic architecture, which is rarely known, it is likely that a combination of such methods could serve as a universal approach. Several frameworks have been developed combining different gene-based methods. We extended their opportunities in the new sumSTAAR framework.</p><p id="Par4223"><bold>Methods:</bold> We included in the framework two additional methods based on the principal component analysis (PCA) and the functional linear model analysis (FLM). We also included the polygene pruning procedure to guard against the influence of the strong GWAS signals outside the gene. This procedure excludes some variants within the gene being in LD with outside GWAS-identified variants from gene-based analysis.</p><p id="Par4224"><bold>Results:</bold> We used summary statistics for neuroticism and coronary artery disease obtained from the UK biobank data for gene-based association analysis. We applied three methods (SKAT-O, PCA and ACAT-V) and their combination using the aggregated Cauchy omnibus test. For both traits, the new PCA method showed the best results for many genes. This allowed us to identify several additional genes. We applied the polygene pruning procedure to the genes initially identified by gene-based analysis. About half of the genes lost significance after this procedure, because the association was explained by strong association signals outside the gene.</p><p id="Par4225"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We extended the opportunities of the gene-based association analysis in our sumSTAAR framework, which is a flexible and comprehensive tool for performing state-of-the-art gene-based analyses using GWAS summary statistics.</p><p id="Par4226"><bold>References:</bold></p><p id="Par4227"><bold>Grants:</bold></p><p id="Par4228"><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1135"><title>EP18.016 Comparison of different copy number variations (CNVs) detection tools using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data</title><sec id="Sec1136"><title><bold>María Rodríguez Hidalgo</bold><sup>1</sup>, José I Miranda<sup>2</sup>, Araceli Lara-López<sup>3</sup>, Iraia Reparaz-Bonilla<sup>1</sup>, Cristina Irigoyen<sup>1</sup>, Javier Ruiz-Ederra<sup>3</sup>, Joan Maynou<sup>4;5</sup></title><sec id="FPar559"><title><sup>1</sup>IIS Biodonostia, Sensorial Neurodegeneration Group, San Sebastián, Spain; <sup>2</sup>Universidad Del País Vasco UPV/EHU, Joxe Mari Korta R&amp;D Center, Departamento de Química Orgánica-I, San Sebastián, Spain; <sup>3</sup>Miramoon Pharma, Donostia, Spain; <sup>4</sup>Hospital Sant Joan de Déu and Institut de Recerca Sant Joan de Déu, Genetic and Molecular Medicine-IPER, Barcelona, Spain; <sup>5</sup>ISCII, Center for Biomedical Research Network on Rare Diseases (CIBERER), Barcelona, Spain</title><p id="Par4229"><bold>Background/Objectives:</bold> The identification and characterization of genetic variants is of increasing relevance in genetic medicine. A significant percentage of genome variability is caused by copy number variations (CNVs), which encompass unbalanced rearrangements that increase or decrease DNA content. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has become a widely used method for studying genetic variability, being a viable and sensitive method to detect CNVs of various sizes. Here we present the comparation of seven tools for CNVs detection from WGS data to determine the most suitable for use in genetic diagnosis of Mendelian diseases.</p><p id="Par4230"><bold>Methods:</bold> More than 70 tools have been reviewed, and seven tools (BreakDancer, CNVpytor, Delly, Lumpy, Manta, Pindel and SvAba) have been selected to evaluate their performance in terms of sensitivity and accuracy using 20 samples included in HGSVC2.</p><p id="Par4231"><bold>Results:</bold> Good performances have been obtained in deletion detection with Lumpy being the best performing tool. However, the performance in gain detection was not as good, with the best performing tool being Manta. When differentiating by variant size, higher yields are obtained. In addition, sensitivity and accuracy can be modified to achieve better performance by filtering according to the minimum number of reads supporting each variant and combining the tools.</p><p id="Par4232"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This work has allowed us to identify the best performing tools in different scenarios, as well as strategies for modifying sensitivity and accuracy parameters if necessary.</p><p id="Par4233"><bold>References:</bold></p><p id="Par4234"><bold>Grants:</bold> MRH is supported by a fellowship from Gobierno Vasco, Spain (Pre-2019-1-0325).

This -- often time consuming – ‘translation’ into fastQ files needs a carefully created Sample Sheet, especially if you want to fully automate the secondary analysis. Presuming you also perform different analysis -- perhaps with different index lengths -- in one sequencing run, this automation will get more challenging due to splitting the different analyses into several Sample Sheets.</p><p id="Par4252"><bold>Methods:</bold> It is hardly possible to process multiple Sample Sheets at the same time, if they are facing the data of a single sequencer run, or a limited amount of compute is available. In that case, the automation has to prioritize the Sample Sheets regarding importance in a time saving manner. Also, invalid Sample Sheets or conflicts between all Sample Sheets have to be detected ahead of demultiplexing in order to prevent running into errors during processing, or in further analyses.</p><p id="Par4253"><bold>Results:</bold> The script improves the processing time as well as the monitoring of a single, or multiple sequencing runs and their further processes significantly, independent of the number of their respective Sample Sheets. Additionally, the hands-on time is reduced whereas the data generation is reproducible with ease.</p><p id="Par4254"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> At first, Sample Sheet handling is challenging, but the time that will be saved in the future is worth implementing such a task into the routine.

Several factors, including the AG-dependent 3′ splice site (ss) and interaction with U2AF35, affect the splicing pattern of SNVs at the first nucleotide G of an exon (1,2). Furthermore, recent databases lack information on functional studies for splicing.</p><p id="Par4325"><bold>Methods:</bold> SNVs at the first exon nucleotide of 379 papers were scrutinized individually to ensure that functional studies were included. Our data set included 65 splicing affecting SNVs from the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) that were functionally analyzed in their corresponding paper and 94 neutral SNVs from the dbSNP database considering minor allelic frequency (0.1 ≤ MAF &lt; 0.50). We considered 124 features (3), linear and non-linear models, including Gradient-Boosting, Random-Forest, and Support-Vector-Classifier (SVC).

Despite their clinical benefit, fluoropyrimidines are associated with adverse drug reactions (ADRs), including gastrointestinal, hematological toxicities and hand-foot syndrome. ADRs may limit treatment effectiveness, because they impose modification of treatment schedules and/or their discontinuation. The aim of our study is to detect mutations in the DPYD gene that can be associated with a higher rate of 5-FU toxicity.</p><p id="Par4350"><bold>Methods:</bold> The study included 15 patients with colorectal cancer treated with chemotherapy regimens including 5-FU.

For this reason, it is of clinical interest to identify predictive factors that can influence clozapine response, including genetic liability to schizophrenia. In this study, we investigate whether a polygenic risk score (PRS) for schizophrenia is associated with a specific therapeutic choice in clozapine treatment: the highest dose ever prescribed.</p><p id="Par4457"><bold>Methods:</bold> Two independent multi-ancestry cohorts of individuals with TRS recruited in the UK were used: CLOZUK2 (N = 3133) and CLOZUK3 (N = 909).

Interindividual differences in drug efficacy are associated with polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes, the most important of which is CytochromeP450 (CYP450) family (1). The persistence of depressive symptoms despite the use of at least two different antidepressants in sufficient doses for a sufficient period of time is defined as Treatment-Resistant Depression(TRD) (2).</p><p id="Par4485"><bold>Methods:</bold> It’s aimed to discuss treatment response of 12 TRD patients by pharmacogenetic analyses. All exons and exon-intron boundaries of 13 CYP genes which are associated with drug metabolism were sequenced using NGS method (Illumina Miseq) and analyzed in SOPHIA DDM™ platform. Pathogenicity was determined according to ACMG classification.</p><p id="Par4486"><bold>Results:</bold> In one patient, a pathogenic variant of CYP2D6, c.1333G&gt;A (p.Gly445Arg) and a rare variant of CYP2B6; in another patient, a pathogenic frameshift variation of CYP2C9, c.353_362del (p.Lys118Argfs*9) was detected. Four different benign/likely benign rare variants were detected in three patients, whereas no variations were detected in seven cases.</p><p id="Par4487"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> While pathogenic variants in CYP genes may effect drug response in TRD, it is suggested that besides other drug-metabolizing enzymes, microbiota may have an effect, especially in cases which these mutations are not present (10/12). In order to contribute to the literature on TRD, pharmacogenetic and microbial analyzes of 50 patients will be examined and compared in the continuation of the study.</p><p id="Par4488"><bold>References:</bold> 1) vanSchaik RHN.

Polygenic risk scores (PRS), which are being widely explored in precision medicine, use the results of association studies to predict the genetic component of disease risk by accumulating risk alleles weighted by their effect sizes. However, limited studies have thoroughly investigated best practices for PRS in global populations across different diseases.</p><p id="Par4500"><bold>Methods:</bold> In this study, we utilize data from the Global-Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative (GBMI, <italic>N</italic> = 2.1 million), which consists of individuals from diverse ancestries and across continents, to explore methodological considerations and PRS prediction performance in 9 different biobanks for 14 disease endpoints. Specifically, we constructed PRS using classic P+T and Bayesian (PRS-CS) methods.</p><p id="Par4501"><bold>Results:</bold> We found that the genetic architecture, such as SNP-based heritability and polygenicity, varied greatly among endpoints. For both PRS construction methods, using a European ancestry LD reference panel resulted in comparable or higher prediction accuracy compared to several other non-European based panels; this is largely attributable to European descent populations still comprising the majority of GBMI participants. PRS-CS overall outperformed P+T, especially for endpoints with higher SNP-based heritability. Notably, prediction accuracy is heterogeneous across endpoints, biobanks, and ancestries, especially for asthma which has known variation in disease prevalence across global populations.</p><p id="Par4502"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Overall, we provide lessons for PRS construction, evaluation, and interpretation using the GBMI and highlight the importance of best practices for PRS in the biobank-scale genomics era.</p><p id="Par4503"><bold>References:</bold></p><p id="Par4504"><bold>Grants:</bold></p><p id="Par4505"><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> Ying Wang: None declared, Shinichi Namba S.N. was supported by Takeda Science Foundation, Esteban Lopera-Maya E.L. is funded by the Colciencias fellowship ed.783., Sini Kerminen: None declared, Kristin Tsuo: None declared, Kristi Läll K.L. was supported by the Estonian Research Council grant PUT (PRG687) and by INTERVENE - This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 101016775., Masahiro Kanai: None declared, Wei Zhou W.Z. was supported by the National Human Genome Research Institute of the National Institutes of Health under award number T32HG010464., Kuan-Han Wu: None declared, Marie-Julie Fave: None declared, Laxmi Bhatta L.B. receive support from the K.G.

Besides the dominance of M haplogroup, Non-Agrarian group had higher West Eurasian component (subclades of H, HV, J, T and W) and admixture compared to other groups including agrarian and fishing communities which are less diverse, carrying mostly aboriginal haplogroups (subclades of M, R and U).</p><p id="Par4509"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The presence of both pure and admixed clusters with African and West Eurasian components allows us to infer that Koṅkaṇ was not just a corridor for the earliest waves of migration, but also a place of Pleistocene settlement along the southern coastal route. Higher diversity and occurrence of West Eurasian component in Non-Agrarian group suggests historical back migration and admixture in this group and its absence in other groups hints at autochthonous peopling.</p><p id="Par4510"><bold>References:</bold></p><p id="Par4511"><bold>Grants:</bold> Konkani Adhyayana Peeta, Mangalore University.</p><p id="Par4512">World Konkani Centre, Mangaluru.</p><p id="Par4513"><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1213"><title>EP20.002 Detection of recent positive selection signatures in the cohort of the Lithuanian Chernobyl catastrophe clean-up workers</title><sec id="Sec1214"><title><bold>Gabrielė Žukauskaitė</bold><sup>1</sup>, Ingrida Domarkienė<sup>1</sup>, Aušra Matulevičienė<sup>1</sup>, Evelina Marija Vatėnienė<sup>1</sup>, Justas Arasimavičius<sup>1</sup>, Alina Urnikyte<sup>1</sup>, Svetlana Dauengauer-Kirlienė<sup>1</sup>, Ingrida Pilypienė<sup>2</sup>, Vaidutis Kučinskas<sup>1</sup>, Laima Ambrozaitytė<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="FPar597"><title><sup>1</sup>Vilnius University, Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Department of Human and Medical Genetics, Vilnius, Lithuania; <sup>2</sup>Vilnius University, Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Clinical Medicine, Clinic of Children`s Diseases, Vilnius, Lithuania</title><p id="Par4514"><bold>Background/Objectives:</bold> Ionizing radiation (IR) is one of the factors that is known to affect genomes and, therefore, challenge organisms to adapt and acquire new traits. Lithuanian Chernobyl catastrophe clean-up workers (LCCWs) are an exclusive object of research, because not only they survived extreme conditions, but also adapted to the life-lasting effects of IR. This study focuses on adaptation and the search for the recent positive selection signatures in the genomes of LCCWs.</p><p id="Par4515"><bold>Methods:</bold> Whole-genome sequencing of 15 LCCWs and 15 control individuals (all males) was performed. Control group included men of Lithuanian descent, who were not involved in the clean-up work of Chernobyl catastrophe. To identify genomic regions which may be under recent positive selection analysis was performed using RAiSD tool. It uses μ values as a predictor for the selective sweep signatures. Top 1% of μ values, of which were higher than a median value in a chromosome, was set for further analysis. These values and selective sweep signatures were compared between the two groups.</p><p id="Par4516"><bold>Results:</bold> Eleven genomic regions under recent positive selection have been identified throughout autosomes.

Function and expression of interleukin 10 receptor (IL10R), as a part of the IL10 antiinflammatory pathway, could play important role in the pathogenesis of SLE. Potentially Interleukin 10 receptor subunit A (IL10RA) gene haplotypes could alter signalling through this pathway in SLE patients and affect the course of the disease.

Despite this similarity, murine Actg1 cannot compensate LoF mutations in Actb. When, however, the endogenous Actb alleles are engineered to produce γ- instead of β-actin, the resulting mice are normal, suggesting that nucleotide motifs in Actb rather than the β-actin itself are essential for actin isoform function [PMID 30012594].</p><p id="Par4544"><bold>Methods:</bold> Comparison of the ACTB and ACTG1 genomic variation landscape from public databases; analysis of gene synteny.</p><p id="Par4545"><bold>Results:</bold> A) Population databases demonstrate consistent absence of recurrent synonymous variants in the ACTB locus, whereas the paralogous positions in ACTG1 contain variants with high population frequency, despite identical nucleotide sequence context in both gene isoforms. These striking differences show neither correlation with the conservation score in 100 vertebrate species nor with codon usage. B) Unlike population databases depicting germline variability, number and type of somatic variants were comparable between both loci, indicating that both actin loci have equal mutation acquisition potential, but selective pressure is different for systemic variants.

Thereafter, Haplogroup frequencies were calculated, and the Principal Component (PC) Analysis was performed with R studio.</p><p id="Par4580"><bold>Results:</bold> We observed four distinct clusters related to each geographical region. Sinhalese and SLT/UK were separated along the PC2. Among the two populations, Sinhalese showed a greater affinity to other South Asian populations in the 1000 Genome Database than SLT/UK. Sinhalese were closer to the Bengali than Gujarat and Punjabi populations.</p><p id="Par4581"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Common maternal ancestry of Sinhalese in Sri Lanka and Tamils of Sri Lankan origin in UK appears to be more distant than that of some other South Asian populations. Maternally Sinhalese are closely related to Indian populations than to other populations in the Eastern and the Western world used in the present study.</p><p id="Par4582"><bold>References:</bold> 1.

However, these studies did not explore the impact of recent changes in effective population size or movement on this structure within Britain and Ireland. To address this, we have assembled the largest haplotype sharing dataset for Ireland and Britain with associated regional ancestry and applied innovative methods to improve our understanding of fine-scale population structure and recent demographic change in Britain and Ireland.</p><p id="Par4658"><bold>Methods:</bold> We assembled genotype data from 6,724 individuals. Using patterns of Identity-By-Descent (IBD) segment-sharing, we applied the Leiden community detection algorithm to identify genetic clusters in this dataset. Additionally, we inferred regional effective population sizes across time using IBDNe, and estimated recent migration rates using MAPS to reveal insights into recent demographic history.</p><p id="Par4659"><bold>Results:</bold> We identified fine-scale genetic population structure which stratifies by geography and detected new subgroups in Ireland and South-East England. Using IBD, we provide novel insights into changes in regional effective population sizes over time, with all population clusters showing patterns of recent exponential growth. We have also identified evidence of gene flow barriers through estimated migration surfaces.</p><p id="Par4660"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our findings extend our knowledge of fine-scale population structure across Britain and Ireland and help disentangle the relative effects of population structure and demographic history when examining rare variant-mediated genetic architecture of complex diseases.</p><p id="Par4661"><bold>References:</bold></p><p id="Par4662"><bold>Grants:</bold> Science Foundation Ireland (Grant# 18/CRT/6214).</p><p id="Par4663"><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1255"><title>EP20.031 Genetically determined levels of the human plasma proteome in the UK Biobank and risk of cardio-metabolic diseases: a Mendelian Randomisation study</title><sec id="Sec1256"><title><bold>Lingyan Chen</bold><sup>1</sup>, Thomas Richardson<sup>1</sup>, Matthew Traylor<sup>1</sup>, Sile Hu<sup>1</sup>, Cyrielle Maroteau<sup>1</sup>, Lina Cai<sup>1</sup>, Joanna Howson<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="FPar618"><title><sup>1</sup>Novo Nordisk Research Centre Oxford, Genetics, Oxford, United Kingdom</title><p id="Par4664"><bold>Background/Objectives:</bold> Proteins are the effector molecules of biology and are the target of most drugs.

Assortative marriages became possible with the widespread introduction of sign language, resulting in increased genetic fitness of deaf individuals and, thereby relaxing selection against deafness. However, the effect of this phenomenon was not previously studied in populations with different genetic structure.</p><p id="Par4679"><bold>Methods:</bold> Using an agent-based computer model, we simulated an isolated human population under different modelling scenarios representing various intensity of selection pressure by deafness over 400 years.</p><p id="Par4680"><bold>Results:</bold> Modelling of the “purifying” selection pressure on deafness (“No deaf mating” scenario) resulted in a decrease in the proportion of deaf individuals and the pathogenic allele frequency. Modelling of the “relaxed” selection (“Assortative mating” scenario) resulted in an increase the proportion of deaf individuals which quickly reaches plateau with a sub-sequent decline and a decrease in the pathogenic allele frequency. The modelling of neutral selection pressure (“Random mating” scenario) showed no changes in the proportion of deaf individuals or the pathogenic allele frequency.</p><p id="Par4681"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Initially low genetic fitness of deaf people in an isolated human population can be significantly increased in the presence of assortative mating by deafness, resulting in a higher prevalence of DFNB1A.

The genomic component occupies a significant place in the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of ischemic stroke. It was shown that focal ischemia can lead to metabolic changes not only in the damaged (ipsilateral) hemisphere (IH) but also in the opposite (contralateral) hemisphere (CH) of the brain[1]. However, the genome reactions of CH cells remain not fully understood. Here, we analyzed series of rat brain samples from IH and CH after the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model and corresponding sham-operated samples using genome-wide RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq).</p><p id="Par4686"><bold>Methods:</bold> Wistar rats, tMCAO, magnetic resonance imaging, RNA-Seq, real-time RT-PCR, bioinformatics.</p><p id="Par4687"><bold>Results:</bold> We revealed 164 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with cut-off&gt;1.5 and <italic>p</italic><sub>adj</sub> &lt; 0.05 that were associated with subcortical structures of CH at 24h after tMCAO.

Gene regulation depends on cis-regulatory elements (CREs) which can interact with gene promoter by chromatin loop. Alteration of chromatin architecture and/or CREs can lead to enhanceropathies. Hearing loss is the most common sensory pathology, affecting about 1–2 in 1000 newborns. In industrially countries, congenital deafness has a genetic origin in 80% cases. This deafness can be syndromic or not (associated or not with other pathology or malformation) and represents respectively 10% and 90% of cases. Among this deafness, we found the first type of autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss and deafness (DFNB1). The GJB2 (Gap Junction Beta 2) gene is implicated on DFNB1 and is responsible for more than 30 % according to study population. Several unelucidated nonsyndromic hearing loss and deafness 1 (DFNB1) cases are monoallelic, led to strongly suggest the presence of distant cis-regulation.</p><p id="Par4719">Thanks to chromatin conformation capture carbon copy (5C) study, we previously identified the first GJB2 CREs, with enhancer and silencer effect on GJB2 expression.

Sequence analysis showed that the LINC00493/SMIM26 gene is evolutionarily conserved among mammals at both the RNA and protein levels. It has been established that LINC00493 is expressed at a high level in most tissues and is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. Knockdown of LINC00493/SMIM26 demonstrated an effect on cell viability depending on the cell type. On the other hand, wound-healing assay revealed that LINC00493 knockdown did not affect cell migration.

Numerous studies have shown that circadian clock disruption is directly linked to disease trigger and outcomes. Diet modifications and resultant epigenetic changes are among the causes of circadian clock disruption<sup>1</sup>. This study aims to elucidate the potential links between diet, circadian clock disruption and oral cancer.</p><p id="Par4798"><bold>Methods:</bold> Mice for this pilot study were separated randomly in two groups (<italic>n</italic> = 12). One group was fed with Normal Diet (ND) and the other group was fed with Western Diet (WD). Both groups were kept in a circadian cabinet to continuously monitor circadian physiology traits. At week 20, mice were sacrificed at 4 time-points with 6h intervals, and oral tissues were collected for DNA/RNA and protein expression. Saliva was collected for metabolomics.</p><p id="Par4799"><bold>Results:</bold> The expression of clock genes in two different time points significantly decreased in the WD group compared to the ND group. Circadian cabinets measurements indicate significant activity reduction in WD group compared to ND group.</p><p id="Par4800"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This data suggests that WD results in significant changes in circadian clock genes expression in oral epithelium. Additional studies are needed to characterize the precise molecular changes and potential epigenetic modifications involved.

This project aims to identify and functionally characterize cis-regulatory elements (CREs) controlling <italic>ABCA4</italic> expression, the gene affected in the most common form of the disease, both in adult human retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE).</p><p id="Par4805"><bold>Methods:</bold> Regulatory elements that are active in human retina and RPE were located by means of ChIPseq and ATACseq experiments. Subsequently, we used the HiChIP technique, which allows to determine 3D chromatin structure, to identify the target genes of these CREs in each tissue. Finally, we tested these enhancers in transgenesis assays in zebrafish, and compared the expression driven by them with the zebrafish endogenous <italic>ABCA4</italic> expression, determined by in situ hybridization.</p><p id="Par4806"><bold>Results:</bold> We found that the regulatory landscape of <italic>ABCA4</italic> gene encompasses 400 kb in which we could identify several active enhancers, some of them specific for retina or RPE.

It is caused by mutations in the CLCN5 gene, which encodes the voltage-gated ClC-5 chloride/proton antiporter. Currently, the treatment of DD1 is only supportive and focused in delaying the progression of the disease. Our group has generated a Clcn5 knock-in (KI) mouse carrying the pathogenic mutation p.V523del, that presents the main clinical manifestations of DD1.We aimed to assess the ability of two small chemical chaperones, sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) and tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), to ameliorate those symptoms in our DD1 mouse model.</p><p id="Par4812"><bold>Methods:</bold> Twelve-weeks old male mice, Clcn5-KI and controls, were selected for treatments. Mice selected for 4-PBA treatment received 250 mg/kg/day in drinking water for 31 days, whereas mice selected for TUDCA treatment received 250 mg/kg/day IP in saline solution for 20 days. Urinary ß2-microglobulin and serum and urinary creatinine were measured by ELISA.

The name also echoes the diagnostic odyssey experienced by so many patients with developmental anomalies. ITHACA is a coordinated network of more than 70 clinical genetics department across EU academic hospitals.</p><p id="Par4854"><bold>Methods:</bold> This ERN brings together experts in rare multiple congenital anomalies and rare neurodevelopmental disorders, the latter field mainly covering intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. ITHACA’s field of expertise covers the clinical and biological/genetic diagnosis of these developmental anomalies, the coordination of their multidisciplinary treatment, and also their prenatal diagnosis and fetal pathology. A very large number of children and adults are affected by rare developmental anomalies: Congenital malformations affect one in 40 babies. Many malformations occur together as part of complex ‘syndromes’ that often show also NDD. Over 5 000 rare syndromes have been described.</p><p id="Par4855"><bold>Results:</bold> ERN-ITHACA networks patient representatives and medical experts with the aim to develop best practices and coordinate guidelines production, to provide a collaborative support for clinical research and to generally improve early diagnosis, care and cure of patients with rare developmental anomalies.</p><p id="Par4856"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> ITHACA has established the patient registry ILIAD dedicated to disorders falling under its scope of expertise. It also encourages the development of telemedicine and tele-expertise to allow collegial discussion of complex situations between referring doctors and RD experts who are scattered in the EU. ITHACA will produce advanced training and e-learning tools dedicated to health professionals, lay persons and Patients Advocacy Groups.</p><p id="Par4857"><bold>References:</bold></p><p id="Par4858"><bold>Grants:</bold> 3rd Health Programme, grant nr 869189 ERN-ITHACA..</p><p id="Par4859"><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1312"><title>EP23.010 Educational Programme on Genetics, Lifestyle Behaviours and Cancer Prevention: A Multidisciplinary Consensus Study</title><sec id="Sec1313"><title><bold>Celia Díez de los Ríos de la Serna</bold><sup>1</sup>, Paz Fernandez-Ortega<sup>2</sup>, Teresa Lluch-Canut<sup>3</sup></title><sec id="FPar645"><title><sup>1</sup>PhD Candidate.

In round 1, experts assessed the relevance of topics found on the systematic review and suggested additional terms. The following rounds aimed to bring consensus on the important topics by including or excluding those topics that reached 75% of consensus. Ethics approved by University committee.</p><p id="Par4862"><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 72 experts (nurses, physicians, psychologist, geneticist, genetic counsellors…) from all around the world participated.

Family history-based guidelines miss a significant number of BRCA gene carriers amongst breast and ovarian cancer patients. Until recently cancer patients required a referral to Clinical Genetics for counselling and to assess eligibility for testing.</p><p id="Par4868">The identification of high-risk gene carriers informs cancer treatment and provides options for risk reduction and surveillance for patients and their families. The MCGT programme has streamlined genetic testing for ovarian and breast cancer patients, increasing access to genetic testing and providing quicker results.</p><p id="Par4869"><bold>Methods:</bold> The MCGT programme included a gap analysis of current service provision, the development of new test pathways and patient resources including an online decision aid (Breast Cancer choices), training and education programmes for cancer clinicians and an evaluation of the new service.</p><p id="Par4870"><bold>Results:</bold> Over 300 patients have been tested in the MCGT programme with a detection rate of BRCA1/2 or PALB2 variants of 11%. Test result timeframes have halved, and clinicians are using results to direct cancer treatment. To date 66 cancer clinicians have attended the online mainstream training programme. Updated data will be presented.</p><p id="Par4871"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The MCGT programme has resulted in rapid and equitable genetic testing for patients by an educated and motivated workforce.

With the increase in knowledge gained regarding genetic diseases and respective one of testing possibilities, the demand for such a specialized service naturally rises. However, the number of specialists to provide it is not of reciprocal growth.</p><p id="Par4887"><bold>Methods:</bold> We have performed a retrospective analysis of genetic specialized services, provided for two periods—2012–2016 and 2017–2021, in the Laboratory of Medical genetics, UMHAT St. Marina in Varna, Bulgaria. We stratified these services into several sections with the main ones being reproductive, pediatric, neuro- and oncogenetics. Noteworthy, during the first period there were 2 genetic specialists versus 4 specialists for half of the second period and 2 - later on.</p><p id="Par4888"><bold>Results:</bold> There was an overall increase of 29% in consultations provided for the second period compared to the first one. Steadily, laboratory testing performed onsite increased with 17% (fully or partially conducted by medical geneticists performing counseling). Distribution of indications showed an 89.6% increase in consultations regarding oncogenetics, 42.7%—for reproductive, 14.7%—for pediatric genetics, and 25.5%—for paternity testing.</p><p id="Par4889"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Genetic counseling is extremely heterogenous in means of indications. While this suggests a need for progressive subspecialization, countries with still-developing economics cannot yet afford such staff distribution. Thus, future practice of genetic specialists will be defined by the prioritization by national healthcare and higher education systems. Currently, it is a matter of delicate balance between number of fellows and demand for counseling and analyses.</p><p id="Par4890"><bold>References:</bold></p><p id="Par4891"><bold>Grants:</bold> None received.</p><p id="Par4892"><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1320"><title>EP23.014 Teaching medical genetics during the pandemic</title><sec id="Sec1321"><title>Rodica Mirela Dragotoiu<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="FPar649"><title><sup>1</sup>Carol Davila Medical and Pharmacy University, Bucuresti, Romania</title><p id="Par4893"><bold>Background/Objectives:</bold> In the pandemic years I approached my students using asynchronous remote teaching.

While portal-facilitated sharing might have significant scientific value, it is also likely to raise difficult legal and ethical questions. Many of these questions were highlighted during the Covid–19 pandemic, as the urgency of efficient data sharing became apparent. Responding to these emerging concerns, regulators around the world have implemented regimes for ‘software used as a medical device.’ It is unclear how these regimes affect online portals for genetic data sharing. This study addresses how online data sharing may be shaped by new forms of regulatory oversight.</p><p id="Par4910"><bold>Methods:</bold> We performed an international comparative analysis of advisory documents applicable to software as medical devices prepared by medical regulators in Canada, the United States, France, and the United Kingdom. We selected 20 documents for review.</p><p id="Par4911"><bold>Results:</bold> We found that regulatory agencies are likely to regulate online tools as medical devices only when they are intended to perform a medical purpose. Online portals for genetic data sharing will not usually meet this threshold. Nevertheless, regulatory guidance provides significant insight into the kinds of issues to which regulators are likely to be attentive in addressing online data sharing. We identify eight normative and logistical issues: efficiency, equity, transparency, confidentiality, communication, empowerment, training, and safety.</p><p id="Par4912"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This review clarifies how the regulation of medical software might apply to portals for genetic data sharing.

An increasing number of high-priced orphan drugs are being approved every year. To ensure fair and equitable access to these drugs, it is urgent to find a fair and sustainable reimbursement system. Some scholars have argued that, in publicly-funded healthcare systems, the public should be involved in this process. This study’s aim is to compare public debates in newspapers around orphan drug reimbursement from Germany, German-speaking Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.</p><p id="Par4917"><bold>Methods:</bold> Articles from six newspapers about orphan drug reimbursement and published between 2000-2020 were analysed quantitatively and qualitatively.</p><p id="Par4918"><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 239 newspaper articles were identified. Coverage increased importantly since 2014. An increasing number of articles took the perspective of individual patients by presenting patient stories and calls for crowdfunding. Other articles took a broader public health perspective; they tended to frequently cite companies (health insurance, pharmaceutical) and to cover issues about pricing and country-specific reimbursement policies.</p><p id="Par4919"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The growing importance of personalised stories emotionalises the public debate on orphan drug reimbursement. It bears justice issues if rare disease patients have to rely on crowdfunding campaigns to get treatment.

Gene selection for RGCS must be undertaken using a transparent and robust process that incorporates a variety of perspectives, including those who live with the condition and their families. Focusing on conditions with a significant impact enables consideration of how severity can be used as a criterion in RGCS to facilitate robustly informed reproductive decisions. Screening for milder or highly variable conditions adds complexity to decision-making. Reproductive decisions based on carrier screening results should be made with access to psychosocial support and high quality information about the condition.</p><p id="Par4933"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Severity is an important criterion for RGCS.

Prior studies have indicated that rare diseases generate more complex ethical and social issues than common diseases and thus require more sensitive consideration of risk and privacy.</p><p id="Par4939"><bold>Methods:</bold> We conducted a semi-structured interview survey with stakeholders of rare disease research (patient organizations, researchers, and companies; <italic>N</italic> = 9) to explore the perceptions and concepts regarding ELSI in Japan, starting in November 2021. The transcripts were coded in MAXQDA and subjected to qualitative analysis.</p><p id="Par4940"><bold>Results:</bold> The qualitative analysis revealed several significant axes of analysis regarding the rare disease challenges for ELSI in Japan. One aspect is that the difficulties created by this rare disease reinforce the ethical challenges of patient engagement. The lack of treatment opportunities and social vulnerabilities are also associated with extreme altruism and a tendency to underestimate the risks of clinical trials. These results suggest that additional rare disease–specific considerations are necessary to address therapeutic misconception, which states that patients tend to expect clinical trials to have a therapeutic effect.</p><p id="Par4941"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Through this research, we identified several aspects of ELSI that should be taken into consideration and that suggest the need to build an ethical ecosystem that supports patients and families.</p><p id="Par4942"><bold>References:</bold> Hartman et al.

This study examines how older generations influence health management in younger ones, in Portuguese families with TTR-FAP or HD. Both are progressive, incurable, late-onset neurological diseases, though some therapeutical measures are already known to slow down TTR-FAP progression.</p><p id="Par4946"><bold>Methods:</bold> This exploratory, qualitative study used the critical incidents technique, in semi-structured interviews with 28 participants (18 TTR-FAP, 10 HD families). Data were analysed thematically.</p><p id="Par4947"><bold>Results:</bold> Findings showed recent disease awareness in HD families, whereas in TTR-FAP families the disease was well known to previous generations. In both cases, older family members played influential roles towards younger generations: through their testimony, providing information and as role models(1,2). In TTR-FAP families, older relatives were active influencers towards pre-symptomatic testing decisions(1). Providing support (emotional/instrumental) stands out in HD families(2).</p><p id="Par4948"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Older family members play relevant roles to help younger relatives dealing with disease-imposed psychosocial challenges. Our results are relevant for provision of psychosocial support to these families, particularly by highlighting key intergenerational exchanges that may improve individuals and families’ psychosocial outcomes.</p><p id="Par4949"><bold>References:</bold> 1 Oliveira, C.R., Mendes, Á., Sousa, L.

To achieve this objective, the health professionals must create a climate of trust that allows the patient to express him/herself freely. The SDM approach allows the patient to learn more about their disease, encourages them to collaborate and helps them to formulate their preferences, including whether or not to undergo genetic testing. We decided to evaluate the SDM in oncogenetics by interviewing patients following their appointment with a genetic counsellor. We aim to understand which strategies are available to optimise and improve decision making in oncogenetic.</p><p id="Par4962"><bold>Methods:</bold> We realised an anonymised questionnaire with 17 questions on decision making, which we proposed to our patients over a 2-month period.</p><p id="Par4963"><bold>Results:</bold> 50 patients agreed to participate in this study which took place in Switzerland. It appears that, in general, decision making is an act that must be reflected upon, but which is not easy from the patient’s point of view. We described the patient’s satisfaction with the help received by the health professionals, the motivations that influence the decision on the process of genetic tests.</p><p id="Par4964"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Although the decision-making approach is ethically appropriate, patients are rarely involved in “decision-making” process as they would like. Its implementation depends primarily on the attitude and skills of the health professional, and on family and cultural factors.</p><p id="Par4965"><bold>References:</bold></p><p id="Par4966"><bold>Grants:</bold></p><p id="Par4967"><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1341"><title>EP24.010 Equity, justice and genomics</title><sec id="Sec1342"><title><bold>Angus Clarke</bold><sup>1</sup>, Carla van El<sup>2</sup></title><sec id="FPar659"><title><sup>1</sup>Cardiff University, Division of Cancer &amp; Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff, United Kingdom; <sup>2</sup>Amsterdam, Department of Clinical Genetics, Section Community Genetics, Amsterdam, Netherlands</title><p id="Par4968"><bold>Background/Objectives:</bold> The development and practical implementation of genomic technologies has the potential to exacerbate pre-existing health inequities and social injustices.

Within these debates, however, the voice of potential future users of HGGE, e.g. patients and carriers of heritable diseases, is barely audible. Although their perspectives as direct stakeholders are very important, it might be difficult to find the right tone to engage them in deliberation. This study therefore aims to ascertain and understand the vulnerabilities and sensitivities concerning HGGE in patients and carriers of heritable diseases, and to explore their perspectives regarding potential applications.</p><p id="Par4984"><bold>Methods:</bold> We included five patients and carriers of heritable diseases via patient organisations, in semi-structured interviews about their thoughts and feelings concerning HGGE. Interviews are ongoing. Whenever relevant, we included mail conversations (<italic>N</italic> = 8) to explore sensitivities in first reactions.</p><p id="Par4985"><bold>Results:</bold> Mail conversations showed that HGGE is a sensitive topic, especially for those who have reproductive problems associated with their heritable condition. Patients revealed that they experienced tension between their feelings of guilt over passing on the condition, and their value of taking responsibility for voicing the patient perspective. If applied to eliminate severe genetic conditions, participants indicated they would prefer HGGE over pre-implantation genetic testing and prenatal diagnosis, because they see HGGE as a less disruptive, more acceptable, and more effective opportunity.</p><p id="Par4986"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Patients and carriers of heritable diseases endorse the approach of an open invitation that is spread by patient organisations, to engage in the deliberation on HGGE that emphasizes that the choice to participate is fully voluntary.</p><p id="Par4987"><bold>References:</bold></p><p id="Par4988"><bold>Grants:</bold></p><p id="Par4989"><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> Jeanne Arnold: None declared, Diewertje Houtman Part-time employment at Erasmus MC, Sam Riedijk Fulltime employment at Erasmus MC, PI in prenatal genetics and social genomics.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1345"><title>EP24.012 Genetic data sharing for research in Europe: consent not only a legal basis under GDPR</title><sec id="Sec1346"><title><bold>Lisa Feriol</bold><sup>1</sup>, Gauthier Chassang<sup>1</sup>, Emmanuelle Rial-Sebbag<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="FPar661"><title><sup>1</sup>CERPOP, Université de Toulouse, Inserm, Université Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France</title><p id="Par4990"><bold>Background/Objectives:</bold> Today, genetic data sharing is presented as necessary to improve health research. Nevertheless, the specificity of this data - due to its high sensitivity - raises questions when considering how to protect data subjects while encouraging sharing.</p><p id="Par4991"><bold>Methods:</bold> There are several legal bases for processing sensitive data - including genetic data – in the GDPR such as explicit consent, public interest in the area of public health and scientific research, which are used differently by Member States. In order to preserve the autonomy of individuals, some national laws use consent for the (re)use of genetic data. However, in practice, the specific requirements for consent in the GDPR are perceived as impairing research activities so that the scientific research exemption is often preferred.</p><p id="Par4992"><bold>Results:</bold> We show that even if consent is not chosen as a legal basis, it should continue to be envisaged as an ethical requirement for expressing clear choices on data reuses, when possible. A more flexible practice of consent would allow both to improve data subjects’ involvement in the reuse of their data and to facilitate accountable practice from the scientific community. In this perspective, we show that the GDPR offers rooms for innovating in consent practices, in line with recognised ethical standards.</p><p id="Par4993"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In a context where trust of individuals in the re-use of their data remains a continuous challenge, reconsidering consent rather than waiving it could reinforce the data subject autonomy and active contribution to research.</p><p id="Par4994"><bold>References:</bold> GDPR.</p><p id="Par4995"><bold>Grants:</bold> CINECA, GA No 825775 - Easi-Genomics, GA No 824110 – GeneInfoKid INCa n°2018-127.</p><p id="Par4996"><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1347"><title>EP24.013 Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis: a person-centred occupational therapy project</title><sec id="Sec1348"><title><bold>Aina Isabel Gayá Barroso</bold><sup>1</sup>, Juan Gonzalez Moreno<sup>2</sup>, Adrián Rodríguez<sup>1</sup>, Eugenia Cisneros-Barroso<sup>1</sup>, Inés Losada López<sup>2</sup></title><sec id="FPar662"><title><sup>1</sup>Fundació Institut d’Investigació Sanitària Illes Balears, Palma de Mallorca, Spain; <sup>2</sup>Hospital Universitario Son Llàtzer, Palma de Mallorca, Spain</title><p id="Par4997"><bold>Background/Objectives:</bold> The aim of this project is to develop a specific Occupational Therapy project for Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis Val50Met (ATTRv) patients.</p><p id="Par4998">To develop an Occupational Therapy project in patients diagnosed with hereditary Val50Met transthyretin amyloidosis.</p><p id="Par4999"><bold>Methods:</bold> An experimental study is carried out to implement a specific Occupational Therapy project in the patients included in the study.

Development of new genomic technologies raises hope for children and their families but also challenges that appropriate consent is delivered. The medical relationship in this regard implies oncologist, geneticist, genetic counsellor and psychologists. Parents, who are the legal guardians and the child, whose rights must be respected under international law (Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989) and national law (Public Health Code), must contribute to the decision to perform a genetic test. Even these rights are reaffirming child’s autonomy, practices on what should be required and how, are varying according to medical centres.</p><p id="Par5013"><bold>Methods:</bold> We conducted an ethical and legal study, aiming at mapping the consent practices in French paediatric oncogenetic units.

In case of couples who had a termination of pregnancy (TOP), these techniques might meet the parent’s need to know. The aim of this qualitative study is to explore experiences of being recontacted for additional diagnostic testing. In addition, why are these couples still opting for genetic testing several years after the termination?.</p><p id="Par5027"><bold>Methods:</bold> This study included parents of a retrospective cohort of 85 foetuses that underwent a TOP for congenital malformations between January 2015 and December 2018 in UZ Brussel. After selection, 31 participants were eligible for recontacting, given that a clinical diagnosis is suspected though a molecular diagnosis remains unclear. After receiving a standardized letter, 14 couples agreed to come to the Genetics department to participate. All interviews were transcribed verbatim, anonymized and coded by thematic analysis of Braun &amp; Clarke (2006).</p><p id="Par5028"><bold>Results:</bold> Despite the years passed since the TOP, these participants were still motivated to perform new genetic testing. Both intrinsic (searching for answers for themselves and their children) and external motivators (contributing to science and helping parents) played an important role as a driver.

For example, several studies have concluded that there exists a link between genetic variation as to monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), involved in neurotransmitter metabolism, and aggressive responding. Alterations in MAO-A genes result in Brunner syndrome which manifests as global cognitive deficits, impulsivity, and mood lability and has been associated with antisocial personality disorder. Recently, the criminal courts worldwide have seen a rise in the use of neuroscientific evidence, particularly with regard to defense of homicide. The MAO-A gene features prominently. This research is an exploration of the legal and ethical issues associated with the use of behavioral genetic evidence at criminal trial.</p><p id="Par5046"><bold>Methods:</bold> Two prominent legal databases, Westlaw and LexisNexis, were searched using search terms MAO-A, MAO, MAOA and monoamine oxidase from 1995 to August 16, 2021.</p><p id="Par5047"><bold>Results:</bold> Thirteen cases were retrieved and categorized by case outcome. Results how that Italian and U.S. courts diverge with respect to the use of genetic evidence in homicide defenses, with the former much more amenable to considering genetic make-up, at least in sentencing.</p><p id="Par5048"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> While some of the differences may relate to the different legal traditions in place, the divergence largely relates to evidentiary procedures. Specifically, Italian courts have exhibited a willingness to incorporate behavioral genetics in sentence reduction on appeal. Conversely, U.S. opponents of the gene-as-a-defense-to-homicide approach cite flawed scientific methodology and the ethics of linking complex behavior to singular genetic defects.</p><p id="Par5049"><bold>References:</bold></p><p id="Par5050"><bold>Grants:</bold></p><p id="Par5051"><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1361"><title>EP25 GWAS</title><sec id="Sec1362"><title>EP25.001 Investigating the effect of sexual behaviour on oropharyngeal cancer risk: a methodological assessment of Mendelian randomization</title><sec id="Sec1363"><title><bold>Mark Gormley</bold><sup>1;2</sup>, Tom Dudding<sup>2</sup>, Linda Kachuri<sup>3</sup>, Kimberley Burrows<sup>1</sup>, Amanda Chong<sup>1</sup>, Richard Martin<sup>1</sup>, Steven Thomas<sup>2</sup>, Jessica Tyrrell<sup>4</sup>, Andrew Ness<sup>5</sup>, Paul Brennan<sup>6</sup>, Marcus Munafo<sup>7</sup>, Miranda Pring<sup>2</sup>, Stefania Boccia<sup>8</sup>, Andrew Olshan<sup>9</sup>, Brenda Diergaarde<sup>10</sup>, Rayjean Hung<sup>11</sup>, Geoffrey Liu<sup>12</sup>, Eloiza Tajara<sup>13</sup>, Patricia Severino<sup>14</sup>, Tatiana Toporcov<sup>15</sup>, Martin Lacko<sup>16</sup>, Tim Waterboer<sup>17</sup>, Nicole Brenner<sup>17</sup>, George Davey Smith<sup>1</sup>, Emma Vincent<sup>1</sup>, Rebecca Richmond<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="FPar669"><title><sup>1</sup>University of Bristol, MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, Bristol, United Kingdom; <sup>2</sup>Bristol Dental School, Bristol, United Kingdom; <sup>3</sup>University of California San Francisco, Department of Epidemiology &amp; Biostatistics, San Francisco, United States; <sup>4</sup>University of Exeter, Exeter Medical School, Exeter, United Kingdom; <sup>5</sup>University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust, National Institute for Health Research Bristol Biomedical Research Centre, Bristol, United Kingdom; <sup>6</sup>World Health Organization International Agency for Research on Cancer, Genetic Epidemiology, Lyon, France; <sup>7</sup>University of Bristol, School of Psychological Science, Bristol, United Kingdom; <sup>8</sup>Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Section of Hygiene, University Department of Life Sciences and Public Health, Rome, Italy; <sup>9</sup>University of North Carolina, Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Global Public Health, Chapel Hill, United States; <sup>10</sup>University of Pittsburgh, Department of Human Genetics, Graduate School of Public Health, Pittsburgh, United States; <sup>11</sup>Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Sinai Health System, Prosserman Centre for Population Health Research, Toronto, Canada; <sup>12</sup>University of Toronto, Dalla Lana School of Public Health, Toronto, Canada; <sup>13</sup>School of Medicine of São José do Rio Preto, São Paulo, Brazil; <sup>14</sup>Albert Einstein Research and Education Institute, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil; <sup>15</sup>University of São Paulo, Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, São Paulo, Brazil; <sup>16</sup>Research Institute GROW, Maastricht University Medical Center, Department of Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, Maastricht, Netherlands; <sup>17</sup>Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Infections and Cancer Epidemiology, Heidelberg, Germany</title><p id="Par5052"><bold>Background/Objectives:</bold> Human papilloma virus infection is known to influence oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) risk, likely via sexual transmission. However, sexual behaviour has been correlated with other risk factors including smoking and alcohol, meaning independent effects are difficult to establish. We aimed to evaluate the causal effect of sexual behaviour on OPC risk using Mendelian randomization (MR).</p><p id="Par5053"><bold>Methods:</bold> Genetic variants robustly associated with age at first sex (AFS) and number of sexual partners (NSP) were used to perform both univariable and multivariable MR analyses with summary data on (2,641 OPC cases and 6,585 controls), obtained from the largest available genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Given the potential for genetic pleiotropy, we performed MR on positive and negative control outcomes, Causal Analysis Using Summary Effect estimates (CAUSE) and multivariable MR to account for the effects of smoking, alcohol, risk tolerance and educational attainment.</p><p id="Par5054"><bold>Results:</bold> In univariable MR, we found evidence supportive of an effect of both later AFS (IVW OR = 0.4, 95%CI (0.3, 0.7), per standard deviation (SD), <italic>p</italic> = &lt;0.001) and increasing NSP (IVW OR = 2.2, 95%CI (1.3, 3.8) per SD, <italic>p</italic> = &lt;0.001) on OPC risk. However, negative control analysis suggested potential violation of the core MR assumptions and subsequent CAUSE analysis implicated genetic pleiotropy. Finally, there was attenuation of the univariable MR results in the multivariable models.</p><p id="Par5055"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Despite using genetic variants strongly related sexual behaviour traits, we found evidence for correlated pleiotropy. This emphasises a need for multivariable approaches and the triangulation of evidence when performing MR of complex behavioural traits.</p><p id="Par5056"><bold>References:</bold></p><p id="Par5057"><bold>Grants:</bold> Wellcome Trust [Grant number 220530/Z/20/Z].</p><p id="Par5058"><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> Mark Gormley Consultant Senior Lecturer in Oral Surgery/ Wellcome GW4-Clinical Academic PhD Fellow, M.G. was supported by a Wellcome Trust GW4-Clinical Academic Training PhD Fellowship.

We applied the SHAHER framework and obtained GWAS results for shared genetic impact trait (SGIT) and unshared genetic impact trait (UGIT) of CBP.
